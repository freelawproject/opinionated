Lawrence against Frederick Smith and others. It was tried at the circuit before a jury, and the plaintiff had a verdict. The defendants made a case with exceptions, and moved at special term for a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>trial, which motion was denied, \u201c with costs.\u201d The entry of judgment had been stayed until the decision of this motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-5\">In adjusting his bill of costs, the plaintiff insisted that he was entitled to the following items, and, against the defendant\u2019s objection, the clerk of Erie county allowed them :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-6\">Costs before argument on appeal......$20 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-7\">For argument on appeal......... . 40 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-8\">Defendants excepted to the clerk\u2019s ruling, and now made this motion by way of appeal, for a readjustment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-9\"><em>L. L. </em>Lewis, for plaintiff, cited section 307, subd. 5 of the Code as amended in 1864, and contended that the costs of an appeal to general term being given by that subdivision \u201c for a new trial, on a case made,\u201d if it meant any thing, it was intended to apply to motions at special term \u201c for a new trial on a case made.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-10\"><em>Geo. W. </em>Cothran, for defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxG\">I. As costs before argument, and for arguments \u201con appeal,\u201d the items objected to were improperly allowed; as there was no appeal, the entry of judgment having been stayed until after the decision of this motion for new trial at special term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-11\">II. An application to the special term for a new trial on a cause, is \u201c a motion.\u201d <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 401; Jackett <em>a. </em>Judd, 18 <em>How. Pr., </em>385.) The relief granted is \u201c an order.\u201d <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 400.) Costs, in the discretion of the court, not exceeding $10, may be allowed on decision of \u201c a motion.\u201d <em>(Ib., </em>\u00a7 315.) On an appeal from an order made at special term, granting or refusing a new trial, only motion-costs can be allowed. (Code, \u00a7\u00a7 349, 307, subd. 5, although Jackett <em>a. </em>Judd, <em>supra, </em>holds otherwise.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-12\">III. It is contended that subdivision 5, of section 307 as amended in 1864, allows costs as adjudged. This is a mistake. That subdivision relates solely to appeals from judgments, and to the argument of motions ordered by the court, or required by the Code, to be heard at general term in the first instance. When a trial has been had before a jury, if a review of the facts is desired, it can only be had on a motion \u201c for a new trial on a case made\u201d at the special term. <em>{Code, </em>\u00a7 265.) After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the decision of this motion, an appeal lies to the general term from the order made at special'term, and from the judgment entered in accordance therewith. It is argued at general term as \u201c an appeal\u201d from a judgment and an order, and is not a motion \u201cfor a new trial on a case- made.\u201d Upon such appeals two very different bills of costs are allowed; the appeal from the order refusing a new trial carrying but motion-costs (in the discretion of the court), whereas the appeal from the judgment carries full costs absolutely, to the successful party. But when the trial has been by the court without a j ury (section 268); or by referees (section 272), if a review of the findings and decisions of the court or referee is sought, the party seeking it must make a <em>\u201c </em>case,\u201d &amp;c., and make his motion <em>\u201c </em>for a new trial on a case made\u201d at the general term in the first instance. Although he is obliged to appeal from the judgment, yet his proceedings amount to nothing but a motion \u201c for a new trial on a case made.\u201d This is submitted as the correct interpretation of subdivision 5, of section 307.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b214-5\">By the Court.\u2014Daniels, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuS\">Held tl\\at the plaintiff on the motion for a new trial at the special term was entitled to but $10 motion-costs, as the proceeding was a mere motion, and not embraced within subdivision 5, of .section 307. The court referred to Jackett <em>a. </em>Judd (18 <em>How. Pr., </em>385), as being decisive of the question involved in this case; and held that the amendment of 1864, by the substitution of the word <em>\u201cor,\u201d </em>in the place of <em>\u201c as;\u201d </em>so that it should read <em>\u201c or </em>for a new trial, on a case made,\u201d instead of \u201c <em>as </em>for a new trial, on a case made,\u201d did not vary the rule as to the amount of costs to be allowed on a motion for a new trial at the special term.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The motion for a readjustment of costs granted, with $10 costs \u2022 of motion, with directions that the clerk disallow the items of $20 and $40 for argument on appeal, and in lieu thereof, allow the plaintiff $10.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
