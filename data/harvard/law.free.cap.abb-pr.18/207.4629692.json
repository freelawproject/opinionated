The defendant\u2019s proceedings being stayed by the plaintiff, her right to costs did not accrue until the stay was removed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-7\">IV. By the Code, the costs of <em>\u201c </em>an application for a new trial on a case made,\u201d are the same as for an appeal. <em>{Code, </em>\u00a7 307, subd. 5.) Such a motion is enumerated, and not a motion under section 315 of the Code. (Mechanics\u2019 Banking Association <em>a. </em>Kiersted, 10 <em>How.

The case of Jackett <em>a. </em>Judd (18 <em>How.

Neither party is entitled to costs until some decision or disposal of an action is made by the court, whereby one of the parties acquires the right thereto against the other, under the statute. The decisions are all one way, and are conclusive, that a party is entitled to have his costs adjusted according to the Code, as it existed at the time of the verdict, to wit, at the time of the dismissal of the complaint in the present action, as to all items prior to and including that date. (Supervisors of Onondaga <em>a. </em>Briggs, 3 <em>Den., </em>173; Moore <em>a. </em>Westervelt, 14 <em>How.

There is no decision allowing costs before argument, or for argument, on a motion for a new trial at special term; but there are decisions that they are not allowable. The defendant\u2019s attorneys have charged, and the clerk has allowed costs before argument, and for argument ($60), under the act of 1864, which was clearly erroneous under the said act, and under all prior acts. The act of 1852, \u00a7 307, subd. 6, and the acts of 1857, 1858, 1859, 1862, and 1864, subd. 5, all being substantially as follows: \u201c To either party on appeal, except to the Court of Appeals, and except appeals mentioned in section 349,\u201d &amp;c. Certain costs are allowed before and for argument; and as there is no appeal in this case, the law, either old or new, is not applicable. The subject-matter of subd. 5 is limited to appeals. The reference to section 349 relates to appeals in cases therein mentioned. Subd. 6 is limited to appeals to the Court of Appeals. (Dwyer <em>a. </em>Oppenheim, <em>N. Y. Transcript, </em>Oct. 20, 1864; Oct. 19, Leonard, J. The charges and allowances for argument were, therefore, illegal. Roosevelt <em>a. </em>Brown, 1 <em>Duer, </em>642; Van Schaick <em>a. </em>Winne, 8 <em>How. Pr., </em>5.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-5\">III. The defendant\u2019s attorneys did not charge or claim fees for the trial of an issue of fact, or of an issue of law, before the clerk, nor before this court at special term. Title 8, ch.. 1 of the Code, \u00a7\u00a7 245-247, direct how to obtain judgment, when there is no answer or demurrer, to wit, no issue to be tried; ch. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 248-257, relate to issues and their mode of trial ch. 3, \u00a7\u00a7 258-265, relate to trial by jury; ch. 4, \u00a7\u00a7 266-269, to trial by the court; ch. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 270-273, to trial by referees ch. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 274-282, to the manner of entering judgment.. The motion for a new trial was not a trial, and did not come within the above laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-6\">IV. Only $10 costs are allowable for a motion for a new trial. (Moore <em>a. </em>Cockroft, 9 <em>How. Pr., </em>476; Potsdam &amp; W. R. R. Co. <em>a. </em>Jacobs, 10 <em>Ib., </em>453; 18 <em>Ib., </em>385, 392, &amp;c., cited above.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-7\">V. Term-fees ought not to have been allowed. The Code-plainly contemplates that term-fees are not to be allowed, except when a cause is on the circuit or special term for trial, or on the general term calendar for argument. The acts of 1862 and 1864, section 307, subd. 7, as well as some of the prior acts, use the expression, when the cause is not <em>\u201c </em>tried,\u201d &amp;c. Subdivisions 2, 3, and 4 of \u00a7 307 speak of trials. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>not the intent of the law to charge term-fees on motions, even if they are placed on the calendar. The remedy of each party in such case, if he does not consent to its being put off, is to move it on, or to move to dismiss it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-5\">VI. As the right to costs is only granted by statute, neither flie clerk nor the court have any authority to impose costs upon a party, unless the statute clearly authorizes it. If the statute is ambiguous or difficult of construction, it must be construed in favor of the opposing party, who is to be mulcted.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b223-14\"> Compare Lawrence <em>a. </em>Smith, <em>Ante, </em>197.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b226-6\">By the Court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azy\">I am constrained to adhere to the case in this court, Moore <em>a. </em>Westervelt (14 <em>How. Pr., </em>279), Avhich holds that the costs must be adjusted according to the Code as it existed at the. time of the verdict, as respects all items prior to that date. It is there said that the \u201c recovery/\u2019 which gives the right to costs, mentioned in the statute, means the \u201c verdict,\u201d and not the judgment. This decision was made at general term in July, 1857, and no amendment of the Code affecting this question has since been made. Crary <em>a. </em>Norwood (5 <em>Abbotts\u2019 Pr., </em>219), decided about the same time, holds the same way. Whether these cases were well considered and supported by authority is not for us to inquire. Uniformity of decision upon questions of this natnrg, as well as respect for the views of eminent judges comprising a former gen eral'term of this court, require that Ave should regard the decision as binding upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The right to costs being fixed by the verdict (or in this case by the dismissal of the complaint, which in principle is the same thing), the question is. not affected by the stay of proceedings. The right to costs had become complete before the stay, and they must be adjusted in accordance with the then existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The fifth subdivision of section 307 of the Code, as it stood in 1852 (then subd. 6), gave to either party on appeal, except to the Court of Appeals, a prescribed rate of compensation, but declared that its provisions should not apply to appeals from orders. At that time, under section 349, an appeal could be taken from an order granting or refusing a new trial, but no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>costs, except a motion-fee, could be given. In 1857, section 307 was amended by adding to the fifth subdivision, \u201c and the same costs shall be allowed * * * in cases ordered to be heard in the first instance at general term.\u201d * * * In 1858 the subdivision was further amended, so that the same read, \u201c and the same costs shall be allowed\u201d * * * .on application for judgment, upon special verdict, or upon verdict subject to the opinion of the court, as for a new trial on a case made, and in cases where exceptions are ordered to be heard in the first instance at a general term. In 1862 the section was again amended, by striking out the word <em>\u201c </em>as,\u201d and inserting the word \u201c or,\u201d so that it should read, \u201c or for a new trial on a case made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The amendment of 1858 was difficult of construction. The word \u201c as\u201d conveyed no idea of what was intended. Whether on application for judgment upon a verdict subject to the opinion of the court, the same costs were to be awarded as were given on a motion for a new trial on a case, or whether the word \u201c as\u201d was to be construed into, as by subsequent amendment it was changed into \u201c or,\u201d it was difficult to determine. The latter liberty was taken by a judge at special term, in Jackett <em>a. </em>Judd (18 <em>How. </em>Pr., 385, 393).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">My construction of the section as it now stands is, that the Legislature intended to give the same costs as are given on an appeal from a judgment, without reference to the place where the application is to be made in the four cases, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\"><em>First. </em>An application for j udgment upon special verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\"><em>Second. </em>Upon verdict subject to the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\"><em>Third. </em>Upon an application for- a new trial on a case made.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\"><em>Fourth. </em>On exceptions ordered to be heard in the first instance at a general term.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">Two of the four cases, viz., application for judgment, upon a special verdict and for a new trial on a case-, must be made at special term, and cannot be made at general term. <em>{Code, </em>\u00a7'265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">The other two, viz., verdict subject to the opinion of the court and exceptions, must go to the general term, and cannot be heard at special term, <em>(lb.) </em>When the first two cases are carried to the general term, it can only be by appeal from-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the judgment upon the special verdict or from the order granting or refusing a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Certainly, the exception of cases mentioned in section 349 can have no application to motions for judgment upon a special verdict, and unless it was designed to give that class of cases the costs prescribed by section 307, although made at special term, then so much of the amendment was utterly useless. The literal reading of the section is, that the parties shall have the same costs as are allowed on appeal, on an application for a new trial on a case made. As such application must be made at special term, it follows that the costs of an appeal are to be awarded at the special term. If the application for a new trial on a case stood alone in the section, I might be inclined to yield to the opinion that it was simply intended to take those cases out of the exceptions of appeals from orders. But the section includes, and places in the same condition, applications for judgment upon special verdict; and it is quite clear that the costs on such motions are the sam\u00e9 as on an appeal. If the judge in Jackett a. Judd, <em>silera, </em>had not emphatically said that only motion-costs were allowable on a motion for a new trial at special term, I could adopt the whole of his subsequent reasoning as illustrating the view I have taken of the question. But that learned judge did not notice that motions for judgment upon a special verdict, or for a new trial on a case, can only be made at special term, and therefore, unless it was intended to give these costs at special term, they cannot be given at all. While he admits that it was intended to give the same costs as on an appeal from a judgment in the four cases mentioned, he confines the right to award the costs to the general term, whereas, in two of the cases, the motions cannot be made at general term at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Heither view is free from difficulty. The section is artificially drawn, ambiguous, and capable, perhaps, of either construction ; and with other judges I can frankly say, I am not entirely satisfied with either. There is as much reason for giving these costs at special term as to confine the right to them at general term, if the motion could be made there. The motion at special term involves the preparation of the case, and frequently as elaborate and solemn argument as at general term; and it would .seem to require a similar compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>My conclusion is, that upon a motion for a new trial upon a case made at special term, the parties are entitled to the same costs as upon an appeal from a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The taxation appealed from must be readjusted upon the principles here stated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b226-9\"> Present, Robertson, Ch.
