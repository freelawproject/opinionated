The sheriff is entitled to the same fees and compensation for services, and the same disbursements, as are allowed by law for like services and disbursements, under the provisions of chapter 5, title 1, part 2 of Revised Statutes. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 243.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-19\">II. The services mentioned in that- part of the Revised Statutes which are like those here performed by the sheriff, are those mentioned in article 1 of that title, \u00a7\u00a7 1-12; 2 <em>Edmonds\u2019 </em>ed. 3; Cowles, J., in Hoge <em>a. </em>Page (11 <em>How. Pr., </em>207).</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-20\">III. No compensation of the sheriff for his services under these provisions is provided at section 38, tit. 3, ch. 10, part <em>3, </em>p. 646. (2 <em>Edm. </em>ed., 665; 14 <em>Abbotts' Pr., </em>285; S.

Pr., </em>456.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-5\">IV. Unless property attached by a sheriff is sold, he is not \u25a0 entitled; as a matter of right, to poundage. (Alburtis <em>a. </em>Dudley, Hoge <em>a. </em>Page, <em>supra) </em>Fifty cents is all he can claim, except, perhaps, 12\u00a3 cents for returning' the writ, and 19 cents for a copy of the writ, making 82 cents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-6\">V. All further compensation depends upon what shall be certified by the officer issuing the warrant' to be reasonable. (Alburtis <em>a. </em>Dudley, Hoge <em>a. </em>Page, Birkbeck <em>a. </em>Stafford, <em>supra)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-7\">VI. Hothing will be certified to be a reasonable compensation for trouble in taking possession and preserving property, when no property has been taken possession of or preserved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-8\">VII. Hothing will be certified to be reasonable which is not equitable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-9\">In Trenor <em>a. </em>Fachin (12 Abbotts\u2019 <em>Pr., </em>136; S. C., 20 <em>How. Pr., </em>405), it was not .denied that the -attachment brought about the compromise; and in allowing the sheriff\u2019s percentage, the court relied on the equitable construction of the statute in The Matter of Bunch (12 <em>Wend., </em>280). See, also, Mayhew <em>a. </em>Wilson (10 Abbotts\u2019 <em>Pr., </em>289).</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-10\">VIII. It is not equitable to give the sheriff commissions where he has done nothing but serve a notice, and where his acting has had no influence on the result of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-11\">IX. If Trenor <em>a. </em>Fachin (special term decision, February, 1861) were fairly to be construed to decide that the sheriff is entitled of right to commissions where he has not sold, in the absence of special equities,\u2014which construction is disputed,\u2014 it would be in conflict with Alburtis <em>a. </em>Dudley (decided July, 1861), and with Birkbeck <em>a. </em>Stafford, a general term decision, May, 1862, and would be to that extent overruled.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b470-12\">Leonard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOm\">The services performed by the sheriff in this case were not such as are performed by a trustee under chapter 5, title 1, part 2, Revised Statutes, referred to in section 243 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">In this case he performed only the duties which usually devolve upon a sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">In the present case the sheriff is entitled, I think, to pound<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>age upon the sum collected, as upon an execution.
