(2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>541.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-15\">Stille Manning and William A. Pratt having various, controversies arising,out of business transactions, submitted them to arbitration, and the arbitrators, among other matters, awarded that Manning was indebted to Pratt in the sum of $6,960.05, as a just balance of the claims of the parties submitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>This part of the award, however, was expressed to be \u201c provided, however, any amount is allowed thereon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">Manning made a motion at a special term of this court to have the award vacated. This motion was granted by Mr. Justice Ingraham at special term in July, 1860, chiefly upon the grounds that the award was upon specific matters, and not upon all matters in controversy, and that it was uncertain in not specifying whether any amount was allowed or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">After the award, but when, and whether before or after the order vacating the award, does not appear, Pratt \u2022 assigned his claim on, or under the award to one Borst.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-7\">And also after the award, but whether before or after the order vacating the award does not expressly appear, Pratt died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-8\">The order vacating the award \"was made, on the 3d day of July, 1860, and that order was appealed from in the name of Pratt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-9\">Subsequently, and while that appeal was pending, a motion was made at special term, that Borst be substituted as a party in the place of Pratt, deceased, and on the 5th day of May, 1864, an order to that effect was made, at special term held by Mr. Justice Poster.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-10\">This motion and order were founded on an affidavit, stating the death of Pratt, and the assignment by him to Borst of all his (Pratt\u2019s) interest in or under the award.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-11\">Manning now appealed from the last-mentioned order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-12\"><em>C.

Such an order can be made, on motion, only within one year after the death of the party. <em>(Code of Pro., </em>\u00a7 121; Keene <em>a. </em>La Farge, 1 <em>Bosw., </em>671; Coon <em>a. </em>Knap, 13 <em>How.

Chatfield, </em>for the respondent, Borst.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b362-6\">By the Court.\u2014Sutherland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMH\">The order appealed from was not made in any action. The proceeding in which it was made was an arbitration proceeding under the statute. Section 121 of the Code has no application to the question of the power of the justice at special term to make the order. That section only authorizes such an order in an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The Code does not affect arbitration proceedings under the statute. <em>{Code, </em>\u00a7 471.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The arbitration proceeding was a statutory proceeding, and this court had no power over it, and had no power to make any order in it, except such as is given or recognized by the statute. The statute (\u00a7 22) declares that nothing contained in it <em>\u201c </em>shall be construed to impair, diminish, or in any way affect the power and authority of the Court of Chancery over arbitrators, awards, or the parties thereto,\u201d &amp;c. This court is now vested with the chancery power or jurisdiction recognized by this section; but it can hardly be claimed that.the justice at special term had jurisdiction to make the order under the equity power recognized by this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">I have looked in vain into the statute for authority for the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">The court has express statutory power to confirm, or to vacate, or modify the award (\u00a7\u00a7 9, 10, 11, &amp;e.) on the application of any party to the submission; but I find no power given to the court to revive the proceeding in case of the death of a party, or to substitute another party in the place of a deceased party.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">I think the order must be reversed, but I think it should be reversed without costs; for there is considerable doubt whether Manning had any right to bring the- question here by appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">After the order substituting him in place of Pratt, Borst had taken an appeal from the order vacating the award, and the two appeals were heard together; the following opinion being rendered upon the latter:</p>\n<author id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>By the Court.\u2014Sutherland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJu\">It follows from our decision on the appeal from the order substituting Borst in the place of Pratt, deceased, that this appeal from the order vacating the award, must be dismissed; for as a consequence of that\" decision Borst has no right to prosecute this appeal, and no one has appeared before us who has.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">But I think the appeal should be dismissed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Ingraham, P. J., and Clerks, J., concurred in these opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Orders accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
