Brennan, comptroller of the city of New York, to obtain payment of a claim against the city for services rendered under a contract with the Corporation. The contract had not been performed within the time therein specified, but the Common Council of the Corporation had passed a resolution directing the payment, notwithstanding the forfeiture.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-8\"><em>A. J. </em>Willard, for the relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-9\"><em>John K. </em>Hackett, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4b\">I. The Common Council had no power to direct the payment of the money in question. (Ch<em>arter, </em>1857, \u00a7 46.) This section provides as follows: \u201c No additional allowance beyond the legal claim under any contract with the Corporation, or for any services, on its account or in its employment, shall ever be allowed.\u201d The resolution admits that the money, the payment of which it directs, was justly forfeited by reason of the failure of the relators to perform the work within the contract time. The provision of the charter is explicit in its prohibition of any allowance of the character of that made by the resolution. The resolution, therefore, being in direct conflict with the provision of the charter, could not impose any duty upon the comptroller.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-10\">II. Admitting the validity of the resolution, the relators have a remedy by action, and where that remedy exists, a mandamus will never be granted. (Shepley <em>a. </em>Mechanics\u2019 Bank, 10 <em>Johns., </em>484; Bryce <em>a. </em>Pres\u2019t of Brooklyn, 1 <em>Wend., </em>318; <em>Exp. </em>Lynch, 2 <em>Hill, </em>45; <em>Exp. </em>Freemans\u2019 Ins. Co., 6 <em>Ib., </em>243.) The relators\u2019 right to the money must of necessity rest in their contract. They can institute a suit upon the contract for the recovery of the balance claimed, and if the Corporation should defend upon the ground that the contract was not performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>in time, they could then introduce the resolution as proof that the defence pleaded had been waived.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-5\">III. The claim of the relators having never been audited by the auditing bureau of Finance Department, the comptroller cannot and should not be compelled to draw his warrant for \u25a0the amount claimed. <em>(Charter, </em>1857, \u00a7 22; People a. Flagg, 17 <em>N. Y., </em>584.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-6\">IV. The fact that the appropriation out of which the payment is directed to be made is exhausted, is fatal to the application for a mandamus. <em>(Charter, </em>1857, \u00a7 28 ; People <em>a. </em>Burrows, 27 <em>Barb., </em>89 ; People <em>a. </em>Tremain, 17 <em>How. Pr., </em>142.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-7\">V. The comptroller owes no duty to the relators, and, therefore, they are not entitled to a mandamus. (Green <em>a. </em>Wood, 35 <em>Barb., </em>653.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-8\">VI. The application should be denied, with costs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b118-9\">J. F. Barnard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnV\">The Common Council may waive, I think, the time for the performance of a contract. It would be a hard rule of construction which would prevent a party to a contract from waiving a penalty incurred by non-performance at the day named, no matter how controlling the reason and excuse may be for non-performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">The fatal defect to this writ is that the bill has not been audited by the \u201c Department of Finances.\u201d This department must certify the claim to the comptroller. Until that is done the comptroller\u2019s duty is plain and imperative. The Common Council cannot audit and allow claims. The Finance Department only can. If they refuse to\" allow and audit a just claim, they are the proper parties to proceed against by mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Motion to dismiss writ of mandamus granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
