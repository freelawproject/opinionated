That the wheat that came into the possession of the assignee, and by order of the court was sold by him, was not, nor was any part of it, the wheat covered by such mortgage instrument, nor was any part of such wheat purchased with the money, or any part of it, advanced or loaned to the assignor by Snydacker, Fyffe &amp; Co.</p><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-9\" pgmap=\"525(20) 526(51)\">As to the claim of the intervening petitioners, L.

Y.</p><p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-9\" pgmap=\"526\">Baldwin, S. if. Griswold, and L. P. Griswold should each pay his proportionate share of the amount of storage due on 506 bushels, and S. P.

We are also satisfied that appellants\u2019 written instrument set out in his petition to the County Court, constituting the contract between them and insolvent, Blatchley, was not a \u201c warehouse receipt,\u201d as contended by them, but a sale by way of mortgage, by insolvent, Blatchley, to them, of 6,000 bushels of wheat, at the date of said writing, then in his elevator at White Hall, and that from the evidence it appears that said Blatchley, long before said assignment, had delivered to appellants the wheat described in said writing, but that said Blatchley still owes appellees the indebtedness contended for by them, but they have no lien on the wheat in question.</p> <p id=\"b528-5\" pgmap=\"528\">We are of the opinion that the final order and decree rendered herein by the County Court of Greene County is in accordance with the law and the evidence in this case, therefore we affirm it.</p> <p id=\"b528-6\" pgmap=\"528\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
