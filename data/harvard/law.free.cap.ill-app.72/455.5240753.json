Lib. arid Sl., Sec. 212, and note 1; also Sec. 355 and notes 1, 2 and 3 on p. 605; Sanford v. Gaddis, 13 Ill. 329; Darling v. Banks, 14 Ill. 46; 13 Am. and Eng. Ency. 397-8 and cases cited in note 3, p. 398.</p><p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-10\" pgmap=\"453\">The plea is taken most strongly against the pleader; everything must be precisely alleged. Towns. Lib. and SI. 60S, note 2. The rule as to framing a plea of justification is thus clearly stated by Chitty : \u201c It is necessary that the' plea should state specific facts (svc), showing in what particular instances, and in what exact manner the plaintiff has misconducted himself.\u201d I Chitty on Pl. 494.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-11\" pgmap=\"453\">The charges in the declaration must be directly met, and not argumentatively or by inference. Fidler v. Delavan, 20 Wend. 57, cited in 1 Hilliard on Torts, 441. The plea admits the truth of the innuendoes in the declaration. 1 Hill. Torts, 441; Towns. Lib. and Sland., Sec. 215; 13 Am. and Eng. Ency. 397.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-12\" pgmap=\"453\">And must justify in the sense of the innuendoes. Towns. L. and Sl., Sec. 212; Nott et ux. v. Stoddard, 38 Vt. 25; 88 Am. Dec. 633.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-4\" pgmap=\"454\">There is no such thing as a half-way justification. Fero v. Ruscoe, 4 N. Y. 165.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-5\" pgmap=\"454\">The justification should be of the meaning, not of the words merely. Snow v. Witcher, 9 Ired. 346.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-6\" pgmap=\"454\">The distinction maintained between oral and written language, as regards its. actionable quality when published concerning an individual as such, is not recognized in regard to language concerning one in a special character. Towns. Lib. and Sl., Sec. 180.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-7\" pgmap=\"454\">\u201c To make an answer in justification good, it must specifically point out the acts of which the plaintiff was guilty, that the court may see whether the defendant was justified in speaking the words complained of.\u201d If the plea does not aver that the words are true, in the sense imputed to them in the declaration or complaint by proper innuendo, it is bad. 13 Am. and Eng. Ency. L., 398, and numerous cases in note 2; see also Mull v. McKnight, 67 Ind. 535; Funk v. Beverly, 112 Ind. 190; 13 N. E.

What one does, one\u2019s actions, are things, and as such have a separate existence, distinct from the person. Every action, every thing one does, is naturally and necessarily the subject of comment. Every action, every thing one does, confers a privilege upon every person to speak or write concerning such action or thing. As to such action or thing every one may in good faith speak or write whatever seems to him fit to be spoken or written., Save good faith there is no limit to criticism concerning a man\u2019s actions or his creations. God forbid (exclaims Baron Alder-son) that you should not be allowed to comment on the conduct of all mankind, provided you do it justly and honorably.\u201d It is apparent that the words alleged to have been used by defendant are nothing more than a criticism of the action of plaintiff in using an anaesthetic. They are not criticisms of the person and consequently, under the above rule, they fall under that class of criticisms which are permitted under the law and therefore are privileged. Me well on Slander and Libel, 564; Townshend on Slander and Libel, 441.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-5\" pgmap=\"455\">In an action of oral or written slander the plea of the general issue operates as a denial of the extrinsic facts stated in the inducement, the speaking of the words or publication of the libel, the truth of the colloquium or the application of the words to the plaintiff, and of the extrinsic fact alleged in the declaration, and the damage, where special damage is necessary to maintain the action, or more than nominal damages are claimed. Where the defense is that the libel or words were published or spoken, not in a malicious sense imputed by the declaration, but in an innocent sense, or upon an occasion which warranted the publication, this matter may be given in evidence under the general issue. Me well on Slander and Libel, 648.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-6\" pgmap=\"455\">The charge, if any, contained in the words alleged to have been slanderously spoken, is the charge of a specific act, and not a mere conclusion or inference. See Kuhn v. Young et al., 78 Tex. 344; 14 S. W. Rep. 796; Fenstermaker v. Tribune Pub. Co., 13 Utah, 532; 43 Pac.

By means whereof, etc., the plaintiff has been greatly injured in his good name and fame and also in his said profession and business as a practitioner of dentistry, etc., to his damage of $5,000. Defendant pleaded:</p> <p id=\"b456-7\" pgmap=\"456\">1. General issue, not guilty.</p> <p id=\"b456-8\" pgmap=\"456\">2. Statute of limitations.</p> <p id=\"b457-3\" pgmap=\"457\">General replication to each of said pleas:</p> <p id=\"b457-4\" pgmap=\"457\">The secondly amended third plea filed by the defendant, to which a demurrer was by the court below overruled and the sufficiency of which is the only question raised on this appeal, attempts to justify the slander, and alleges that the plaintiff used in his profession, upon persons for whom he did work, an anaesthetic, one of the ingredients of which was cocaine, then and there a dangerous anaesthetic which \u201c was capable of and at times would produce death and blood-poisoning in persons upon whom the same would be used,\u201d etc., and \u201c that the said words in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration alleged to have been spoken by the defendant,\u201d etc., setting them out in haee verba, \u201c were then and there at the time and place, etc., true.\u201d Wherefore defendant spoke the words as he lawfully might, etc.</p> <p id=\"b457-5\" pgmap=\"457\">The demurrer to this plea alleges \u201c that the same and the matters therein contained in manner and form as they are therein pleaded, are not sufficient in law to bar plaintiff\u2019s action etc., and for special cause alleges that said plea does not answer or justify the charges in the declaration. Said plea attempts to justify a charge not made or found in the declaration. Said plea does not justify in the true sense of the charge. The justification in the plea is not as broad as the charge. The plea does not justify the charge in the sense of the innuendoes, and is otherwise informal, argumentative, uncertain and insufficient.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b457-6\" pgmap=\"457\">The plaintiff in the court below, appellant here, upon the court overruling his said demurrer to said plea of justification, elected to stand by his demurrer. Whereupon the court below gave final judgment against appellant for costs and that he go without day, etc. From this judgment appellant appeals to this court, and contends that the court below erred in not sustaining his demurrer to said plea of justification.</p> <p id=\"b457-7\" pgmap=\"457(44) 458(119)\">It will be seen by a careful reading of the amended declaration that it charges defendant with having spoken of and concerning the plaintiff in the practice of his profession as a dentist, \u201c that he is going to kill somebody with that anaesthetic he is using; it will cause blood-poisoning. That he is going to kill somebody some time with that anaesthetic he is using; it will cause blood-poisoning. That he will kill somebody some time if he don\u2019t quit using that anaesthetic.\u201d The plea of justification only states that the plaintiff used in his profession, upon persons for whom he did work, an anaesthetic, one of the ingredients of which was cocaine, a dangerous anaesthetic, which was capable of and at times would produce death and blood-poisoning in persons upon whom the same would be used, etc. And that the said words in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration alleged to have been spoken by the defendant were then and there true, etc.</p> <p id=\"b458-6\" pgmap=\"458\">It will be seen at a glance that the plea of justification is not as broad as the charge in the declaration, and for that reason was bad on demurrer. Sanford v. Gaddis, 13 Ill. 329; Darling v. Banks, 14 Ill. 46. Chitty thus states the rule as to framing a plea of justification: \u201c It is necessary that the plea should state specific facts, showing in what particular instances, and in what exact manner, the plaintiff has misconducted himself.\u201d Chitty on Pl. marg. p. 494.</p> <p id=\"b458-8\" pgmap=\"458\">Appellee insists, in his brief, that the demurrer to his plea of justification should have been carried back to the declaration, as that was bad on demurrer. We are of the opinion that the trial court would not have been justified in carrying the demurrer back to the declaration, as the declaration is sufficient to be answered; and it seems appellee so thought, because he filed a plea of general issue thereto, and also a plea of the statute of limitations, neither of which pleas he withdrew, and then requested the trial court to carry the demurrer back to the declaration.</p> <p id=\"b458-9\" pgmap=\"458\">For the error of the trial court in not sustaining the demurrer to the plea of justification, we reverse the judgment herein, and remand this case to the court below, with instructions to that court to sustain the demurrer to said plea, and for such further proceedings herein as the law permits.</p> <p id=\"b458-10\" pgmap=\"458\">\u00a1Reversed and remanded with instructions.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
