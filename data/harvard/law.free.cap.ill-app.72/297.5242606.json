The bill distinctly alleges that the defendants are representing their business to be a part of the business of the complainant. This in itself, entirely independent of any question of trade-mark or trade-name, is such a fraudulent competition that a court of equity will not hesitate for a moment to enjoin it under the circumstances stated in the bill and affidavit.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-7\" pgmap=\"296\">The rule of law which denies protection to a geographical name is subject to this limitation: that if the name has acquired a secondary meaning indicating in the case of a trade-mark that the goods are manufactured by a certain person, or in the case of a trade-name, that the business belongs to a certain person or corporation, then the protection Avill be granted. The bill in this case alleges that the name claimed has acquired such secondary meaning in association with the business of complainant.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-8\" pgmap=\"296(107) 297(38)\">A few out of many cases that could be cited are respectfully submitted, in each of Avhich a geographical name, having acquired this secondary meaning, ivas protected: (Shrewsberry Patent Thread) Marshall v.

But this can not be availed of by appellants now, for since the writ was issued, and prior to this appeal, there has been, as shown by the record, a hearing of the merits of the order, upon a motion to dissolve, in which appellants appeared and were heard. In Brown v. Luehrs, 79 Ill. 575, it is said:</p> <p id=\"b297-7\" pgmap=\"297\">\u201cIt is objected that the preliminary injunction should not have been granted without notice to appellants. Admitting this, we do not perceive how advantage is to be taken of it in the way of reversing a decree on final hearing, making the injunction perpetual, where the proof justifies a decree for an injunction.\u201d High on Inj., Secs. 1580 and 1615.</p> <p id=\"b297-8\" pgmap=\"297\">The same reasoning applies to the case here, viz., that after the order has been determined to be proper upon a hearing, participated in bv both parties, it is too late to raise questions as to this informality in the original issuing of it.</p> <p id=\"b297-9\" pgmap=\"297\">It is urged by appellants that the bill is insufficient in its averments to entitle complainants to an injunction.</p> <p id=\"b297-10\" pgmap=\"297\">The bill prays for no other relief.</p> <p id=\"b297-11\" pgmap=\"297\">Without discussing the question of proprietary rights to the name in controversy, it is enough to say that the allegations of fraudulent acts and intent on the part of defendants is sufficient to sustain the bill. Merchants Detective Ass\u2019n v. Detective Mercantile Agency, 25 Ill. App. 259, and cases therein cited. The order is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
