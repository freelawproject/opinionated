This doctrine is frequently applied in the other important issue often raised as to whether there was other insurance or whether the condition of the risk as to their building was truly stated.

But this rule is subject to various exceptions, and one of them occurs when the representations, though false, relate to the legal effect of the instrument sued on. Clem v. Newcastle, etc., R. R.

For the law will not sanction dishonest views and practices, by enabling an individual to acquire, through the medium of his deception, any right or interest. Whitney v.

It was defended upon the ground that appellee had been imposed upon by appellant\u2019s agent who took the notes and wrote the policies.</p> <p id=\"b494-9\" pgmap=\"494\">The contention of appellee was that the agent, one G. J. Dorrell, falsely represented that he was an agent or partner of a Mr. Porter, an agent who wrote policies in appellant\u2019s company, and in whom she had confidence, and by such representations induced her to take the policies. She also contended that he falsely made her say in an application for the insurance that she had no other insurance and that by reason of such statement, when in fact she had other insurance, the policies were rendered void.</p> <p id=\"b495-3\" pgmap=\"495\">Even if Dorrell did falsely represent to appellee that he was an agent or partner of Porter, that could not defeat a recovery on the notes. There was no false representation as to the principal, the party bound by the contract of insurance. Appellee knew the company she was being insured in. She had her property already insured in it. As to one of the policies it w\u00e1s but a renewal.</p> <p id=\"b495-4\" pgmap=\"495\">The alleged false statement in the application as to other insurance did not render the policy void. If the fact is as contended by appellee, that the misstatement occurred by reason of Dorrell writing in the application a false answer, certainly the insurance company could take no advantage of it. An untrue statement made in the application, although made with the knowledge of the insured, would not render the policy void, if the agent writing the application knew the real facts.

Mendenhall, 164 Ill. 458. \u2022</p> <p id=\"b495-5\" pgmap=\"495\">The verdict of the jury was against the law and the evidence and should have been set aside. The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for another trial. Eeversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
