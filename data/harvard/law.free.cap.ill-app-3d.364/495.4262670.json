The trial court accepted this interpretation, and accordingly it found defendant, Anthony W. Kohl, guilty of being a felon in possession of a per se unlawful weapon under sections 24 \u2014 1.1(a) and 24 \u2014 1(a)(1) of the Criminal Code of 1961 (Code) (720 ILCS 5/24 \u2014 1.1(a), 24 \u2014 1(a)(1) (West 2002)). Kohl appeals, and we reverse.</p> <p id=\"b513-3\" pgmap=\"513\">I. BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b513-4\" pgmap=\"513\">In March 2003, Kohl, who was on parole relating to a burglary conviction, received a visit at his Glendale Heights apartment from Agent Craig Woelfel of the Illinois Department of Corrections parole division. Agent Woelfel apparently went to Kohl\u2019s apartment to go over Kohl\u2019s parole agreement with him and to make sure he was complying with that agreement. While there, Agent Woelfel noticed some swords hanging on a wall and a pocketknife on a table. Agent Woelfel believed the swords and pocketknife might be considered collector\u2019s items, so he did not report Kohl as violating his parole agreement, which prohibited the possession of certain weapons. Nevertheless, Agent Woelfel told Kohl he needed to get rid of the items.</p> <p id=\"b513-5\" pgmap=\"513\">Kohl decided to have an indoor garage sale. He drew up and distributed flyers advertising the items for sale, which included coffee makers and swords. He got a quick response \u2014 from parole agent Jeffrey Bryant and a Glendale Heights police officer. Agent Bryant asked whether, as the garage sale flyer promised, Kohl had swords. Kohl said he did; he told Agent Bryant they were in a storage unit on the apartment\u2019s balcony. Agent Bryant searched the storage unit and found some swords and knives. At that point, Kohl was arrested.</p> <p id=\"b513-6\" pgmap=\"513\">Contending that several of the knives found in the storage unit were in fact \u201cmetal knuckles,\u201d the State charged Kohl with two counts of unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon. Under the Code, Kohl could be found guilty based on his mere possession of metal knuckles (see 720 ILCS 5/24 \u2014 1.1(a), 24 \u2014 1(a)(1) (West 2002)), but to be found guilty based on his possession of knives, Kohl had to have possessed the items with the intent to use them unlawfully against another (see 720 ILCS 5/24 \u2014 1.1(a), 24 \u2014 1(a)(2) (West 2002)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The State did not contend that Kohl intended to use any of the items unlawfully. So the only way to prove him guilty was to establish that one or more of the items was a set of metal knuckles. To this end, the State introduced four of the items found in Kohl\u2019s storage unit. All of these items were comprised of blades and metal handle grips in one form or another. And, according to the State, all of these items were metal knuckles.</p> <p id=\"b514-3\" pgmap=\"514\">The trial court agreed that one of the items was a set of metal knuckles, but found that the other three were knives. As for the item determined to be a set of metal knuckles (which is the only one with which we are concerned here), it consists of the following: a grip on which the holder rests two fingers and from which two thin, pointed, two-inch metal projectiles extend at right angles; and two metal loops into which the holder inserts his or her middle and ring fingers, and from which extend at 45-degree angles two stubbier, half-inch metal projectiles, and from which also extends, straight out, a SVa-inch-long, lVa-inch-wide sharp pointed blade, shaped like an arrowhead. Here is a picture of the item:</p> <p id=\"b514-4\" pgmap=\"514\">[[Image here]]</p> <p id=\"b514-5\" pgmap=\"514\">After determining that the above item was not a knife but, instead, a set of metal knuckles, the trial court found Kohl guilty of both counts of unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon and merged the first count into the second (which alleged that Kohl was on parole). See 720 ILCS 5/24 \u2014 1.1(e) (West 2002). The court then denied Kohl\u2019s motion for a new trial and sentenced him to five years in prison. He appeals.</p> <p id=\"b514-6\" pgmap=\"514\">II. ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"b514-7\" pgmap=\"514\">The question presented by Kohl\u2019s appeal is this: does an item consisting of a SVa-inch-long, H/a-inch-wide sharp knife blade, and several smaller, blade-like projectiles, amount to a set of metal knuckles simply because the item happens to be gripped by resting two fingers on the handle and inserting two fingers through metal loops, which, if the item were used against somebody, would not make contact with that person unless the 3V2-mch knife blade were already buried in his or her body?</p> <p id=\"b514-8\" pgmap=\"514(46) 515(178)\"> To answer that question, we must construe the meaning of \u201cmetal knuckles\u201d as the term is used in the Code. As noted, the trial court construed \u201cmetal knuckles\u201d as including the item described above. There is some dispute as to the standard we should apply in reviewing that determination. For his part, defendant argues that, since this is a question of statutory construction, we should apply the standard of review we always apply in cases of statutory construction, i.e., de novo. See, e.g., In re Detention of Powell, 217 Ill. 2d 123, 135 (2005) (stating that \u201c[t]he issue before us is a matter of statutory construction, and our review is therefore de novo\u201d); People v. Collins, 214 Ill. 2d 206, 214 (2005) (stating that, \u201c[b]ecause the construction of a statute is a question of law, the standard of review is de novo\u201d); People v. Grever, 353 Ill. App. 3d 736, 751 (2004) (stating that \u201c(Tissues of statutory construction are questions of law subject to de novo review\u201d). The State, however, argues that, although this is a case of statutory construction, we should not apply the statutory construction standard of review. Instead, as the State sees it, the trial court\u2019s determination that the item at issue is a set of metal knuckles is a factual finding and, as such, it is entitled to deference.</p> <p id=\"b515-4\" pgmap=\"515\">There are two serious problems with the State\u2019s argument. First, the State has cited no authority in support of it, and, arguably, it is waived. See Official Reports Advance Sheet No. 21 (October 17, 2001), R. 341(e)(7), eff. October 1, 2001; People v. Morales, 343 Ill. App. 3d 987, 989 (2003). Second, and more importantly, waiver aside, the State\u2019s argument demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the finding that the trial court made here. The State argues that the trial court\u2019s determination that the item at issue is a set of metal knuckles was a factual finding. In fact, however, it was a legal one. See People v. Velez, 336 Ill. App. 3d 261, 265 (2003) (question of whether item at issue was \u201cswitch blade\u201d within meaning of section 24 \u2014 1 was one of statutory construction subject to de novo review). Of course, it is beyond serious dispute that legal findings \u2014 such as a trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute \u2014 are entitled to no deference. Powell, 217 Ill. 2d at 135; Grever, 353 Ill. App. 3d at 751. Additionally, the facts concerning the composition and structure of the metal item are uncontested. See People v. Herman, 347 Ill. App. 3d 525, 529 (2004) (applying de novo review where facts were not contested). Accordingly, in this case, as in all cases of statutory construction, we review de novo the trial court\u2019s determination that an item comes within the definition of a statutory term.</p> <p id=\"b515-5\" pgmap=\"515(93) 516(17)\">We turn now to consider whether the item here fits within the meaning of metal knuckles. Our primary objective when construing the meaning of a statutory term is to give effect to the legislative intent behind that term. See In re Madison H., 215 Ill. 2d 364, 372 (2005). In construing a statutory term, we must presume that the legislature did not intend unjust, inconvenient, or absurd results. People ex rel. Birkett v. Jorgensen, 216 Ill. 2d 358, 363 (2005). Further, under the principle of lenity, we must construe any ambiguity in a penal statute in favor of the accused. See People v. Hicks, 164 Ill. 2d 218, 222 (1995).</p> <p id=\"b516-3\" pgmap=\"516\"> According to the Code, a person is guilty of unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon if he or she \u201cknowingly possesse[d] *** any weapon prohibited under Section 24 \u2014 1 of this [Code].\u201d 720 ILCS 5/24 \u2014 1.1(a) (West 2002). Section 24 \u2014 1 prohibits the possession of any \u201cbludgeon, black-jack, slung-shot, sand-club, sand-bag, metal knuckles, throwing star, or any knife, commonly referred to as a switchblade knife, which has a blade that opens automatically by hand pressure applied to a button, spring or other device in the handle of the knife, or a ballistic knife, which is a device that propels a knifelike blade as a projectile by means of a coil spring, elastic material or compressed gas.\u201d 720 ILCS 5/24 \u2014 1(a)(1) (West 2002). Under section 24 \u2014 1 of the Code, we see that the possession of some items is considered per se unlawful \u2014 that is, their mere possession is illegal \u2014 whereas the possession of other items is considered illegal only if the possessor intends to use them unlawfully. Compare 720 ILCS 5/24 \u2014 1(a)(1) (West 2002) (\u201c[a] person commits [an] offense *** when he knowingly *** possesses\u201d) with 720 ILCS 5/24 \u2014 1(a)(2) (West 2002) (\u201c[a] person commits [an] offense *** when he knowingly *** possesses with intent to use the same unlawfully against another\u201d); see also People v. Sullivan, 46 Ill. 2d 399, 402-03 (1970) (referring to subsection (a)(1) and stating that \u201c[t]he legislature has specifically named the weapons, the simple possession of which is per se unlawful\u201d). Metal knuckles fall into the per se unlawful category; most knives, however, do not. See 720 ILCS 5/24 \u2014 1(a)(1) (West 2002). The Code does not define \u201cmetal knuckles.\u201d Of the various weapons listed in section 24 \u2014 1(a)(1), only a switchblade knife and a ballistic knife are defined. See 720 ILCS 5/24\u2014 1(a)(1) (West 2002).</p> <p id=\"b516-4\" pgmap=\"516(168) 517(83)\"> Under well-settled principles of statutory construction, an undefined term must be given its ordinary and popularly understood meaning. People v. Ward, 215 Ill. 2d 317, 325 (2005). And to determine that meaning, we may look to a dictionary. See People v. Collins, 214 Ill. 2d 206, 214-15 (2005). The American Heritage Dictionary says metal knuckles are a \u201cmetal chain or a set of rings attached to a bar that can be fitted over the fingers to increase the impact of a blow with the fist.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary_(4th ed._). This definition makes clear that the term \u201cmetal knuckles,\u201d popularly understood, refers to a weapon with one main purpose: to increase the power \u2014 and, hence, the impact \u2014 of a punch. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines metal knuckles as a \u201cweapon worn on the hand for the purposes of offense or defense, so made that in hitting with the fist considerable damage is inflicted.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 188 (6th ed. 1990). The Black\u2019s Law Dictionary definition conceivably could include any type of metal weapon worn on the hand and made to inflict considerable damage in hitting. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary does not define metal knuckles. However, Webster\u2019s does define \u201cbrass knuckles\u201d as \u201ca set of four metal finger rings or guards attached to a transverse piece and worn over the front of the doubled fist for use as a weapon.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 269 (1986). Therefore, definitionally, the weapon in question is not a set of metal knuckles.</p> <p id=\"b517-4\" pgmap=\"517\">Four important considerations support this conclusion. First, the item\u2019s appearance undermines the argument that it is a set of metal knuckles. To be sure, the item does include two complete metal loops into which the holder\u2019s middle and ring fingers may be placed. But jutting forth from these loops is a long, thick knife blade. If a person were to punch someone while wearing this item, the problem for the victim would not be that the metal loops would add to the impact of the assailant\u2019s fist. Indeed, the metal loops would not even make contact with the victim until a S^-inch-long, lVa-inch-wide blade was buried in the victim\u2019s body. The State argues that this contact with the blade would be merely \u201cincidental.\u201d In other words, the State argues that a blade jammed more than three inches deep into a person\u2019s body has made merely incidental contact with that person. We cannot agree with that assessment. Moreover, contrary to the State\u2019s assertion, if the item were used offensively, it would not necessarily be used in a punching or jabbing manner. Rather, the item could be used in a slashing manner. The State does not suggest that metal knuckles are a slashing weapon; nor do we understand this to be the case. Thus, the item is not a set of metal knuckles.</p> <p id=\"b517-5\" pgmap=\"517\">Second, it would be unjust to classify the item as metal knuckles. Were we to do so, then any object could be classified as a set of metal knuckles based solely on the way that the object is gripped. More importantly, this would be so notwithstanding that the object \u2014 if used as a weapon \u2014 would not inflict injury primarily because the grip would come into contact with the victim. Rather, the primary injury would occur in some other way, for example, because a large knife blade would be driven into the victim. Because accepting that interpretation would lead to unjust results, fundamental principles of statutory construction require us to reject it. See Jorgensen, 216 Ill. 2d at 363.</p> <p id=\"b517-6\" pgmap=\"517\">Third, it would make little sense to conclude that, simply because a large knife blade is gripped, in part, through two finger loops, the legislature intended the item to be classified as a set of metal knuckles, notwithstanding that the item is neither designed as a traditional set of metal knuckles nor used in the way metal knuckles are used. Again, we may not interpret a statute in a way that produces absurd results. Jorgensen, 216 Ill. 2d at 363. Thus, for this reason too, we must reject the State\u2019s argument.</p> <p id=\"b518-3\" pgmap=\"518\">Fourth, case law supports the conclusion that the item is not a set of metal knuckles. In People v. Whitfield, 8 Ill. App. 3d 210, 212 (1972), the court found that just because an item included metal and was worn over the defendant\u2019s fist did not mean that the item was a set of metal knuckles. There, during a protest in front of a store, the defendant wore a spiked wristband across his fist, which he pointed at several people in the store. The defendant was arrested and charged with possession of a per se unlawful item, i.e., metal knuckles. The court found that the item that the defendant had possessed was not metal knuckles. Whitfield, 8 Ill. App. 3d at 212. In doing so, the court reasoned that the prohibition on metal knuckles applied to a category of weapon with a particular design \u2014 a category that the defendant\u2019s wristband did not fit into. Whitfield, 8 Ill. App. 3d at 212.</p> <p id=\"b518-4\" pgmap=\"518\">Likewise, in the present case, the design of the item takes it out of the metal knuckles category. As noted, metal knuckles are in a category of weapons primarily designed to inflict injury by strengthening the power of a punch. Also as noted, if the item here were used as a weapon, the main injury to the victim would be having a big blade buried in the victim\u2019s body. Thus, here, as in Whitfield, the item is not a set of metal knuckles.</p> <p id=\"b518-5\" pgmap=\"518\">The State makes an unconvincing attempt to distinguish Whitfield. Specifically, the State argues that here, unlike in Whitfield, the design and purpose of the item make it a set of metal knuckles. We have already rejected that argument. Thus, the State\u2019s attempt to distinguish Whitfield fails.</p> <p id=\"b518-6\" pgmap=\"518\">The reasoning of cases involving other allegedly per se unlawful weapons also supports our conclusion that the item here is not a set of metal knuckles. For example, the courts of this state have repeatedly rejected a broad definition of \u201cbludgeon\u201d as that term is used in section 24 \u2014 1(a)(1). See People v. Fink, 94 Ill. App. 3d 816, 817 (1981); People v. Tate, 68 Ill. App. 3d 881, 883 (1979). These cases urge a narrow interpretation of what constitutes a per se unlawful weapon under section 24 \u2014 1(a)(1). And they remind us that, as noted above, any doubt as to whether that section applies must be resolved in favor of the defendant. See People v. Milka, 211 Ill. 2d 150, 185 (2004); People v. Vue, 353 Ill. App. 3d 774, 779 (2004). Therefore, these cases provide additional support for our conclusion that the item here is not a set of metal knuckles.</p> <p id=\"b518-7\" pgmap=\"518(72) 519(141)\">Cases from other jurisdictions also lend support to our conclusion. In People v. Laguna, 124 Misc. 2d 182, 183-85, 475 N.Y.S.2d 783, 784-85 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 1984), the court rejected the argument that an item similar to the one at issue in Whitfield qualified as a set of metal knuckles. The following language in Laguna is appropriate to the current situation: \u201c \u2018to base a conviction on mere possession it must clearly appear that the thing possessed answers the description of one of the prohibited instruments or weapons.\u2019 \u201d Laguna, 124 Misc. 2d at 184, 475 N.Y.S.2d at 785, quoting People v. Visarities, 220 A.D. 657, 658, 222 N.Y.S. 401, 403 (1927). Additionally, in Commonwealth v. Fisher, 485 Pa. 8, 12, 400 A.2d 1284, 1286 (1979), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, while not addressing directly the precise question presented here, found that a \u201c \u2018Wyoming Knife\u2019 \u201d was not a prohibited \u201coffensive weapon,\u201d which was defined to include metal knuckles. The Wyoming Knife was comprised of a metal handle, with two finger holes, which incorporated two blades, one facing outward, the other inward. Fisher, 485 Pa. at 11, 400 A.2d at 1286. Both of these cases support the above conclusion \u2014 that is, the item here is not a set of metal knuckles.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b519-4\" pgmap=\"519\">To summarize, the item Kohl possessed is not a set of metal knuckles. Because it is not, the trial court erred in finding Kohl guilty of unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon, based on his possession of a per se unlawful weapon. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s decision cannot stand.</p> <p id=\"b519-5\" pgmap=\"519\">III. CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b519-6\" pgmap=\"519\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the circuit court of Du Page County is reversed.</p> <p id=\"b519-7\" pgmap=\"519\">Reversed.</p> <p id=\"b519-8\" pgmap=\"519\">GROMETER, P.J., concurs.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b512-10\" pgmap=\"512\">Metal knuckles are perhaps more commonly known as \u201cbrass knuckles.\u201d See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 188 (6th ed. 1990) (noting that the term \u201cbrass knuckles\u201d stems from the fact that the item was originally made of brass); see also People v.

The majority appears to believe that the item must be either a set of metal knuckles or a knife, but not both. I see no reason to limit the inquiry in this way. Further, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the item does not constitute metal knuckles because it may be used in a slashing manner. Although this may be the case, it does not take away from the weapon\u2019s primary means of use \u2014 in a punching or jabbing manner. Metal knuckles with blades attached to them are still metal knuckles.</p> <p id=\"b520-10\" pgmap=\"520(74) 521(98)\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that it would be unjust to classify the weapon here as a set of metal knuckles. According to the majority, if we were to do so, then any object could be classified as a set of metal knuckles based solely on the way that it is gripped, notwithstanding that the object would not inflict injury primarily because the grip makes contact with the victim. This argument is, again, premised on the assumption that the object must be either a set of metal knuckles or a knife, which I reject. The majority\u2019s assertion that it would be unjust to classify the weapon as metal knuckles solely on the way that it is gripped ignores the dictionary definitions of metal or brass knuckles. In addition to specifying the way that it is gripped, those definitions require that the weapon increase the impact of a blow with the fist, which clearly this does, or be worn over the doubled fist for use as a weapon, which this is.</p> <p id=\"b521-4\" pgmap=\"521\">Next, the majority asserts that it makes little sense to conclude that the legislature intended the weapon to be classified as metal knuckles simply because it is gripped, in part, through two metal loops, notwithstanding that it is neither designed nor used like a traditional set of metal knuckles. I disagree with this reasoning. The item here consists of a base that is clearly a set of traditional metal knuckles.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Affixed to the base are several small blades and one long blade. It is designed to be used like a traditional set of metal knuckles \u2014 to increase the impact of a blow or punch when the object makes contact with the victim. I fail to see how it makes little sense to classify the item as metal knuckles when it is designed as a set of metal knuckles and is intended to be used in the manner of metal knuckles. The blades certainly make the weapon more dangerous than a traditional set of metal knuckles, but I do not believe their presence precludes classifying the item as metal knuckles. In my view, it is immaterial that the item might also satisfy the definition of a knife. As the majority notes, the legislature placed metal knuckles in the per se unlawful category: their mere possession is a crime, without the need to demonstrate an unlawful purpose. I doubt that the legislature intended that people could skirt this prohibition by attaching knife blades to the metal knuckles, thereby making them even more dangerous.</p> <p id=\"b521-5\" pgmap=\"521\">Next, I find the majority\u2019s reliance on Whitfield to be misplaced. Whitfield is clearly distinguishable, as the item there did not satisfy the definition of metal knuckles. That weapon did not consist of finger rings or guards and was not designed to protect the knuckles and increase the impact of a punch.</p> <p id=\"b521-6\" pgmap=\"521(24) 522(62)\">Finally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that the main injury to a victim here would be a large blade buried in the victim\u2019s body and that this is not an injury that results from a powerful punch or blow. The weapon is designed to inflict injury by increasing the power or impact of a blow. That it does so via a blade buried in the victim\u2019s body does not, in my view, take away from the fact that it satisfies the definition of metal knuckles.</p> <p id=\"b522-3\" pgmap=\"522\">In summary, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s order.</p> <footnote label=\"4\"> <p id=\"b520-11\" pgmap=\"520\">I do not address at length the Black\u2019s Law Dictionary definition, as even the majority concedes that it is broad enough to encompass the weapon in question. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 188 (6th ed. 1990).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"5\"> <p id=\"b521-7\" pgmap=\"521\">For this reason, I find the majority\u2019s reliance on cases construing the term \u201cbludgeon\u201d (720 ILCS 5/24 \u2014 1(a)(1) (West 2000)) to be misplaced. Those cases instruct that Illinois courts have rejected construing the term broadly to include any club-like weapon. See, e.g., Vue, 353 Ill. App. 3d at 780. Here, in contrast, the base of the weapon is unquestionably a set of traditional metal knuckles.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
