Pugh appeals his 175-month total sentence, imposed after being found guilty by a jury for possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Pugh attacks his sentence as substantively unreasonable because the district court improperly departed upward from the Guidelines pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> resulting in an excessive and unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Based on the sentencing record, we conclude that Pugh\u2019s sentence is reasonable in light of the district court\u2019s consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> factors and the reasons it provided for departing. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201c[EJven <em>pre-[United States </em>v.] <em>Booker </em>[, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ], the extent of a district court\u2019s departure from the guidelines had to be reasonable.\u201d). The record supports the court\u2019s finding that the threats to court officers and the battery on Pugh\u2019s cell mate were indicative of \u201ca violent pattern of continuing and escalating criminal conduct.\u201d The court also considered Pugh\u2019s past convictions for similar serious offenses as well as mitigating evidence of rehabilitation. Finally, the sentence imposed for each count is less than the statutory maximum sentence of ten years. <em>See United States v. Blas, </em>360 F.3d 1268, 1274 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining when the facts support departure, \u201cwe have found sentences equal to or with the statutory maximum to be reasonable\u201d). Pugh fails to demonstrate that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">. Pugh does not appeal the procedure of the upward departure, rather he challenges the extent of the departure as unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\">. The district court must impose a sentence \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider, among other factors, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, and the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
