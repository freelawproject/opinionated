He filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint against Assistant Warden Webb, Ray Black, Michael Owens, Donna Kazmierczak, and Lt. Stephen Sims, alleging claims of retaliation, deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, excessive use of force, and violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Rehabilitation Act (RA). The district court dismissed Wolfs claims against Warden Webb pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) and granted the motion for summary judgment of the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>maining defendants based on failure to exhaust administrative remedies, except for his claims against Lt. Sims. The district court granted summary judgment for Lt. Sims on the excessive force and retaliation claims and further ruled that the ADA and RA claims against Sims be dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). Denying Wolfs motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, the district court determined that the appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">By moving to proceed IFP, Wolf is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We may dismiss the appeal under 5th Circuit Rule 42.2 if it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Wolf does not challenge the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his complaint or denying him leave to proceed IFP on appeal. Pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Nevertheless, when an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed that issue. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Because Wolf has failed to challenge any legal aspect of the district court\u2019s disposition of the claims raised in his complaint or the certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith, he has abandoned the critical issues of his appeal. <em>See id. </em>Thus, the appeal lacks arguable merit and is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, Wolfs motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Wolf has two previous strikes per the dismissals in <em>Wolf v. Southers, </em>No. 1:99-cv-01220-ZLW (D.Colo. Nov. 19, 1999) and <em>Wolf v. Thaler, </em>No. 4:12-cv-00767 (S.D. Tex. June 4, 2012). Because Wolf has now accumulated at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed in a court of the United States while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Wolf is further warned that any future frivolous or repetitive filings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction may subject him to additional sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b994-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
