The district court denied the petition, finding that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient in light of <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), but that Santos failed to demonstrate prejudice under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Santos contends that the district court erred when it concluded that he had not suffered prejudice and abused its discretion when it denied coram nobis relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">On appeal from a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of coram nobis, this court reviews factual findings for clear error, questions of law de novo, and the district court\u2019s ultimate decision to deny the writ for abuse of discretion. <em>Santos-Sanchez v. United States, </em>548 F.3d 327, 330 (5th Cir.2008), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2340, 176 L.Ed.2d 559 (2010). In <em>United States v. Amer, </em>681 F.3d 211, 212-14 (5th Cir.2012), this court held that <em>Padilla </em>announced a new rule that does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">Without the benefit of <em>Padilla, </em>Santos cannot, for the reasons this court set forth in its earlier opinion, demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient for failing to warn him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea or, concomitantly, that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his petition. <em>See Santos-Sanchez, </em>548 F.3d at 334-36. Consequently, the court does not reach Santos\u2019s argument that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance and that the district court erred when it concluded that, even if he did show prejudice, he was not entitled to coram nobis relief. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-17\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b976-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
