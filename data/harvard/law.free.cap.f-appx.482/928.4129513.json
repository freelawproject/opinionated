He received a 36-month prison sentence, which was more than twice the high end of the guidelines range of 10 to 16 months. Pantoja argues that this sentence is substantively unreasonable, contending that it is greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing. He asserts that the sentence did not accurately reflect the seriousness of the offense or his criminal history. He also contends that his illegal reentry amounted to an \u201cinternational trespass\u201d and thus was not as serious as the court determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-19\">We review a sentence for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009). Where as here, the district court varies upward from the guidelines range, we must determine whether the sentence \u201cunreasonably fails to reflect\u201d the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). An above-guidelines sentence is unreasonable if it either \u201c(1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We also consider the extent of the variance from the guidelines range. <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-20\">Pantoja\u2019s arguments amount to a request for us to reweigh the sentencing factors, which we will not do. <em>See United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 344 (5th Cir.2011). Even if a different sentence could also have been appropriate, that is insufficient to warrant reversal. <em>United States v. York, </em>600 F.3d 347, 361-62 (5th Cir.2010). As for his contention that illegal reentry is merely \u201can international trespass,\u201d this court has implicitly rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>the assertion that this characterization of the offense renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See United, States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Although the sentence imposed by the district court represents a substantial increase from the guidelines range, the district court was in the best position to judge Pantoja and the circumstances of the offense, and the reasons given by the district court sufficiently support the sentence. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 812-13 (5th Cir.2008). The district court engaged in a thorough discussion that made clear that it had carefully examined the record. It tied the reasons for its sentence to specific facts, including Panto-ja\u2019s extensive criminal history that was not accounted for in the calculation of the guidelines range, his lies to government officials, and his unabated illegal reentries. The court made an individualized assessment and was free to conclude, as it did in Pantoja\u2019s case, that the guidelines range gave insufficient weight to some of the sentencing factors, including the seriousness of the offense, Pantoja\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to promote respect for the law, the need to protect the public, and the need to deter Pantoja from engaging in future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a); <em>Williams, </em>517 F.3d at 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b950-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
