Dupuch contends \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional, facially and as applied, in violation of the Commerce Clause, because the possession of firearms by a convicted felon does not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Dupuch acknowledges, however, that this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses his argument that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-18\">Pursuant to \u00a7 922(g)(1), it is unlawful for a convicted felon \u201cto ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). We have repeatedly held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not a facially unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1273 (11th Cir.2001) (holding \u201cthe jurisdictional element of the statute, <em>ie., </em>the requirement that the felon \u2018possess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition,\u2019 immunizes \u00a7 922(g)(1) from [a] facial constitutional attack\u201d); <em>United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258, 1259-60 (11th Cir.2001) (rejecting the argument that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional, both facially and as applied, because Congress exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause in passing the statute); <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>124 F.3d 1265, 1266 (11th Cir.1997) (holding \u00a7 922(g)(1) was not an unconstitutional extension of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power); <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 389-90 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that as long as the weapon in question has a \u201cminimal nexus\u201d to interstate commerce, \u00a7 922(g) is constitutional). Thus, Du-puch\u2019s argument that \u00a7 922(g) is facially unconstitutional because Congress exceeded its power under the Commerce Clause in enacting the statute is foreclosed by our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Further, Dupuch\u2019s argument that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to him is foreclosed by precedent. This Court has held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) was not unconstitutional as applied to a defendant who only possessed a firearm intrastate because \u201c\u00a7 922(g) is an attempt to regulate guns that have a connection to interstate commerce\u201d and the government demonstrated that the firearm in question \u201chad traveled in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>McAllister, </em>77 F.3d at 390; <em>see also Dupree, </em>258 F.3d at 1260 (holding that brandishing a firearm that was manufactured in another state suffices to establish the required \u201cminimal nexus to interstate commerce\u201d). Dupuch was convicted of possessing the firearm and ammunition in Florida, and stipulated that the firearm and ammunition were manufactured outside of Florida. Thus, the firearm and ammunition traveled in interstate commerce, and \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not unconstitutional as applied to Dupuch.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
