Mejia argues that his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court imposed a three-year term of supervised release when U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) provides that supervised release ordinarily should not be imposed on a defendant who is a deporta-ble alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-22\">Mejia correctly notes that because he did not raise his \u00a7 5D1.1(c) argument in the district court, the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence is reviewed for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324 (5th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-23\">Given the statements that the district court made when it imposed the term of supervised release, which addressed the need to deter him, Mejia fails to show that the district court procedurally erred because it failed to explain its term of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324. Nor does Mejia show that the court erred because it failed to give notice of its intent to depart upwardly. The term of supervised release was not an upward departure but was within the statutory and guidelines ranges for Mejia\u2019s conviction. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3559(a)(3), \u00a7 3583(b)(2). Finally, Mejia fails to show error, plain or otherwise, as to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, given that the district court\u2019s statements at sentencing accounted for why a term of supervised release was warranted. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); \u00a7 5D1.1, comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b992-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
