Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). In determining whether to reduce a sentence, the court first determines whether a sentence modification is authorized and to what extent. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Next, the court must consider any applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and determine whether any reduction is warranted. <em>Id. </em>at 2692, 130 S.Ct. 2683.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-24\">The court implicitly determined Bennett was eligible for a reduction, <em>see United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011), but concluded that it was not warranted in the light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the circumstances of his case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Having concluded that Bennett was eligible for a reduction, the court was under no obligation to reduce his sentence. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1 (B)(i-iii)). The court properly-considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Bennett\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1 (B)(i)-(iii). We see no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">In his reply brief, Bennett argues for the first time that there is a disparity in the way defendants\u2019 motions for reduction of sentences are handled, specifically referring to two other individuals. This court generally does not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 360 (5th Cir.2010). In any event, Bennett has not shown that the two people he cited have similar criminal records, which include gang membership, or similar post-sentencing conduct involving sexual conduct. Thus, he has not shown that any disparity was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Bennett has failed to show that the'district court abused its discretion in denying \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b966-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
