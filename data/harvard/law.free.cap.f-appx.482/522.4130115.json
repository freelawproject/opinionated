Abella complains of retaliation for exercising his rights under the First Amendment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 198B. We vacate and remand with instructions to dismiss the counts about retaliation in the complaint against Vails, Del Valle, and Salazar based on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Abella complains about three actions by the officers following his protesting of an ordinance proposed by Councilwoman Nancy Simon, reporting of her to a licensing agency, filing of complaints with the police, and photography of police conduct. First, Abella\u2019s complaint alleges that Vails refused to file a police report about the president of Abella\u2019s condominium association \u201cpassing out flyers with libel information against\u201d him. Abella\u2019s complaint alleges that \u201cValls\u2019s statement that \u2018if Ms. Simon paid this person to pass [t]hese flyers out and ... has all the right to do it\u2019 implicates that Officer Vails might have had knowledge of what was going on.\u201d Second, Abella\u2019s complaint alleges that Del Valle issued a parking citation to Abella when his car had been in \u201chis parking space\u201d inside his private condominium complex. Third, Abella\u2019s complaint alleges that Salazar issued a parking ticket to Abella when he \u201cpick[ed] up public records [at] Town Hall and ... parked in front of the building where there were other cars parked.\u201d Abella\u2019s complaint alleges that Salazar said he had been ordered to issue the ticket by Major Frank Bocanegra; Bo-canegra \u201claughed when he saw [Abella]\u201d at Town Hall; \u201c[a]fter a couple of days\u201d Bo-canegra and Captain J. Alongi \u201creviewed ... and decided to rip off the ticket\u201d; and, \u201c[a] few days later,\u201d Salazar said that \u201cBo-canegra ... knew how far he could do wrong without getting caught.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff who complains of retaliation for exercising rights protected by the First Amendment must allege \u201cfirst, that his speech or act was constitutionally protected; second, that the defendant\u2019s retaliatory conduct adversely affected the protected speech; and third, that there is a causal connection between the retaliatory actions and the adverse effect on speech.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Hendrix, </em>423 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2005). The First Amendment protects the rights of speech, to petition for redress, U.S. Const. Amend. I; <em>United Mine Workers of Am. v. Ill. State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>389 U.S. 217, 222, 88 S.Ct. 353, 356, 19 L.Ed.2d 426 (1967), and to photograph police activities, <em>Smith v. City of Cumming, </em>212 F.3d 1332, 1333 (11th Cir.2000). To establish a causal connection, the plaintiff must allege that the protected conduct was the \u201cmotivating factor behind the defendants\u2019 actions.\u201d <em>Smith v. Mosley, </em>532 F.3d 1270, 1278 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Abella\u2019s complaint fails to allege that Vails, Del Valle, or Salazar retaliated against Abella for exercising his rights under the First Amendment. Abella\u2019s complaint alleges that Vails only \u201cmight have had knowledge\u201d of an alleged scheme to stifle Abella\u2019s protected conduct. <em>See id. </em>And Abella\u2019s complaint does not allege that his protected conduct motivated Del Valle to issue the parking citation. <em>See id. </em>Although Abella\u2019s complaint alleges that Salazar knew Bocanegra was bent on harassing Abella, those facts fail to establish that Salazar ticketed Abella in retaliation for his protected conduct. <em>See id. </em>The district court erred when it based its decision on the collective actions of all defendants instead of deciding whether these three officers were entitled to qualified immunity based on the allegations about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>each of them. Vails, Del Valle, and Salazar are entitled to dismissal of the three counts about retaliation in the complaint against them based on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">We VACATE that portion of the order that denied the motions to dismiss of Vails, Del Valle, and Salazar, and we REMAND with instructions to dismiss the counts about retaliation in the complaint against the three officers based on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
