On appeal, Petitson argues that the BIA erred as a matter of law in determining that Petitson was ineligible for adjustment of status based on a finding that she entered the United States as an alien crewman. After review, we deny Petitson\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">A. \u201cC-l/D\u201d Visa</p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">Petitson, a citizen of the Philippines, is an experienced crewman. On January 14, 1997, Petitson went to the U.S. embassy in Bridgetown, Barbados and obtained a \u201cC-1/D\u201d visa for entry into the United States, with an expiration date of January 12, 2002. As recounted later, Petitson then came to the United States and joined the crew of a vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-15\">An alien crewman traveling to meet a vessel in the United States is issued a \u201cC-1/D\u201d visa, which is a dual \u201cC-l\u201d and \u201cD\u201d visa. A \u201cD\u201d visa is given to a nonimmi-grant alien serving aboard a vessel or aircraft \u201cwho <em>intends to land temporarily and solely in pursuit of his calling as a crewman and to depart from the United States with the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived or some other vessel or aircraft.\u201d See </em>INA \u00a7 101(a)(15)(D)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(D)(i) (emphasis added); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.1(a)(2); <em>see also </em>22 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.41 (\u201cAn alien is classifiable as a nonimmigrant crewman upon establishing to the satisfaction of the consular officer the qualifications prescribed by INA [\u00a7 ] 101(a)(15)(D)\u201d). A \u201cC-l\u201d visa is given to a nonimmigrant alien in immediate and continuous transit through the United States. INA \u00a7 101(a)(15)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.1(a)(1)(h), (2). As mentioned above, Petitson received a \u201cC-l/D\u201d visa. The \u201cD\u201d symbol on Petitson\u2019s visa indicates that a consular officer gave Petitson \u201calien crewman\u201d status under the INA. <em>See </em>22 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 41.12, 41.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-16\">B. 1998 Admission to United States</p>\n<p id=\"b465-17\">On June 1, 1998, Petitson presented her \u201cC-l/D\u201d visa to an immigration officer in Los Angeles and was admitted to the United States as a \u201cC-l\u201d nonimmigrant alien in transit with authorization to remain until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>June 29, 1998. Petitson was issued a Form 1-94 (Arrival-Departure Record) admitting her with a \u201cC-l\u201d classification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Petitson traveled to New Orleans, where, the next day, June 2,1998, Petitson joined the crew of the M/V Enchanted Capri as a bartender. Petitson\u2019s employment ended on February 19,1999. At that time, Petitson disembarked from the M/V Enchanted Capri in Florida, where she lived, despite the fact that her authorization to remain in the United States in her visa had expired in June 1998. Petitson\u2019s Seafarer\u2019s Identification and Record Book reflects these dates of service on the <em>M/V </em>Enchanted Capri.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">C. 2002 Marriage</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Three years later, on June 18, 2002, Petitson married a U.S. citizen in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. On September 27, 2002, Petitson\u2019s husband filed a petition for alien relative (1-180) on Petitson\u2019s behalf, which indicated that Petitson would be applying for adjustment of status. On May 17, 2004, the Immigration and Naturalization Service approved the 1-130 petition, but the approval notice stated that, based on evidence submitted with the 1-130 petition, Petitson was not eligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">In April 2007, Petitson filed an 1-485 application for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident. On January 2, 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) denied Petitson\u2019s application because Petitson had been admitted into the United States as a \u201cC-l/D\u201d crewman on June 1, 1998, and, therefore, was statutorily ineligible to adjust her status.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">D. 2008 Notice to Appear</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">On June 2, 2008, the DHS issued a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging Petit-son with removability because she had remained in the United States for a longer time than permitted, in violation of INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). At a subsequent calendar hearing on October 1, 2008, Petitson admitted the allegations in the NTA. The IJ found that re-movability was established by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">Petitson indicated she planned to renew her application for adjustment of status. On October 31, 2008, the DHS moved to pretermit Petitson\u2019s application for adjustment of status on the basis that Petitson (1) was admitted as an alien crewman in 1998 and (2) therefore was ineligible to adjust her status to permanent resident. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 245(c)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c)(1) (providing that adjustment of status under \u201csubsection (a) of this section shall not be applicable to ... an alien crewman\u201d); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.1(b)(2) (providing that \u201c[a]ny alien who, on arrival in the United States, was serving in any capacity on board a vessel or aircraft or was destined to join a vessel or aircraft in the United States to serve in any capacity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>thereon\u201d is not eligible for adjustment of status).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">After extensive briefing and argument at several hearings, the IJ concluded that Petitson was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status \u201cas she is an alien crewman.\u201d In support of this finding, the IJ stated: (1) Petitson was issued a \u201cC-l/D\u201d nonimmigrant visa, and, in order to qualify for that visa, Petitson had to establish either that she was going to be a crewman traveling in the United States to join a vessel or aircraft or that she would be a crewman employed on a vessel or aircraft when she arrived in the United States; (2) Petitson was admitted into the United States on June 1, 1998, as a \u201cC-l\u201d alien in transit, indicating that she was a crewman traveling to the United States to join a vessel or aircraft based on her \u201cC-l/D\u201d visa; (3) the day after Petitson was so admitted, she embarked on the M/V Enchanted Capri as a bartender; and (4) Petitson\u2019s seaman book indicated that she was commissioned on the M/V Enchanted Capri until February 19, 1999, when she disembarked.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Based on this record, the IJ found that (1) Petitson arrived in the United States on June 1, 1998 as an alien in transit to join a vessel as a crewman, and (2) an alien crewmember is statutorily barred from applying for adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c). Accordingly, the IJ granted the DHS\u2019s motion to pre-termit Petitson\u2019s application for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The BIA dismissed Petitson\u2019s appeal. The BIA emphasized that Petitson (1) was issued a \u201cC-l/D\u201d visa, (2) conceded that she entered the United States on June 1, 1998 to work aboard the M/V Enchanted Capri, and (3) joined the crew of that vessel the following day. Agreeing with the IJ, the BIA concluded that the disposi-tive fact was that Petitson entered the United States in pursuit of her calling as a seaman; \u25a0 the fact that she was admitted in \u201cC-l\u201d status did not prevent her from being classified as a \u201calien crewman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Petitson timely petitioned for review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">The Attorney General, at his discretion, may adjust the status of an alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien meets certain requirements. INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). An alien bears the burden of proving her eligibility for adjustment of status. INA \u00a7 240(c)(4)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(A). As noted earlier, however, alien crewmen are statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status. INA \u00a7 245(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c); see <em>also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.1(b)(2). The INA defines a \u201ccrewman\u201d as \u201ca person serving in any capacity on board a vessel or aircraft.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(10), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(10). Furthermore, the INA excludes from the definition of \u201cimmigrant\u201d an \u201calien crewman serving in good faith as such in a capacity required for normal operation and service on board a vessel ... who intends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>to land temporarily and solely in pursuit of his calling as a crewman and to depart from the United States with the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived or some other vessel or aircraft.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 101(a)(15)(D)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(D)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The BIA reads these two INA provisions, \u00a7 101(a)(10) and \u00a7 101(a)(15)(D)(i), \u201cin conjunction when construing the crewman provision\u201d in INA \u00a7 245(c). <em>Matter of Loo, </em>15 I. &amp; N. Dec. 601, 603 (BIA 1976). Thus, the BIA \u201cexamine[s][the] alien\u2019s visa' and the circumstances surrounding his entry into the United States to determine if he entered as a crewman.\u201d <em>See Matter of G-D-M-, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 82, 85 (BIA 2009).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This Court has acknowledged that the \u201cfocal issue\u201d in determining whether an alien qualifies as a crewman \u201cis whether [the] petitioner entered the United States in pursuit of [her] calling as a seaman.\u201d <em>Parzagonis v. I.N.S., </em>747 F.2d 1389, 1390 (11th Cir.1984) (citing and discussing <em>Matter of Goncalves, </em>10 I. &amp; N. Dec. 277 (BIA 1963)). If it is apparent that an alien was issued a visa as a crewman and entered the United States in pursuit of that occupation, the alien is a crewman. <em>Matter of G-D-M-, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 84-85 (relying on <em>Matter of Gon-calves </em>and <em>Matter of Tzimas, </em>10 I. &amp; N. Dec. 101 (BIA 1962)). Thus, the alien need not already be employed as a crewman, so long as the alien enters the United States \u201cin pursuit of employment as a crewman.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Indeed, <em>Matter of G-D-M- </em>involved facts very similar to this case. The alien entered the United States on a \u201cC-l/D\u201d visa and was issued a Form 1-94 that classified him as a \u201cC-l\u201d nonimmigrant in transit. <em>Id. </em>at 83. At the time of entry, the alien possessed a Seaman\u2019s Service Record Book and planned to work on a ship, but did not have a license to work aboard a specific ship. <em>Id. </em>Even though the alien never found work on a ship, the BIA concluded that the alien was a crewman because he secured a visa as a crewman and entered the United States with the intention to work as a crewman. <em>Id. </em>at 83-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Here, the BIA did not err in determining that Petitson was an alien crewman and thus that she failed to carry her burden to show she was eligible to adjust her status. The record establishes that Petit-son was an experienced seafarer who possessed a seaman\u2019s book. Petitson applied for and obtained a \u201cC-l/D\u201d visa as an alien crewman in transit, which she used to enter the United States on June 1, 1998. In fact, the next day, Petitson joined the crew of the M/V Enchanted Capri in New Orleans. Before the IJ and the BIA, Pet-itson repeatedly conceded that she entered the United States with the intention of working on a ship and that she did in fact work on the M/V Enchanted Capri.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Given Petitson\u2019s \u201cC-l/D\u201d visa and the circumstances surrounding her entry, the record supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Petitson entered the United States in pursuit of her calling as a seafarer. <em>See Parzagonis, </em>747 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>F.2d at 1390; <em>Matter of G-D-M-, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Petitson argues that she cannot be an alien crewman because she was issued a Form 1-94 indicating that she was admitted as a \u201cC-l\u201d transit alien. Specifically, Petitson contends that alien crewmen cannot be \u201cadmitted\u201d into the United States and issued a Form 1-94, but can be only \u201cparoled\u201d into the United States and issued a Form 1-95 (Crewman\u2019s Landing Permit). This argument ignores the fact that the \u201cfocal issue\u201d of the crewman determination is the alien\u2019s reason for entering the United States. Petitson\u2019s \u201cC-l/D\u201d visa and the circumstances surrounding her entry indicate that she entered the United States to join the crew of the M/V Enchanted Capri. Thus, Petitson was an alien crewman within the meaning of the INA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Moreover, a Form 1-95 Landing Permit is required only when an alien crewman already working aboard a ship, which has entered a U.S. port, wants \u201cto land temporarily\u201d for such purposes as shore leave or to depart the United States. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 252(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1282(a); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 252.1; <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 101(a)(13)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(B) (providing that an alien crewman permitted to land temporarily is not considered admitted). In contrast, Petitson traveled to the United States on an aircraft as a passenger, not as an employee, and was not seeking temporary landing privileges. As such, Petitson was issued a Form 1-94, not a Form 1-95. This does not mean, however, that Petitson was not an \u201calien crewman\u201d for INA purposes. As discussed above, that determination turns on Petitson\u2019s reason for entering the United States, not on the form issued to her at inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Because Petitson was an alien crewman when she entered the United States, she was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 245(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\">. Unless otherwise exempted, an arriving nonimmigrant is issued a Form 1-94 at the time of entry and then must surrender the Form 1-94 when she leaves. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 235.1(h). The Form 1-94 is \u201cevidence of the terms of admission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Petitson's Form 1-94 is not in the record. In September 2002, Petitson applied for a replacement Form 1-94, and her request was approved. The replacement Form 1-94 also is not in the record. However, the parties do not dispute that Petit-son\u2019s Form 1-94 indicated admission as a \"C-1\u201d nonimmigrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-14\">. Petitson's Seafarer's Identification and Record Book was issued by the Philippines Department of Transportation and Communications Maritime Industry Authority \u201cfor the purpose of providing the holder ... with identity papers for travel to or from an assigned vessel, and of providing a record of the holder\u2019s sea service.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\">. We have jurisdiction to review non-discretionary legal determinations as to statutory eligibility for discretionary relief. <em>Alvarado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>610 F.3d 1311, 1314 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Thus, we have jurisdiction to review Petitson\u2019s claim challenging the legal determination that she is statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"Al5\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision and the LPs decision \u201c[ijnsofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning.\u201d <em>Chen v.

We apply <em>Chevron </em>deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of a statute it administers if it is reasonable and does not contradict the clear intent of Congress. <em>Castillo-Arias v.

On appeal, Petitson contends for the first time that she never had any intention of joining a ship and did not join a ship after she entered the United States. However, Petitson does not provide any record cites to support this assertion, and the record evidence contains objective indicia of her intent to enter the United States to work on a ship and establishes that she in fact worked on a ship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\">. In support of her argument, Petitson relies on <em>In re Saturnino Orocay Baguis Jr., </em>2005 WL 1848389 (BIA May 6, 2005), a non-published, non-precedential, single-judge decision that an alien crewman must be presently employed as a crewmen when he enters the United States and cannot be an \"intending crewman.\u201d In so doing, <em>In re Saturnino Orocay Baguis Jr. </em>distinguished <em>Matter of Goncalves, </em>10 I. &amp; N.

However, in <em>Matter of G-D-M-, </em>a subsequent three-judge panel of the BIA rejected <em>In re Saturni-no Orocay Baguis Jr. </em>and applied <em>Matter of Goncalves </em>to facts very similar to Petitson\u2019s. <em>See Matter of G-D-M-, </em>25 I. &amp; N.
