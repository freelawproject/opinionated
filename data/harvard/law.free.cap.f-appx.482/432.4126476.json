This sentence was at the bottom of the applicable guideline imprisonment range of twenty-seven to thirty-three months. On appeal, Autry argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of the mitigation factors he presented at sentencing. Autry asserts that since any sentence of incarceration would have a significant impact on his family, his community, and the victims, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>only a downward variance to a sentence of probation would have been reasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1188-89 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). We may \u201cset aside a sentence only if we determine, after giving a full measure of deference to the sentencing judge, that the sentence imposed truly is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1191. A sentence may only be vacated if we are left with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The district court is required to impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3) \u2014 (5), (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sen-fence was unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Although we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guidelines range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">We conclude that Autry\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable. His actions \u2014 including creating fictitious account statements and using clients\u2019 investments to pay his own bills and debts \u2014 caused a loss of over $150,000 to the victims. By pleading guilty to just one of the fifteen charges and having the others dismissed, Autry had already received a substantial reduction in his possible sentence. The twenty-seven-month sentence was imposed at the lowest end of the guideline range. The sentence also promotes respect for the law and helps deter others from committing similar crimes. The district court considered Autry\u2019s mitigation arguments and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, then imposed a sentence not greater than necessary under the totality of the circumstances. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\">. We do not have \"jurisdiction to consider a defendant\u2019s appeal of a discretionary decision of the district court to not apply a downward <em>departure, </em>so long as the district court did not incorrectly believe that it lacked the authority to apply a departure.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245-46 (11th Cir.2005) (emphasis added). The district court here stated that the guidelines were \"advisory only\u201d and that it was \"not bound to follow them.\" Thus, to the extent that Autry argues that the district court erred by not granting a downward <em>departure, </em>we lack jurisdiction to consider the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
