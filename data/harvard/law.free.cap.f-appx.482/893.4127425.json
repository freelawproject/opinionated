We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b916-20\">Herzing, a private corporation, operates Herzing University in New Orleans, Louisiana. Following Seals\u2019s dismissal from the university\u2019s paralegal program and its return of his Federal Pell Grant to the United States Department of Education, Seals filed suit against Herzing. Herzing responded by filing a Motion to Dismiss and Compel Arbitration, which relied upon an arbitration agreement that Seals signed in connection with his enrollment at the university. The district court granted the motion to compel arbitration and ordered the federal action stayed and administratively closed pending completion of arbitration. The parties then submitted their dispute to the American Arbitration Association. While arbitration was pending, Herzing filed a counterclaim seeking $4,930 owed for tuition, and Seals answered and denied the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-21\">A two-day arbitration hearing was scheduled. Seals proceeded pro se prior to the hearing, but he retained counsel for the hearing itself. On the hearing\u2019s second day, the parties agreed to settlement terms. The terms were read on the record at the arbitration hearing, and Seals was permitted to ask questions concerning them. After receiving clarification, Seals agreed that he was comfortable with the agreement. A Confidential Consent Award was then prepared, which reduced the terms of the agreement to writing, and it was signed by the parties, their attorneys, and the arbitrator. The Confidential Consent Award was then read on the record at the arbitration hearing, and Seals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>again stated that he was comfortable with the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Within days of signing the Confidential Consent Award, Seals filed a Motion and Order to Suppress Confidential Consent Award (Motion to Suppress) in the district court. He claimed that he had accepted Herzing\u2019s offer at the arbitration hearing only because his attorney had made a and had pressured him to do so. Seals attached a copy of the Consent Award to the motion. In response, Herzing filed a Motion to Settlement Agreement, to Deposit Settlement Funds into Registry of the Court and to Award Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs (Motion to Enforce), a Motion to Place Exhibits Under Seal (Motion to Seal), and its opposition to Seals\u2019s Motion to Suppress. Herzing also moved for consideration of its Motion to Seal. Seals then filed a motion in opposition to Herzing\u2019s Motion to Enforce, a Motion and Order for Leave of Court to File Amend-ment to the Complaint (Motion to Amend), and a Motion in Opposition to the Motion for an Placement of Exhibits \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d Under Seal. Subsequently, Herzing filed its opposition to Seals\u2019s Motion to Amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">The district court granted expedited of Herzing\u2019s Motion to Seal. The court recognized Seals\u2019s motion opposing expedited review, but noted that it did not advance any argument concerning review; instead, it seemed to address the merits of Herzing\u2019s Motion to Seal. Later, the court issued orders addressing the remaining motions. First, the court granted Herzing\u2019s Motion to Seal and that the exhibits relating to the confidential settlement agreement be placed under seal. Next, the court denied Seals\u2019s Motion to Suppress and granted Herzing\u2019s motion to enforce the settle-ment agreement on the grounds that: (1) \u201cit [was] undisputed that Seals and Herz-ing entered into a valid written compro-mise,\u201d (2) the record did not support Seals\u2019s suggestion that his lawyer pres-sured him into settling his claims, and (3) \u201cthere [was] no evidence showing that the compromise [was] invalid.\u201d The court de-termined that the request to deposits funds into the court\u2019s registry was prema-ture. Finally, the court \u201cagreefd] that [Seals\u2019s] motion [was] unsupportable and that Herzing [was], therefore, entitled to a reasonable award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with opposing [Seals\u2019s] motion to suppress and pursuing its own motion to enforce the settlement.\u201d The court denied Seals\u2019s Motion to Amend be-cause \u201cthe settlement agreement [was] valid and enforceable,\u201d and \u201c[a] valid com-promise precludes the parties from litigat-ing the matter that was compromised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">Seals filed a Notice of Appeal following the district court\u2019s rulings on the various motions. He seeks review of the district court\u2019s orders (1) denying his Motion to Suppress and granting Herzing\u2019s motion to enforce the settlement agreement, (2) granting Herzing\u2019s Motion to Seal, (3) granting Herzing\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees, and (4) denying his Motion to Amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b917-15\">We have jurisdiction to consider this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 because the district court's orders dispose of the entire controversy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is unaffected by the fact that the exact amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to be awarded to Herzing remains to be determined.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">We first address Seals\u2019s argument that the district court erred in denying his Motion to Suppress and granting Herzing\u2019s motion to enforce the settlement agreement. On appeal, Seals contends that the Confidential Consent Award cannot be enforced as a settlement agreement because the two documents \u2014 the Confidential Consent Award and a settlement agreement\u2014 are distinct. Before the district court, however, he argued that the Confidential Consent Award should not be enforced because he \u201cwas under duress\u201d as a result of his attorney making a misrepresentation and pressuring him to settle. He only alluded to the argument he now presses on appeal in two lines at the beginning of his motion in opposition to Herzing\u2019s Motion to Enforce. Because this argument was only presented to the district court in a cursory manner, it has not been preserved for appeal, and we will not consider it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Next, we consider Seals\u2019s argument that the district court erred in granting Herzing\u2019s Motion to Seal. \u201c[W]e review the district court\u2019s decision to seal the settlement agreement for abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Seals first argues that sealing his Exhibit 1 (Confidential Consent Award) and Herz-ing\u2019s Exhibits A (Confidential Consent Award) and B (arbitration transcript) was against public policy because \u201ctransparency is in order.\u201d \u201cIt is clear that the courts of this country recognize a general right to inspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, \u201cthe right to inspect and copy judicial records is not absolute,\u201d and \u201c[ejvery court has supervisory power over its own records and files.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, paragraph six of the Confidential Consent Award states, \u201cAll parties to the litigation and arbitration and their attorneys agree to keep the amounts and terms of the settlement confidential. Claimant understands and agrees that this confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement was a material inducement for Herzing to enter into this Agreement, and that it has value to Herzing.\u201d In light of the parties\u2019 agreement to maintain confidentiality, the express statement that confidentiality was a material inducement for Herzing to settle, the fact that \u201cpublic policy favors voluntary settlements,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the limitation of the district court\u2019s order to these three exhibits, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering these exhibits sealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">Seals also argues that sealing the exhibits was improper because he disputed the authenticity of Exhibits A and B, but the district court ordered them sealed before he had an opportunity to view them. This argument is without merit because the district court\u2019s order sealing the exhibits in no way affected Seals\u2019s access to the docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>ments as a party to the matter or his ability to challenge their authenticity.</p>\n<p id=\"Afp\">Seals next challenges the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to Herzing, and Herzing defends the award by asserting that the district court acted in accordance with its inherent power. \u201cWe review a court\u2019s imposition of sanctions under its inherent power for abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Pursuant to its inherent power, \u201ca court may assess attorney\u2019s fees when a party has \u2018acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district court awarded Herzing its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with opposing Seals\u2019s Motion to Suppress and pursuing its motion to enforce the settlement agreement because Seals\u2019s Motion to Suppress was \u201cunsupportable.\u201d In its order, the district court stated that \u201cSeals\u2019 unsupported suggestion that his lawyer somehow forced him to settle his claims is not only unfounded in the record, it falls well short of establishing duress. And dangerously borders on frivolous.\u201d Seals has failed to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion. Nothing in Seals\u2019s appellate brief or the record leads us to question the district court\u2019s conclusion that Seals\u2019s Motion to Suppress was without justification, and in the analogous context of an arbitral award (as opposed to a settlement agreement entered into in the course of an arbitration), we have held that a party\u2019s refusal to abide by the award \u201cwithout justification\u201d quali-f\u00edes as vexatious behavior that can support the award of attorneys\u2019 fees by a federal court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ahx\">Finally, Seals challenges the denial of his Motion to Amend. We review the district court\u2019s denial of Seals\u2019s Motion to Amend for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The district court denied Seals\u2019s motion based on Article 3080 of the Louisiana Civil Code, having determined that Seals entered into a valid and enforceable settlement agreement with Herzing that resolved his claims.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The district court explained that Seals could not, by amending his complaint, \u201cresurrect claims that he agreed to release.\u201d Seals challenges the denial of his motion on the ground that his claims against Herzing were not litigated, but his argument is without merit because the settlement agreement he entered into with Herzing resolved his claims in lieu of litigation, and in the settlement agreement Seals expressly agreed to \u201cexecute a complete release of all claims against Herzing\u201d and that \u201c[t]here [would] be no reservation of any nature against Herzing.\u201d Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Seals\u2019s Motion to Amend.</p>\n<p id=\"AWM\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"A8S\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b916-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
