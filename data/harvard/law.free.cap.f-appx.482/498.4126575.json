On appeal, Kapordelis argues that the district court erred by: (1) extending judicial immunity to his suit seeking only declaratory relief; and (2) failing, upon his motion, to recuse the district and magistrate judges from considering the case. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-25\">We review a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a complaint for frivolity under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A for abuse of discretion. <em>Bingham v. Thomas, </em>654 F.3d 1171, 1175 (11th Cir.2011). A claim is frivolous \u201cif it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will not disturb a district court\u2019s decision on abuse of discretion review if its decision falls within a range of permissible choices, and it is not influenced by a mistake of law. <em>Zocaras v. Castro, </em>465 F.3d 479, 483 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Here, Kapordelis has alleged that two separate appellate panels abused judicial process in deciding his appeals. The first panel affirmed his criminal convictions for child pornography. He argues that the panel denied him due process when it declined to consider key facts. He also alleges that the panel was motivated by a desire to protect the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. The second panel decided his appeal from a dismissal of a separate <em>Bivens </em>action.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">This Court has indicated that, in a <em>Bivens </em>action, a federal judge retains absolute immunity against injunctive relief, and \u00a7 1983 \u201climit[s] the relief available to plaintiffs to declaratory relief.\u201d <em>Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1241-42 (11th Cir.2000). We need not reach this issue, however, because Kapordelis is not entitled to declaratory relief, as he possesses an adequate remedy at law: Kapordelis may pursue Supreme Court review of the challenged decisions. <em>See Bolin, </em>225 F.3d at 1242-43 (\u201cplaintiffs are not entitled to declaratory relief [when] there is an adequate remedy at law\u201d). Furthermore, Ka-pordelis\u2019s eonclusory allegations of bias against the circuit judges and visiting district judge who heard his prior appeals are insufficient to make out a constitutional violation. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Kapor-delis\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">We review a judge\u2019s failure to re-cuse himself for an abuse of discretion. <em>McWhorter v. City of Birmingham, </em>906 F.2d 674, 678 (11th Cir.1990). When reviewing a failure to recuse under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), the test is whether an \u201cobjective, disinterested, lay observer ... would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>McWhorter, </em>906 F.2d at 678 (quotation omitted). A judge\u2019s rulings in the same or a related case generally may not serve as the basis for recu-sal, absent a showing of \u201cpervasive bias and prejudice.\u201d <em>McWhorter, </em>906 F.2d at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Here, pervasive bias has not been shown. Kapordelis\u2019s arguments that recu-sal was required are based solely on decisions rendered in a previous case. Further, his allegations of prejudice are wholly eonclusory. The eonclusory allegations fail to meet the objective standards for recusal under either 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 or \u00a7 455(a). <em>McWhorter, </em>906 F.2d at 678. It was therefore not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny the recusal motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
