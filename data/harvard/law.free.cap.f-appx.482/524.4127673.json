Lopez-Chang\u2019s total offense level was 21 which, combined with his criminal history of category II, yielded an advisory guideline of 41 to 51 months. Despite the fact that the district court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the advisory guideline, Lopez-Chang argues that his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable under <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review a sentence for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 41, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Lopez-Chang argues that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because the court failed to consider the sentencing factors enumerated therein.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In particular, Lopez-Chang argues that the district court erred when it failed to consider the mitigating evidence presented by his defense counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government argues that the district court need only acknowledge that it considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Failure to discuss mitigating evidence does not indicate that the court \u201cerroneously \u2018ignored\u2019 or failed to consider this evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007). Although the district court did not specifically mention the mitigating evidence presented by Lopez-Chang\u2019s counsel, it stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in reaching its decision. Accordingly, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s decision was procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">Lopez-Chang also argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. He notes that a district court must impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including reflection of the seriousness of the offense, deterrence of criminal conduct, and protection of the public. In determining whether a sentencing decision was substantively unreasonable, this court considers the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence that is within the guidelines range is normally considered substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). We will reverse only if \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3558(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). In this case, Lopez-Chang was assigned a sentence of 41 months, which was the lowest choice in the applicable guidelines range. Finding nothing in the record that evidences the existence of a mitigating factor which would allow this court to conclude that the district court erred in not making a downward departure under \u00a7 3553(b)(1) from the range indicated in the sentencing guidelines, we conclude that Lopez-Chang\u2019s sentence was also substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-9\">. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586 (providing examples of procedural error that could render a sentence unreasonable which include \"failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Sentencing Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviations from the Guidelines range.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-12\">.
