Mayes now moves for leave to proceed in forma pau-peris (IFP) on appeal from the denial of his motion for a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-16\">By so moving, Mayes challenges the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into a litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-21\">Although Mayes\u2019s notice of appeal was not filed within 14 days of the entry of the order denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a motion filed by Mayes seeking vacatur of that order constituted, with the benefit of liberal construction, a motion for reconsideration that extended his time for filing an appeal sufficiently to make his notice of appeal timely. <em>See United States v. Brewer, </em>60 F.3d 1142, 1143-44 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-22\">Mayes\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion relied on Amendment 750 to the Guidelines, which had the effect of lowering the offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 for most crack cocaine offenses. Mayes challenges the district court\u2019s determination that he was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his sentence ultimately rested on the career offender provision under \u00a7 4B1.1 rather than \u00a7 2D1.1. According to Mayes, his sentence was based on \u00a7 2D1.1 because \u00a7 2D1.1 represented the starting point for the calculation of his guidelines range; the refusal to reduce his sentence would constitute a miscarriage of justice due to the inequity of the disparity in punishments for crack cocaine compared to powder cocaine; the mandatory nature of \u00a7 1B1.10 violates the separation-of-powers doctrine by limiting judicial discretion to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence; and he was deprived of the opportunity to file a reply to the Government\u2019s response to his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because he never received a copy of the Government\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-23\">Mayes\u2019s arguments fail. \u201cThe crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>ers,\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2009), and the mandatory nature of \u00a7 1B1.10 does not violate the separation-of-powers doctrine, <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>655 F.3d 426, 434-35 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1124, 181 L.Ed.2d 1002 (2012). Given that Mayes\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion did not entitle him to any relief as a matter of law, his complaint regarding his lack of opportunity to file a reply does not present a nonfrivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">Asserting that two motions he filed in the district court remain pending, Mayes requests that, in the event we do not remand his case for reconsideration of the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, his case be remanded with instructions for the district court to rule on the motions and to allow him to move in the district court to file a late notice of appeal based on excusable error. We deny these requests. The motions referred to by Mayes were denied by the district court on January 24, 2012, and February 1, 2012, respectively, and, as discussed above, Mayes\u2019s notice of appeal was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">Mayes has failed to demonstrate a non-frivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b956-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
