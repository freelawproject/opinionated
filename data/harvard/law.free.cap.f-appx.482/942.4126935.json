Agurcia maintains his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In that regard, he contends the advisory Guidelines sentencing range was too severe because: (1) the illegal reentry Guideline, \u00a7 2L1.2, is not based on empirical data; (2) the Guideline allowed impermissible double-counting of his previous convictions; (3) his illegal-reentry offense was not a serious crime of violence, but merely a trespassing crime; and (4) the district court did not consider his benign motive for illegally reentering the country or other mitigating circumstances, such as his entry into the United States as a child and loss of cultural ties with his native country.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly-preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). Because Agurcia did not raise his substantive reasonableness contention in district court, review is for plain error only. <em>E.g., United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007). Agurcia\u2019s objection to this standard of review is presented only to preserve the issue for possible further review. Among other factors, he must show a clear or obvious error. He fails to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">Agurcia\u2019s empirical-data contention is foreclosed by our court\u2019s precedent <em>(United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367 n. 7 (5th Cir.2009)), as is his double-counting contention <em>(Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31; <em>United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2001) (double-counting not generally prohibited; problematic only when expressly forbidden by particular Guideline at issue)). He raises these issues only to preserve them for possible future review. Our court has also previously rejected the contention that a within-Guidelines sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2 is unreasonable because, according to that contention, the illegal reentry at issue here is merely a trespassing offense and not a crime of violence. <em>E.g., United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">When reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence within a properly-calculated Guidelines sentencing range, it is generally inferred the district court considered the sentencing factors in the Guidelines and \u00a7 3353(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Along that line, the record reflects the district court expressly considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as Agurcia\u2019s as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>sertions for mitigating his sentence, but implicitly overruled his contentions and concluded a within-Guidelines sentence was adequate, fair, and reasonable. <em>E.g., United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant\u201d. <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Furthermore, Agurcia\u2019s sentence is presumed reasonable because it is within the advisory sentencing range. <em>E.g., Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 766. His general disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness attaching to a within-Guidelines sentence. <em>E.g., United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b965-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
