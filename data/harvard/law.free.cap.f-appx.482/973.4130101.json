Hicks, </em>464 Fed.Appx. 347 (5th Cir.2012) (per curiam), bound by <em>United States v. Tickles, </em>661 F.3d 212, 214-15 (5th Cir.2011) (per curiam), which held that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d) does not apply retroactively to a defendant who is sentenced after the effective date of the FSA but whose offense preceded that effective date. In <em>United States v. Berry, </em>No. 11-51050, \u2014 Fed.Appx. -, 2012 WL 5906899 (5th Cir. Nov. 26, 2012) (per curiam), however, this court announced that <em>Tickles </em>had been overruled by <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2326, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), which held that the more lenient penalties of the FSA apply to offenders who committed offenses before the effective date of the FSA but who were sentenced after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-15\">The Supreme Court granted a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>vacated, and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Dorsey. Hicks v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 221, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2012). We therefore VACATE the judgment of sentence and REMAND for resentencing in accordance with <em>Dorsey.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b996-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
