He argues on appeal that his 46 month sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Specifically, he argues that his predicate drug offense was over ten years old, and therefore stale, and that it was error for the district court to apply the 16-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) without mitigation; that there were sufficient grounds for mitigation and the district court placed undue weight on deterrence; and that the district court refused to consider his five week Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) custody for \u00a7 3553(a) purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-25\">In reviewing a sentence for substantive reasonableness, we consider the totality of the circumstances under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>While a sentence within the guideline range is not presumptively reasonable, we ordinarily expect it to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>Once a district court has applied the proper guideline range, we will vacate the sentence if, and only if, \u201c \u2018we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008)), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). The reasonableness standard is not applied to each individual decision made during the sentencing process, but only to the final sentence. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Defendants may be given credit for pri- or custody under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). However, district courts are not authorized at sentencing to award credit for time served. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 333, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 1354, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992). The Attorney General, through the Bureau of Prisons, has the exclusive responsibility of administering the sentence and crediting time served, after the district court has sentenced the offender. <em>Id. </em>at 334-35, 112 S.Ct. at 1354-55. To preserve an issue for appeal, an objection must be raised in clear and simple language so as to notify the trial court and the opposing party of the particular grounds upon which appellate review will later be sought. <em>See United States v. Straub, </em>508 F.3d 1003, 1011 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Here, we conclude from the record that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a 46 month sentence, and the sentence is substantively reasonable. The sentence is within the guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum, and the court explicitly considered the parties\u2019 arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The evidence showed that Cruz had two illegal entries, two removals, and necessarily, three illegal entries. In light of this substantial history, it was reasonable for the district court to consider Cruz\u2019s recidivism in imposing the sentence. Furthermore, the evidence showed that Cruz\u2019s wife and children continue to live in the United States, and that he might attempt to return in order to be with them. Though potential mitigating factors existed, such as the hardship on Cruz\u2019s family while he is imprisoned, the district court heard and considered those arguments in imposing the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Furthermore, Cruz\u2019s argument that the 46 month sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to give him credit for the five weeks he spent in ICE custody is without merit. The record shows that there was confusion as to whether Cruz was requesting credit under \u00a7 3585(b), or a downward variance under \u00a7 3553(a). To the extent that Cruz was seeking credit under \u00a7 3585(b), the district court properly determined that it did not have the authority to credit Cruz\u2019s sentence with time served. Even if Cruz preserved the downward variance objection, the final sentence was still reasonable, as reasonableness is determined not by discrete decisions but by the final sentence. <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1245. As already stated herein, the sentence is reasonable given Cruz\u2019s history of recidivism, the serious nature of his prior drug felony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>and the possibility that, if deported again, he might return to the United States to be with his family. Cruz essentially seeks on appeal a re-weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which we are precluded from doing. <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Cruz next argues that it the district court\u2019s imposition of three years of supervised release is procedurally and substantively unreasonable, because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c), as a default, advises against its imposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">We review the district court\u2019s imposition of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">District courts commit procedural errors in sentencing when they, <em>inter alia, </em>improperly calculate the guidelines. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Where supervised release is not required by statute and the defendant is a deportable alien who likely will be deported after imprisonment, the district court should not ordinarily impose a term of supervised release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c). The need to afford adequate deterrence and to protect the public \u201cordinarily is adequately served by a new prosecution.\u201d <em>Id., </em>cmt. 5. However, the district court should consider imposing a term of supervised release on such a defendant if \u201cthe court determines it would provide an added measure of deterrence and protection based on the facts and circumstances of a particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a party induces or invites the district court into making an error, the doctrine of invited error generally renders that error un-reviewable. <em>United States v. Stone, </em>139 F.3d 822, 838 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"Aea\">In the instant case, we note that Cruz explicitly stated on the record that supervised release, even up to three years, was \u201cabsolutely appropriate.\u201d (R3 at 15). At no point did he qualify that statement by explaining that it would only be appropriate in conjunction with a lesser sentence than the one that was ultimately imposed. Regardless, even if the doctrine of invited error does not preclude review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing three years of supervised release. Though as a default the guidelines state that deportable aliens should not receive supervised release, its imposition was not unreasonable here, given Cruz\u2019s history of multiple attempted entries and illegal entries. Accordingly, we hold that the total sentence of 46 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by the three years of supervised release is both procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Thus, we affirm Cruz\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
