On appeal, Bostic, who has never contested the determination that he qualified as a career offender per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), argues that the district court erred in sentencing him under the career offender guidelines because the court should have sentenced him under the drug quantity guidelines as it did at his original sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). We may affirm for any reason supported by the record. <em>United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1189 (11th Cir.2008). A sentencing court may make factual findings based on undisputed statements in the PSI \u2014 that is, facts contained in a PSI are deemed admitted for sentencing purposes unless a party objects to them \u201cclearly and specifically\u201d at sentencing. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303-04 (11th Cir.2009) (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding context), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2129, 176 L.Ed.2d 750 (2010); <em>see United States v. Hedges, </em>175 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.1999) (concluding that a defendant\u2019s failure to object to conclusory statements in the PSI renders those statements undisputed and permits the sentencing court to rely upon them without error despite the absence of supporting evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-17\">The rule of lenity applies if a sentencing guideline is ambiguous. <em>United States v. Jeter, </em>329 F.3d 1229, 1230 (11th Cir.2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>The rule of lenity requires a \u201cgrievous ambiguity\u201d or \u201cuncertainty in the statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1307 (11th Cir.2008). The simple existence of some statutory ambiguity is insufficient to warrant application of this rule because most statutes are ambiguous to some extent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">A district court may modify an imprisonment term \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Part A of Amendment 750 amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 by reducing base offense levels associated with various amounts of crack cocaine under the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Pt. A. In July 2011, the Sentencing Commission decided to make Parts A and C of Amendment 750 retroactive. 76 Fed.Reg. 41332-01 (July 13, 2011). Amendment 750 became effective and retroactive on November 1, 2011. U.S.S.GApp. C, Amends. 750, 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">A district court must follow a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cby substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, in determining whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s imprisonment term is warranted, \u201cthe court shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the [applicable retroactive amendment; here, Amendment 750] had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l), lB1.10(c) &amp; comment. (n.4). \u201cIn making such determination, the court shall substitute only the [applicable retroactive amendment] ... for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781 (stating that <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing\u201d (emphasis in original)). Under the second step, the court must decide whether to retain the original sentence or to resentence the defendant under the amended guideline range. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">\u201cBy its terms, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentencing or resentencing proceeding.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The Supreme Court has rejected a defendant\u2019s argument that the district court erred in failing to correct two mistakes in his original sentence, concluding that, because such aspects of his sentence were not affected by the amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, they were outside the scope of the proceeding authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at \u2014, 130 S.Ct. at 2693-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">In <em>Davis, </em>we concluded that, in adopting the PSI\u2019s undisputed facts that the defendant was responsible for at least 8 kilograms of cocaine base, the sentencing court had found that the defendant was responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, even though the court originally had not specified the exact quantity in excess of 1.5 kilograms for which he was responsible. <em>See Davis, </em>587 F.3d at 1302-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>04. Thus, the district court did not err when it denied the defendant\u2019s motions for sentence modification and recalculation of his sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">According to the amended Drug Quantity Table, the distribution of between 840 grams and less than 2.8 kilograms of cocaine base results in a base offense level of 34. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c)(3). If a career offender\u2019s offense level from the table in \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) is \u201cgreater than the offense level otherwise applicable,\u201d per Chapter 2, the offense level from \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)\u2019s table shall apply. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). The district court correctly refused to disregard Bostic\u2019s undisputed status as a career offender in ruling on his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion per Amendment 750. At his original sentencing, Bostic qualified as a career offender, but was sentenced pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 only because the drug quantity guidelines provided a higher base offense level (ie., 38) than the career offender enhanced level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (ie., 37). However, if Amendment 750 had been in effect at the time of the original sentencing, Bostic would have been sentenced as a career offender, a designation which remains unchanged, because the enhanced offense level of 37 provided by \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) would have been greater than the amended base offense level of 34 provided by \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3). In other words, leaving all other original sentencing determinations unchanged \u2014 thus leaving unchanged the decision to apply the higher of the two offense levels (career offender or crack cocaine) \u2014 the career offender level of 37 was properly applied by the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-12\">. We have expressed doubt as to whether the rule of lenity should play any role in interpreting the advisory sentencing guidelines after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 259, 125 S.Ct. 738, 764, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Wright, </em>607 F.3d 708, 716-19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>(11th Cir.2010) (Pryor, J., and Fay, J., concurring). However, \"[w]hether the rule of lenity applies to <em>advisory </em>Sentencing Guidelines is an open question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 719 (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-5\">. Contrary to Bostic's argument, <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), provides no support for his position. Although <em>Moore </em>involved a retroactive guideline which lowered the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine, the retroactive guideline there did not trigger \u00a7 3582 because the original sentence had been based on the career offender guidelines and the retroactive amendment did not lower the guideline range. The holding of that case says nothing about this case. This case involves a career offender who\u2014 although he was originally sentenced on the basis of the crack cocaine guideline because that guideline was originally higher than the career offender guideline \u2014 remains a career offender and whose career offender guideline level, after application of the retroactive guideline, is higher than the retroactively reduced crack cocaine guideline. Similarly, <em>United States v. Munn, </em>595 F.3d 183 (4th Cir.2010), and <em>United States v. McGee, </em>553 F.3d 225 (2d. Cir.2009), are different from the instant case. In both cases, although the defendant was a career offender, the district court at the original sentencing had departed downward because the career offender offense level was deemed to overrepresent the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the ultimate sentence had been based on the crack cocaine guidelines. Although Bostic\u2019s original sentence was also based on the crack cocaine guidelines, that obtained only because it was higher than the career offender guideline. Thus, the instant case is easily distinguishable from <em>Munn </em>and <em>McGee.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
