He argues that, even if his sentencing guidelines range was not lowered by the amendment, the district court can, after <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based upon its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and his post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts. The district court\u2019s ruling is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Under the Guidelines, as amended by the FSA, Robicheaux\u2019s base offense level of 38 remained unchanged as he was held accountable for 35.6 kilograms of cocaine base, and, after the amendment, a base offense level of 38 applies to \u201c8.4 KG or more of cocaine base.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Robicheaux was thus ineligible for a sentence reduction because the amendment did not reduce his guidelines range. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Moreover, the principles of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny, including <em>Kimbrough, </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b987-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
