He argues that his 46-month, above-guidelines sentence was unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">We generally review a district court\u2019s sentencing decision under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Key, </em>599 F.3d 469, 473 (5th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 997, 178 L.Ed.2d 832 (2011). Because the sentencing judge sits in a superior position to make factual findings and judge their import under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), our review is \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-17\">Davis contends that because his objection to the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement was sustained based on insufficient evidence of an attempted burglary, the district court was left with no reasonable justification for imposing an above-guidelines sentence. This conclusion is belied by the sentencing record. The testimony revealed that on the night Davis was arrested, he was kicking in the door to his estranged wife\u2019s home to gain access to the residence, his wife had a male companion with her in the home, and she feared for her life, as Davis had already shot her on one prior occasion. Similarly, Davis\u2019s contention that the advisory guidelines range reasonably accounted for Davis\u2019s personal history and characteristics, respect for the law, and just punishment is also belied by the record, which fully supports the district court\u2019s finding that Davis is a violent criminal. The district court\u2019s reasons for the deviation were fact-specific and allowed for meaningful appellate review. <em>See Key, </em>599 F.3d at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-18\">Davis\u2019s allegation that the district court had pre-determined that it would impose a 46-month sentence before any evidence was adduced on the \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6) issue is purely speculative. Nevertheless, nothing in the testimony adduced at sentencing suggests that an above-guidelines sentence was unreasonable. Insofar as Davis takes issue with the extent of the deviation, he does so in a purely conclusional fashion. We \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>(2007). The 46-month sentence imposed by the district court represents a 16-month variance from the top of the guidelines range. We have affirmed more significant deviations. <em>See, e.g., Key, </em>599 F.3d at 475-76 (affirming a 216-month sentence when the applicable guidelines range was 46 to 57 months); <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008) (affirming a 72-month sentence when the upper end of the guidelines range was 30 months); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 705-06, 708-10 (5th Cir.2006) (upholding a 60-month sentence when the upper end of the guidelines range was 27 months). Davis fails to show that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a substantively unreasonable sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b933-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
