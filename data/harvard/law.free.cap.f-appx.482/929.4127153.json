We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>Xtreme Lashes, LLC v. Xtended Beauty, Inc., </em>576 F.3d 221, 226 (5th Cir.2009). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). If a motion for summary judgment is properly supported, the opposing party may not rely merely on allegations in its own pleadings, but must, in its response, identify specific evidence in the record and articulate how that evidence supports that party\u2019s claims. <em>Duffie v. United States, </em>600 F.3d 362, 371 (5th Cir.2010). This burden is not satisfied by conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated assertions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Harris argues that the magistrate judge applied incorrect law, overlooking the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Wilkins v. Gaddy, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1175, 175 L.Ed.2d 995 (2010) regarding the quantum of injury required. The magistrate judge found that Harris had failed to establish an Eighth Amendment violation because he had not shown more than a de minimis injury. Harris is correct that the magistrate judge applied the wrong standard after <em>Wilkins, </em>which rejected the \u201cde minimis injury\u201d standard. <em>See Wilkins, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1177, 130 S.Ct. 1175. However, the district court, noting Harris\u2019s objection raising <em>Wilkins, </em>determined additionally that Harris had presented \u201cno evidence, except his own conclusory allegations, that force was applied \u2018maliciously or sadistically to cause harm.\u2019 \u201d As the district court correctly noted, all Harris presented to the district court concerning the need for the use of force was his allegations in his pleadings. The allegations in his complaint were unsworn, and Harris offered no evidence in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Harris may not rely merely on the allegations in his pleadings. <em>See Duffie, </em>600 F.3d at 371. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment for the defendants on the claim of excessive use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Harris argues that the record shows that Smith retaliated against him by falsely writing him up for possessing marijuana in retaliation for Harris having previously taken too many pills at pill call. The district court correctly concluded that Harris had failed to establish retaliation because he did not show that Smith retaliated against him for engaging in a constitutionally protected activity. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1164 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir.1999). Taking extra pills at pill call is not a constitutionally protected activity. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment for the defendants on Harris\u2019s claim of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">Regarding his claim of a denial of due process at his disciplinary proceedings, Harris argues that the magistrate judge incorrectly stated the facts. He contends that he alleged that he overheard a conversation between Major Voorhies and Classification Officer Ladmirault just before his hearing which suggested that Ladmirault was biased toward a finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">A claim that a prisoner was \u201cimproperly charged with things he did not do,\u201d standing alone, does not state a due process claim. <em>See Collins v. King, </em>743 F.2d 248, 253 (5th Cir.1984). Although Harris alleges that the disciplinary report was false, he has never affirmatively denied that he possessed the marijuana. Additionally, Harris has not shown the existence of a liberty interest requiring due process, i.e., that his punishment, a change in his custody to maximum-extended lockdown and four weeks loss of yard privileges, imposed an atypical or significant hardship beyond the ordinary incidents of prison life such that he was deprived of a cognizable liberty interest. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Dickerson v. Cain, </em>241 Fed.Appx. 193, 194 (5th Cir.2007). The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>did not err in granting summary judgment for the defendants on the claims related to Harris\u2019s disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayn\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b951-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
