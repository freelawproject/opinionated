He argues that his sentence, which is within the advisory guidelines range, is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-17\">In the district court, Velasquez-Carbajal argued in favor of a more lenient sentence for several reasons, including the age of his drug trafficking conviction. Velasquez-Carbajal later objected to the 52-month sentence \u201cbased on the [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3558(a).\u201d Velasquez-Carbajal\u2019s objection sufficed to preserve his substantive reasonableness argument for appellate review. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-22\">This court has consistently rejected Velasquez-Carbajal\u2019s \u201cdouble counting\u201d argument and that the presumption of correctness should not apply because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2001). This court has also determined that the \u201ctrespass\u201d argument raised by illegal aliens does not justify disturbing an otherwise presumptively reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). This court has further determined \u201cthat the staleness of a prior conviction used in the proper calculation of a guidelines-range sentence does not render a sentence substantively unreasonable and does not destroy the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to such sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-23\">Velasquez-Carbajal\u2019s argument that the district court did not consider his personal circumstances is not supported by the record. The district court noted that Velasquez-Carbajal\u2019s case differed from the more common cases where defendants return illegally very quickly. The district court also noted the lack of violent conduct in Velasquez-Carbajal\u2019s past. However, the district court did express concern over his evading arrest conviction and drug activity. The district court did \u201cnot believe, based upon the information outlined in the [presentence report] or argued by Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>sel, that a downward variance would be appropriate.\u201d Rather, the district court concluded that a sentence in the middle of the guidelines range was appropriate to satisfy the \u00a7 3553(a) goals and \u201cprovide adequate deterrence.\u201d Velasquez-Carbajal has not shown that his sentence was substantively unreasonable, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), nor has he rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir. 2008). Accordingly, his sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b962-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
