Simmons argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. He maintains that the district court improperly focused solely on his prison disciplinary offense instead of balancing that factor with positive factors such as his following the district court\u2019s directive to pursue a GED. He asserts that he should not be negatively affected by the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (BOP) refusal to allow him to take vocational classes until he earns his GED, and he notes that under <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011), a court may not lengthen a prison sentence to foster rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-24\">The district court ruled that Simmons was eligible for a sentence reduction, but it declined to grant such a reduction because of Simmons\u2019s prison disciplinary offense. We need not consider the applicability of <em>Tapia </em>because the record shows that the district court merely expressed frustration with the BOP\u2019s handling of Simmons\u2019s rehabilitation, and it denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because of the prison disciplinary offense. Simmons does not dispute that he committed the prison disciplinary offense. In light of Simmons\u2019s serious prison disciplinary offense, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Simmons\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"AYA\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b949-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
