A federal jury found Taylor guilty of (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>and (2) possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The district court sentenced him as a career offender to concurrent 262 month sentences on each count. On appeal, Taylor asserts that Amendment 750 reduces his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 from 28 to 24, which he asserts is 2 levels below the level 26 \u201crequired to trigger\u201d his current career-offender enhancement. He contends that the amendment dropped his career-offender enhancement from 34 to 32 and that \u00a7 2D 1.1 is a necessary part in establishing the sentencing range, even under the career-offender enhancement. He also argues that the 100-to-l crack cocaine ratio was unconstitutional, had a disparate effect on African-Americans, and Congress recognized this disparity in passing the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d). Taylor urges retroactive application of the FSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u201c[W]e review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002)) (per curiam). A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment unless the defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a sentencing range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered, the district court considers the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is not consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements if it does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">For a defendant to obtain a reduction in a term of imprisonment based on an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines, the relevant amendment must be listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). Because they are listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c), Parts A and C of Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines may serve as the basis for a sentence reduction. Part A of Amendment 750 amended \u00a7 2D 1.1 by revising the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2D 1.1(c), and reducing offense levels associated with various amounts of crack cocaine. U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750, Pt. A, <em>cross referencing </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 748 (2011). The Amendment had no effect on \u00a7 4B 1.1. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The district court must follow a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cby substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. All of the other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing proceeding remain unaffected. <em>Id. </em>Under the second step, the court must decide whether, in its discretion, to retain the original sentence or to resentence the defendant under the amended guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">When a defendant is sentenced as a career offender, the sentence is \u201cbased on\u201d the guideline ranges applicable to career offenders under \u00a7 4B 1.1, not the levels set forth in \u00a7 2D1.1. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327. In <em>Moore, </em>this court faced the question of whether defendants who were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief in light of Amendment 706, which lowered the base offense levels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>for certain quantities of crack cocaine under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c). <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325-27. This court held that the defendants did not qualify for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendment 706 had no effect on their guideline ranges, which were calculated under \u00a7 4B 1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Under the 1997 Sentencing Guidelines Manual, when a defendant qualified as a career-offender and his offense statutory maximum was 25 years or more but less than life, his offense level was 34. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(A), (B) (1997). The commentary defined offense statutory maximum as \u201cthe maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offense of conviction that is a crime of violence or controlled substance offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B 1.1, comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">This court has held that constitutional challenges to a defendant\u2019s sentence are the sort of \u201cextraneous\u201d issues that are not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and must be pursued through a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 782 (upholding a district court\u2019s finding that it had no jurisdiction in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding to consider the defendant\u2019s claim that his sentence violated the Eighth Amendment). Additionally, this court has held that the sentencing ratio between crack and powder cocaine offenses does not violate equal protection based on the disproportionate impact on African-American offenders. <em>United States v. Hanna, </em>153 F.3d 1286, 1287-89 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The FSA increased the amounts of crack cocaine required to trigger the higher statutory-maximum sentences and the mandatory minimum sentences in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1). Pub.L. No. 111-120, 125 Stat. 2372 (2010). Under the FSA, the 10 year mandatory minimum and the life statutory maximum apply to offenses involving 280 grams or more of crack cocaine, and the 5 year mandatory minimum and the 40 year statutory maximum apply to offenses involving 28 grams or more of crack cocaine, respectively. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), (b)(l)(B)(iii) (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">As an initial matter, because constitutional issues are not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we conclude that Taylor\u2019s constitutional challenge to the old 100-to-l crack cocaine ratio was not properly before the district court. Furthermore, we conclude that Taylor\u2019s argument regarding the FSA\u2019s retroactivity is outside the scope of \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Moreover, the district court properly denied Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the career-offender enhancement was based entirely on the statutory maximum sentence, not on Amendment 750. As a result of his prior convictions, Taylor was classified as a career offender and his offense level, as determined by \u00a7 4B1.1, was based on the offense statutory maximum term of 40 years\u2019 imprisonment. Under both the initial guidelines and the amended guidelines, Taylor\u2019s enhanced offense level as a career offender is 34. In other words, Taylor\u2019s offense level after the application of Amendment 750 is exactly what it was at the time of his 1998 sentencing under the prior version of the guideline. Thus, a reduction in his term of imprisonment is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because the amendment does not have the effect of lowering his guideline range. Accordingly, we hold that Taylor is ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to reduce sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
