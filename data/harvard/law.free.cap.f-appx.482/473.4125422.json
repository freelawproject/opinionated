Lockhart has previously filed several motions to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. This Court also affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of Lockhart\u2019s previous Rule 60(b) motion\u2014 construed as another \u00a7 2255 motion \u2014 because Lockhart had not received permission to file successive \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>See United States v. Lockhart, </em>409 Fed.Appx. 307 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">On appeal, Lockhart asserts that the indictment in his federal criminal case failed to charge a federal offense, and thus, the district court lacked jurisdiction over his case. Lockhart further argues that his counsel was ineffective at trial and at sentencing in various ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">We are obligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking and review <em>de novo </em>questions concerning jurisdiction. <em>Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">Where, in a purported Rule 60(b) motion, a defendant challenges the validity of his conviction by seeking to add a new ground for relief or attacking a district court\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits, the motion is properly construed as a second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See id. </em>at 1293-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">A prisoner may not file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion without prior permission from this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h); <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1316 (11th Cir.2002). Absent such permission, the district court lacks jurisdiction to address the \u00a7 2255 motion and must dismiss it. <em>See Williams, </em>510 F.3d at 1294-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">Lockhart\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion does not allege any error in his earlier \u00a7 2255 proceedings. Rather, it merely raises several bases for relief from his conviction. His Rule 60(b) motion is therefore properly construed as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See id. </em>at 1293-94. Lockhart failed to obtain authorization from this Court to file this successive \u00a7 2255 motion and, accordingly, the district court correctly determined that it did not have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
