His advisory Guidelines sentencing range was 24 to 30-months\u2019 imprisonment, but the district court imposed a sentence of, <em>inter alia, </em>60-months, explaining that Martinez had previously been removed from the United States on five occasions (twice following illegal-reentry convictions) and that he continued to flout the immigration laws and engage in other criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">As he did at sentencing, Martinez challenges his sentence as substantively unreasonable. <em>Post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall v. United, States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Where, as here, the district court varies upward from the Guidelines range, our court must determine whether the sentence \u201cunreasonably fails to reflect\u201d the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). An above-Guidelines sentence is unreasonable if it: \u201c(1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors\u201d. <em>Id. </em>The extent of the variance from the Guidelines range is also considered. <em>Id. </em>at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Martinez\u2019 contention that his criminal-history score accounted for his past crimes and recidivism fails because the score did not take into account: several of his prior convictions; and that prior, more lenient sentences had not deterred him from continuing to reenter the country illegally. In any event, a district court may vary upward based on factors already considered by the Guidelines. <em>E.g., United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 809-13 (5th Cir. 2008). Moreover, these complaints amount to a mere disagreement with the weight the district court gave to the various sentencing factors and thus are insufficient to warrant reversal. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586 (explaining appellate courts will not reweigh sentencing factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Our court has previously rejected the contention that illegal reentry is merely a trespass offense that is treated too harshly under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir. 2006). Further, even if, as Martinez suggests, a shorter sentence would have been sufficient to deter him, that is insufficient to warrant reversal, given the district court\u2019s wide discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. York, </em>600 F.3d 347, 361-62 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">Although the sentence represents a substantial increase from the Guidelines range, the district court was in the best position to judge Martinez and the circumstances of the offense, and the reasons given by the district court sufficiently support the sentence. The court tied the reasons for its sentence to specific facts and particular 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which were sufficient to justify the extent of the variance. The court made an individualized assessment and was free to conclude, as it did, that in Martinez\u2019 case, the Guidelines range gave insufficient weight to some of the sentencing factors, including Martinez\u2019 history and characteristics, the need to protect the public, and the need to deter Martinez from continuing to violate the law. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b907-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
