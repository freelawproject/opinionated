The defendant objected that another order of notice could not be made, because of the order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>notice and attempted service before the term. The court overruled the objection, and the defendant filed this bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b132-5\"><em>Dudley </em>Remide, specially for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE2\">If the service was illegal, the defect cannot be cured by a new order of notice. <em>Sleeper </em>v. <em>Baptist </em>Association, 58 N.
