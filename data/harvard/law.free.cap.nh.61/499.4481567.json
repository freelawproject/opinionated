Two suits between these parties are not necessary for balancing the equal damages accruing from the single contract of exchange, and duly set forth in pleading. _ The defendant\u2019s judgment for costs will conclude the controversy by a clause of recoupment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-9\">Stanley, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
