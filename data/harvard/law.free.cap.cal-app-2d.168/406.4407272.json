A. Bellatti, a human being, in the driving of a vehicle with gross negligence. He was tried before the court without a jury. The court found him guilty as charged, and granted probation for three years on condition that he spend six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>months in the custody of the sheriff as a preliminary condition thereof. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">By stipulation of the parties the trial was had on the record of the evidence adduced at the preliminary examination. Defendant did not testify in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Defendant in his brief to this court makes only two points: 1. That the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the finding of the trial court for the reason that no corpus delicti was proven in that the death of the decedent was not the proximate result of appellant\u2019s driving. 2. That the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the finding of the trial court in that the People failed to prove the death of decedent was the result of appellant\u2019s driving with gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">When a cause reaches this court on appeal on the sole ground of insufficiency of the evidence to support the findings of the trial court \u201cwe may not reweigh the evidence or resolve conflicts therein in favor of the defendant. The credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are committed exclusively to the trier of fact.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flummerfelt, </em>153 Cal.App.2d 104, 106 [2] [313 P.2d 912].)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u2018 \u2018 The right to draw proper inferences from the evidence is a function of the jury; and as long as its conclusions do not do violence to reason, an appellate court is not permitted to substitute its findings of the ultimate fact for that reached by the constitutional as well as the statutory arbiter thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Circumstantial evidence may be as convincing in its force and as conclusive as the testimony of witnesses to an overt act.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>8 Cal.2d 502, 511 [66 P.2d 631].)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">\u201c \u2018We must assume in favor of the verdict the existence of every fact which the jury could have reasonably deduced from the evidence, and then determine whether such facts are sufficient to support the verdict. \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Newland, </em>15 Cal.2d 678, 681 [104 P.2d 778].)  \u201cProof of the corpus delicti in a murder ease \u2018consists of two elements, the death of the alleged victim [s] and the existence of some criminal agency as the cause, either or both of which may be proved circumstantially or inferentially. \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>151 Cal.App.2d 173, 177 [5] [311 P.2d 117].)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">Viewing the duty of this court in the light of these rules we find the evidence is substantially as follows: A California patrol officer proceeding in a northerly direction on Highway 6 near Rosamond in Kern County, met the defendant who was traveling south \u201cin excess of ninety miles per hour\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>in a white Buieb automobile. This was a \u201cmile or so\u201d from the place the accident occurred. The officer immediately turned his car around and pursued the defendant at about 110 miles per hour, proceeding around a long sweeping curve. The curve and a slight grade obscured defendant\u2019s car momentarily. While in the curve the officer saw a dust cloud come up about three-fourths of a mile ahead. The officer arrived about 60 seconds after seeing the dust cloud come up, and determined the point of impact with deceased\u2019s car to be coincidental with the dust cloud. About one to five minutes before meeting defendant\u2019s car the officer had met deceased\u2019s car bound south, following a road grader at about 25 miles per hour. At the point of impact the defendant was found still behind the wheel of his ear. Deceased\u2019s car was overturned near the point of impact with deceased pinned underneath it. Deceased was taken to the Mojave Medical Center Hospital and died there about two and a half days after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Defendant\u2019s car at the time the officer arrived was at rest west of the highway about 15 feet from the vehicle of the deceased, which was also west of the highway. The defendant\u2019s car was white. The deceased\u2019s car was orange color. The damaged portion of the front of defendant\u2019s car showed orange paint smears. The left rear of deceased\u2019s vehicle had been struck and at that point showed white paint transfers. The officer noticed the odor of alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath. The parties stipulated that the doctor who had taken blood tests from defendant shortly after the accident would, if called, testify that an analysis of appellant\u2019s blood showed 232 milligram per cent alcohol concentration and that a person with such concentration would be under the influence of intoxicants. The officer\u2019s official written report was placed in evidence at defendant\u2019s own request, and is therefore in evidence in its entirety. It shows a chart of the tire marks made by both vehicles, clearly indicating that defendant\u2019s car, while traveling in a straight line, struck the rear of deceased\u2019s car. Defendant is therein quoted as saying that he \u201chad been drinking beer last night and this morning. Did not know how much. Could not remember anything about accident.\u201d Other passengers were quoted in the report as placing the defendant as the driver of the car. Said report shows that the officer took the statement of the deceased while in the Mojave Medical Center Hospital the day before deceased\u2019s death and that deceased then stated \u201cI was southbound about 20 miles per hour following the grader. I did not have any idea anything was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>wrong until I was struck from rear.\u201d None of the witnesses reported seeing any other cars that might possibly have been involved in any way in the accident. The certificate of death, which was also placed in evidence, recites the cause of the deceased\u2019s death as \u201cExtensive fractures and hemorrhages with prolonged shock, from car accident.\u201d The certificate of death is prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 10551; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crozier, </em>119 Cal.App.2d 204, 208 [3.] [258 P.2d 1029]; <em>Bryson </em>v. <em>Manhart, </em>11 Cal.App.2d 691, 696 [2] [54 P.2d 778].)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">While the defendant\u2019s failure to testify will not supply a complete hiatus in the necessary elements of the prosecution\u2019s proof nevertheless a defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand \u201cto deny or explain evidence presented against him, when it is in his power to do so, may be considered by the jury as tending to indicate the truth of such evidence, and as indicating that among the inferences that may reasonably be drawn therefrom, those unfavorable to the defendant are the more probable.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Adamson, </em>27 Cal.2d 478, 489 [165 P.2d 3].)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Erom the foregoing facts this court is of the opinion that the trial court was amply justified in concluding that the defendant was wilfully driving at a dangerously high rate of speed; that he approached the deceased from the rear; that he was intoxicated; that the accident was the result of gross negligence; and that the circumstances are not only consistent with the hypothesis of guilt but are inconsistent with any other rational hypothesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Griffin, P. J., and Mussell, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
