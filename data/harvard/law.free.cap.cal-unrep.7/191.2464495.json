Norris, L. A. No. 1336 (just decided), 144 Cal. 422, 77 Pac. 998, the order of the court directed publication \u201cin the San Diego Union,\u201d and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>actual publication was in the \u201cSan Diego Union and Daily-Bee, \u2019 \u2019 and the order of publication ordered that publication be made for two months, and publication was made for five weeks only. We cannot say that the court was not justified in construing its order as referring to the paper in which it was published, and the requirement of the order as to time of publication must yield to the provisions of section 3549 of the Political Code, under which four weeks\u2019 publication is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">On the authority of the decision cited, and for the reasons here given, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
