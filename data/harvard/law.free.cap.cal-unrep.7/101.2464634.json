Certain other evidence was offered, but was not admitted by the court, and the rulings in excluding this evidence are relied upon as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The appellant offered in support of his application a petition by Luis Pina setting forth that he was a brother of the deceased, and as such entitled to administer upon his estate, and requesting that the appellant be appointed in his stead. This petition was not verified, but had attached thereto a certificate of acknowledgment in the form of an acknowledgment for the conveyance of real estate, and, upon the objection of the contestants, was excluded by the court. No evidence was offered on the part of the applicant that Luis Pina was a brother of the deceased, or in any way related to him, and the court very properly excluded the petition. This was the only evidence offered by the applicant in support of his right to have letters of administration issued to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Certain exceptions were taken to other rulings of the court, but none of these rulings are of such a character as would justify a reversal of the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">We concur: McFarland, J.; Van Dyke, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
