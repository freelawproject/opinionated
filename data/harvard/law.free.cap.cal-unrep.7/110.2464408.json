A motion for a new trial was granted, from which the present appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">One of the grounds for the motion was the insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict, and the order granting a new trial, being general in its terms, must, under the well-established rule, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The contention of the appellant that because the court, at the time it made the order, filed an opinion setting forth certain reasons for its action, the consideration of the appeal is limited to those reasons, is untenable: Newman v. Overland Pac. Ry. Co., 132 Cal. 73, 64 Pac. 110. As said in that case: \u201cThe order which is entered in the minutes is the only record of the court\u2019s action, and is to be measured by its terms, and not by the reasons which the court may give for it.\u201d Objection is also made to the form in which-the specifications of insufficiency of evidence are set forth in the statement, but, as was said in Bledsoe v. Decrow, 132 Cal. 312, 64 Pac. 397: \u201cThe specifications as to the insufficiency of the evidence to justify the findings resulted in getting all the evidence in the record, and seems to have informed defendant\u2019s attorneys as to the respects wherein the evidence was alleged to be insufficient.\u201d It is recited in the statement herein at the close, \u201cThe foregoing comprises all the testimony given in this action\u201d: See, also, Churchill v. Flournoy, 127 Cal. 355, 59 Pac. 791; Standard Quicksilver Co. v. Habishaw, 132 Cal. 115, 64 Pac. 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
