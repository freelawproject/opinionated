Justice Holmes</author>\n<p id=\"Ag4\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">The defendant in error was convicted of wilfully refusing to make a return of his net income as required by the Revenue Act of 1921; November 23, 1921, c. 136, \u00a7\u00a7 223. (a), 253; 42 Stat. 227, 250, 268. The judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 15 F.(2d) 809. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">We may take it that the defendant had sufficient gross income to require a return under the statute unless he was exonerated by the fact that the whole or a large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>part of it was derived from business in violation of the National Prohibition Act. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that gains from illicit traffic in liquor were subject to the income tax, but that the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution protected the defendant from the requirement of a return.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap6\">The Court below was right in holding that the defendant\u2019s gains were subject to the tax. By \u00a7 213 (a) gross income includes \u201c gains, profits, and income derived from . . . the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.\u201d These words are also those of the earlier Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, \u00a7 II, B; 38 Stat. 114, 167, except that the word \u2018 lawful \u2019 is omitted before \u2018business\u2019, in the passage just quoted. By \u00a7 600; 42 Stat. 285, and by another Act approved on the same day Congress applied other tax laws to this forbidden traffic. Act of November 23, 1921, c. 134, \u00a7 5; 42 Stat. 222, 223. <em>United States </em>v. <em>One Ford Coup\u00e9, </em>272 U. S. 321, 327. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stafoff, </em>260 U. S. 477, 480. We see no reason to doubt the interpretation of the Act, or any reason why the fact that a business is unlawful should exempt it from paying the taxes that if lawful it would have to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">As the defendant\u2019s income was taxed, the statute of course required a return. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sischo, </em>262 U. S. 165. In the decision that this was contrary to the Constitution we are of opinion that the protection of the Fifth Amendment was pressed too far. If the form of return provided called for answers that the defendant was privileged from making he could have Raised the objection in the return, but could not on that account refuse to make any return at all. We are not called on to decide what, if anything, he might have withheld. Most of the items warranted no complaint. It would be an extreme if not an extravagant application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>of the Fifth Amendment to say that it authorized a man to refuse to state the amount of his income because it had been made in crime. But if the defendant desired to test that or any other point he should have tested it in the' return so that it could be passed upon. He could not draw a conjurer\u2019s circle around the whole matter by his own declaration that to write any word upon the government blank would bring him into danger of the law. <em>Mason </em>v. <em>United States, </em>244 U. S. 362. <em>United States ex rel. Vajtauer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Immigration, </em>273 U. S. 103. Tn this case the defendant did not even make a declaration, he simply abstained from making a return. See further the decision of the P\u00f1vy Council, <em>Minister of Finance </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>[1927] A. C. 193.</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">It is urged that if a return were made the defendant would be entitled to deduct illegal expenses such as bribery. This by no means follows, but it will be time enough to consider the question when a taxpayer has the temerity to raise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
