Md. State Bd. of Elections, </em>428 Md. 596, 53 A.3d 1111 (2012) (also representing computer-facilitated petitions to submit the Maryland Dream Act to referendum on the 2012 election ballot). Following the passage of Maryland\u2019s latest congressional redistricting law, enacted by the General Assembly in an October 2011 special session as Senate Bill 1, chapter 1 (pursuant to the results of the 2010 United States Census) (hereinafter SB 1), Intervenor, MDPetitions.com, employed a website-based initiative to gather the signatures necessary to petition SB 1 to referendum on the general election ballot in November 2012.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The site\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>computer software allowed a user to generate electronically a petition signature page by entering his or her identifying information<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in specified fields on the website. The registered voter then could print the page, affix his or her signature, complete the required petition circulator\u2019s affidavit attesting to the genuine nature of his or her signature,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and submit it to the petition sponsor in support of referring SB 1 to the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The Maryland State Board of Elections (hereinafter \u201cthe State Board\u201d) certified the petition for referendum on 20 July 2012 after determining that Intervenor had gathered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>required number of valid signatures. Pursuant to Md.Code (2002, 2010 Repl.Vol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-209, Petitioners <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (hereinafter \u201cWhitley\u201d) filed a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> challenging the State Board\u2019s certification of the petition on the grounds that Intervenor failed to submit a sufficient number of valid signatures. Specifically, Whitley objected to two classes of signatures that were validated by the State Board, the invalidity of either of which would render the petition insufficient to place SB 1 on the ballot. First, Whitley contended that signature pages obtained through the use of MDPetitions.com were invalid under \u00a7 6-203 of the Election Law Article and the State Board\u2019s own regulations because the computer program or the recruiting household member, rather than the individual signer, \u201cincluded\u201d or \u201cprovided\u201d the individual\u2019s identifying information. Second, Whitley objected to signature pages that were signed by the voter twice \u2014 once as the signer pledging support for the petition and again as the circulator attesting that the signature of the signer was valid \u2014 as contrary to the plain language of the affidavit requirements of Article XVI, Section 4 of the Maryland Constitution and \u00a7 6-204 of the Election Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The Circuit Court affirmed the action of the State Board, determining that the applicable constitutional and statutory provisions were unambiguous and did not support Whitley\u2019s contentions. We issued a writ of certiorari to consider two issues: (1) whether petition signatures obtained through the use of a third-party website violate the statutory requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>that an individual \u201cinclude\u201d or \u201cprovide\u201d his or her identifying information, <em>see </em>Md.Code, (2002, 2010 RepLVol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-203; COMAR 33.06.03.06; and (2) whether an individual can \u201cself-circulate\u201d a petition by signing both as the voter and as the circulator consistent with the affidavit requirements of the Maryland Constitution and Election Law Article. <em>See </em>Md. Const, art. XVI, \u00a7 4; Md.Code (2002, 2010 RepLVol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-204. On 17 August, 2012, we issued an Order affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We shall elaborate now our reasons for that Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Article XVI, Section 1 of the Maryland Constitution reserves to the people the power to petition to referendum any Act, or any part of an Act, passed by the General Assembly (if approved by the Governor) or passed over the Governor\u2019s veto. Md. Const, art. XVI, \u00a7 1. To proceed to referendum, a petition must be filed with the Secretary of State, Md. Const, art. XVI, \u00a7 2, bearing the signatures of three percent of the registered voters of the State as determined by the total number of votes actually cast in the preceding gubernatorial election.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Md. Const, art. XVT, \u00a7 3(a). Each signature page accompanying the petition must include an \u201caffidavit of the person procuring those signatures that the signatures were affixed in his presence and that, based upon the person\u2019s best knowledge and belief, every signature on the paper is genuine and bona fide and that the signers are registered voters at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>address set opposite or below their names.\u201d Md. Const, art. XVI, \u00a7 4. Upon a determination of sufficiency, the petitioned Act is submitted to the registered voters of the State on the ballot for their approval or rejection. Md. Const, art. XVI, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">On 20 October 2011, the Maryland General Assembly enacted Senate Bill 1, chapter 1 of the 2011 Special Session, signed by Governor O\u2019Malley that same day. SB 1 established a congressional redistricting plan for Maryland\u2019s eight congressional districts, pursuant to the results of the 2010 U.S. Census.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Following its passage, Intervenor, MDPetitions.com, initiated an effort to collect at least the 55,736 signatures required to subject SB 1 to referendum on the 2012 general election ballot, pursuant to Article XVI of the Maryland Constitution and Title 6 of the Election Law Article.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On 26 March 2012, Intervenor received from the State Board an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>advance determination of the sufficiency of the format of their proposed petition pursuant to Md.Code (2002, 2010 RepLVol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-202.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">For a signature to be accepted as valid by the State Board, it must comply with the provisions of the Maryland Constitution and Title 6 of the Election Law Article.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Each paper submitted as part of a petition must \u201ccontain the full text, or an accurate summary approved by the Attorney General, of the Act or part of Act petitioned.\u201d Md. Const, art. XVI, \u00a7 4; Md.Code (2002, 2010 RepLVol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-201(c)(2) (requiring that a petition seeking to place a question on the ballot contain either \u201c(i) a fair and accurate summary of the substantive provisions of the proposal; or (ii) the full text of the proposal\u201d). Additionally, a valid signature page must include a description of the petition\u2019s subject and purpose, a statement of the signer\u2019s support and status as a registered voter, spaces for signatures and signer information, and a space for the required affidavit to be made and executed by the petition circulator.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-201(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>In completing a signature page, each signer of a petition must \u201cinclude ..., printed or typed,\u201d his or her name, address, and the date the petition was signed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-203(a). The signature page must also include \u201can affidavit of the person procuring those signatures that the signatures were affixed in his presence and that, based upon the person\u2019s best knowledge and belief, every signature on the paper is genuine and bona fide and that the signers are registered voters at the address set opposite or below their names.\u201d Md. Const, art. XVI, \u00a7 4. If the affidavit, \u201cmade and executed by the individual in whose presence all of the signatures on that page were affixed and who observed each of those signatures being affixed,\u201d Md.Code (2002, 2010 Repl. Vol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-204, is not included, the signature will be deemed invalid. Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-203(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Intervenor collected petition signatures both in person and through the use of a website that allowed visitors to the site to enter relevant identifying information to generate their own copy of a referendum petition, which could then be printed, signed, and mailed to the petition sponsor. To use the petition computer software, an individual could visit MDPetitions.com, select the \u201credistricting petition\u201d option, and follow a series of prompts to complete the petition. After selecting the redistricting option, the website first displayed a screen which included a picture of the new congressional districts as defined by SB 1, a summary of Intervenor\u2019s concerns regarding SB 1 and Intervenor\u2019s call to action,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the option to either \u201cSign the petition now\u201d or \u201cGet a volunteer packet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>An individual who elected to sign the petition would then be taken to a screen that provided instructions on how to generate a petition. On the left side of the screen was a five-step instruction process, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\">Maryland has strict rules regarding how the petition is filled out. This site will help insure that your petition is filled out in 5 easy steps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">Step 1 \u2014 Provide information requested on the petition, as indicated to the right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">Step 2 \u2014 Select members of your household who might also want to sign the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">Step 3 \u2014 Download the petition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">Step 4 \u2014 Print the petition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">Step 5 \u2014 Sign and date the petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">On the right side of the screen, a series of boxes appeared in which the individual could enter his or her identifying information, as instructed in Step 1. The screen prompted, \u201cFill out the following form with your information,\u201d and included the following fields for the individual to complete: first name, last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>name, suffix (optional), email address, phone number, zip code (5 digit), and birth date. After filling in the relevant information and clicking \u201cContinue,\u201d the software program would search the most recent voter registration rolls made available by the Maryland State Board of Elections to identify the user\u2019s status as a registered Maryland voter. Assuming that the software was able to identify the user as a registered voter,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> a screen displaying the names of all of the Maryland voters registered at the address entered would appear. The user was instructed to deselect the name of any registered voter at the address who did not wish to sign the petition by clicking a box appearing next to the voter\u2019s name. After clicking \u201cContinue,\u201d the user could then select a button labeled \u201cDownload a petition\u201d to download his or her personal petition. The screen contained the following instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">Step 1 \u2014 Download the petition, you may need to save the file to your computer in order to open it</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">Step 2 \u2014 Open the File which includes the petition, a self-addressed envelope, and a copy of the bill</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">Step 3 \u2014 Print the petition.

Intervenor submitted an additional 36,267 signatures on 30 June. As of 18 July, the Board accepted 59,201 signatures and rejected 7,649, thus validating and verifying more than the number of signatures necessary to submit SB 1 to referendum. As a result, in a letter dated 20 July 2012,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the State Board granted final certification to Intervenor\u2019s petition, pursuant to Md.Code (2002, 2010 Repl.Vol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-208(b).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">After the petition was certified for the November 2012 general election ballot, five registered Maryland voters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>(\u201cWhitley\u201d) challenged the validity of the petition\u2019s certification by filing a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief under Section 6-209<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> of the Election Law Article in the Circuit Court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The complaint alleged that because two categories of petition signatures failed to meet the requirements of Article XVI of the Maryland Constitution and the Election Law Article, the State Board\u2019s certification decision was based on an insufficient number of signatures and should be reversed. First, Whitley contended that the approximately 7,578 signatures obtained through the electronic generation of a petition through the mechanisms of MDPetitions.com failed to satisfy the requirement of Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-203(a) and COMAR 33.06.03.06(B)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> that the petition signer \u201cinclude\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>or \u201cprovide\u201d his identifying information. Second, Whitley asserted that the approximately 14,254 signature pages<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> on which the registered voter attested to his or her own signature as the circulator are invalid in violation of Article XVI, Section 4 of the Maryland Constitution and Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-204(a) in that the circulator\u2019s required affidavit was not \u201caffixed in [the] presence\u201d of the person \u201cprocuring\u201d the petition signatures. Whitley sought a declaration that the petition did not satisfy the legal requirements for certification of a petition to referendum, requested that the Circuit Court reverse the State Board\u2019s certification decision, and asked the court to enjoin the Secretary of State from preparing and certifying SB 1 to the State Board, pursuant to Election Law Article, \u00a7 7-103(c)(l).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>(b) <em>Certification. </em>\u2014 If the chief election official determines that a petition has satisfied all requirements established by law relating to that petition, the chief election official shall certify that the petition process has been completed and shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-12\">(1) with respect to a petition seeking to place the name of an individual or a question on the ballot, certify that the name or question has qualified to be placed on the ballot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Whitley, the State Board, and Intervenor filed cross-motions for summary judgment. A hearing was held on 10 August 2012 in the Circuit Court to consider these motions. The court entered summary judgment in favor of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Board,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> affirming the certification decision and approving the methodology by which the petition signatures were gathered. Specifically, the court determined that computer-generated petitions complied with the requirements of \u00a7 6-203 because the statute fails to specify the method by which a signer must \u201cinclude\u201d his or her identifying information. Further, the court found that because neither the Maryland Constitution nor \u00a7 6-204 of the Election Law Article contains an express requirement that an individual other than the petition signer serve as the circulator, self-circulating petitions are not invalid presumptively.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Whitley noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and filed contemporaneously a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. Prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court, we issued a writ of certiorari. <em>Whitley v. Md. State Bd. of Elections, </em>427 Md. 523, 50 A.3d 9 (2012). We heard oral arguments on 16 August 2012, and the next day, on 17 August 2012, we issued a Per Curiam Order affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. We shall explain now our reasons for that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">We are asked here to consider the following two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">(1) Does allowing a petition sponsor\u2019s computer program to pre-fill the signer\u2019s identifying information on the petition form violate the requirement of Md.Code Ann., Elec. Law Sec. 6-203(a) that the individual signer shall \u201cinclude\u201d that information and/or the requirement of the State Board\u2019s regulation, COMAR Sec. 33.06.03.06B(1) that the signer shall \u201cIpjrovide\u201d such information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">(2) Does allowing a circulator of a referendum petition to attest to his or her own signature violate the requirement of Md. Const., Art. XVI Sec. 4 that each petition must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>attached \u201can affidavit of the person procuring those signatures that the signatures were affixed in his presence;\u201d and/or the requirements of Md.Code Ann., Elec. Law Sec. 6-204(a) that the affidavit be \u201cmade and executed by the individual in whose presence all of the signatures on that page were affixed and who observed each of those signatures being affixed\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">On review of an order granting summary judgment,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> this Court reviews the record to determine whether any material facts are in dispute. <em>Md. State Bd. of Elections v. Libertarian Party, </em>426 Md. 488, 505-06, 44 A.3d 1002, 1012 (2012); <em>Doe v. Montgomery Cnty.

[p]rovide the following information, to be printed or typed in the appropriate spaces: (A) Date of signing, (B) Signer\u2019s name as it was signed, and (C) Current residence address ... \u201d. COMAR 33.06.03.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">We concluded previously that the provisions of \u00a7 6-203 are mandatory, not discretionary. <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 728, 962 A.2d at 360. Thus, in order for the State Board to validate and verify properly a signature, the petition signers must have complied with the requirements in \u00a7 6-203. Section 6-203(a)(2) states, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]o sign a petition, an individual shall ... include the [required identifying] information, printed or typed, in the spaces provided ...\u201d. There is no dispute that the information required by the statutory provisions and accompanying regulations \u2014 specifically, the signer\u2019s name, address, and date of signing \u2014 appeared on the signature pages at issue. Rather, Whitley asserts that Intervenor\u2019s use of MDPetitions.com, which allows individuals to generate electronically signature pages, contravenes the requirement of \u00a7 6-203 and COMAR 33.06.03.06B(1) that the signer \u201cinclude\u201d or \u201cprovide\u201d his identifying information, and defeats the purpose of \u00a7 6-203 by increasing the risk of voter fraud. Essentially, Whitley contends that the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>statute and regulation requires that the <em>signer </em>\u201cinclude\u201d his or her identifying information, and that any signature for which a third party entered the identifying information is invalid on its face. Thus, Whitley takes exception not only to those signatures for which the individual entered the information into MDPetitions.com on behalf of himself or herself, but also for those in which an individual entered information into MDPetitions.com on behalf of another registered voter residing at the same address.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Further, Whitley claims that the State Board expressed disapproval regarding computer-generated petitions because they are the functional equivalent of pre-printed \u201cwalking\u201d petitions.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> By not following the letter of the law, Whitley contends, the computer program renders meaningless the protections against voter fraud provided by \u00a7 6-203. <em>See Doe, </em>406 Md. at 731, 962 A.2d at 368 (stating that the purpose of \u00a7 6-203(a) is to \u201cprovide additional means by which fraudulent or otherwise improper signatures ... may be detected\u201d (quoting <em>Barnes v. State ex rel. Pinkney, </em>236 Md. 564, 571-72, 204 A.2d 787, 791 (1964))).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Conversely, the State Board and Intervenor argue that the use of an online petitioning program is entirely consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>the statutory language because neither the statute nor the regulations specify the individual or method by which such information must be included. The State Board distinguishes its disapproval of pre-printed petitions from those at issue in the instant case, contending that its prohibition is on \u201cwalking lists\u201d of petitions, rather than the type of household list generated by MDPetitions.com. Respondents contend that, in seeking a requirement that the signer print or type personally his or her identifying information, Whitley attempts to add additional, \u201cunduly burdensome\u201d elements to the petitioning process. <em>See Fire-Rescue, </em>418 Md. at 476 n. 14, 15 A.3d at 805 n. 14 (2011) (noting that this Court has determined that statutes defining the referendum petition process \u201care viable if not unduly burdensome on the constitutionally protected right to referendum\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The Circuit Court, in considering Whitley\u2019s argument, rejected the contention that the plain meaning of the words \u201cinclude\u201d and \u201cprovide\u201d necessitate that the petition signer print or type personally his or her identifying information. The court stated that, \u201c[wjhile it might well be the case that a process like the one implemented by Intervenor was not contemplated by the legislature when the statute was written,\u201d there is no legal support in either Subtitle 6 of the Election Law Article or the State Board\u2019s accompanying regulations from which to conclude that the process employed here violates the law. Consequently, the Circuit Court affirmed the State Board\u2019s decision to certify the signatures submitted via electronically-generated petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We conclude that the language of \u00a7 6-203(a) and CO-MAR 33.06.03.06(B) is unambiguous. Section 6-203(a)(2) requires the petition signer to \u201cinclude\u201d his or her identifying information together with his or her signature as provided in (a)(1). The plain meaning of the word \u201cinclude\u201d is \u201cto take in or comprise as part of a whole.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 588 (10th ed.1999).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As applied to this context, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the identifying information set out in \u00a7 6-203(a)(2) should be considered a component of the completed signature page. The requirement that the individual signing the petition \u201cinclude\u201d the identifying information specified in \u00a7 6-203(a)(2) does not require, therefore, that the individual signer be the person who prints or types the required information onto the signature page. Rather, it requires that the completed petition page submitted by the individual incorporate the relevant information.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Similarly, we do not impute a requirement that an individual type or print personally information from the State Board\u2019s use of the word \u201cprovide,\u201d which means \u201cto supply or make available.\u201d Memam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 940 (10th ed.1999). Whitley asks us to find that there is a personal completion requirement on the basis simply of these two words. Because our role in interpreting a statute does not include reading language into a statute, we decline to find that an individual must print or type personally his or her identifying information in order to comply with \u00a7 6-203. <em>See Johnson v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt., </em>387 Md. 1, 14, 874 A.2d 439, 447 (2005) (\u201cWe may not read language into a statute that is not there\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In construing a statute, we must keep in mind also the purpose of the provisions at issue. <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 172, 935 A.2d at 708 (noting that the Court\u2019s primary goal in statutory construction is to \u201cdiscern the legislative purpose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision\u201d). Interpreting the words \u201cinclude\u201d and \u201cprovide\u201d to require affirmative action on the part of the individual does little to further the purpose of the requirements of \u00a7 6-203(a)(2). As we described in <em>Fire-Rescue, </em>the provisions of \u00a7 6-203 are designed to assist the State Board in the two-step validation and verification process in Subtitle 6 of the Election Law Article. 418 Md. at 478-80, 15 A.3d at 807-OS. Specifically, while the purpose of the signature requirement of \u00a7 6-203(a)(l) is to \u201cprovide a personal attestation, as a signature is often used, to evidence support for the petition and to provide a unique identifier,\u201d the printed or typed information is used not only to validate the signature on the petition, but also to \u201cverify the eligibility of the petition signer to support the petition,\u201d as required by \u00a7 6-207. <em>Id. </em>at 479-80, 15 A.3d at 807-08. Thus, the statutory requirement that the individual provide his name, address, and date of signing \u201cpertain only to the <em>identification of the signer.\u201d Barnes, </em>236 Md. at 571, 204 A.2d at 791 (emphasis added) (discussing the statutory predecessor to \u00a7 6-203, Md.Code (1964 Supp.), Art. 33, \u00a7 169).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Whether an individual prints or types personally the information on the signature page, uses a computer program, or has someone else write the information on his or her behalf does not impact the ability of the State Board to identify the signer. The individual still provides to the State Board the petitioning voter\u2019s identifying information to aid the Board in validating and verifying the signatures under \u00a7 6-203 and \u00a7 6-207.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Whitley contends that to read \u00a7 6-203 in this way is contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent because it opens the door to voter fraud. While preventing voter fraud was indeed a concern of the General Assembly in enacting the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Subtitle 6, <em>see, e.g. Fire-Rescue, </em>418 Md. at 473,15 A.3d at 804 (\u201cPlainly, the overarching goal of the entire Petition Subtitle is to ensure that only eligible voters sign petitions.... \u201d), Whitley fails to point to any actual or persuasive indicia that allowing electronically-generated petitions contradicts this purpose. Regardless of whether a voter completes a paper or an electronic petition, the information required to be included by statute is the same. Moreover, there is no evidence that completing electronically a petition makes voter registration information any more readily available to an individual intent on committing voter fraud. <em>See id. </em>at 492 n. 6, 15 A.3d at 815 n. 6 (Harrell, J., dissenting) (noting the common practice of using a telephone book directory to commit circulator and petition fraud).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Allowing a voter to complete a computer-generated petition prioritizes citizen convenience. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2002, 2010 Repl. Vol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 1-201(5). Registered voters need not wait for a petition sponsor or circulator to find or stumble upon them, but may participate in the political process on their own initiative. Further, because the software confirms electronically that the information entered by a voter matches the information on the voter registration rolls, the process permits individuals to avoid many common errors, such as entering a nickname (instead of a full name), that result frequently in the invalidation of petition signatures. An individual for whom a household member enters the information onto MDPetitions.com has the opportunity to inspect and verify the accuracy of the information before submitting the petition to the election authority. Whitley provides no persuasive evidence, or even conjecture, that any of these advances in citizen convenience will result in increased fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Moreover, this interpretation is supported by the legislative history of \u00a7 6-203 of the Election Law Article. <em>See Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt. v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 131, 756 A.2d 987, 993 (2000) (\u201c[Ejven when the language of a statute is free from ambiguity, in the interest of completeness we may ... explore the legislative history of the statute under review ... [T]he resort to legislative history is a confirmatory process; it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>is not undertaken to contradict the plain meaning of the statute.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). The predecessor of \u00a7 6-203, Md.Code (1964 Supp.), Art. 33 \u00a7 207, <em>repealed by </em>2002 Md. Laws ch. 291, \u00a7 3 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\">There shall be appended to the signature of each signer his residence, his occupation, the precinct or district wherein he is registered as a voter, and his place of business, and immediately below the signature of any such signer, there shall be either printed or typed, the name of such signer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARh\">Hence, by requiring only that the signer\u2019s identifying information \u201cbe appended,\u201d the predecessor of \u00a7 6-203 contained no requirement that the signer print or type personally the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In 1998, the General Assembly directed the formation of a Commission to revise and recodify Maryland\u2019s election law \u201cto remove[] archaic provisions, resolve[] omissions and contradictions, and incorporate[ ] substantive, structural changes in the current law that the Commission considers necessary to meet the needs of modern election administration.\u201d 1996 Md. Laws. ch. 432, \u00a7 1. The revised Election Code effected no substantive changes to the verification procedure in the petitioning process. <em>See </em>Report of the Commission to Revise the Election Code 55 (1997) (listing the addition of a provision for the removal of signatures from a petition as the only substantive revision to \u00a7 6-203 of the Election Law Article). The legislative history confirms that the plain meaning of the statutory provisions does not include a requirement that the signer print or type personally the required information on the signature page. Had the Legislature intended to impose a requirement that the signer of the petition print or type personally his or her information directly onto a signature page, it would have done so presumably. <em>Compare </em>Md.Code (2002, 2010 RepLVol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-203(a)(2) <em>with </em>Md.Code (1957, 1971 Repl.Vol.), Article 33, \u00a7 23-2, <em>superseded by statute </em>(stating that signers of a \u201cpetition for the election of a charter board ... shall place to the right of his or her name as and when signed, the date of such signature <em>in his or her own handwriting\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>quently, we decline to read \u00a7 6-203 and COMAR 33.06.03.06 to include a requirement that the signer of a petition print or type personally his or her identifying information on a petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">B. <em>Sufficiency of Circulator Affidavit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">We turn now to whether a self-circulated petition, in which both the affidavit and petition are signed by the same individual, violates Md. Const, art. XVI, \u00a7 4 or the Election Law Article. Article XVI, \u00a7 4 of the Maryland Constitution requires that \u201cthere shall be attached to each paper of signatures filed with a petition an affidavit of the person procuring those signatures that the signatures were affixed in his presence and that, based upon the person\u2019s best knowledge and belief, every signature on the paper is genuine and bona fide and that the signers are registered voters at the address set opposite or below their names.\u201d The Maryland General Assembly provided further that \u201c[e]ach signature page shall contain an affidavit made and executed by the individual in whose presence all of the signatures on that page were affixed and who observed each of those signatures being affixed.\u201d Md.Code (2002, 2010 RepLVol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-204(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Whitley contends that both the Maryland Constitution and the Election Law Article require that an individual other than the petition signer prepare and sign the circulator\u2019s affidavit. Specifically, Whitley argues that the use of the words \u201cprocure,\u201d \u201cpresence,\u201d and \u201cobtain\u201d imply that more than one person was intended to be present at the time the signatures are affixed to the signature page and that, accordingly, an independent witness is required to sign the circulator\u2019s affidavit. Allowing a signer to self-circulate a petition by signing both as the signer and the circulator, Whitley claims, defeats the purpose of the affidavit requirement and increases the risk of voter fraud by removing an element of the validation and verification process. Whitley asks this Court to invalidate the signatures submitted by individuals who signed a petition as both the signer and the circulator.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>By contrast, the State Board and Intervenor argue that the State Board certified properly the self-circulated signature pages because neither the Constitution nor the Election Law Article specifies the individual required to serve as circulator. Because there is no express requirement that a person other than the signer of the petition serve as a circulator, Respondents assert that the language of the statute permitted clearly and unambiguously the State Board to certify the signatures at issue. Although Respondents contend that the constitutional and statutory provisions are unambiguous, the State Board maintains that even if we were to find otherwise, we should extend deference to the State Board\u2019s interpretation that self-circulation of a petition is consistent with the applicable law. Further, Respondents urge that allowing an individual to sign his or her own petition as circulator decreases, rather than increases, the risk of voter fraud because the circulator must sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury. As a result, Respondents argue, the individual is subject not only to the criminal penalties imposed by Subtitle 6 of the Election Law Article, but also the threat of a perjury charge and possible conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In granting the State Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the Circuit Court judge determined that the language at issue was unambiguous and declined to require that a person other than the signer of the petition serve as the circulator. The court noted that, although neither the Constitution nor the Election Law Article contain an express requirement regarding the identity of the circulator, the General Assembly had the option to impose such a requirement. Therefore, because the \u201clegislature determined that the provisions of Subtitle 6 of the Election law Article would best serve the interests of preventing fraud,\u201d the trial court affirmed the State Board\u2019s application of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">We agree with the decision of the Circuit Court and conclude that Article XVI, Section 4 and Election Law \u00a7 6-204 contain no ambiguity regarding the identity of the circulator. Therefore, we need not pin our reasoning on deference to the State Board\u2019s interpretation. <em>See Fire-Rescue, </em>418 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>469, 15 A.3d at 801 (\u201c[W]e conclude that the particular statutory provision at issue ... is clear and unambiguous, notwithstanding the utility of judicial gloss, and therefore we do not defer to the Board\u2019s interpretation.\u201d); <em>Aviation Admin, v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 572, 873 A.2d 1145, 1155 (2005) (\u201cWhen a statutory provision is entirely clear, with no ambiguity whatsoever, administrative constructions, no matter how well entrenched, are not given weight.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). While it may be accurate to observe that the Legislature provided for the possibility of two distinct classes of individuals, it did not require expressly that the signer and circulator be different persons. There is no support for Whitley\u2019s contention that allowing self-circulated petitions runs contrary to the purpose of the circulator\u2019s affidavit. Rather, because the Election Law Article imposes independent penalties on individuals who commit voter fraud that are designed to shield the referendum process from consideration of petitions with insufficient signatures, we decline to adopt Whitley\u2019s hypertextual view of Article XVI, Section 4 and \u00a7 6-204 of the Election Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">We consider the constitutional and statutory provisions at issue in light of the purpose of the circulator\u2019s affidavit. As we stated previously, the circulator\u2019s affidavit assists in validation of the petition signatures by attesting to the genuine nature of an individual\u2019s signature and status as a registered voter. <em>See Fire-Rescue, </em>418 Md. at 478-80,15 A.3d at 807-08. \u201cThe purpose of the circulator\u2019s attestation is to \u2018assure the validity of the signatures and the fairness of the petition process,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting Md.Code (2002, 2010 RepLVol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-204(b)), prevent fraud in the petition process, and provide an additional guarantee of trustworthiness to the signature of the voter. <em>Id. </em>at 479, 15 A.3d 798. The language of the Constitution and the Election Law Article is consistent with this purpose. By requiring that the affidavit attest to the authenticity of the signature and the accuracy of the information required to be submitted by law, the affidavit is an independent check on the validity of the petition signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>In accordance with this overarching purpose, we consider the meaning of the specific provisions at issue. Article XVI, Section 4 prescribes \u201conly the form and contents of the affidavit to be signed by the person procuring the signatures,\u201d <em>Howard Cnty. Citizens for Open Gov\u2019t v. Howard Cnty. Bd. of Elections, </em>201 Md.App. 605, 625, 30 A.3d 245, 258-59 (2011), while the General Assembly is authorized to establish procedures to determine the authenticity of the affidavit. Md. Const, art. XVI, \u00a7 4. Although Whitley argues that Section 4 and the Election Law Article also specify the identity of the individual required to fill out the affidavit, the constitutional and statutory language contain no such specification. Indeed, the Election Law Article does not refer to the identity of the circulator, instead defining the circulator as \u201can individual who attests to one or more signatures affixed to a petition,\u201d Md.Code (2002, 2010 Repl.Vol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-101(d), limited only by the requirement that the circulator be at least eighteen years of age at the time the signatures are affixed to the petition. Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-204(c). In addition to his or her signature, the circulator must provide his or her printed or typed name, address, and telephone number to aid in the validation process. COMAR 33.06.03.07. Thus, it appears that the purpose of the affidavit is to confirm that the signature of the individual appearing on the petition in fact belongs to the person that it purports to represent.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Additionally, the General Assembly promulgated penalties designed to safeguard the integrity of the petitioning process. Most importantly, an individual who executes a fraudulent circulator\u2019s affidavit is subject to the threat of a perjury prosecution. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2002, 2010 Repl.Vol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 6 \u2014 101(b) (\u201c \u2018Affidavit\u2019 means a statement executed under penalty of perjury.\u201d); Md.Code (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.), Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 9-101(b) (\u201cA person who [commits perjury] is guilty of [a] misdemeanor ... and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding ten years.\u201d). Further, the Election Law Article provides a broad punitive scheme for individuals who attempt to commit fraud in the petitioning process, including criminal penalties for any indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>vidual who willfully and knowingly \u201csign[s] the name of any other person to a petition,\u201d \u201cfalsif[ies] any signature or purported signature to a petition,\u201d or \u201ccirculate^], cause[s] to be circulated, or flle[s] with an election authority a petition that contains any false, forged, or fictitious signatures.\u201d Md.Code (2002, 2010 Repl.Vol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 16-401. Although Whitley contends that requiring an independent signer and circulator is necessary to ensure the integrity of the petitioning process and deter fraud, he provides no persuasive evidence that the provisions adopted by the General Assembly are insufficient to accomplish that objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Whitley asks us to engage in a hypertextual analysis in which we parse the terms \u201cprocure,\u201d \u201cobserve,\u201d and \u201cpresence\u201d to imply a requirement that it takes two to tango in the completion of each signature page. This suggested approach leads us nonetheless to the conclusion that a self-circulated petition is valid. The term \u201cprocure\u201d means commonly \u201cto get or obtain; cause\u201d or \u201cto get possession of.\u201d New Websterian 1912 Dictionary 651 (1912) (\u201cto get or obtain; cause\u201d); Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 930 (10th ed.1999) (\u201cto get possession of; obtain by particular care and effort\u201d). Although one could employ the term \u201cprocure\u201d to demand the presence of more than one individual, neither the language of the constitutional provisions nor the common definition imply that the participation of two distinct individuals is necessary. Likewise, \u201cobserve\u201d means commonly \u201cto watch carefully ...\u201d or \u201cto take notice.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 802 (10th ed.1999). The Election Law Article requires the circulator\u2019s affidavit to be executed by the individual \u201cwho observed each of [the petition] signatures being affixed.\u201d Md.Code (2002, 2010 RepLVol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-204(a). Although the General Assembly could have imposed (and may yet include) an express requirement that the circulator be independent from the signer, it instead defined more forgivingly the circulator as \u201can individual who attests to one or more signatures affixed to the petition.\u201d Md.Code (2002, 2010 ReplVol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-101(d). We find it instructive that the General Assembly declined to impose an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>express requirement regarding the identity of the circulator in favor of a broader, expansive definition. Therefore, we determine that, within the context of the Election Law Article, the use of the word \u201cobserve\u201d does not require that the signer and circulator be distinct individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Nor does the requirement that the circulator\u2019s affidavit attest that the petition signatures were affixed \u201cin his presence\u201d mandate the participation of two individuals. <em>See </em>Md.

At the adoption of Article XVI, Section 4, \u201cpresence\u201d was defined commonly as \u201cthe state or quality of being present.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> New Websterian 1912 Dictionary 645 (1912); <em>see also </em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 921 (10th ed.1999) (defining \u201cpresence\u201d as \u201cthe fact or condition of being present\u201d). We cannot impute exclusively from the use of the term \u201cpresence\u201d a requirement that the signer and circulator be different individuals. To the contrary, an individual is necessarily and metaphysically in his or her own presence, and thus may attest to his or her own signature being affixed to a petition signature page \u201cin his presence,\u201d without violating the requirements of Section 4 or the Election Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">As support for his contrary contention, Whitley references the Estates &amp; Trust Article\u2019s requirement that a will must be \u201csigned by two or more credible witnesses in the presence of the testator.\u201d Md.Code (1974, 2011 RepLVol.), Estates <em>&amp; </em>Trusts Article, \u00a7 4-102. This attempted analogy is unpersuasive for two reasons. First, the signature requirement in the context of wills is necessary to provide presumptive evidence of its validity because the testator necessarily is deceased and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>unavailable to testify as to his or her recollection. <em>Van Meter v. Van Meter, </em>183 Md. 614, 618, 39 A.2d 752, 754 (1944). Second, although the underlying purpose of the signature requirement in both the wills and voter petition contexts is the prevention of fraud, <em>see Slack v. Truitt, </em>368 Md. 2, 12-13, 791 A.2d 129, 135 (2002) (noting that the presence of the signatures on a will creates a presumption of validity); Md.Code (2002, 2010 Repl.Vol.), Election Law Article, \u00a7 6-204(b), there is an additional safeguard present in the referendum context. Specifically, the requirement that the circulator\u2019s affidavit be signed under penalty of perjury, thereby subjecting the circulator to criminal penalties, provides an additional guarantee of trustworthiness that is not present in the Estates and Trusts context.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">We determine that the provisions of the Maryland Constitution and the Election Law Article are unambiguous. They do not specify the identity of the circulator, and certainly contain no requirement that the circulator and signer be separate individuals. The statutory provisions already in place are adequate to meet its uncontroverted purpose of preventing voter fraud. Whitley provides no persuasive evidence or conjecture to the contrary. Indeed, Whitley does not contend that voter fraud occurred in the instant case. Therefore, we determine that self-circulating petitions are consistent with both the letter and the spirit of the applicable constitutional and statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">BATTAGLIA, ADKINS and BARBERA, JJ\u201e dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-10\">.

The Majority holds that the provisions permit self-circulation because the language \u201cdid not require expressly that the signer and circulator be different persons.\u201d Maj. Op. at 159, 55 A.3d at 53. This reasoning, however, imports into the relevant provisions something that is not there. It takes the absence of an explicit distinction between circulator and signer and draws from it an inference of an affirmative right to self-circulate referendum petitions. The Majority is wrong to draw this inference from the statute and allow it to prevail over the plain meaning of the text. <em>See Gorman v. Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pacific Co., </em>178 Md. 71, 75, 12 A.2d 525, 527 (1940) (\u201c[T]he court may not allow an inference to prevail against the manifest intention of the Legislature.\u201d). Such a holding abandons this Court\u2019s \u201cparamount objective to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature ... [by looking] first to the plain language of the statute.\u201d <em>Schmitz, </em>362 Md. at 236-37, 764 A.2d at 842 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The Purpose of the Text</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Article XVI, \u00a7 6-204, and COMAE 33.06.03.08 obviously contemplate the involvement of two distinct individuals \u2014 a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>circulator and a signer. With this clear and unambiguous language, our inquiry would ordinarily end. <em>See Brown v. State, </em>359 Md. 180, 188, 753 A.2d 84, 88 (2000). We may, however, go on to consider the text in light of the purpose of the statute being interpreted. Specifically, the plain meaning should be construed \u201cas to carry out and effectuate, or aid in, the general purposes and policies\u201d of the statute being interpreted. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>75 Md.App. 621, 630, 542 A.2d 429, 433 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The purpose of \u00a7 6-204 of the Election Law Article, and the requirement of the circulator\u2019s affidavit contained therein, \u201cis to assure the validity of the signatures\u201d and \u201cclearly addresses prevention of fraud.\u201d <em>Montgomery County Volunteer Fire-Rescue Ass\u2019n v. Montgomery County Bd. of Elections, </em>418 Md. 463, 478-79, 15 A.3d 798, 807 (2010). Likewise, interpreting the requirement of the circulator\u2019s affidavit contained in Article XVI, \u00a7 4 of the Maryland Constitution, this Court has stated: \u201cThe purpose of the requirement of the affidavit is to give a prima facie presumption of validity to the petition to which it is attached.\u201d <em>Tyler v. Secretary of State, </em>229 Md. 397, 404, 184 A.2d 101, 104 (1962). Therefore, the purpose of the circulator\u2019s affidavit is two-fold. It is designed to prevent fraud in the first place, and second, if executed correctly, the affidavit creates a presumption that there is no fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">This two-fold purpose of the circulator affidavit supports the plain meaning interpretation that there must be two different individuals \u2014 a circulator and a signer. Interpreting the statute to require separate circulators and signers directly carries out, effectuates, and aids the \u201cuncontroverted purpose of preventing voter fraud.\u201d Maj. Op. at 163, 55 A.3d at 56. The existence of the separate circulator provides an independent check on the signer. The circulator is able to vouch that the signer did in fact appear before the circulator and did in fact sign the petition. Thus, the independent circulator prevents an individual from affixing multiple signatures to the petition, as each signer must personally appear in front of the circulator before her signature can be affixed to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The Majority does not deny that this plain meaning interpretation furthers the prevention of fraud. Instead, it says that it is not necessary to interpret the relevant provisions to further the purpose of \u00a7 6-204 because \u201cthe Election Law Article imposes independent penalties on individuals who commit voter fraud that are designed to shield the referendum process from consideration of petitions with insufficient signatures.\u201d Maj. Op. at 159, 55 A.3d at 53. Specifically, the Majority reasons that the signer of the affidavit \u201cis subject to the threat of a perjury prosecution\u201d and \u201cthe Election Law Article provides a broad punitive scheme for individuals who\u201d commit voter fraud. Maj. Op. at 160-61, 55 A.3d at 54. Thus, the Majority holds that it is not necessary to have separate circulators and signers because these other provisions are sufficient to protect against fraud. Maj. Op. at 160-61, 55 A.3d at 54-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The Majority misses the mark. It is irrelevant whether the Election Law Article has additional safeguards built in that are also designed to prevent fraud. It is the duty of this Court to interpret every provision of the statute in light of its purpose. This Court cannot pick and choose among statutory provisions and decide that the threat of a perjury conviction is a better means of preventing voter fraud than requiring the circulator and signer to be different people. The Legislature provided for both provisions, and as such, both provisions must be interpreted as a means of preventing fraud. Allowing for self-circulation does nothing to carry out, effectuate, or aid the general purpose of the statute to prevent fraud. The correct interpretation, therefore, is one that requires different circulators and signers. This gives affect to the plain meaning of \u00a7 6-204 while also furthering its purpose of preventing fraud.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>The Plain Meaning of \u201cProcure,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u201cObserve,\u201d and \u201cPresence\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In one final attempt to justify its holding, the Majority says that it would reach the same conclusion even if it decided to engage in this \u201chypertextual\u201d interpretation of the statute. Maj. Op. at 161, 55 A.3d at 54-55. It quotes dictionary definitions for the terms \u201cprocure,\u201d \u201cobserve,\u201d and \u201cpresence,\u201d and reasons that none of these definitions strictly demand the existence of two individuals. Maj. Op. at 161-63, 55 A.3d at 54-56. The Majority concludes, therefore, that the circulator and signer may be the same person because neither the Constitution nor the statute says otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The inferences that the Majority draws from these dictionary definitions, however, do not comport with the commonly understood meanings of these terms. <em>See Morris v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>319 Md. 597, 606, 573 A.2d 1346, 1350 (1990) (\u201cTo determine the most appropriate [meaning of a word] in given circumstances requires more than a glance at a dictionary. It requires careful study of the context in which the word is used.\u201d). Under the Majority\u2019s definitions, the Legislature would have intended for a circulator to procure his own signature from himself; observe himself writing his own signature; and affix his signature in his own presence. This formulation is simply not logical. No one speaks in the manner in which the Majority now attempts to define these terms. No one says that they \u201cprocure\u201d something from themself. No one says that they \u201cobserve\u201d themself perform an act. No one says that they are \u201cmetaphysically in his or her own presence.\u201d Maj. Op. at 162, 55 A.3d at 55. The definitions used by the Majority are not the commonly understood meanings of these words. We should examine the words \u201cprocure,\u201d \u201cobserve,\u201d and \u201cpresence\u201d in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\n<em>Procure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">First, the Majority defines \u201cprocure\u201d as \u201cto get or obtain\u201d or \u201cto get possession of.\u201d Maj. Op. at 161, 55 A.3d at 54-55. Contrary to the Majority\u2019s interpretation, the common meaning of this definition involves two individuals. One does not \u201cget or obtain\u201d something from herself. She gets or obtains something from someone else. Applying this common understanding of the word procure in this context, a person does not get or obtain her own signature. She procures, or gets or obtains, the signatures of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Understanding the term \u201cprocure\u201d as requiring two individuals in this context is supported by this Court\u2019s previous description of a circulator: \u201cIt is established ... that the one procuring the petitions or circulating them is the agent of the signers.... \u201d <em>Tyler, </em>229 Md. at 403, 184 A.2d at 104. Implicit in this Court\u2019s previous statement is that \u201cthe one procuring the petitions\u201d is different from \u201cthe signers\u201d of the petitions. The circulator procuring the petitions is acting as the agent for the individuals signing the petition. One does not act as an agent for herself. If she were, then she would be the principal, not the agent. An agent acts for someone else. There are two individuals: the principal and the agent. Just as in this case, there are two individuals: the circulator acting as the agent, who procures the signatures, and the signers, who are the principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\n<em>Observe</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Second, the Majority defines \u201cobserve\u201d to mean \u201cwatch carefully\u201d or \u201cto take notice.\u201d Maj. Op. at 161, 55 A.3d at 54-55. Yet, dictionaries in defining this word use examples such as: to \u201cobserve a child\u2019s behavior,\u201d American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1213 (4th ed.2006) (emphasis removed); \u201cI have observed my own children carefully,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary Unabridged 1558 (Philip Babcock Grove ed., 2002) (emphasis removed); \u201cHe observed the passerby in the street,\u201d \u201cI wanted you to observe her reaction to the judge\u2019s question,\u201d and \u201cHe observed frequently that clerks were not as courteous as they used to be,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1338 (Stuart Berg Flexuer ed., 2d ed.1987) (emphasis removed). None of these examples portray a person watching himself carefully. They portray a person watching someone else carefully. Applying this common understanding of the word observe in the context of these laws, a person does not observe himself affix his own signature. He observes, or watches carefully, someone else affix their signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Evidently, the Majority ignores this common understanding believing that the Legislature intended for the circulator to engage in some form of \u201cself-observation.\u201d I submit that nowhere in the law has the word \u201cobserve\u201d been used to mean watching oneself perform some act. Further, the Majority does not offer anywhere in the law where the word \u201cobserve\u201d means anything different than the common definitions I provide above.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\n<em>Presence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Third, the Majority defines \u201cpresence\u201d as \u201cthe state or quality of being present.\u201d Maj. Op. at 162, 55 A.3d at 55. It uses this definition to mean that one is in her own presence when she signs the circulator affidavit. It is well established, however, that this Court must construe a statute \u201cso that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.\u201d <em>Chow v. State, </em>393 Md. 431, 443, 903 A.2d 388, 395 (2006) (citations and quotation marks omitted). Allowing an individual to sign his own affidavit reads the circulator re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>quirement out of the statute. There is no longer a need for a person to circulate referendum petitions and procure signatures because now each individual can simply sign the petition and the affidavit. <em>Cf. Montgomery County Volunteer Fire-Rescue Ass\u2019n, </em>418 Md. at 484, 15 A.3d at 810 (Harrell, J., dissenting) (arguing that \u201cthe Majority opinion has read the signature requirement out of the [Election law] statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">To the contrary, dictionaries defining the term explain that a person is present by \u201c[bjeing at hand or in attendance: Thirty guests were present at the ceremony.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1388 (emphasis removed). This makes clear that a person is not present in herself. She is present in relation to someone else. As such, applying this common understanding of the word presence in this context, a person is not in her own presence when signing the petition. She is in the presence of someone else signing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Requiring a second individual in the context of referendum petitions is supported by the common understanding of the term \u201cpresence\u201d that this Court has used in other contexts. For example, the Estates and Trusts Article requires that a will should be \u201cattested and signed by two or more credible witnesses in the presence of the testator.\u201d Md.Code (2001, 2011 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 4-102 of the Estates and Trusts Article. Just like the requirement of the circulator\u2019s affidavit in this case, the purpose of attesting to the will in the presence of the testator is to prevent fraud and create a presumption of a valid will. <em>Slack v. Truitt, </em>368 Md. 2, 12-13, 17, 791 A.2d 129, 135, 138 (2002). In such cases, this Court has always understood that the witnesses and the testator must be different people, notwithstanding the fact that there is no such express distinction in the Estates and Trusts Article. The witnesses must sign in the presence of the testator and a testator cannot witness his own will.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Additionally, Maryland Rule 15-202 defines \u201cdirect contempt\u201d as \u201ca contempt committed in the presence of the judge presiding in court.\u201d Md. Rule 15-202(b). In this context, this Court has always understood that the phrase \u201cin the presence of the judge\u201d requires two individuals: the judge, in whose presence the contempt is committed, and a second individual who commits the contempt. Likewise, Maryland law allows a police officer to make an arrest without a warrant for \u201c[cjrimes committed in [the] presence of [the] police officer.\u201d Md.Code (2001, 2008 RepLVol.), \u00a7 2-202 of the Criminal Procedure Article. In this context, this Court has also always understood there to be two different individuals: the police officer, in whose presence the crime is committed, and a second individual, who commits the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The legislative language in these three examples is very similar if not identical to that found in the Election Law Article. In the current case, the circulator must attest that \u201cthe signatures were affixed in his presence.\u201d Md. Const, art. XVI, \u00a7 4. Similarly, the witnesses must sign the will \u201cin the presence of the testator,\u201d the contempt must be \u201ccommitted in the presence of the judge\u201d and the crime must be \u201ccommitted in [the] presence of [the] police officer.\u201d In all four cases the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>legislative language is nearly identical and the common understanding of all four provisions leads to the same conclusion\u2014 that the term presence contemplates the existence of two different individuals. The Majority cites no instances, and I find none in which the statutory term \u201cin the presence of\u2019 has been judicially determined to refer to only one person.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The Majority is left with only a metaphysical notion, saying that \u201can individual is necessarily and metaphysically in his or her own presence.\u201d Maj. Op. at 162, 55 A.3d at 55. Under the Majority\u2019s view, each and every circulator would be a modern day Aristotle, continuously pondering his very own existence in the world.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">I submit that the Legislature did not write these words with the intent of requiring this Court to resort to such a metaphysical interpretation. We have a duty to apply the plain meaning of the language under a common sense perspective in terms that the language is commonly understood. <em>See Huffman, </em>356 Md. at 628, 741 A.2d at 1091. The use of the term \u201cpresence\u201d in the Election Law Article is better defined using its commonly understood meaning which involves two distinct people \u2014 the circulator and the petition signer.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">I would hold, therefore, that Article XVI, \u00a7 4 of the Maryland Constitution, \u00a7 6-204 of the Election Law Article, and COMAR 33.06.03.08 do not permit the self-circulation of referendum petitions. The plain meaning of these provisions, interpreted in light of furthering the purpose of preventing fraud, contemplates the separate existence of both a circulator and a signer. The same individual cannot fulfill both requirements under the current constitutional and statutory law. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>would hold that the petition is legally insufficient for lack of the required number of valid signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Judges BATTAGLIA and BARBERA authorize me to state that they agree with the views set forth herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-8\">. As Justice Scalia explains: \u201cCourts have sometimes ignored plain meaning in astonishing ways.\u201d Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 72 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\">. A search of the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed.2006) and Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary Unabridged (Philip Babcock Grove ed., 2002) reveals that neither source contains the word \"hypertextual.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b205-5\">. The Majority\u2019s rationale against interpreting \u00a7 6-204 to further the purpose of preventing fraud is further cast into doubt by its complete failure to consider the second half of the purpose of the circulator\u2019s affidavit \u2014 the creation of a presumption of validity. Even if one were to accept that the threat of a perjury prosecution was sufficient to ignore our mandate to interpret every provision to carry out and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>effectuate its purpose, the Majority fails to consider that there is no separate provision that creates a presumption of validity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\">. To be sure, there have been, writings that have explored the psychological experiment of self observation. Perhaps the Majority has read The Fourth Way and Esoteric Christianity: An Introduction to the Teachings of G.I. Gurdjieff where the author submits that self observation requires a person to divide her attention because there is a difference between \u201cseeing a tree, and seeing yourself seeing a tree.\u201d Rebecca Nottingham, The Fourth Way and Esoteric Christianity: An Introduction to the Teachings of G.I. Gurdjieff 35 (2009). Under this form of self-observation, the field of psychology requires a person to create a \"new vantage point in addition to [her] normal awareness\u201d in order to actually observe herself. This form of self-observation is not within the common understanding of the term observe that I have described above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\">. The Majority\u2019s rejection of this analogy is mistaken. First, the Majority says that it is unpersuaded by this analogy because the purpose of the signature requirement for a will is to provide a presumption of validity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Maj. Op. at 162-63, 55 A.3d at 55-56. The Majority completely misses, however, that the purpose of the circulator's affidavit is also to provide a presumption of validity. <em>Tyler v. Secretary of State, </em>229 Md. 397, 404, 184 A.2d 101, 104 (1962). As such, the fact that both the signature of the witness and the circulator's affidavit serve the exact same purpose makes this analogy more persuasive, not less.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Second, the Majority argues that this analogy is unpersuasive because the Election Law Article contains additional safeguards against fraud, whereas the Estates and Trusts Article does not. Maj. Op. at 162-63, 55 A.3d at 55-56. As previously explained, this argument completely misses the mark. The existence of additional safeguards in the Election Law Article is completely irrelevant to this case. The Legislature felt it necessary to provide for multiple provisions to aid in the prevention of fraud. This Court cannot choose which provisions it likes the best or which provisions it believes would be most effective in preventing fraud. Indeed, it may have been wise for the Legislature to provide multiple safeguards to prevent fraud since no one method is perfect. As such, it is improper for the Majority to disregard the purpose of the circulator\u2019s affidavit to prevent fraud merely because the threat of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>perjury conviction also exists. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 162-63, 55 A.3d at 55-56.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b211-9\">.
