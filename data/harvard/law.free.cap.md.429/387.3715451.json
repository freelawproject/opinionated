We also review the rare situation when a trial court has permitted a litigant to discover and introduce into evidence communications between an opposing party and its attorneys, based on an implied waiver of the attorney-client privilege via testimony. Finally, we answer four other issues raised by the parties relating to this urban real estate development that failed to come to fruition.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>The owners of two adjoining properties leased them to developer-tenants for the purpose of building an apartment building on each. As construction was beginning, the landlords breached the ground leases by refusing to provide estoppel certificates and contesting the tenants\u2019 building permits. The landlords\u2019 breach prevented the tenants from obtaining financing, which ended the development project. The tenants sued for lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In discovery, the landlords admitted to breaching but refused to explain why they had breached, stating simply that they had relied on the advice of counsel. Before trial, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County ruled against the landlords on several motions, holding that (1) the tenants could discover and introduce evidence of the landlords\u2019 reasons for breaching, including communications with their former counsel, (2) the landlords could not introduce evidence of the 2008 crash in the real estate market to show that the tenants would not have made profits, and (3) the landlords could not argue or present evidence that the tenants, having planned to create a shell company to operate the apartment buildings, were not the real party in interest. The jury awarded the tenants over $36 million in damages, holding the landlords jointly and severally liable. The trial court also awarded joint and several attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The landlords appealed, contesting the issues mentioned above, as well as whether joint and several liability was proper. The Court of Special Appeals held that the landlords could not be held jointly and severally liable for damages but otherwise affirmed. Both parties petitioned for <em>certiorari. </em>For the reasons explained below, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Facts and Legal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">On June 16, 2004, Respondents/Cross-Petitioners RSC Tower I, LLC and RSC Tower II, LLC (\u201cTenants\u201d) entered into separate ground leases to develop adjoining properties in Rock Spring Park in Montgomery County, Maryland. The owners of the properties, Camalier L.P. and Davis Brothers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Montgomery Farm L.P. (\u201cLandlords\u201d), signed the ground leases. The ground leases provided that Tenants \u2014 corporate entities formed by Penrose development company for the purpose of developing the two parcels \u2014 -would build \u201chigh rise multifamily apartment project[s]\u201d on each parcel as part of a common plan. Specifically, RSC Tower I, LLC agreed to build \u201cTower I\u201d on Parcel 20, with construction to start no later than July 15, 2004. RSC Tower II, LLC agreed to build \u201cTower II\u201d on Parcel 21, with construction to start no later than July 1, 2009.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each tower was to contain approximately 350 units.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The plan for the two properties changed later in 2004, when Tenants and Landlords discussed building instead condominium units, a hotel, and a spa resort. The developer for this new project was to be Canyon Ranch, an outside development company. On March 3, 2005, Tenants obtained approval of the site plan amendment for the new project from the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d). Additionally, because Maryland law prohibits developing residential condominiums on leasehold estates,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on September 13, 2005 Landlords agreed to sell the parcels to Tenants, modifying the ground leases accordingly and entering into sales contracts to convey the land. As a preliminary step to selling the properties, Landlords assigned their interests in the ground leases to Petitioners/Cross-Respondents CR-RSC Tower I, LLC, Second CR-RSC Tower I, LLC, CR-RSC Tower II, LLC, and Second CR-RSC Tower II, LLC, four corporate entities wholly owned by the owners of the properties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Yet on August 28, 2006, Tenants reverted to the original plan to build the apartment towers, -filing another site plan amendment with the Commission. Tenants returned to the original plan because Canyon Ranch withdrew from the project, citing what it called \u201cthe overall slow down in the condominium marketplace\u201d and \u201csome missteps during the development project.\u201d A power struggle ensued, with Landlords asserting that they had the \u201csole authority\u201d to determine whether to return to the apartment plan or to proceed with the condominium plan. Nevertheless, the Commission approved the site plan amendment. Landlords then instituted administrative actions contesting the Commission\u2019s approval of the site plan amendments as well as the decision of the Montgomery County Department of Permitting Services (\u201cDPS\u201d) to issue a building permit for Tower I.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Tenants moved forward with the apartment project, entering into a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) with Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company (\u201cNML\u201d) under which NML agreed to provide an $85 million construction loan and purchase $30.1 million in equity in the apartment towers. To finalize the financing agreement, in October 2006 Tenants requested that Landlords execute estoppel certificates, as called for by the ground leases. In simple terms, the estoppel certificates would certify that Tenants were in compliance with all terms of the lease. There was some back and forth about the terms of the estoppel certificates, and when Landlords still had not signed them by October 26, 2006, Tenants threatened to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">On November 3, 2006, Landlords wrote to Tenants, attaching draft estoppel certificates with several reservations. In those certificates, Landlords asserted that Tenants were in breach of the ground leases. When Tenants showed the certificates to NML, it said the certificates were not sufficient to finalize the financing agreement because Landlords said that Tenants were in breach. Tenants then filed a declaratory action against Landlords in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>While the lawsuit was pending, Tenants continued negotiating with NML, ultimately agreeing to a financing arrangement under which Tenants would assign their interest in Tower I to a separate corporate entity, Sorrento, which would be owned by NML and Tenants as \u201c90/10 partners.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plans further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\">Cash flow will be split 90/10 [until] both parties earn a 10% cumulative preferred return. Thereafter, cash flow will be split 60% to [NML] and 40% to [Tenants].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">These plans were reflected in Tenants\u2019 formal application for financing on December 8, 2006. In anticipation of the financing agreement, both NML and Tenants prepared <em>pro formas </em>projecting the towers\u2019 expected profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">On April 4, 2007, the Circuit Court entered summary judgment in Tenants\u2019 favor, finding that Landlords had breached the ground leases by failing to provide the requested estoppel certificates and pursuing administrative actions against the site plan amendments and building permits. The Circuit Court ordered Landlords to execute the requested estoppel certificates within three days and dismiss the administrative actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Landlords appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals stayed the order to dismiss the administrative actions. Landlords signed the estoppel certificates but attached cover letters expressly reserving \u201call claims asserted in the pending litigation\u201d and \u201call claims regarding the existence of any default, event, or condition that was not addressed by the Court in its Order, the final adjudication of which may [cause] any of the certifications contained in the Estoppel Certificates to be inaccurate.\u201d Of course, these reservations caused NML to reject the estoppel certificates, and the financing deal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>remained stalled. The Court of Special Appeals ultimately affirmed the order to dismiss the administrative actions, which Landlords did on September 8, 2008. This appellate decision, though, is not what we review today. We review issues arising in a second suit brought by Tenants against Landlords.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In September 2008, when the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision came down, the previous financing arrangement with NML was no longer available, and the building permits had expired. Thus, instead of attempting to move forward with the project,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Tenants filed their second lawsuit on March 3, 2009, seeking damages from Landlords in the amount of $30 million.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An amended complaint filed on October 29, 2009, increased the demand to $50 million and alleged that Landlords had acted in bad faith and committed a \u201csuccession of breaches\u201d following the initial refusal to sign the estoppel certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In discovery, Tenants questioned Landlords about their reasons for refusing to sign the estoppel certificates and instituting the administrative actions. Landlords\u2019 responses almost uniformly pointed to conversations with counsel as the reason for their actions. Accordingly, Tenants filed a motion to compel discovery from Landlords\u2019 former counsel, Hogan &amp; Hartson, which Landlords opposed. The trial court ruled in Tenants\u2019 favor, ordering discovery from Hogan &amp; Hartson regarding Landlords\u2019 reasons for breaching. In discovery, Tenants obtained an email from Davis Camalier, one of Landlords, in which he instructed the lawyers: \u201cJust make sure you stop the bastards Whichever way you choose to go. We need some leverage!.]\u201d Some might say this was the \u201csmoking gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>On the first day of trial, the trial court ruled on several pretrial motions. It reserved ruling on Landlords\u2019 motion to exclude evidence of \u201cmotivations that led to the breach of the Ground Leases, and ... communications \"with former counsel Hogan &amp; Hartson,\u201d opting to wait \u201cand see how that played out[,] ... if it was going to be used as a defense ... [, and not] mention it in opening statement.\u201d Significantly, the court granted Tenants\u2019 motion to exclude evidence or argument relating to \u201cpost-breach market conditions for the purpose of seeking to prove that [Tenants] have no damages or lesser damages than claimed.\u201d This had the effect of preventing Landlords from presenting evidence or pursuing cross-examination regarding the post-breach decline in the real estate market.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The trial occurred between March 1 and March 11, 2010. On the first day of trial, Tenants filed a second amended complaint that alleged a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; raised the demand for damages; and added, as an alternative to the lost profits claim, $23 million in reliance damages. The second amended complaint also alleged that each Tenant was a third-party beneficiary of the other\u2019s ground lease, making Landlords jointly and severally liable for all damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Tenants presented the expert testimony of Wiley Wright, who used the <em>pro formas </em>prepared by NML and Tenants in advance of their financing agreement to estimate the amount of profits that the towers would have made. Expert William Foote also calculated the money spent by Tenants in reliance on the contracts. The \u201cbastards\u201d email was introduced into evidence as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The verdict was large. The jury awarded damages of $36,350,239 against Landlords, jointly and severally, and did not specify whether the damages were lost profits or reliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>damages. The trial court also awarded joint and several attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $3,654,683 against Landlords.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The dispute then took its second trip to Annapolis, with Landlords\u2019 appeal. The Court of Special Appeals issued a published opinion reversing the joint and several nature of the damages award but otherwise affirming. <em>See CR-RSC Tower I, LLC v. RSC Tower I, LLC, </em>202 Md.App. 307, 32 A.3d 456 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Questions Presented</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">Landlords petitioned for <em>certiorari, </em>asking:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">1. Under what circumstances should a Court permit (or require) evidence of post-breach market conditions affecting a claim for lost profits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">2. Where a plaintiff seeks reliance damages as an alternative to proving lost profits, is a defendant entitled to present evidence that the plaintiff would never have recouped its investment in a business venture?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">3. Does a defendant, in denying a plaintiff\u2019s charge of bad faith, waive the attorney-client privilege as to communications relevant to the subject-matter of the claim of bad faith?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">4. Where two defendants are not jointly and severally liable on separate contracts, may a court award the related attorneys\u2019 fees on a joint and several basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-12\">5. Under what circumstances can a plaintiff recover lost profits that, had a transaction proceeded as planned, would have belonged to a non-party entity?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-13\">Tenants filed a cross-petition for <em>certiorari, </em>asking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-14\">May [Landlords] be found jointly and severally liable for their joint effort to derail an integrated real estate development project on adjoining parcels of land, where they breached identical covenants in two related ground leases, and the jury found that each [Landlord] breached covenants running with the land to implement a uniform plan of development for each [Landlord\u2019s] benefit?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">We granted <em>certiorari </em>on February 8, 2012, <em>CR-RSC Tower v. RSC Tower, </em>424 Md. 628, 37 A.3d 317 (2012) as to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>questions, and shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Post-Breach Market Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Landlords sought to show that Tenants would have made no profits, regardless of whether there was a breach. They offered expert testimony about the real estate market crisis in 2008-2010, when, as phrased by counsel, \u201cthe world has changed\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, \u201cthe cataclysmic events of 2008 in the economy\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> took place. In granting Tenants\u2019 Motion in Limine, the trial court ruled that Landlords could not present evidence of \u201cpost-breach market conditions,\u201d such as the unusually severe drop in the real estate market in 2008, and the market\u2019s static nature in 2010 at the time of trial. The Order stated that designated defense experts were not permitted to opine that \u201cKey Assumptions\u201d made by Tenants\u2019 expert Wright, who testified about pro forma projections made in 2006, were \u201cunreasonable under current market conditions.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, citing the \u201cgeneral principle\u201d that contract damages are measured at the time of breach. <em>CR-RSC, </em>202 Md.App. at 344, 32 A.3d at 478. The court held that this rule applied to both collateral and direct lost profits. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Landlords argue that this ruling was in error, because evidence of the post-breach market is a necessary part of any lost profits claim. Without such evidence, they say, a plaintiff cannot meet the requirement that lost profits be proved with \u201creasonable certainty.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They assert that their proffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>evidence of post-breach market conditions would have showed that the towers never would have made a profit. Thus, Landlords contend not only that the trial court erred by excluding such evidence, but also that Tenants\u2019 lost profits claim fails as a matter of law for lack of post-breach evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Tenants respond generally that evidence of post-breach market conditions not contemplated by the parties is irrelevant and inadmissible to prove lost profits, and that reasonable projections made during the contract are sufficient to sustain the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The decision whether to allow or preclude the admission of evidence is generally committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Md., Inc. v. Gasper, </em>418 Md. 594, 619-20, 17 A.3d 676, 690-91 (2011). We will only find an abuse of such discretion \u201cwhere no reasonable person would share the view taken by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Consol. Waste Indus, v. Standard Equip. Co., </em>421 Md. 210, 219, 26 A.3d 352 (2011) (quoting <em>Brown v. Daniel Realty Co., </em>409 Md. 565, 601, 976 A.2d 300, 321 (2009) (quotation marks omitted)). We review for clear error \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s factual finding that an item of evidence does or does not have \u2018probative value,\u2019 \u201d but we review de novo \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s conclusion of law that the evidence at issue is or is not \u2018of consequence to the determination of the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gasper, </em>418 Md. at 620, 17 A.3d at 691 (citation omitted). Thus, we examine the law of contracts and how to prove damages from a breach in order to determine whether the trial court erred in excluding Landlords\u2019 proffered evidence about the post-crash real estate market.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>We observe at the outset that the parties\u2019 phrasing of the lost profits issue is imprecise. Both parties offered evidence of \u201cpost-breach market conditions,\u201d in the sense that each sought to introduce evidence relating to 2009 and 2010. The difference is that Tenants\u2019 market evidence as to 2009 and 2010 consisted of projections made during the pre-breach life of the contract, by them and NML while negotiating the financing agreement, and Landlords\u2019 market evidence consisted of analyses made for trial based <em>only </em>on conditions current at trial. Landlords argue that post-breach market evidence is necessary to prove lost profits. Yet the 2010 market evidence they proffered, as the attorneys agreed, reflected a \u201ccataclysmic change\u201d from what was contemplated in 2006. This distinction, as we shall explain, is key to determining whether Landlords\u2019 market evidence was relevant to, or necessary for, proving Tenants\u2019 lost profits claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\n<em>General v. Consequential Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">As we said in <em>David Sloane, Inc. v. Stanley G. House &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>a party injured by a breach of contract has a right to damages based on his expectation interest as measured by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">(a) the loss in the value to him of the other party\u2019s performance caused by its failure or deficiency, plus</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">(b) any other loss, including incidental or consequential loss, caused by the breach, less</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">(c) any cost or other loss that he has avoided by not having to perform.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">311 Md. 36, 42, 532 A.2d 694, 697 (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 347 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">Damages are calculated differently depending on which category the claim is in \u2014 whether it is for the \u201cvalue of the other party\u2019s performance\u201d or a \u201cconsequential loss\u201d following from the breach. As we recently said in <em>Burson v. Simard, </em>when the claim is based on value, it is a \u201cgeneral damages\u201d claim, calculated as \u201cthe difference between the contract price and the fair market value at the time of breach.\u201d 424 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>318, 327-28, 35 A.3d 1154, <em>1159 (2012) </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted). However, when the claim is for \u201cconsequential loss,\u201d it is a \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cconsequential\u201d damages claim, calculated as losses that \u201cmay reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time of making of the contract.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 327, 35 A.3d at 1159 (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">There is some uncertainty over which category applies to lost profits claims. As Professor Dobbs explains, this is because the word \u201cprofit\u201d can refer either to business profits or the increase in value of an item. <em>See </em>3 Dan B. Dobbs, <em>Law of Remedies </em>\u00a7 12.4(3) (2d ed.1993). In the former instance, when lost profits are claimed for lost income from business operations that would have been made but for the breach, the claim is for \u201cconsequential\u201d or \u201cspecial\u201d damages. <em>Id; see also E. River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval, </em>476 U.S. 858, 874, 106 S.Ct. 2295, 2303-04, 90 L.Ed.2d 865 (1986) (lost profits claim for income that could have been earned but for a breach of warranty by a manufacturer who installed defective turbines on plaintiffs\u2019 ships was for consequential damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In the latter instance when the lost profits claim is based on the value of the item promised, the claim is for \u201cgeneral damages,\u201d as the damages are \u201cthe difference between the contract price and the fair market value at the time of breach.\u201d <em>Burson, </em>424 Md. at 327-28, 35 A.3d at 1159 (citation and quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12.2(3) (lost profits are general damages when they are for \u201cthe market value of the very thing promised\u201d); 11 <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 56.19 (Rev.ed.2005) (lost profits based on the resale of a promised car can be proved by looking to \u201cthe excess of this market price over the contract price\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In such cases, as with all general damages claims, the market value of the item is determined at the time of breach. The cases cited by Tenants support this rule. <em>See, e.g., Charles County Broad. Co., Inc. v. Meares, </em>270 Md. 321, 332, 311 A.2d 27, 34 (1973) (\u201c[I]n breach of a contract to sell, damages are based on value at the time the transfer was to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>made.... \u201d); <em>Kasten Constr. Co. v. Jolles, </em>262 Md. 527, 531, 278 A.2d 48, 51 (1971) (\u201cIn general, the measure of damages when a vendee breaches a contract to purchase real estate is the difference between the contract price and the fair market value at the time of breach.\u201d); Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12.2(3) (\u201cGeneral damages ... [i]n a contract for the sale and purchase of property or goods ... is the difference between contract price and market price on the date when performance was due.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Landlords challenge Tenants\u2019 \u201ctime of breach\u201d theory, pointing out that many of the cases cited by Tenants did not involve lost profits at all. <em>See, e.g., Beard v. S/E Joint Venture, </em>321 Md. 126, 147-48, 581 A.2d 1275, 1285-86 (1990); <em>Charles County Broad. Co., </em>270 Md. at 332-33, 311 A.2d at 34; <em>Kasten Constr. Co., </em>262 Md. at 531, 278 A.2d at 51; <em>Marshall v. Haney, </em>9 Gill 251, 260 (Md.1851); <em>Cannell v. M\u2019Clean, </em>6 H. &amp; J. 297, 301-02 (Md.1825). Thus, Landlords argue, these cases do not support Tenants\u2019 position that the \u201ctime of breach\u201d rule applies to consequential lost profits.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Tenants would have us apply this \u201ctime of breach\u201d rule across the board, to every kind of damages claim. Yet as Corbin explains, there cannot be one rule for every kind of breach, because different kinds of damages require different kinds of calculations. <em>See Corbin, supra, </em>\u00a7 55.11 (\u201cThere are many rules of damages for particular kinds of contracts, such as contracts for the sale of goods, construction contracts, employment contracts, etc.\u201d (footnotes omitted)); <em>see also Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. R. Co., </em>333 F.2d 705, 708 (7th Cir.1964) (\u201cSince the market value rule is merely a method, it is not applied in cases where it is demonstrated that another rule will better compute actual damages.\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, we cannot take for granted that the \u201ctime of breach\u201d rule applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\n<em>Applying The Time of Breach Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Some of the cases cited by Tenants make this distinction very clear, explaining that the \u201ctime of breach\u201d rule applies only to lost profits as general damages. <em>See, e.g., Anchor Sav. Bank, FSB v. United States, </em>597 F.3d 1356, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2010) (\u201c[T]he rule favoring the measurement of damages as of the time of the breach \u2018does not apply ... to anticipated profits or to other expectancy damages that, absent the breach, would have accrued on an ongoing basis over the course of the contract.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Sharma v. Skaarup Ship Mgmt. Corp., </em>916 F.2d 820, 825-26 (2d Cir.1990) (\u201cIt is ... fundamental that, where the breach involves the deprivation of an item with a determinable market value, the-market value at the time of the breach is the measure of damages.. However, [when the things promised] did not have a market value and were not replaceable[, l]ost profits were therefore the best measure of the loss.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>see also Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>500 F.2d 659, 668 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The distinction between general damages and consequential damages is present in the secondary literature as well. <em>See </em>Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12.4(4) (explaining that the time of breach rule applies to general damages but not special or consequential damages); <em>Corbin, supra, </em>\u00a7 60.12 (\u201c[G]eneral damages are the full contract price minus the market value of the land at date of breach and also minus any payment received. Costs of making a resale may be allowed as consequential or incidental damages. If foreseeable, other consequential damages are available.\u201d (citing <em>Kasten, </em>262 Md. at 530-31, 278 A.2d at 51)); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 60.11 (measuring damages \u201cby the value of land at the time it should have been paid,\u201d whereas \u201cconsequential damages\u201d are separate and extra). We think it clear, therefore, that the \u201ctime of breach\u201d rule cannot be blithely applied to lost profits cases involving a business\u2019s anticipated income. The nature of the evidence offered to prove lost profits must be examined carefully.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Here, the evidence of damages reveals that although Tenants\u2019 expert, Mr. Wright spoke about \u201clost profits,\u201d he also sought to establish how to value the ground lease that Landlords\u2019 refused to perform. <em>See </em>Dobbs, \u00a7 12.4(3) at 76. (\u201cLost profits are normally consequential damages. But in some instances lost profits may resemble general damages because they furnish evidence about the value of the defendant\u2019s performance.\u201d). Indeed, Mr. Wright testified about market value of the ground lease, and lost profits in one unified approach. He explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">In the real estate industry for an income-producing piece of property, the market determines what will be paid for that income-generated piece of property by what\u2019s known as a \u2018capitalization approach.\u2019 And what that capitalization approach does, is it takes the net operating income for the piece of property when it\u2019s stabilized ... divides it by what\u2019s known as capitalization rate, and that\u2019s a market determined rate, and it\u2019s the commonly-used methodology for determining market value for an income-producing piece of property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Using pro forma projections made in 2006 by Tenants and their lender and applying the capitalization formula, he estimated income from rentals for both towers, and subtracted total costs to build the towers, as well as ground rents payable to Landlords. He then discounted that figure to present value by using a 6-percent capitalization rate for Tower I and a 6.5-percent capitalization rate for Tower II to arrive at a total lost revenue for each tower. With Wright\u2019s damages testimony, lost profits for a 10-year period might be seen as congruent with the value (to Tenants) of the ground lease that Landlords breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Dobbs explains in \u00a7 12.4(3) general damages with this example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">[Suppose] the defendant breaches a contract to sell land or a business to the plaintiff. A parcel of land or a business which can produce $100,000 in annual profits will have a greater market value than a parcel or a business which can produce only $10,000 in annual profits. So the plaintiff might attempt to prove the value of the land or the business by proving the profits it could earn. Coupled with evidence about the ratio between value and profits for the particular kind of enterprise, it would be possible to back-construct the value of the defendant\u2019s promised performance. Once value is determined the ordinary contract-market value measure could be used to figure general damages. The damages are general damages in such a case because they are based on the value of the very performance promised by the defendant (land or business) and not on some secondary good derived from that performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-6\"><em>Id. </em>Dobbs uses the following example of consequential damages as a contrast with general damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">[Suppose] the defendant breaches a contract to supply paint to a painting contractor. The contractor cannot find substitute paint quickly and he suffers two losses: (a) he loses a contract job on which he would have made profits; and (b) his reputation suffers so that he loses future profits on customers he would have enlisted but for his reputation as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>painter who falls behind schedule. Although the second kind of claim may be identified as a loss of good will, both kinds of claims are for lost profits and both represent consequential damages[.] The damages are consequential because they are not based on the market value of the very thing promised (the paint).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In one sense the damages proof in this case is more like the first example above. Yet, arguably these damages are unlike breach of sale of land or business in that example because Tenants were required to take necessary steps to develop the property in order to realize the profits Mr. Wright estimated. This was a complex undertaking requiring Tenants\u2019 expertise as developers. For this reason, it is difficult to say that the testimony reflected that the ground lease itself was equal in value to the 10-year income stream. We conclude, therefore, that the damages proved by Tenants should not be strictly categorized either as general or consequential. Accordingly, rather than stop our analysis with the conclusion that these are general damages, measurable only at breach, we will address further arguments made by Landlords, which are premised on their theory that these are consequential damages, measurable at a later day.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\n<em>Post-Breach Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Landlords continue to vigorously argue that the trial court erred in refusing admission of their expert\u2019s testimony about the condition of the real estate market in 2010. They cite cases purportedly demonstrating that Maryland courts have always looked to post-breach market evidence to determine whether a lost profits claim has been proved with \u201creasonable certainty.\u201d Yet a close examination of those cases shows that they do not stand for Landlords\u2019 asserted rule. For example, in <em>Lanahan v. Heaver, </em>we commented that the plaintiffs unbuilt houses seemed not to be in demand given that \u201cthirteen of those actually built remain unsold[.]\u201d 79 Md. 413, 422-23, 29 A. 1036, 1038-39 (1894). Yet this was not why we held that the plaintiffs lost profits claim failed for lack of certainty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>As we explained, the lost profits claim failed because there was simply \u201cno evidence in the record of what the market value of such houses would have been.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420, 29 A. at 1038.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Here, of course, we have the opposite problem: the parties proffered competing measures of the relevant market, and we must decide which is the proper measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Landlords\u2019 other cases are similarly unhelpful. For example, in <em>Macke Co. v. Pizza of Gaithersburg, Inc., </em>we remanded to the trial court to calculate lost profits, speculating that if the plaintiff had found a substitute for the defendant\u2019s promised machines, then \u201ca more appropriate measure of damages might be that grounded on the [plaintiffs] actual experience for the period [contemplated by the contract], rather than one based on extrapolating profits from the results experienced [previously].\u201d 259 Md. 479, 492, 270 A.2d 645, 652 (1970). Landlords assert that this language directs courts to look to post-breach market evidence to determine the amount of profits a plaintiff would have made. Yet as Tenants point out, <em>Macke </em>did not involve \u201cmarket evidence\u201d at all, but instead referred to the plaintiffs \u201cactual experience\u201d with substitute performance during the period when the profits would have been made. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We agree with Tenants that the best reading of <em>Macke </em>is simply that a plaintiffs actual experience with substitute performance is relevant to determining lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>profits. Of course, Tenants could not seek substitute performance here, as no one other than Landlords could produce the estoppel certificates respecting the ground leases.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Moreover, in <em>M &amp; R Contractors &amp; Builders, Inc. v. Michael, </em>we were not even calculating the amount of lost profits when we mentioned substitute performance. Rather, we were discussing whether the plaintiff builder\u2019s substitute performance would count as mitigation against his lost profits. We held that it would not unless the plaintiffs contract with the defendant \u201cwas such as to require [his] entire time and attention so that their breach made it possible for the builder to undertake another project[.]\u201d 215 Md. 340, 356, 138 A.2d 350, 359 (1958). This was the context in which we said, \u201cthe actual gain made under the substituted contract must be considered in measuring the damages to which the builder is entitled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We were not even discussing the measure of lost profits, let alone \u201cpost-breach market conditions.\u201d Finally, <em>Republic Ins. Co. v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>the last case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>cited by Landlords, did not involve lost profits, and its statement about measuring damages \u201cas of the date of the breach\u201d referred to \u201cfluctuations in value,\u201d not market conditions. 92 Md.App. 528, 533, 608 A.2d 1301, 1304 (1992) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Thus, none of Landlords\u2019 Maryland cases directly support admitting post-breach market evidence to prove lost profits.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Indeed, we know of no Maryland cases in which such evidence was admitted for that purpose,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and out-of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>state cases provide no general rule either.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, we find no support for Landlords\u2019 claim that any and all post-breach evidence is admissible as a necessary part of any consequential lost profits claim. In our view, the question of time is not key. Rather, as we shall explain, the core question for consequential damages is whether they were in the contemplation of the parties when they contracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\n<em>The Contemplation of the Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A8q\">As Professor Corbin explains, consequential lost profits \u201cmay be regarded as too remote or too speculative ... [but] will not be so regarded if the defendant had reason to foresee them.\u201d <em>Corbin, supra, </em>\u00a7 56.19 (footnotes omitted). Professor Dobbs agrees that foreseeability is the key, because, under <em>Hadley v. Baxendale, </em>9 Ex. 341, 156 Eng. Rep. 145, 151 (1854), the \u201ccontemplation of the parties\u201d at the \u201ctime of contracting governs\u201d consequential damages. As he says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6f\">Both the moral and economic rationales for <em>Hadley v. Baxendale </em>suggest that the relevant time for determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>the \u201ccontemplation of the parties\u201d is the time of contracting, not, for example, the time of breach. If the point is to let the parties prescribe their own liabilities, the time of contracting must control, and that is in fact the rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\"><em>Dobbs, supra, </em>\u00a7 12.4(7) (citing <em>Hadley, </em>156 Eng. Rep. at 151 (consequential damages are \u201csuch as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Likewise, Professor Sutherland explains that consequential damages are determined by looking to what the parties can be said to have planned and assumed when they contracted. As he says, consequential damages are \u201csuch as ordinarily arise according to the intrinsic nature of the contract and the surrounding facts and circumstances made known to the parties at the making of it.\u201d J.G. Sutherland, <em>A Treatise on the Law of Damages </em>\u00a7 51 (John R. Berryman, ed., 4th ed.1916) (emphasis added). These passages instruct us that consequential lost profits are calculated with reference to what the parties can reasonably be said to have anticipated when they entered into the contract. Thus, circumstances that cannot be said to have been \u201cknown to the parties\u201d when they contracted \u2014 such as a post-breach boom or bust in the market \u2014 should not affect the measure of consequential damages that would \u201cordinarily arise\u201d according to the \u201cintrinsic nature of the contract.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>To be sure, the <em>Hadley </em>foreseeability rule originated as a limit on damages and has been most often applied that way. But courts have also applied the rule positively, using it to justify damages because they were foreseeable or would ordinarily occur under the circumstances. <em>See Dobbs, </em>\u00a7 12.4(1) (\u201c[Tjhere is no reason to deny consequential damages if the limiting rules are met.\u201d); <em>Anchor Sav. Bank, </em>597 F.3d at 1369-70 (evidence of future lost profits that could have been derived from the lost income-producing asset <em>admissible); Midland Hotel Corp. v. Reuben H. Donnelley Corp., </em>118 Ill.2d 306, 113 Ill.Dec. 252, 515 N.E.2d 61, 67-68 (1987); <em>Welch v. U.S. Bancorp Realty &amp; Mortgage Trust, </em>286 Or. 673, 596 P.2d 947, 963 (1979); <em>AM/PM Franchise Ass\u2019n v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>526 Pa. 110, 584 A.2d 915, 921 (1990) (treating \u201creason to know\u201d test as equivalent to \u201cforeseeable.\u201d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The dispositive questions, therefore, are (1) whether, at the time they entered into contract, it was foreseeable to the parties that a breach of contract might result in the termination of the real estate development project for which the land was being leased and, if so, (2) whether the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that post-breach market data was irrelevant in determining the expected value of performance as of the time of breach. Thus, evidence of post-breach booms and busts is not relevant \u2014 and thus not admissible\u2014 when it cannot be said that the parties foresaw it.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Of course, many contracts are made with the possibility of a future market downturn in mind \u2014 for example, contracts for delivery or sale of goods.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Indeed, such contracts are often made with the purpose of allocating the risk of future market swings between the parties.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> But when both parties\u2019 success depends on a relatively stable market, it cannot be said that a subsequent, unforeseen market crash was within the parties\u2019 contemplation, at least not without any evidence to suggest that it was.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Such is the case here, as both Landlords and Tenants were relying on the success of the towers. Indeed, the ground leases provided for Landlords\u2019 rental income to more than double following construction of the towers, from $64,734.58 prior to construction<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> to $130,260.83 following full construction,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> with further increases thereafter based on the \u201cfair rental value\u201d of the premises. Thus, Landlords\u2019 income from the leases was dependent on Tenants\u2019 success in constructing and running the towers.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Testimony about the income projections produced by Tenants revealed that, by use of capitalization rates,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Tenant and NML took into account the normally expected risk of vacancy in the apartments.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> With no suggestion that the market swing described by Landlords as \u201ccataclysmic\u201d was contemplated,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> we cannot say that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the trial court erred in excluding all evidence of it. We bear in mind, in reaching this conclusion, that a trial court\u2019s rulings on the admission of evidence are discretionary, so long as the correct rule of law is applied. <em>See Gasper, </em>418 Md. at 619-20, 17 A.3d at 690-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Our conclusion is reinforced when we consider that market projections of Tenants and NML made in furtherance of the contract were not contradicted by Landlords. Rather, they declined to produce any projections of future profits based on conditions during the contract. Landlords must have made their own market projections in anticipation of the ground leases, given that their expected revenue was just as dependent upon the rental market as that of Tenants. But, despite clear and repeated rulings by the trial court against use of post-breach market evidence for 2009 or 2010, Landlords declined to offer any evidence of market projections made during the 2006-2007 time period. Indeed, at oral argument, when asked by Judge Battaglia why they failed to introduce such evidence, in the face of the trial court\u2019s rulings, Landlords simply reiterated their belief that 2009-2010 evidence should have been admitted.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Landlords\u2019 view of the market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>as of the time of contracting would certainly have been relevant, but as they clarified in their opposition to Tenants\u2019 motion to exclude post-breach evidence, their proffered experts were prepared to testify only as to \u201cwhat the market actually is/was at the time the Project would have been available for rent\u201d to show that Tenants\u2019 \u201cearlier projections ... have now \u2014 given the downturn of the real estate market-proven to be unrealistic.\u201d They reiterated at the hearing on the motion that their experts were going to testify as to \u201chow the market performed after time, over time ... [wjhen the towers would have been delivered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Thus, Landlords failed to contradict Tenants\u2019 view of the parties\u2019 expectations for profit at the time of contracting. They did not offer evidence of their own market projections, and did not point to any market indicators<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> that may have made the crash objectively foreseeable. Without anything to contradict the projections put forth by Tenants, the trial court was acting reasonably when it concluded that the crash was not within the parties\u2019 contemplation.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>See Prod. Credit, </em>989 F.2d at 418 (market decline unforeseen where \u201cthe parties never addressed the possibility\u201d); <em>W.A.

Some of our consequential lost profits cases, while not explicitly addressing which market projections were relevant, appear to adhere to the principle that the parties\u2019 contemplation controls. For example, in <em>Automatic Retailers of Am., Inc. v. Evans Cigarette Serv. Co., </em>we affirmed a lost profits award, refusing to consider post-breach circumstances that \u201cmight have changed\u201d the amount, instead holding that the plaintiffs \u201clong history\u201d in the business was sufficient evidence of the profits that it would have made \u201cfor its services during the applicable period.\u201d 269 Md. 101, 109-10, 304 A.2d 581, 586 (1973); <em>see also Sumwalt Ice &amp; Coal Co. v. Knickerbocker Ice Co., </em>114 Md. 403, 417, 80 A. 48, 51 (1911) (holding that \u201cdeclarations ... made more than six months or a year after the commission of the wrong complained of, were too remote and were properly excluded\u201d); <em>U.S. Tel.

Gildersleve, </em>29 Md. 232, 250 (1868) (\u201c[I]f the special circumstances under which the contract was actually made, were communicated by the plaintiff to the defendant, and thus known to both parties, the damages resulting from the breach of such a contract which they would reasonably contemplate, would be the amount of injury which would ordinarily follow from a breach of a contract under these special circumstances so known and communicated.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Landlords contend that looking only to the parties\u2019 expectations at the time of contracting creates a windfall for Tenants by \u201cawarding] damages based upon a fictional market, which was far sunnier than the real market into which each Tenant would have delivered its product.\u201d Tenants respond that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>appearance of a windfall in this case is \u201cillusory,\u201d as a drastic change in the market post-breach will cause one party more harm than the other \u201cno matter which standard is chosen.\u201d We agree with Tenants on this point. The only reason Tenants benefitted from the exclusion of post-breach market evidence is that the market declined post-breach. But whether post-breach market evidence would increase or decrease an award, we think it irrelevant to the measure of consequential damages \u2014 that were clearly within the contemplation of the parties when the contracted \u2014 measured at the time of breach.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">The Second Circuit explained why measuring damages at the time of breach, rather than the time of trial, is preferable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">Measuring contract damages by the value of the item at the time of breach is eminently sensible and actually takes expected lost profits into account. The value of assets for which there is a market is the discounted value of the stream of future income that the assets are expected to produce.... New York courts have thus explicitly upheld damage awards based on \u201cwhat knowledgeable investors anticipated the future condition and performance would be at the time of breach\u201d and have rejected awards based on what \u201cthe actual economic conditions and performance\u201d were in light of hindsight.... [AJppellants are unclear about the time at which damages are to be determined under the rule they espouse. Certainly they are not entitled to select the precise date on which the vessels had their highest value or a period of time that was profitable but that excludes periods where losses occurred. If the time of trial governed, the rule would be a two-edged sword.... New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>York courts have expressly refused to adopt this \u201cwait and see\u201d theory of damages. (Citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\"><em>Sharma v. Skaarup Ship Mgmt. Corp., </em>916 F.2d 820, 826 (2d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Landlords further complain that excluding post-breach evidence encourages \u201cstrategic litigation,\u201d as potential plaintiffs would be able to sit back during the three-year statute of limitations<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> to see if the market rises or falls. If it rises, they say, plaintiffs should simply ignore the breach and strike a more profitable deal elsewhere; if it falls, plaintiffs should sue, getting the \u201cwindfall\u201d of having their damages measured according to pre-breach projections. Landlords argue that such was Tenants\u2019 course of action here, waiting until the real estate market crashed to file for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">We disagree that Tenants\u2019 behavior in this case evidenced any kind of gamesmanship. They attempted for more than a year to secure Landlords\u2019 performance under the ground leases, even obtaining an injunction for such performance. That was no strategic \u201cwait-and-see\u201d tactic, but was an attempt to move forward with the project. Similarly, suing for damages once the breach had made the project impossible was not gamesmanship. Landlords cannot seriously contend that Tenants should , have continued to employ lawyers in an attempt to secure estoppel certificates and move forward with a project that had lost its funding and permits. After Landlords\u2019 prolonged breach, which happened to extend into a severe market downturn, Tenants\u2019 only reasonable course of action was to sue for damages.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Sorrento as Intermediary</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">We next address Landlords\u2019 argument that Tenants\u2019 plans to create a separate corporate entity to operate the towers undermined the causation element of the damages claim.

Thus, Landlords argue that it \u201cwould be a perversion of Maryland law for Tenants to recover tens of millions of dollars that never would have belonged to them even in the hypothetical economy of their <em>pro </em>formas.\u201d Tenants respond that the Sorrento financing plan was only one of the options available for Tower I, and that a different plan could have been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Judge James Eyler writing for the Court of Special Appeals considered this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">The fact that [Tenants] may have subsequently assigned their interest in the ground leases to a new entity if the financing had in fact occurred does not negate causation as a matter of law for breach of contract damages.

In that suit by a former state employee against Governor Ehrlich, the employee alleged waiver of the privilege based on the Governor\u2019s supposed earlier production of documents similar to those refused. This footnote provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">We reject Grove\u2019s argument asserting that the Governor waived attorney-client privilege by producing documents similar to the ones for which he is asserting the privilege ... as being not on point.

Yet, the Court was careful to qualify its comment about the <em>Parler &amp; Wobber </em>doctrine, saying only that it did not apply to the Governor\u2019s production of documents, and that \u201cto the extent previously applied in this State, [the doctrine] relates to civil plaintiffs in professional malpractice cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The Court did not purport to set a steadfast rule that under different circumstances a defendant could not be said to have waived the privilege through testimony. Using a restrained approach, the <em>Ehrlich </em>Court went as far as it needed to, in distinguishing <em>Parler &amp; Wobber, </em>to reach the conclusion that the Governor\u2019s earlier production of documents was not a waiver of the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Ehrlich\u2019s assertion of the privilege belatedly, in connection with document production, is strikingly different from offering up \u201cattorney advice\u201d as the only reason that prevented Landlords from providing the estoppel certificates, but refusing to disclose what the advice was. This is not a case of waiver by prior document production. Here, in stark contrast, the asserted basis of waiver is the affirmative testimony of several officers and employees of Landlords, both in depositions and at trial, in which they brought up conversations with their attorneys to answer questions about their reasons and motivations for certain actions. Landlords employed this strategy in an effort to prove that they acted in good faith in refusing to sign the estoppel certificates. And they did so with remarka<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>ble consistency, beginning with the deposition of Floyd Davis Camalier on December 3, 2009, when the idea to hide behind the advice of counsel appears to have been hatched:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">Q: Did you participate in the decision to take that position, namely we will not sign an estoppel certificate that says you are in compliance with the ground lease?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">A: I may have had an opinion. I don\u2019t know what participate means. I\u2019m just \u2014 I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m one of the family members. I had an opinion. I\u2019m sure other people did as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYU\">Q: What was your opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">A: My opinion? My opinion \u2014 I was just following \u2014 I was just following \u2014 I was just following at that point in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASs\">Q: Who were you following?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">A: I was following our group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">Q: Who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">A: Who? Well, we had the \u2014 we had all the parties together and that\u2019s how we made \u2014 a decision was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">Q: Who was involved in making the decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-12\">A: There were lots of people. I don\u2019t remember who was at which meeting. The Davises and the Camaliers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-13\">Q: Let\u2019s identify the exact human beings that were involved in the decision....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-14\">[W]ho of that group of human beings were you following?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjiD\">A: Well, we \u2014 we were \u2014 we were \u2014 I mean, we were \u2014 we were just \u2014 we were sitting there. We were in a meeting in a conference room at our attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-15\">Q: And what opinion did you express?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-16\">A: I don\u2019t know what I expressed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-17\">Mr. Cooter: Just a minute. Just a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-18\">The Witness: Sorry</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-19\">Mr. Cooter: Is this a meeting where there\u2019s a lawyer involved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-20\">The witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>A: I instruct you not to answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">Q: Did you ever express an opinion about whether the family should take the positions they were taking on the estoppel certificate issue outside the presence of lawyers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abj\">A: I don\u2019t think I ever discussed it outside of the attorneys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In subsequent depositions, Landlords used the same strategy of claiming that their business decisions were based on the advice of counsel, and therefore that they could not say anything more about their motivations. For example, Floyd E. Davis, III, repeatedly refused to answer questions about his personal reasons for opposing Tenants\u2019 site plan approvals, pointing simply to counsel\u2019s advice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">Q: My question goes to whether you had any business purpose, not a legal strategy or legal analysis that you may have talked about with Hogan &amp; Hartson. Was there any business reason for attacking the site plan approvals in the two lawsuits that had been filed in Montgomery County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMp\">A: Once again, I can\u2019t separate that out, because we discussed \u2014 we really didn\u2019t discuss that outside of counsel. We discussed everything with counsel. The business aspects of it, everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">Q: Your testimony is you just surrendered all independent business judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">Q: Did you make any independent business judgment in the fall of 2006, or did you just do what your lawyers told you to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">A: It wasn\u2019t just the lawyers. But it was arriving at a consensus. I can\u2019t discuss it any further, that\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">Q: Your position in the fall of 2006 was you wanted apartments built on the land, you just wanted them built by somebody other than RSC?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>A: Once again, all of this, our positions came out in consultation, you know, with counsel, and family members were there. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">Q: What did you want to see happen with the land?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">A: We\u2019re going around in circles. I mean, as I said before, I wanted to see apartments built. I wanted to see the land developed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">Q: Given your testimony that [you wanted to see apartments built], are you able to tell me why, if that was the truth, your family took the positions it took with respect to the estoppel certificate, between October 2nd, 2006 and April 2007?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">A: No, I can\u2019t answer that. I mean, I think I\u2019m mixing apples and oranges. But basically at this point all our decisions were being made in consultation with counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Similarly, Charles A. Camalier, III, when asked about his reasons for refusing to sign the estoppel certificates and for failing to back the project before the county, offered only his conversations with Hogan &amp; Hartson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">Q: ... Was there anything that prevented [Landlords] from telling Park <em>&amp; </em>Planning at the end of December 2006, while we weren\u2019t the ones who submitted the application to amend the site plan from condos to apartments, we\u2019re in favor of proceeding with the apartments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">A: Again, we were relying on our counsel, so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">Q: Independent of what Hogan <em>&amp; </em>Hartson may have told you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-13\">A: No, why would we go independent? We hired what we thought was the best law firm in town. We were relying on their advice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">Finally, John G. Davis employed the same strategy, bringing up conversations with Hogan &amp; Hartson in answers to questions about his personal motivations for opposing Tenants\u2019 site plans and refusing to sign the estoppel certificates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Q: Okay. And Judge McGann ordered you to dismiss your actions questioning the site plan approvals in April of 2007, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">Q: You made a business decision not to dismiss them in April of 2007?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">A. Based on advice from counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">Q: Following the November 6, 2006 letter from RSC, did the Davis families reconsider the position that they had asserted prior to November 6th with respect to the estoppel certificates?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">A: Any discussions/decisions we made concerning this letter was done with the guidance and advice of Hogan &amp; Hartson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">Q: Now, is it your contention in this litigation that the positions that were taken on your behalf by Hogan &amp; Hartson were authorized by the Davis defendants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">A: We \u2014 we hired Hogan &amp; Hartson for their advice. They advised us and came up with a game plan on how to move forward. They were driving the bus. I don\u2019t know\u2014 I\u2019m not a lawyer. I wouldn\u2019t authorize them to send individual documents or whatever\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-11\">Q: After getting recommendations from your lawyers on how to proceed, who made the decision to take the positions that the Davis defendants took?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-12\">A: Well, on advice of counsel, the partners are the \u2014 the three Davis brothers are the partners, so they made the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-13\">Q: So do you accept responsibility for the decisions that were made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-14\">A: Again, we \u2014 we relied on advice of counsel[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>The trial court considered this deposition testimony key to its decision to grant Tenants\u2019 motion to compel discovery from Hogan &amp; Hartson. The court reasoned that Landlords could not use their consultations with counsel unfairly to assert good faith while at the same time avoiding any investigation into the asserted basis of that good faith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\">If we just had letters, and we had the defendants saying, look, in deposition it was our decision, we took counsel from them, and we have every opportunity to make our decision, and this is what we did, we thought the plaintiff was breaching, and all we did tell them is \u2014 you know, if it was just as simple as that, I wouldn\u2019t [compel discovery from Hogan &amp; Hartson], I\u2019m not looking to open up another area.... [B]ut, certainly, it\u2019s a two-edge sword, and you can\u2019t come in and say, by the way, I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and, yet, you can\u2019t hear from the person that I told to do something!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Even so, the trial court did not rule that any evidence discovered from Hogan &amp; Hartson would necessarily be admissible. Instead, the trial court decided to \u201cwait[ ] and see ... [i]f [reliance on counsel] was going to be used as a defense\u201d before allowing any of the Hogan &amp; Hartson evidence into trial. He also specifically instructed Tenants not \u201cto mention it in opening statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Yet at trial, Landlords brought up their privileged discussions once again, using the same coy strategy. The Court of Special Appeals described several such exchanges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">[T]he attorney for [Tenants] asked Mr. Camalier if he was aware that the continuing course of conduct of not providing unconditional estoppel certificates would result in a failure of financing for the RSC Towers. Mr. Camalier responded by stating that \u201c[w]e were operating in good faith and operating pursuant to discussions with our attorney who felt we were doing nothing improper.\u201d Later, Mr. Camalier stated</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">We thought about it in that we sent the letter to our lawyers and asked them what, are we acting in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>faith? Are we acting within qur rights under the ground lease? So, to the extent, yes, we saw what Mr. Hoffman said in his letter but we did not make an independent analysis. We sent it to our lawyer. This is what they\u2019re stating. Are we on solid ground, operating in good faith, which we were, and basically have we complied with the ground lease? We were advised, yes we were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">Mr. Davis also referred to the advice of counsel to explain why he refused to sign the estoppel certificates:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">Q: Mr. Davis, is the statement in that letter that the reason you refused to sign the estoppel certificates was that you got negligent advice from Hogan &amp; Hartson? A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">Q: Is that a truthful statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">Mr. Davis also referred to the advice of counsel to avoid answering a question asked by [Tenants] as to whether he knew that reserving all rights under the estoppel certificates would result in the failure of the project to go forward:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVl\">Q: Mr. Davis, will you answer my question? My question is this. When you signed that letter purporting to reserve all rights, you knew that assertion was totally inconsistent with the business purpose for which an estoppel certificate is requested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">A: We signed the estoppel certificate that the Judge ordered and once again, I did not draft this letter. It was drafted by an attorney. I did sign it and reserving all rights, I thought reserved the rights that we had under the documents as we went to the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aso\"><em>CR-RSC, </em>202 Md.App. at 366-67, 32 A.3d at 491. The record also contains several other examples of affirmative use of the privilege as a dodge against candid answers, such as when Davis mentioned that Landlords consulted with counsel before deciding to try to force Tenants to follow the original condominium plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">We had hired Hogan &amp; Hartson and I mean, they are a well known and respected law firm and they were advising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>us, and once again, that does not mean I\u2019m not taking responsibility but together with Hogan &amp; Hartson, and other family members, we made the decisions that we did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Davis was no more forthcoming when asked about the \u201cbusiness reason for\u201d opposing the building permit for the apartment project: \u201cBusiness reason? I think it was the legal reason. We [just] wanted to make sure that, you know, that we as landowners sign the proper documents.\u201d Given a second chance, he stone-walled again: when asked for \u201cany business reason[,] if you wanted apartments to be built on the land[,] why you would challenge the fact that there is a building permit authorized by Montgomery County to build the apartment building,\u201d Davis answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Never missing an opportunity, Davis continued to hide behind the privilege in response to other questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">Q: One of the decisions you made was to ask the court system to stay Judge McGann\u2019s order to dismiss the building permit challenge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">Q: Not a decision you had to make, one you chose to make?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">A: In consultation with our attorneys, once again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">Q: And one of the things you did was you decided to send a letter on April 16, 2007 with the estoppel certificates that Judge McGann had required you to file with a cover letter reserving your rights. That was a decision you made, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">A: In consultation with counsel, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">This conduct is a far cry from the mere disclosure of documents similar to privileged ones by the Governor in <em>Ehrlich</em><footnotemark><em>50</em></footnotemark><em> </em>When defendants behave in this manner, bringing up conversations with attorneys to deflect questions about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>business justification, personal motivation, or intent, we enter a different realm of considerations than that posed in <em>Ehrlich.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">We see no principled distinction that would call for applying the doctrine of waiver of the privilege to a plaintiff, but not a defendant. It may be that there are more situations in which the waiver doctrine will be applied against a plaintiff, but the doctrine is based on fairness, and fairness cannot be one-sided. For a witness to disclose that he was acting \u201con the advice of\u2019 his attorney, and say no more, constitutes disclosure of \u201cas much as he pleases.\u201d Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2327; <em>Parler &amp; Wobber, </em>359 Md. at 693, 756 A.2d at 538. If this occurs, the trial court may find that the privilege has been abused, and that a waiver has occurred. The waiver doctrine is also grounded in the \u201ctruth-finding process\u201d of trial. <em>See Permian Corp. v. United States, </em>665 F.2d 1214, 1221 (D.C.Cir. 1981) (\u201cBecause the attorney-client privilege inhibits the truth-finding process, it has been narrowly construed ... and courts have been vigilant to prevent litigants from converting the privilege into a tool for selective disclosure. The client cannot be permitted to ... invoke the privilege as to communications whose confidentiality he has already compromised for his own benefit.\u201d); <em>see also State v. Walker, </em>345 Md. 293, 328, 691 A.2d 1341, 1358 (1997) (referencing the \u201ctruth-seeking mission\u201d of trial.)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\n<em>The Nature of Statements Resulting in the Waiver of Attorney-Client Privilege</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Landlords further assert that authorities allowing waiver by a defendant should not have been applied to them because their testimony \u201cdescribed only the circumstances of the attorney-client communication, not the content[.]\u201d According to Landlords, their testimony was simply a denial of Tenants\u2019 allegations of bad faith. Thus, they contend that if the above precedents were applied to them, their only options while testifying would have been to concede bad faith or waive the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>We agree with Landlords that a \u201cclient\u2019s simple denial of an allegation by the opposing side that an act was committed with a particular intent does not inject advice of counsel into the case, even though that advice may have been the reason why the intent was not present.\u201d Rice, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 9:46. The waiver doctrine certainly leaves room for a defendant to deny bad faith without waiving the attorney-client privilege. Yet what defendants cannot do is defend a charge of bad faith by referencing specific communications with attorneys that purportedly provided a good-faith basis for certain actions, and then refuse to allow any further investigation into those communications. This is because allowing a defendant to \u201cmake the naked assertion that they consulted with their attorneys ... leav[es] the fact finder with the impression that they had [shown good faith] even in [a] situation where they had not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Van Straaten, </em>2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98604, at *14). Such tactics would allow the defendant to use the attorney-client communication to his benefit and then refuse to answer more questions about it. This would be an abuse of the privilege \u2014 using it both as a sword and a shield.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The quoted testimony amply shows that Landlords attempted to use the attorney-client privilege as a sword and shield. They did not simply deny bad faith and refuse to answer questions about attorney-client communications. Indeed, Tenants\u2019 counsel repeatedly clarified that they were not seeking information about attorney-client communications, but instead wanted to know what was in the minds of the individual Landlords when they took certain actions.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> As in <em>Workman, </em>each Landlord \u201cclaim[ed] in his defense that he relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>[counsel\u2019s] advice without permitting [Tenants] to explore the substance of that advice.\u201d <em>See </em>138 F.3d at 1264. This is not allowed because it is not fair and undermines the \u201ctruth-seeking mission\u201d of a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Of course, the information sought from the defendant must be relevant, or likely to lead to the discovery of relevant information, to an issue at trial. Thus, we examine the question of why Landlords\u2019 business reason, or other motivation or reasons for acting, was relevant to this suit.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> This issue is debated by the parties, with Landlords asserting that their intent in pursuing the administrative actions and refusing to give the estoppel certificates was not relevant. After a close review of the record, we conclude that the business reasons or Landlords\u2019 other intent or motivation, were relevant both because of the allegations of the complaint, as amended, and because of the defenses raised by Landlords.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">With respect to the allegations in the complaint, every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Tenants, in their amended complaint, alleged a breach of the implied covenant, in addition to other breaches of the contract, placing Landlords\u2019 intent and motivations in issue. Landlords\u2019 motivations became even more relevant when they offered two defenses on the damages issue: argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>ing first that Tenants could not prove that the damages they claimed were proximately caused by Landlords\u2019 breach, and second, that Tenants failed to mitigate their damages, as contract law requires. These theories overlap and both contained a theme that Landlords were acting in good faith. For example, in opening statement, Landlords\u2019 counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">The Court determined and was affirmed on appeal that our folks have breached these ground leases having to do with the estoppel certificates and some other things [because] \u201cthey made a business decision to breach ground leases.\u201d That\u2019s not what happened. They made a business decision not to get [sic] estoppel certificates. Like most lawsuits, they thought they were right. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">So, from the start of trial, Landlords\u2019 counsel portrayed his clients as reasonable businesspersons who had a business reason that they thought was justifiable, to refuse the estoppel certificates. This portrait was offered in the context of attempting to minimize the breach, with counsel saying to the jury: \u201cHow did these estoppel certificates, these ungiven estoppel certificates, cause them $50 million, $60 million, what they\u2019re going to ask you for, in damages because they went unsigned for about ... seven months[.]\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Yet when Tenants asked Landlords what was the basis of their \u201cbusiness decision not to\u201d provide the certificates, the witnesses refused to say, invoking the attorney-client privilege. Since in their argument as to why a certain damage award was too high, Landlords relied on their belief that \u201cthey were right\u201d in refusing to issue the certificates, Tenants certainly had a right to inquire as to the basis of that thinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">As to mitigation, Landlords\u2019 counsel threw out this notion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>They\u2019re also going to have a duty to mitigate their own damages.... They had things they could have done. Build the buildings. Give [Landlords] the 60 days that they wanted.... [T]here were things they could have done and should have done that would have avoided all of this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWg\">The 60-day notice counsel referred to was a disagreement between the parties as to whether Tenants had failed to comply with the Lease by failing to give Landlords 60 days notice of the site plan amendment for the anticipated project, which Tenants filed with the Commission. During testimony, Landlords\u2019 counsel pursued this point by asking Tenants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiW\">Q: Okay. Now, what that meant was that in November of ... 2006 there was only one issue still on the table as to these estoppel certificates that divided your side from their side. Do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\">A. At this point in time, ... that is what I thought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">Q. Okay. And that issue, ... was whether or not [Landlords] were entitled to 60 days[ ] notice of the ... site plan amendment before it was filed. Do you recall that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">A. I recall that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">Q. Now, [Landlords] said, \u201cWe\u2019re entitled to 60 days notice,\u201d and you said, ... No, you\u2019re not.\u201d That was the dispute in the fall of '06, was it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">A. I think that was the basis on which this letter was written.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">Q. Well, was that, is that essentially the dispute on these estoppel certificates?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">A. Well, there were things that changed over time, ... and certainly this letter is indicating that this was the only issue outstanding at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\">Q. Now, you, you had a solution to the problem. All you had, ... to do is withdraw the site plan amendment and give them the 60 days?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-12\">Did you inquire as to, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I just withdraw this, give them the 60 days. They\u2019ll get their 60 days and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>problem is solved\u201d? Did you ... inquire of anybody if you could do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">... [W]hy you just didn\u2019t give them the 60 days and be done with it was \u2014 the reason you didn\u2019t is because you weren\u2019t required to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">A. That\u2019s one of the reasons that I wasn\u2019t, ... and I think the delay ... would have prejudiced the project if we had to go back through and go through this process again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">Q. [Rjather than just do that simple thing that maybe would have accounted for 60 days worth of delay, you elected to litigate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">... It is that process that you started that brings us here today? (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">What this sequence of questions portrays is Landlords\u2019 theory that, although legally Landlords were not entitled to 60 days notice, Tenants had a duty to mitigate, and mitigation required that, rather than file a lawsuit to force Landlords to give the estoppel certificate, they just give in to Landlord\u2019s demand for 60 days to review the site plan, and re-file the plan with the zoning authority after that review. One could reasonably interpret Landlords\u2019 theory to be that Tenants\u2019 giving in to the 60-day review (and re-filing) would have avoided the $60 million damage claim because financing would not have been lost and the project could have been built. This theory pre-supposes, of course, that Landlords were not planning other steps to thwart the project, whether by further breach or other method. Tenants\u2019 counter to this theory is that Landlords did not want Tenants to complete the development project because they thought they could do better leasing the land to someone else. With these two countervailing theories, Landlords\u2019 business reason for refusing the estoppel certificates takes a front and center position as a highly relevant issue in the damages trial. Thus, the trial court acted within its discretion in deciding that Landlords\u2019 good faith business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>reason for refusing the certificates was a legitimate and relevant area for inquiry by Tenants.

The court also held that only restrictive covenants, as opposed to affirmative covenants such as the agreement to provide estoppel certificates, could be enforced by third parties under a uniform plan of development. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Tenants contend that the evidence was sufficient to support joint and several liability under either theory.

Most important, they say, is language in Section 9.3(c) referencing \u201ceasements, privileges and obligations\u201d between the two parcels, including \u201cthe shared infrastructure of common access, a clubhouse, garage, parking, and recreational areas.\u201d <footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Tenants also reference attachments to the ground leases, such as the \u201csite plan for both towers;\u201d \u201cspecifications for Towers I and II; plans and specifications for [a] clubhouse shared by both towers; the overall project site plan; and the \u2018overall underground garage.\u2019 \u201d They assert that Section 14.1 makes all of these provisions covenants,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> and that they became covenants running with the land when Tenants filed \u201cMemoranda of ground lease\u201d with Montgomery County. Thus, Tenants contend that, because the \u201cvery purpose\u201d of a covenant running with the land is to \u201ccircumvent privity constraints,\u201d the four corners of the ground leases show an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>intent to confer third-party beneficiary status on each Tenant under our decision in <em>120 W.

Mayor of Balt., </em>426 Md. 14, 35-36, 43 A.3d 355, 368 (2012), and other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Tenants additionally assert that the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d are relevant to the parties\u2019 intent to create third-party beneficiaries under <em>Shillman v. Hobstetter, </em>249 Md. 678, 689, 241 A.2d 570, 576 (1968), and other authorities. They contend that several \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d show the parties\u2019 intent to confer third-party beneficiary status on each Tenant, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">the shared common facilities (underground garage, parking lots, and recreational areas, luxury clubhouse, public access); testimony by ...

(Footnotes added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Thus, Tenants\u2019 assert that, because \u201cthe promisee\u2019s intent ... controls,\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Tenants\u2019 plan to create \u201cintertwined,\u201d mutually-dependent towers \u2014 under which \u201c[njeither ground lease would have been executed had the other not been executed simultaneously\u201d \u2014 \u201camply supported the jury\u2019s conclusion that each RSC tenant was a third party beneficiary of the other\u2019s ground lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Landlords cite mostly the same cases as Tenants, arguing that those cases support the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding. Under those cases, they say, the evidence presented at trial \u201cnegates [the] inference\u201d that the parties intended to make each Tenant a beneficiary of the other\u2019s ground lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In the primary case cited by both parties, <em>120 West Fayette Street, </em>we summarized the law regarding third-party beneficiaries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">At common law, only a party to a contract could bring suit to enforce the terms of a contract. The common law rule has expanded to permit third-party beneficiaries to bring suit in order to enforce the terms of a contract. An individual is a third-party beneficiary to a contract if the contract was intended for his or her benefit and it clearly appears that the parties intended to recognize him or her as the primary party in interest and as privy to the promise. It is not enough that the contract merely operates to an individual\u2019s benefit: An incidental beneficiary acquires by virtue of the promise no right against the promisor or the promisee.

State Highway Admin., </em>we explained the third-party beneficiary standard in more detail. We said the \u201cdecisive[] distinction\u201d was between \u201cintended and incidental beneficiaries,\u201d with the \u201ccrucial fact\u201d being whether the pertinent provisions in the contract were \u201cinserted ... to benefit\u201d the third party. 408 Md. 242, 261, 265, 969 A.2d 284, 296, 298 (2009). Another \u201cfactor to consider,\u201d we said, is whether the third party is named in the contract or its \u201cantecedent agreements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265, 969 A.2d at 297-98. We also reaffirmed our agreement with Section 302 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">(1) unless otherwise agreed between promisor and promisee, a beneficiary of a promise is an intended beneficiary if recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties and either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">(a) the performance of the promise will satisfy an obligation of the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">(b) the circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">(2) An incidental beneficiary is a beneficiary who is not an intended beneficiary.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 262 n. 6, 969 A.2d at 296 n. 6. Other cases have further detailed this standard. <em>See, e.g., Noble v. Bruce, </em>349 Md. 730, 753, 709 A.2d 1264, 1276 (1998) (holding that the third party was not an intended beneficiary because the promisor \u201cdid not communicate or meet with\u201d the third party); <em>Marlboro Shirt Co. v.

[the third party] must show that [the promisor] owed [him] a duty under the contract.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">In applying this standard, we look to \u201cthe intention of the parties to recognize a person or class as a primary party in interest as expressed in the language of the instrument and consideration of the surrounding circumstances as reflecting upon the parties\u2019 intention[.]\u201d <em>Ferguson v. Cramer, </em>349 Md. 760, 767, 709 A.2d 1279, 1283 (1998) (citation and quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>To begin with, only two of the cases cited by Tenants from this Court actually found evidence of intent to create a third-party beneficiary, and they both involved facts markedly different from this case. In <em>Shillman v. Hobstetter, </em>a residential developer and a lender agreed that the lender would issue conditional commitments for certain planned homes if the developer would refund certain purchasers\u2019 deposits. 249 Md. at 682-83, 241 A.2d at 572-73. The only thing the developer promised to do under the agreement (return the deposits) was clearly intended to benefit the purchasers, so logically we found that the purchasers were intended third-party beneficiaries. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 241 A.2d at 576-77. Similarly, in <em>Prescott v. Coppage, </em>the trial court appointed a receiver for a savings and loan company as well as a special counsel to assist him. Because the purpose of the court order was to benefit the creditors, we found them to be third-party beneficiaries entitled to recover against the special counsel. 266 Md. 562, 574, 296 A.2d 150, 156 (1972). In both cases, the contracts were created specifically to benefit the third parties in question. In other words, it is fair to say that the purchasers in <em>Shillman </em>and the creditors in <em>Prescott </em>were the \u201cprimary parties] in interest\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> under those contracts, because the provisions that named them were obviously \u201cinserted ... to benefit\u201d them.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The same cannot be said of the ground leases in this case, which were clearly entered into first and foremost for the benefit of the parties that signed them. In each ground lease, the purported third-party beneficiary is mentioned only briefly and in passing \u2014 to wit, in sections involving easements running between the two parcels, plans for the development of common areas, and overall site plans that mention both towers. The peripheral nature of these provisions \u2014 which simply describe the joint nature of the two projects \u2014 is substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>different from the central provisions in <em>Shillman </em>and <em>Prescott, </em>which demonstrated how the third parties in those cases were \u201cowed ... a duty under the contract[s].\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> This, we said, was the \u201ccrucial fact\u201d in support of finding a third-party beneficiary,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> and it is not present here.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>None of Tenants\u2019 secondary arguments overcome this \u201ccrucial fact.\u201d Although covenants running with the land are generally designed to \u201ccircumvent privity restraints,\u201d the covenant to provide estoppel certificates was not. Nothing about Landlords\u2019 breach of that covenant or their breach by pursuing administrative actions had anything to do with the joint nature of the development project. Nor do the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d change the \u201ccrucial fact\u201d that the breached covenants were not \u201cinserted ... to benefit\u201d the third party. <em>See Lovell, </em>408 Md. at 261, 265, 969 A.2d at 296, 298. Most of the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d alluded to by Tenants simply reveal the joint-nature of the towers project. As we have said, this is not evidence of intent to benefit a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The only novel circumstance is what Tenants\u2019 call \u201cthe third party\u2019s reliance interest\u201d under the ground leases \u2014 that each tower would not have been built without the other \u2014 which they assert is relevant under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 302. Yet simply reviewing the explanation and illustrations of this Restatement section reveals why it is inapplicable here. In each of the section\u2019s examples, the contracts were entered into with the express purpose of benefitting a third party, as the parties explained and agreed upon how the third party would be benefitted. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 302 (1981). Here, in contrast, the parties simply understood that the two towers were to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>\u201cintertwine\u201d as part of a common plan.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Tenants cite no other authority to support their reliance theory. We are left, therefore, with no evidence that the parties intended to make each Tenant a third-party beneficiary of the other\u2019s ground lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\n<em>Covenants Running with the Land</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Alternatively, Tenants argue that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that there was insufficient evidence to support joint and several liability under the doctrine of uniform plans of development. They also contend that the court incorrectly limited joint and several liability to restrictive covenants, but assert that, in any ease, the restrictive covenants present here supported joint and several liability. Landlords respond that the language of the ground leases does not create third-party liability under a uniform plan of development.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">To begin with, we know of no authorities, and Tenants provide none, connecting covenants under a uniform plan of development with joint and several liability for damages. As Professor Powell explains, the question of a uniform plan of development arises when a party with an interest in a piece of property in a community asserts that there is an implied covenant that, although not mentioned in any of the community\u2019s deeds, restricts what each property owner can do with his or her land. <em>See </em>9 Richard R. Powell, <em>Powell on Real Property </em>\u00a7 60.03[1] (Michael A. Wolf ed., 2012). In such cases, the implied restriction must be \u201cplain and unmistakable, or necessary\u201d when examining the nature and purpose of the development as a whole. <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). Such \u201cimplied covenants\u201d are \u201cmost commonly found in cases involving subdivisions where title to all lots originated in a common grantor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 60.03[2].</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Our cases reflect this description of the \u201ccommon plan\u201d doctrine. We detailed the history and purpose of the doctrine in <em>Roper v. Camuso:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">The doctrine of implied negative reciprocal covenants developed in order to provide protection for purchasers buying lots in what they reasonably expected was a general development in which all of the lots would be equally burdened and benefitted.... The seminal prerequisite for asserting that an implied negative reciprocal covenant exists is a common grantor who has a general plan of development for the land. If a general plan of development exists establishing certain restrictions on property use, those restrictions could be enforced in equity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">... We stated in <em>McKenrick v. Savings Bank, </em>174 Md. 118, 128, 197 A. 580, 584-85 (1938):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">[I]f in such a case it appears that it was the intention of the grantors that the restrictions were part of a uniform general scheme or plan of development and use which should affect the land granted and the land retained alike, they may be enforced in equity; ... the burden is upon one seeking to enforce such restrictions, where they are not specifically expressed in a deed, to show by clear and satisfactory proof that the common grantor intended that they should affect the land retained as a part of a uniform general scheme of development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">In <em>McKenrick </em>and subsequent cases, the assertion of an implied reciprocal restriction arising from a general plan of development was not premised on any recorded declaration subjecting the land to restrictions, but was based either on the inclusion by a common grantor of uniform restrictions in individual deeds to specific lots or from oral commitments made to purchasers of lots subject to restrictions that subsequent conveyances of retained land would be subject to the same restrictions. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">376 Md. 240, 260-62, 829 A.2d 589, 602 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">As the above examples show, covenants that can be implied by a uniform plan of development must relate to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>uniform plan and \u201caffect the land.\u201d <em>McKenrick, </em>174 Md. at 128, 197 A. at 584-85. Such covenants are typically restrictions on how the lots can be used and developed, so as not to alter the nature of the development as a whole. <em>See, e.g., Roper, </em>376 Md. at 259, 829 A.2d at 601 (covenants dealing with the height of fences); <em>Schovee v. Mikolasko, </em>356 Md. 93, 97, 737 A.2d 578, 580 (1999) (restriction providing that \u201cno lot could be devoted to a use other than a residential use and that no lot may contain more than one detached residential structure at any time\u201d); <em>Turner v. Brocato, </em>206 Md. 336, 343-44, 111 A.2d 855, 859 (1955) (covenants \u201crelating to front yard measurements, walls, open spaces, and approval of plans by an architect ... [and] the maintenance or operation of a number of specified noxious or offensive trades or businesses on the land\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">We know of no authority for the proposition that a person with an interest in land subject to the restrictions of a uniform plan can enforce other, unrelated covenants against persons not in privity. The breaches of covenants here \u2014 failure to provide estoppel certificates and wrongful administrative actions \u2014 have no relation to the common plan. The doctrine simply does not fit the facts. Such evidence cannot create joint and several liability for the breach of unrelated covenants, and we affirm the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision to reverse the Circuit Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\n<em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Although the Court of Special Appeals invalidated the jury\u2019s joint and several damages award, it did not address the trial court\u2019s award of joint and several attorneys\u2019 fees, observing that the award of attorneys\u2019 fees \u201clies within the sound discretion of the trial judge\u201d and that Landlords had \u201coffer[ed] virtually no argument in support of\u2019 overturning that award. <em>CR-RSC, </em>202 Md.App. at 374, 32 A.3d at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Landlords argue that the Court of Special Appeals erred in not extending its ruling on joint and several liability to the attorneys\u2019 fees. The only basis for joint and several attorneys\u2019 fees, they say, is third-party beneficiary status, which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>court held was not present here. Landlords also assert that it would be \u201cabsurd\u201d to ignore Tenants\u2019 \u201ccarefully crafted separate existences simply because they chose not to act like separate entities in their joint prosecution of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Tenants respond that Landlords incorrectly conflate joint and several liability for attorneys\u2019 fees with joint and several liability for damages, which depends on separate analytical factors. They cite cases in which courts have apportioned attorneys\u2019 fees among defendants based upon (1) the commonality of issues in the litigation, <em>Turner v. D.C. Bd. of Elections &amp; Ethics, </em>354 F.3d 890, 898 (D.C.Cir.2004); (2) each defendant\u2019s degree of liability and culpability, <em>Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin, </em>749 F.2d 945, 959-60 (1st Cir.1984); and (3) the amount of time spent defending against each defendant, <em>id. </em>Thus, Tenants assert that the Circuit Court acted within its discretion in awarding joint and several attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">When a contract provides for attorneys\u2019 fees in the event of litigation,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5 is \u201cthe foundation for analysis of what constitutes a reasonable fee.\u201d <em>Monmouth Meadows Homeowners Ass\u2019n v.

Additionally, the trial court has discretion to consider \u201cany other factor reasonably related to a fair award of attorneys\u2019 fees[,]\u201d and the trial court need not \u201cexplicitly comment on or make findings with respect to each factor\u201d nor \u201chold an evidentiary hearing to determine a proper fee award[.]\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 337-38 &amp; nn. 11-12, 1 A.3d at 8 &amp; nn. 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>In this case, the trial court explained on the record why the attorneys\u2019 fee estimate of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert was reasonable under Rule 1.5. The trial court did not mention the joint and several nature of the award, however, which was summarily stated in the written order. Yet the court did provide a clue as to its reasoning on the joint and several nature of the award. By referring to the parties as \u201cthe defendant\u201d and \u201cthe plaintiff,\u201d the trial court implied that it viewed the parties as single entities for the purposes of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Such reasoning is supported by precedent. Although we have not defined precisely when attorneys\u2019 fees should be awarded jointly and severally, we have upheld joint and several awards when defendants acted in concert to harm the plaintiffs. <em>See, e.g., Hoffman, </em>385 Md. at 6, 48-49, 867 A.2d at 279, 304-05 (various defendants conspired to defraud and misrepresent aspects of a residential purchase). Federal courts have employed the same reasoning. As the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">[A] plaintiffs fully compensatory fee for claims centered on a set of common issues against two or more jointly responsible defendants should be assessed jointly and severally.

Landlords\u2019 other principal cases also involved substitute performance, as opposed to post-breach market evidence. In <em>Sloane, </em>the defendant breached an exclusive contract by replacing the plaintiff, an advertising agency, with another agency. 311 Md. at 41, 532 A.2d at 696. We held that, to calculate the lost profits the plaintiff would have made if it had gotten to work with the defendant, it was proper to look to the replacement agency's \u201cexperience to prove the volume of advertising activity actually done for [the defendant] during the relevant period. To that known output of work [is] applied the charges agreed to in its contract with [the plaintiff].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Again, we did not mention any evidence of \"market conditions,\u201d but instead looked to actual substituted performance as a means for calculating the profits the plaintiffs would have made. <em>See also Sinclair Refining Co. v.

The same is true of the Restatement provision cited by Landlords. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 352 (1981). Landlords point out that Illustration 6 in this provision involves a plaintiff who is permitted to prove lost profits with \u201crecords of the [business\u2019s] subsequent operation and of the operation of similar [businesses] in the same locality, along with other evidence including market surveys and expert testimony[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Yet the Restatement does not specify whether such \"market surveys\u201d were conducted pre- or post-breach \u2014 except that this illustration is based on our decision in <em>Evergreen Amusement Corp. v. Milstead, </em>206 Md. 610, 617-18, 112 A.2d 901, 904 (1955), in which the \"market survey\u201d was conducted prior to the time of contracting. Corbin mentions this Restatement provision as well. <em>See Corbin, supra, </em>\u00a7 56.17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\">. Perhaps the best case for Landlords is <em>Hoang v. Hewitt Ave. Assocs., LLC, </em>in which the trial court commented, post-breach, on the real estate market as part of his conclusion that lost profits had been proved with reasonable certainty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">The [trial] court factored in that the real estate market was \"well-established\u201d and that the evidence presented by [the plaintiff] assumed a flat market, not one that would increase. The court found that the real estate market \"will almost certainly continue to appreciate at some rate.\u201d It noted, in addition, that town houses, being on the lower end of the housing market, enjoy greater protection from downward fluctuations in the real estate market than do other, more expensive, houses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">177 Md.App. 562, 573, 936 A.2d 915, 922 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Yet, despite this observation, it is not clear that any post-breach market evidence was presented. First of all, the plaintiff's complaint was filed just two months after the contract had been entered into. <em>Id. </em>at 568-69, 936 A.2d at 919. It is perhaps unlikely, then, that the parties produced new market analyses just two months after preparing to contract, solely for litigation purposes. Indeed, as the trial court explained, the plaintiff's evidence consisted of \"assumptions ... as to what is the real estate market likely to do a year from now, two years from now, even further out,\u201d which appears to refer to the plaintiffs\u2019 pre-contract projections, used as a basis of the agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 574, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>936 A.2d at 922. To be sure, it is possible that the evidence of \"the real estate market as it existed at the relevant time\u201d consisted of post-breach market analyses. <em>Id. </em>at 610, 936 A.2d at 944. But the Court of Special Appeals' characterization of the evidence as what \"the parties expected,\u201d <em>id., </em>coupled with the trial court\u2019s characterization of it as future \"assumptions\u201d and the quick turn-around from contract to trial, militates against such a conclusion. More likely is that the evidence of market conditions, just like Tenants\u2019 expert evidence here, was based on projections made pursuant to the parties' agreement. In any case, as with Landlords\u2019 other cases, <em>Hoang </em>does not provide direct support for the proposition that post-breach market evidence is relevant or admissible to prove lost profits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b455-6\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>Dunn, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.16 (\"Another possible approach to proving lost profits damages is to use industry averages. The courts are divided, however, on the question whether this evidence is permissible.\u201d (citing numerous cases for each position)). <em>But see Advent Sys. Ltd. v. Unisys Corp., </em>925 F.2d 670, 681 (3d Cir.1991) (opining, before remanding for a new trial, that the \"actual results in the marketplace during the pertinent two years\u201d of business operation could be relevant to a lost profits claim for those two years); <em>Coonis v.

Other sections of Sutherland\u2019s treatise also support this interpretation.

Although we have been asked to determine, in this economic climate, how lost profit damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>in the context of a speculative real estate venture are to be measured, what the Majority has done is affirm an award of damages as lost profits that is really punitive in nature, rather than acknowledge that any standard for awarding damages lacks certainty and eviscerates foreseeability. I believe, in this framework, that the Landlords<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> should have been afforded their day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">In this case, the trial court erred in barring the Landlords from introducing evidence of the depressed residential real estate market as it existed at the time Tenants\u2019 claimed lost profits were expected to materialize. As Landlords described at trial, \u201cthe world had changed\u201d due to a downturn of the real estate and credit markets caused by the \u201ceconomic Armageddon in [20]08.\u201d The Majority\u2019s holding that such drastic economic factors cannot inform an assessment of damages when the nature and extent of such damages were not foreseen by the contracting parties provides a windfall to the non-breaching party by excluding evidence that such profits would not have arisen had the contract been performed. This places the breaching party in the position of a guarantor of the non-breaching party\u2019s ultimately unrealistic expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">To put the case in context:</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Developer Tenants were prevented from building, renting, and selling apartment buildings on Landlords\u2019 tracts in Montgomery County. In June of 2004, the parties entered into ground leases under which Tenants would build two high-rise apartment buildings, Tower I, anticipated to be completed in 2008 or 2009, and Tower II, with completion contemplated in 2012. Tenants projected, for their own purposes and as justification for obtaining financing, multimillion dollar profits from the planned development, based on projections made in 2006 of continuing growth in the residential real estate market. In 2007, Landlords breached their contracts, and in 2008, the U.S. housing market crashed. Subsequently, Tenants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>sued for lost profits. Before the case was tried, however, the judge barred Landlords from introducing any \u201cevidence of, or ... arguments based upon, post-breach market conditions for the purpose of refuting [Tenants\u2019] claimed damages,\u201d thus precluding introduction of evidence of the real estate market downturn that occurred after the breach but before development of the Towers was to be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">The Landlords proffered that they would have offered expert testimony taking into account \u201cthe economic downturn and the resulting impact on the real estate market.\u201d Landlords\u2019 designated damages expert, R. Larry Johnson, according to his proffer, would have opined \u201cthat no profits would have been earned by [Tenants], even if there had been no breach, because the Tower I building would have been delivered into a rental market (in 2008 or 2009) which does not support the projections upon which [Tenants\u2019 expert\u2019s] conclusions are based.\u201d Landlords would have introduced expert testimony to rebut Tenants\u2019 damage claims, contending that Tenants\u2019 projections \u201care too high, and even slight decreases in market rental rate eliminates the profit in the damages claim.\u201d Furthermore, Landlords proffered expert testimony regarding the unrealistic nature of Tenants\u2019 projections when viewed in light of \u201cthe current market,\u201d the \u201c[sjtagnant rental rates in [the real estate] market over the last several years,\u201d and evidence of \u201cwhat the market is/was at the time the Project would have been available for rent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">At trial, Tenants\u2019 expert had estimated lost profits based on Tenants\u2019 profit projections made in October 2006 for the purposes of obtaining financing for the project.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury awarded damages in the amount of $36,350,239.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In this case, Landlords as well as Tenants had to rely on experts in economics and real estate. To that extent, the parties were evenly matched in their proffered expert testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>mony, until the trial court barred Landlords\u2019 proffered testimony on damages. Obviously neither method for defining lost profits, an inquiry that focuses on foreseeability at time of contracting as the Majority espouses, or market-based calculations from the anticipated time of completion sought by Landlords, can be other than speculative because the buildings in issue were never built. The trial court thus erred in allowing the use of Tenants\u2019 assumptions to prove the amount of damages but foreclosing Landlords from rebutting such projections with evidence of the real estate market as it existed at the time the development would have come to fruition.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Clearly, courts prefer a rule that allows admission of evidence of actual performance when such evidence is available. The Majority acknowledges as much when it contends that the cases cited by Landlords all consider the admissibility of evidence of post-breach substitute performance and notes that \u201cnone of Landlords\u2019 Maryland cases directly support admitting post-breach market evidence to prove lost profits.\u201d Op. at 416, 56 A.3d at 187. In <em>Macke Company v. Pizza of Gaithersburg, Inc., </em>we noted that plaintiffs substitute performance after the breach but before trial might be \u201ca more appropriate measure of damages\u201d because it is \u201cgrounded on ... actual experience.\u201d 259 Md. 479, 492, 270 A.2d 645, 652 (1970). We have further stated that \u201cthe actual gain made under the substituted contract must be considered in measuring the damages to which the builder is entitled.\u201d <em>M &amp; R Contractors &amp; Builders, Inc. v. Michael, </em>215 Md. 340, 356, 138 A.2d 350, 359 (1958). Thus, it is clear that when evidence of actual performance is available, any rule setting the benchmark for damages determinations either at the time of contracting or at the time of the breach must yield to more relevant evidence of \u201cplaintiffs \u2018actual experience\u2019 with substitute performance.\u201d Op. at 414, 56 A.3d at 186, quoting <em>Macke, </em>259 Md. at 493, 270 A.2d at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">This principle is supported by Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo\u2019s explanation in <em>Sinclair Refining Company v. Jenkins Petroleum Process Company, </em>that post-breach evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>actual performance must be admitted to avoid providing a financial windfall based on inaccurate prediction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">The law will make the best appraisal that it can, summoning to its service whatever aids it can command.... At times the only evidence available may be that supplied by testimony of experts as to the state of the art, the character of the improvement, and the probable increase of efficiency or saving of expense.... This will generally be the case if the trial follows quickly after the issue of the patent. But a different situation is presented if years have gone by before the evidence is offered. Experience is then available to correct uncertain prophecy. Here is a book of wisdom that courts may not neglect. We find no rule of law that sets a clasp upon its pages, and forbids us to look within.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">289 U.S. 689, 697-98, 53 S.Ct. 736, 739, 77 L.Ed. 1449, 1456 (1933) (internal citations omitted). Justice Cardozo further determined that \u201c[t]o correct uncertain prophecies in [measuring the damages for a breach of contract] is not to charge the offender with elements of value non-existent at the time of his offense. It is to bring out and expose to light the elements of value that were there from the beginning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 698, 53 S.Ct. at 739, 77 L.Ed. at 1456 (allowing evidence of the actual profits gained from defendant\u2019s post-breach use of the plaintiffs device for purposes of proving damages).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The question then becomes, how should lost profits be computed when actual performance is not available as a benchmark. Faced with such a situation, post-contract market evidence has been admitted to prove lost profits. <em>Hoang </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>v. Hewitt Avenue Associates, LLC </em>involved the breach of a sales contract for two adjacent parcels of raw land on which town homes were to be built. 177 Md.App. 562, 936 A.2d 915 (2007). In the case, a developer \u201csought to recover collateral lost profits, <em>i.e., </em>the profits it anticipated it would have realized upon the sale of the 14 town houses it planned to construct on the property, and would have constructed but for [the sellers\u2019] breach by failure to convey.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607, 936 A.2d at 941-42. The sales contract, executed in May 2004, was to close within 60 days. When, in July 2004, the sellers failed to close on the sale, the developer filed suit. Following entry of default against the sellers, the court held an evidentiary hearing on the issue of damages in April 2005. At that hearing, the trial court admitted expert testimony regarding estimated profits on the town homes that were never built. Specifically, the trial court admitted testimony about:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">... the costs [that the developer] likely would have incurred in developing the land into a community of 14 town houses, the probability of the completed town houses being sold in that area of Montgomery County, the prices the finished town houses would have fetched on the real estate market as it existed at the relevant time, and the profit that would have been returned to [the developer] on the expected sales.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJW\"><em>Id. </em>at 611, 936 A.2d at 945. The testimony of the expert real estate appraiser, James Donnelly, was based upon his appraisals of the land dependant upon comparable sales and market conditions <em>at the time of the 2005 hearing. </em>Additionally, Mr. Donnelly had opined that the profit projections were conservative based on the residential real estate market as it existed at the time of the 2005 hearing. The trial court referenced those \u201cconservative\u201d estimates in finding that \u201cthe amount of profits in this case can be determined with reasonable certainty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 936 A.2d at 922. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s award of lost profits, concluding that the evidence the of post-contracting real estate market admitted at the hearing was \u201clegally sufficient to prove that [the developer] sustained collateral lost profits due to the breach of contract to convey the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610-11, 936 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>944 (2007). Clearly, when actual performance is absent, evidence of post-contract conditions is admissible and is not rejected as too speculative, unforeseeable and lacking reasonable certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">In fact, in the present case, the evidence adduced by Tenants was more speculative than that put forth by the developers in <em>Hoang, </em>based as it was on \u201cmarket conditions as of October, the October 2006 time frame, to determine whether or not the assumptions that were utilized in [Tenants\u2019 projections] prepared at that time were reasonable assumptions.\u201d Tenants relied on projections of a real estate market three to five years in the future, which turned out, as we know, to be unreliable. As such, it was no more certain than Landlords\u2019 proffered testimony as to the state of the real estate market when the Towers would have been built and reached the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The Majority contends, however, that post-breach market evidence is not \u201ca necessary part of any consequential lost profits claim.\u201d Op. at 417, 56 A.3d at 188. Practical application of the Majority\u2019s rule would require that the Landlords here were guarantors of future profits and could not introduce similarly speculative evidence of potential gains and losses to mitigate lost profit damages. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts expressly disclaims such a scenario when it states, \u201c[t]he expectation interest is not based on the injured party\u2019s hopes when [it] made the contract but on the actual value that the contract would have had to [it] had it been performed.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Restatement (Second) of Contracts Section 344, comment b, at 104 (1981). The Restatement provides an example that is analogous to the situation in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">A makes a contract with B under which A is to pay B for drilling an oil well on B\u2019s land, adjacent to that of A, for development and exploration purposes. Both A and B believe that the well will be productive and will substantially enhance the value of A\u2019s land in an amount that they estimate to be $1,000,000. Before A has paid anything, B breaks the contract by refusing to drill the well. Other exploration then proves that there is no oil in the region. A\u2019s expectation interest is zero.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 344, illustration 5 at 105. Although relied upon by this Court in 1987, this Restatement provision governing lost profits are not addressed by the Majority. <em>David Sloane, Inc. v. Stanley G. House &amp; Associates, </em>311 Md. 36, 42, 532 A.2d 694, 697 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In determining lost profits when no evidence of actual performance is available, admission of evidence to assist the jury in determining damages that are as close as possible to the actual value of performance is a necessity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> By allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Tenants to exclude evidence of post-breach market conditions, the Majority effectively puts the Landlords in the position of \u201cA\u201d in the Restatement example, thereby awarding Tenants damages based upon projections that the Landlords were not permitted to rebut.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">By embracing the jury verdict that was not informed by the Landlords\u2019 expert testimony, the Majority reinforces an award that is punitive in nature. It is clear from the evidence presented at trial that the apparently willful and acrimonious breach on the part of the Landlords colored the jury\u2019s damage award. The trial court admitted an email from Landlords to their former counsel requesting that counsel \u201cstop the bastards,\u201d and in denying Landlords\u2019 pre-trial motion in limine to exclude this communication, the trial court reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">I think a jury has a right to know how everything was formed, and what happened.... I also think [the discovery] goes to credibility. If they think that one side is basically trying to undermine the other side, a jury can evaluate their credibility by examining that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">And, also motive and intent, I think are relevant in this case.... [I]f you had no defense, other than, yes, we breached it, we screwed the deal royally, we\u2019re the bad guys, and let\u2019s basically only talk dollars and cents, then I probably would take a different position.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The Majority references the \u201cbastards\u201d e-mail, suggesting it may have been the \u201csmoking gun\u201d in the case, op. at 402-08, 56 A.3d at 179, highlighting the spectre that the damages awarded are really punitive in nature because, what would it be a \u201csmoking gun\u201d of, other than willfulness? Certainly we should not be sanctioning punitives in the guise of \u201clost profits.\u201d The Landlords should have had their day in court; I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Judge HARRELL has authorized me to state that he joins this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\">.

This Court looked to the Restatement provision governing \"the measure of damages for breach of contract\u201d in <em>David Sloane, Inc. v. Stanley G. House &amp; Associates, </em>in its reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">The measure of damages for breach of contract is addressed generally in Restatement (Second) Contracts, [Section] 347 (1981) which recognizes that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">\"the injured party has a right to damages based on his expectation interest as measured by</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">(a) the loss in the value to him of the other party\u2019s performance caused by its failure or deficiency, plus</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">(b) any other loss, including incidental or consequential loss, caused by the breach, less</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>(c) any cost or other loss that he has avoided by not having to perform.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">311 Md. 36, 42, 532 A.2d 694, 697 (1987). The \"expectation interest\u201d that the <em>Sloane </em>Court cited is defined in Section 344(a) of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts as a promisee\u2019s \"interest in having the benefit of his bargain by being put in as good a position as he would have been in had the contract been performed.\u201d Section 347(c) of the Restatement contemplates that a factor in damages is loss avoided by saving a party from financial injury. The evidence proffered, but not received, would have shown that the market had deteriorated to the point that the Tenants avoided financial disaster as a result of the Landlords\u2019 breach. That evidence should have been allowed under the Restatement as the cost avoided by the Tenants \"not having to perform.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts, \u00a7 344(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b512-9\">. See 11 Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 55.3, at 7 (Rev. ed.2005) (stating that the aim of contract damages is to \"put the injured party in as good a position as that party would have been in if performance had been rendered as promised\"). <em>See also Knapp v. Eagle Property Management Corp., </em>54 F.3d 1272, 1282 (7th Cir.1995) (\"Defendants cannot be forced to put [plaintiff] in a better position than she would have been absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>their conduct.\u201d); <em>Dopp v. Pritzker, </em>38 F.3d 1239, 1248 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that the trial court's instructions that \"full damages ... reflect the amount necessary to put Dopp in as good a position as he would have been if the oral contract had been fully performed\u201d amounted to \"virtually a hornbook restatement and application of the concept of contractual wholeness.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\">. By setting the threshold after which market evidence may not be considered at the time of contracting, the Majority moves the bar further back in time, from the 2006 \"time of the breach\u201d inquiry that Tenants request and that the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals used, to 2004, when the ground leases were executed. <em>CR-RSC Tower I, LLC v. RSC Tower I, LLC, </em>202 Md.App. 307, 337, 344, 32 A.3d 456, 473, 478 (2011). The Majority\u2019s rule effectively requires evidence that is more speculative and uncertain than even the 2006 projections, misguided in themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
