Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). <em>Miranda </em>requires the police to advise the suspect that \u201che has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602. Only if the suspect, upon receiving valid warnings, makes a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of the rights embodied in the warnings may the police question the suspect. <em>Id. </em>at 478-79, 86 S.Ct. 1602. In the present case, we must decide whether the police complied with both the \u201cwarnings\u201d and \u201cwaiver\u201d requirements of <em>Miranda </em>before interrogating Petitioner, Ramiro Arce Gonzalez.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Petitioner is a Mexican immigrant who does not speak or comprehend the English language. His native language is Mixtee, an indigenous language spoken in a particular region of Mexico.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The police arrested Petitioner in connection with a murder. Through a state trooper who used a combination of Spanish and, in explaining the words \u201ccourt\u201d and \u201cattorney,\u201d Mixtee, the police issued the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and received Petitioner\u2019s waiver of the rights embodied in those warnings. The same state trooper acted as the interpreter during the subsequent interrogation, which was conducted entirely in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Spanish. During the interrogation Petitioner made a statement connecting him to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Before trial, Petitioner sought suppression of the statement on the grounds that he did not receive proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings and, consequently, was unable to make a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of the rights addressed in those warnings. The suppression court denied the motion. Petitioner\u2019s statement to the police was admitted into evidence at trial, and he was convicted of first degree murder and related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Petitioner argued, among other claims of error, that the State failed to prove that he was properly advised of, and validly waived, the <em>Miranda </em>rights. A panel of the Court of Special Appeals issued an unreported opinion holding that the record developed at the suppression hearing sufficed to permit the court to rule that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and Petitioner\u2019s waiver complied with constitutional dictates. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The trial that led to Petitioner\u2019s conviction for first degree premeditated murder was conducted over three days in October 2009. The crime, however, had occurred four years earlier.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">The record discloses that, on the night of October 15, 2005, the victim, Cheryl Williams, joined Petitioner and his acquaintance, Rutilio Melo, in a minivan. Melo drove the minivan to a site near a wooded area of Princess Anne, Somerset County, where Williams later was murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Investigation of the crime led the police soon to focus on Melo. The police arrested and interviewed Melo, who, like Petitioner, speaks the dialect Mixtee Alto. Melo, with Trooper Ed Torres interpreting in Spanish, implicated Petitioner in the murder. Within hours, the police arrested Petitioner. With Trooper Torres interpreting in Spanish, Petitioner made a statement to the police. In that statement Petitioner admitted that he accompanied Melo to the site where he, Petitioner, had sexual intercourse with the victim; Melo used a car jack to bludgeon the victim to death; and he, Petitioner, assisted Melo in moving the body further into a wooded area and then disposing of the murder weapon. Petitioner later filed a motion to suppress that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\"><em>The suppression </em>hearing<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">A suppression hearing was held to determine the admissibility of the statement Petitioner made during the police interrogation. Detective Sergeant George Nelson, the lead investigator, described the interrogation, which took place at the Princess Anne State Police Barrack. Detective Nelson testified that Trooper Torres issued Petitioner the <em>Miranda </em>warnings in Spanish, using a Maryland State Police (MSP) 180 form. That process consumed 22 minutes and was not recorded. Detective Nelson then conducted the interrogation, with Trooper Torres interpreting for Petitioner, in Spanish. Pursuant to his usual practice, Detective Nelson first conducted what he called a \u201cpre-interview\u201d to determine whether Petitioner had any valuable information; that pre-interview likewise was not recorded. After the pre-interview, Detective Nelson and Trooper Torres left the room. They returned several hours later to conduct a second interrogation of Petitioner, which was recorded on audiotape.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Detective Nelson testified to his observations of how Petitioner comprehended what was being interpreted in Spanish during the issuance of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and subsequent interrogation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">[Petitioner] would shrug his shoulders, shake his head. Sometimes he would say si. Even prior to Trooper Torres finishing his question, the responses were, in most instances, normal, almost immediate. There wasn\u2019t a pause like he was trying to figure out what Trooper Torres was saying. I didn\u2019t see a problem. If I did, I wouldn\u2019t have continued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADC\">Trooper Torres also testified at the hearing. Much of his testimony focused on his issuance of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Petitioner, Petitioner\u2019s waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights, and the subsequent interrogation, during which Trooper Torres served as the interpreter. Trooper Torres testified that he was not a certified interpreter, but his parents were born in Puerto Rico. Although he was born in the United States, Trooper Torres lived in Puerto Rico until the age of nine or ten, where he spoke predominantly Spanish in the home. He testified that he regularly serves as an unofficial interpreter when Spanish-speakers are arrested. Trooper Torres explained that there are times when he recognizes that an individual for whom he is interpreting does not comprehend what is being translated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARo\">Generally when I do interpret and I discover that the person I\u2019m translating to doesn\u2019t understand what I\u2019m speaking or what I\u2019m trying to \u2014 the point I\u2019m trying to get across, I will backtrack and first what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll translate for them. If they don\u2019t understand, they need to tell me, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Then I\u2019ll break it down in layman\u2019s terms, so to speak. I\u2019ll rephrase it or change the wording, and generally that will \u2014 and then I\u2019ll ask them, \u201cDo you understand now,\u201d and they\u2019ll give me the proper response yes or no. And if the answer is no, then I\u2019ll just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>change the way I ask the question. And most \u2014 well, they always ask \u2014 I always ask, \u201cDo you understand now?\u201d They\u2019ll reply, \u201cYes, I understand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Turning to Petitioner\u2019s case in particular, Trooper Torres testified that he first encountered Petitioner when he arrested Petitioner at his home. At that time, Torres communicated in Spanish with others at the house and then with Petitioner, while placing him under arrest. Trooper Torres testified that, at the State Police Barrack, he and Detective Nelson went into the interview room together to meet with Petitioner. Trooper Torres described that at the outset he identified himself and Detective Nelson as police officers, and he advised Petitioner that he was a subject of a murder investigation and that is why he was placed under arrest. Trooper Torres delivered all of this in Spanish and Petitioner responded in Spanish that he understood. Trooper Torres testified that \u201cthere was no confusion in [Petitioner\u2019s] face. There was no doubt in my mind that he understood what I was telling him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Trooper Torres testified that he next administered the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Petitioner in Spanish. Trooper Torres explained that he read from a Spanish language copy of a <em>Miranda </em>rights card and then translated into Spanish each right listed on the MSP 180 form, which contained the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, line by line.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After each line, Trooper Torres <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>asked Petitioner, \u201cDo you understand[?].\u201d If Petitioner indicated that he did not understand, Trooper Torres would rephrase each <em>Miranda </em>right and warning until he was satisfied that Petitioner understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Trooper Torres stated that, during his issuance of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Petitioner indicated that he did not understand the Spanish words for \u201ccourt\u201d and \u201cattorney.\u201d In order to explain those words to Petitioner, Trooper Torres read from a card the phonetic spelling of what he believed to be the Mixtee versions of those two words. Trooper Torres explained that he obtained the phonetic spelling of \u201ccourt\u201d and \u201cattorney\u201d in Mixtee from the sister of Petitioner\u2019s confederate, Rutilio Melo. Torres testified that, while administering the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Melo earlier that day,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">I made contact with [Melo\u2019s] sister who was also there at the barrack, and I would ask her what was the Mixtecan word for attorney, judge and court because those are words that [Melo] did not understand at that point. And she actually wrote them down phonetically for me, and then I went back into the interview with Melo and said it in [the] Mixtecan word for it, and at that point he did understand the <em>Miranda.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Trooper Torres could not recall what Mixtee words he used in advising Petitioner. Yet he testified that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">[w]hen [Petitioner] had a question on a certain portion of it, I would stop____And that\u2019s when I utilized that paper I used with the other subject, translated into Mixtecan, and I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>just said it phonetically. And I even asked him, am I saying it right, and if he understood, and he would say yes, so then I would proceed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Similarly, Trooper Torres stated that, when Petitioner indicated he did not understand,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">I would stop, explain it again just in layman\u2019s terms. And if he still didn\u2019t understand, I would say, \u201cOkay, what part am I saying do you not understand?\u201d And then he would say whatever word he didn\u2019t understand. Again, attorney, abogado. And then I would say \u2014 I refer to my little note that the sister had provided me, and I would say, \u201cAbogado means this.\u201d And he would say, \u201cOkay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Trooper Torres added that he could tell from the expression on Petitioner\u2019s face that he understood what was meant by the Mixtee version of \u201cattorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Trooper Torres testified that, after interpreting the five lines of warnings from the MSP 180 form, and concluding that Petitioner understood the warnings, he proceeded to interpret for Petitioner the portion of the form that set forth \u201can acknowledgment saying that he has read or have had read the explanation of his rights to him. And I asked him if that\u2019s correct, sign that line. And I had my finger on the signature line. And he did sign it, and he put the date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Trooper Torres then detailed how he reviewed with Petitioner the \u201cwaiver\u201d portion of the MSP 180 form. He read the Spanish version on the <em>Miranda </em>rights card and then went over the form and translated it for Petitioner. Torres testified: \u201cI translated it for him what the waiver of his rights was and asked him if he had any questions to ask me, and if that was correct, if he was waiving his rights, to sign that line and I pointed to the signature line, and he did.\u201d Trooper Torres confirmed that \u201ceach one of these lines\u201d on the form was \u201ctranslated word for word.\u201d Trooper Torres repeated that at no time did he fail to address Petitioner\u2019s lack of understanding. Petitioner signed the waiver of rights on the MSP 180 form.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Once the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were issued and Petitioner executed the written waiver, Trooper Torres interpreted for Petitioner and Detective Nelson as the latter began the unrecorded pre-interview, which was conducted entirely in Spanish and English. Petitioner\u2019s responses in Spanish were \u201cimmediate.\u201d Torres, directing his remark to the prosecutor, elaborated: \u201cJust as we\u2019re having a conversation, a dialogue between you and I, [Petitioner\u2019s] responses were accurate with the question that I would ask, he would immediately reply with a correct answer. It wasn\u2019t like a wrong answer [was] given.\u201d Torres provided an example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">[T]he question [from Detective Nelson] was, \u201cDo you remember the time \u2014 what time it was?\u201d And I interpreted it in Spanish, and I asked him in Spanish, \u201cDo you remember what time it was?\u201d And his reply was, \u201cNo, I did not have a watch with me.\u201d And that was all in Spanish. It was immediate, no hesitation. There was no facial gestures of confusion, no stuttering or pondering, searching for words. His replies were immediate and correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">At no time during the pre-interview did Petitioner ask for a further explanation of the questions asked. Trooper Torres similarly testified that during the subsequent, recorded interrogation Petitioner responded in Spanish to the questions and he \u201c[n]ever stuttered\u201d and he \u201cdidn\u2019t indicate to me that he did not understand what I was saying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The State introduced without objection a transcript and audiotape of the recorded interrogation. The judge listened to the tape for the express purpose of determining for himself whether, as the trooper had described, Petitioner answered without hesitation the questions that were put to him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">On cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses, defense counsel established that a normal reading in English of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings takes approximately 32 seconds but that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>according to Detective Nelson\u2019s report, it took 22 minutes to advise Petitioner of those same rights. Trooper Torres' testified that he translated each of the warnings, as set forth on the MSP 180 form, \u201cword for word\u201d and asked Petitioner if he understood. The trooper acknowledged, though, that he could not recall exactly what he said in explaining to Petitioner what was meant by each of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Petitioner did not testify at the suppression hearing. Defense counsel asked the court to take judicial notice of a transcript of a hearing that had occurred two months earlier, on May 7, 2009. That earlier hearing, presided over by the same judge as presided at the suppression hearing, had been held to determine whether defense counsel was able to communicate effectively with his client, Petitioner, and whether Petitioner would be able to comprehend the proceedings. Two interpreters were present at the May 2009 hearing: Jose Lopez, who interpreted from English into Spanish; and Jose Gonzalez, who interpreted from Spanish into Mixtee Bajo. Petitioner\u2019s defense attorney had proffered at that hearing that he was having \u201can extraordinary amount of difficulty in communicating\u201d with Petitioner. According to defense counsel, the two interpreters also \u201cseemed to be having a great deal of difficulty in establishing true communication with\u201d Petitioner, in part because the Mixtee interpreter spoke the Mixtee Bajo dialect, while Petitioner spoke Mixtee Alto. The court determined at the May 2009 hearing that, in order \u201cto be effective, we need to try again to find a Mixteco Alto interpreter.\u201d The suppression hearing judge stated that he would consider what had occurred at that May hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">At the conclusion of the suppression hearing, the court heard argument of counsel and then ruled, denying the motion to suppress. The court framed the relevant question as whether, in light of the totality of the circumstances, Petitioner \u201ccould sufficiently understand Spanish in order to waive his rights under <em>Miranda </em>and could freely and voluntarily respond to the questions posed to him by Somerset County Detective Sergeant Nelson and interpreted into Spanish by Maryland State Trooper Torres.\u201d The court stated that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\u201cbelieve[d] the testimony of Trooper Torres to be both truthful and persuasive.\u201d Relying heavily on the testimony of Trooper Torres, the court ruled, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201cthe defendant voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>Rights.\u201d The court found Trooper Torres\u2019s testimony to be supported by the observations of Detective Sergeant Nelson and corroborated by the audio-taped interview. The court also found that Petitioner\u2019s responses to the questions posed by the officers during the interrogation were \u201cin uninterpreted Spanish, were immediate and without hesitation in such a manner to suggest that [Petitioner] fully understood the questions by the officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\n<em>The trial and appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Petitioner was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Somerset County. The jury found Petitioner guilty of first degree murder, first degree assault, and second degree assault. After merging the two assaults with the murder conviction, the court sentenced Petitioner to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Petitioner argued, among other claims of error, that the statement he gave to the police was obtained in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>Petitioner argued that the State failed in its burden to prove the constitutional adequacy of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and his waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights was neither informed nor voluntary. The intermediate appellate court held in an unreported opinion that the State had carried its burden of proving the constitutionality of both the warnings and waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-9\">1. Can the State ever meet its burden of persuasion in establishing that the language used by an advising officer reasonably conveyed the content of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and that the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his rights when the officer issues the warnings in a foreign language and the State fails to place the content of those warnings into the record at trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>2. Did the State fail to meet its burden in establishing that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings issued to the Petitioner reasonably conveyed his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that his waiver of those warnings was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary where the advising officer issued the warnings in a combination of Spanish and Mixtee, a Pre-columbian indigenous language with no relation to Spanish that was foreign to the officer; where the State failed to introduce the Mixtee language warnings used; where the officer testified that Petitioner had difficulty understanding the warnings, including the terms \u201ccourt\u201d and \u201cattorney\u201d; and where Petitioner was an 18 year old Mixtee Indian who had recently immigrated to the United States with no prior knowledge of the court system and no education?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\">3. Did the Court of Special Appeals improperly shift the burden of persuasion in the determination of the constitutionality of the <em>Miranda </em>waiver to the Petitioner when it required that the Petitioner present sufficient evidence that he did not understand Spanish when he was informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We granted the petition. <em>Gonzalez v. State, </em>425 Md. 396, 41 A.3d 570 (2012). Because all three questions implicate the denial of the motion to suppress Petitioner\u2019s statement to the police, we shall address them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">When reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, \u201cwe confine ourselves to what occurred at the suppression hearing. We view the evidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion, here, the State.\u201d <em>Lee v. State, </em>418 Md. 136, 148, 12 A.3d 1238 (2011) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe defer to the motions court\u2019s factual findings and uphold them unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Luckett, </em>413 Md. 360, 375, n. 3, 993 A.2d 25 (2010)). The credibility of the witnesses, the weight to be given to the evidence, and the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>come within the province of the suppression court. <em>Longshore v. State, </em>399 Md. 486, 499, 924 A.2d 1129 (2007) (\u201cMaking factual determinations, <em>ie. </em>resolving conflicts in the evidence, and weighing the credibility of witnesses, is properly reserved for the fact finder. In performing this role, the fact finder has the discretion to decide which evidence to credit and which to reject.\u201d (internal citations omitted)). \u201cWe, however, make our own independent constitutional appraisal, by reviewing the relevant law and applying it to the facts and circumstances of this case.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>418 Md. at 148-49, 12 A.3d 1238 (quoting <em>Luckett, </em>413 Md. at 375, n. 3, 993 A.2d 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Petitioner contests the constitutional adequacy of both the warnings and the waiver. He relies on the undisputed facts that: (1) his native language is Mixtee (sub-dialect Alto), which is not merely a form of the Spanish language, but a different language altogether; (2) at the time of the interrogation, October 2005, Petitioner neither spoke nor comprehended English; and (3) Trooper Torres, who does not know Mixtee, could not recall, and the record does not otherwise demonstrate explicitly, what he said to convey to Petitioner the meaning of the words \u201ccourt\u201d and \u201cattorney,\u201d as those terms are employed in the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. As for his claim that he could not possibly have made a knowing and intelligent waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights, Petitioner relies on these same undisputed facts and the added facts that, at the time of the interrogation, he was barely 18 years old, uneducated, and a recent immigrant to the United States with no prior contact with our criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Petitioner acknowledges the general rule that the State need not prove exactly what was said in issuing the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. He asserts nonetheless that, when it is shown that a suspect is being given <em>Miranda </em>warnings in a language that the advising officer does not himself speak fluently, the State must produce a precise record of \u201cthe critical words used to obtain that waiver,\u201d whether it be a recording, a transcript, notes, or exact recollection of the specific foreign-language words used. Petitioner emphasizes that Trooper Torres could not recall what Mixtee words were used to explain \u201ccourt\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>\u201cattorney.\u201d This lack of specificity in the record, Petitioner argues, prevented the suppression court and any reviewing court from determining the constitutional adequacy of the warnings. Petitioner further argues that Trooper Torres\u2019s use of the Spanish language, both in conveying the balance of the warnings (all but the words \u201ccourt\u201d and \u201cattorney\u201d) and in obtaining Petitioner\u2019s waiver, likewise was inadequate to convey to Petitioner either the substance of the <em>Miranda </em>rights or what he was waiving when he signed the MSP 180 form.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The State counters that, even without a record of the Mixtee words used by Trooper Torres to convey the words \u201ccourt\u201d and \u201cattorney\u201d to Petitioner, the State met its burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the warnings satisfy the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny. The State directs us to the testimony of Trooper Torres, who the suppression court expressly found to be truthful. Trooper Torres explained in detail how he advised Petitioner of the <em>Miranda </em>rights in Spanish, how Trooper Torres obtained the Mixtee translation of certain words from Melo\u2019s sister, and how Petitioner indicated eventually that he understood each warning contained on the MSP 180 form. The State points out that Trooper Torres\u2019s testimony is corroborated by the audiotaped interview, where the Petitioner appeared to answer questions in Spanish appropriately and without hesitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">We resolve the parties\u2019 dispute by resort, first, to the applicable law. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects individuals from being compelled to make self-incriminating statements: \u201cNo person shall ... be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> U.S. Const, amend. V. In the seminal case of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>the Court recognized that a \u201cpolice-dominated atmosphere\u201d can be inherently coercive and potentially \u201cundermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.\u201d 884 U.S. at 445, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>467, 86 S.Ct. 1602. The Court held in <em>Miranda </em>that, \u201c[i]n order to combat these pressures and to permit a full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination, the accused must be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights and the exercise of those rights must be fully honored.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 86 S.Ct. 1602.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The prophylactic measures developed in <em>Miranda </em>are the now-familiar warnings that law enforcement personnel are required to convey to a suspect before embarking on any custodial interrogation: \u2018</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">[A suspect] must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The rights accorded by <em>Miranda </em>can be waived. <em>See id. </em>at 475, 86 S.Ct. 1602. The State has a \u201cheavy burden\u201d to establish that a suspect has waived those rights, <em>id., </em>which means that the State must shoulder \u201cthe burden to establish waiver by a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d <em>Berghuis v. Thompkins, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 2261, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010). In order to meet that burden, the State \u201cmust show that the waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary under the \u2018high standar[d] of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights [set forth in] <em>Johnson v. Zerbst,\u2019\u201d </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). <em>Maryland v. Shatzer, </em>559 U.S. 98,-, 130 S.Ct. 1213, 1219, 175 L.Ed.2d 1045 (2010) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 475, 86 S.Ct. 1602).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">No particular wording or \u201cprecise formulation\u201d need be used to impart the nature of the Fifth Amendment rights to the suspect. <em>Duckworth v. Eagan, </em>492 U.S. 195, 202, 109 S.Ct. 2875, 106 L.Ed.2d 166 (1989); <em>see Florida v. Powell, </em>559 U.S. 50,-, 130 S.Ct. 1195, 1204, 175 L.Ed.2d 1009 (2010) (\u201cThe four warnings <em>Miranda </em>requires are invariable, but this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Court has not dictated the words in which the essential information must be conveyed.\u201d). Rather, the proper \u201cinquiry is simply whether the warnings reasonably \u2018conve[y] to [a suspect] his rights as required by <em>Miranda.\u2019 \u201d Duckworth, </em>492 U.S. at 203, 109 S.Ct. 2875 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>California v. Prysock, </em>453 U.S. 355, 361, 101 S.Ct. 2806, 69 L.Ed.2d 696 (1981) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">In determining the adequacy of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, we look to the totality of the advisements. <em>State v. Luckett, </em>413 Md. 360, 379-80, 993 A.2d 25 (2010).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">[I]f the warnings, viewed in the totality, in any way misstate the suspect\u2019s rights to silence and counsel, or mislead or confuse the suspect with respect to those rights, then the warnings are constitutionally infirm, rendering any purported waiver of those rights constitutionally defective and requiring suppression of any subsequent statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 380, 993 A.2d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Even if the warnings themselves pass constitutional muster, the State still must prove, upon proper challenge, that the suspect\u2019s waiver of the rights conveyed in those warnings was knowing and voluntary. The adequacy of a suspect\u2019s waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights \u201cis not one of form, but rather whether the defendant <em>in fact </em>knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in the <em>Miranda </em>case.\u201d <em>North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979) (emphasis added). Therefore, although \u201cthe courts must presume that a defendant did not waive his rights\u201d and \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s burden is great\u201d to prove waiver, \u201cin at least some cases waiver can be clearly inferred from the actions and words of the person interrogated.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Berghuis, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2261.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">In evaluating the validity of a waiver in a given case, the court must consider \u201cthe particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. at 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019; <em>see Butler, </em>441 U.S. at 374-75, 99 S.Ct. 1755. This inquiry has \u201ctwo distinct dimensions\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>First, the relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception. Second, the waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it. Only if the \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u201d reveals both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda </em>rights have been waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\"><em>Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 421, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986) (quoting <em>Fare v. Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 725, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 61 L.Ed.2d 197 (1979)). This approach requires an examination of \u201call the circumstances surrounding the interrogation,\u201d including the individual\u2019s \u201cage, experience, education, background, and intelligence, and ... whether he has the capacity to understand the warnings given him, the nature of his Fifth Amendment rights, and the consequences of waiving those rights.\u201d <em>Fare, </em>442 U.S. at 725, 99 S.Ct. 2560; <em>accord McIntyre v. State, </em>309 Md. 607, 615-16, 526 A.2d 30 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Upon our independent review of the record developed at the suppression hearing, we conclude, for the reasons that follow, that the circuit court properly denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress his statement to the police. As we shall see, the facts found by the suppression court largely dictate our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\"><em>The </em>Miranda <em>warnings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">In evaluating the adequacy of the warnings issued by Trooper Torres, we begin with a crucial credibility determination made by the suppression court. The court stated that it \u201cbelieve[d] the testimony of Trooper Torres to be both truthful and persuasive.\u201d That credibility determination is virtually unassailable. Consequently, we, as the reviewing court, must accept as fact (as obviously did the suppression court) Trooper Torres\u2019s testimony concerning his impressions of Petitioner\u2019s comprehension of not only the Spanish language, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>but also the trooper\u2019s phonetic pronunciation of the Mixtee words for \u201ccourt\u201d and \u201cattorney.\u201d Indeed, the suppression court found that Petitioner \u201ccould sufficiently understand Spanish in order to waive his rights under <em>Miranda.\u201d </em>Implicit in that finding, moreover, is the suppression court\u2019s predicate (albeit unexpressed) finding that Petitioner sufficiently comprehended the <em>Miranda </em>warnings so as to enable him to make a valid waiver of the rights described therein.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">We therefore view the testimony of Trooper Torres as presenting an accurate recitation of what occurred as he delivered the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Petitioner. Based on Trooper Torres\u2019s recitation of what occurred, we, like the suppression court, are able to conclude the following: (1) with the exception of two words (\u201ccourt\u201d and \u201cattorney\u201d) Trooper Torres painstakingly \u2014 and, ultimately, successfully \u2014 conveyed to Petitioner in Spanish the balance of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings accurately set forth on the MSP 180 form;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (2) Trooper Torres\u2019s use of the phonetic spelling of what he understood to be the Mixtee words for \u201ccourt\u201d and \u201cattorney\u201d sufficiently conveyed to Petitioner, based on his reaction to the trooper\u2019s pronunciation, the meaning of court and attorney. To be sure, the State could have resolved all doubt in this regard had it been able to offer into evidence the note from which Trooper Torres read the phonetically spelled Mixtee words. Nonetheless, the evidence the State did present, which was fully credited by the suppression court, legally sufficed to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>that court\u2019s conclusion that the <em>Miranda </em>advisements were constitutionally adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Our conclusion that witness testimony may be sufficient to establish the adequacy of <em>Miranda </em>warnings delivered in a foreign language, without an audiotape or a transcript of the advisement, finds support in the decisions of other state supreme and federal courts. For example, in <em>United States v. Abdi Wali Dire, </em>680 F.3d 446, 470 (4th Cir.2012), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W.-(U.S. Oct. 2, 2012) (No. 12-6529), multiple defendants were advised of their <em>Miranda </em>rights in Somali through an interpreter. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that \u201cthe court could not determine the exact content of the warnings based on [the agent\u2019s] testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473. The Court determined that the district court had \u201creasonably accepted the testimony of [the advising agent],\u201d notwithstanding that \u201cthere were \u2018slight variations in the recollections\u2019 \u201d of the law enforcement personnel present during the advisement. <em>See also Perri v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>817 F.2d 448, 453 (7th Cir.1987) (affirming denial of habeas corpus petition based on testimony in the record and state court\u2019s implicit finding that defendant understood his rights, where <em>Miranda </em>warnings were administered in an Italian dialect different from defendant\u2019s dialect); <em>People v. Duck Wong, </em>18 Cal.3d 178, 133 Cal.Rptr. 511, 555 P.2d 297, 299, 302 (1976) (affirming trial court\u2019s determination, based on its evaluation of conflicting testimony regarding the content of the advisement and the accuracy of the translation, that proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings had been administered in Chinese using an acquaintance of the defendant as an interpreter); <em>Commonwealth v. Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 562 N.E.2d 797, 803 (1990) (affirming denial of motion to suppress a statement where <em>Miranda </em>warnings were administered in Spanish and suppression court considered officer\u2019s testimony, which included a recitation in Spanish of \u201capproximately the same warnings he gave to the defendant on the night of the arrest,\u201d despite testimony of an interpreter that the officer spoke with a \u201cheavy Anglo accent\u201d and used two imprecise words in his translation of the <em>Mi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number><em>randa </em>warnings into Spanish). <em>Cf. United States v. Tunis, </em>859 F.2d 953, 960-61 (D.C.Cir.1988) (reversing trial court\u2019s suppression of statements and noting the \u201cdubious relevance to the validity of [the defendant\u2019s] waiver\u201d of <em>Miranda </em>rights that the interrogation sessions were not audio- or videotaped, even though the equipment was readily available, because \u201cthere is no constitutional requirement that confessions be recorded by any particular means\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\"><em>Tague v. Louisiana, </em>444 U.S. 469, 100 S.Ct. 652, 62 L.Ed.2d 622 (1980), and <em>Hale v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 326, 247 A.2d 409 (1968), upon which Petitioner relies, do not undermine our conclusion that the record supports the suppression court\u2019s ruling. We glean the following from <em>Tague, </em>a seven-paragraph per curiam opinion. In that case, an officer testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">he read petitioner his <em>Miranda </em>rights from a card, that he could not presently remember what those rights were, that he could not recall whether he asked petitioner whether he understood the rights as read to him, and that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t say yes or no\u201d whether he rendered any tests to determine whether petitioner was literate or otherwise capable of understanding his rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">444 U.S. at 469, 100 S.Ct. 652. Citing <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Butler, </em>the <em>Tague </em>Court noted that the burden to establish the admissibility of the defendant\u2019s confession to the police rightly rests with the State. <em>Id. </em>at 470-71, 100 S.Ct. 652. The <em>Tague </em>Court held that the prosecution had not carried its burden because, \u201c[i]n this case, no evidence at all was introduced to prove that petitioner knowingly and intelligently waived his rights before making the inculpatory statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471, 100 S.Ct. 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Similarly, in <em>Hale, </em>the Court of Special Appeals held that a criminal defendant\u2019s statements were improperly admitted at trial. 5 Md.App. at 330, 247 A.2d 409. In that case, the advising officer testified that, before beginning questioning, he used a <em>Miranda </em>card located in the interrogation room to read and explain to the suspect his rights; the suspect read the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>card himself; and the suspect indicated that he understood those rights. <em>Id. </em>at 328-29, 247 A.2d 409. The State did not offer the card into evidence, and, although the officer stated that the suspect \u201cwas advised of his rights to counsel; he didn\u2019t have to say anything and anything that he did say could be used against him in court,\u201d the officer was unable to remember what else, if anything, was written on the card. <em>Id. </em>at 329,247 A.2d 409. The court found nothing in the record to establish that the suspect had been advised of his \u201cright to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during the interrogation,\u201d \u201c[n]or was he told that if indigent a lawyer would be appointed to represent him, as required by <em>Miranda.\u201d Id. </em>at 330, 247 A.2d 409. The <em>Hale </em>court (correctly, in our view) did not require that the content of the <em>Miranda </em>card be introduced into evidence. <em>Id. </em>Yet, \u201cit is not sufficient for the police officer to simply state that he advised the accused of his <em>Miranda </em>rights or that he read the <em>Miranda </em>card to him. There must be a clear-cut showing in the record that the requisite warnings were in fact given.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The present case is readily distinguishable from <em>Tague </em>and <em>Hale. </em>In <em>Tague, </em>unlike here, the advising officer did not testify as to what he said and did in the course of delivering the <em>Miranda </em>rights, much less did that officer detail, as Trooper Torres did, the efforts he made to guarantee, insofar as reasonably he could, that Petitioner comprehended the rights being explained to him. In <em>Hale, </em>unlike here, there was <em>no </em>evidence that the suspect was made aware of at least several of the key rights that <em>Miranda </em>requires be included in the advisement, including the right to consult with an attorney, to have the attorney present during questioning, and to have an attorney appointed by the court if he was indigent.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">We re-emphasize that, had the police audiotaped or, better still, audio\u2014 <em>and </em>videotaped the issuance of the <em>Miranda </em>rights and Petitioner\u2019s waiver of them, there would be little cause to decide, as the suppression court and two appellate courts have had to do, whether the warnings issued to Petitioner satisfy the constitutional standard of an adequate exp\u00eda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>nation of the rights dictated by <em>Miranda.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That said, we conclude that the suppression court, upon hearing \u2014 and fully crediting \u2014 the testimony of Trooper Torres, properly ruled that the State had carried its burden to prove the constitutionality of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><em>The </em>Miranda <em>waiver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">We likewise conclude that the State proved the constitutionality of Petitioner\u2019s waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights. Petitioner makes no allegation that he was threatened or coerced into making statements, that deceptive practices were used against him, or that his statements were the result of promises or inducements or that his will was overborne. Rather, Petitioner argues that his lack of comprehension of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, assessed together with his personal characteristics, made it impossible for him to have made a knowing waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Much of what we have said in analyzing the warnings given to Petitioner holds true for his waiver of the rights described in those warnings. Indeed, Petitioner\u2019s argument for why his waiver was \u201cunknowing\u201d rests largely upon the contention that he could not make a good waiver of the rights without being adequately informed of those rights. We have explained, <em>supra, </em>why that argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Nor was Petitioner\u2019s waiver rendered unknowing by the facts that, at the time, Petitioner was 18 years old, uneducated, and a recent immigrant to the United States unacquainted with this country\u2019s criminal justice system. Without more, these facts do not render Petitioner unable, as a matter of law, to make a knowing (or, for that matter, involuntary) waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Indeed, in <em>MeIn</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number><em>tyre v. State, </em>309 Md. 607, 526 A.2d 30 (1987), this Court affirmed a trial court\u2019s determination that a valid waiver had been obtained from an individual of a much younger age (15 years old), who, evidently, had no prior exposure to the criminal justice system. <em>Id. </em>at 625, 526 A.2d 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Petitioner also finds support for his position in the evidence offered at the suppression hearing that, at an earlier hearing held in May 2009, the same judge who presided at the suppression hearing had determined that a Mixtee Alto interpreter was required in order for Petitioner to be able to understand the trial proceedings and to permit effective communication between Petitioner and defense counsel. Petitioner\u2019s reliance on the May 2009 hearing is, in the end, unavailing. It does not follow from the judge\u2019s ruling at the May 2009 hearing that Petitioner was to have a Mixtee Alto interpreter at trial that Petitioner did not sufficiently comprehend the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and make a knowing waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights. Indeed, as the State points out, at the May 2009 hearing the judge did not have the benefit of listening to the audiotaped interrogation, which demonstrates Petitioner\u2019s ability to understand and answer questions posed in Spanish. <em>See, e.g., Campaneria v. Reid, </em>891 F.2d 1014, 1020 (2d Cir. 1989) (affirming district court\u2019s denial of habeas petition based on harmless error, but rejecting defendant\u2019s contention that he did not effectively waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights because he did not understand the warnings where <em>Miranda </em>warnings were delivered in English although defendant\u2019s native tongue was Spanish and appellate court was evidently aware that defendant \u201ctestified on his own behalf through an interpreter\u201d at trial); <em>United States v. Bernard S., </em>795 F.2d 749, 752 (9th Cir.1986) (affirming district court\u2019s finding that defendant validly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights where <em>Miranda </em>warnings were delivered in English and appellate court noted that defendant clearly had some difficulty with English, his native language was Apache, and \u201che was assisted at trial by an interpreter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Trooper Torres\u2019s testimony, corroborated by Detective Nelson, and credited by the suppression court, was that Petitioner appeared to Trooper Torres to comprehend and voluntarily execute, with his signature, the waiver portion of the MSP 180 form. The court also had the benefit of listening to the audiotaped interrogation. The court said, as to that, \u201c[AJlthough this Judge does not speak Spanish, in listening to the audiotape, the defendant\u2019s responses to the questions posed by the officers are in uninterpreted Spanish, were immediate and without hesitation in such a manner to suggest that defendant fully understood the questions by the officers.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The suppression court did not err in determining, based on the evidence the court chose to credit fully, that Petitioner made a knowing and voluntary waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">We hold that the suppression court reasonably could find, from the totality of the evidence offered by the State, not countered by testimony of Petitioner to the contrary,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>State proved both that proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings were adequately conveyed to Petitioner and that he knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights, before he was interrogated and made the statement he sought to suppress.

Petitioner argued to the suppression court, and reargues here, that the length of time Trooper Torres took in explaining the <em>Miranda </em>rights (22 minutes) is evidence of Petitioner\u2019s lack of comprehension. The suppression court saw no merit in the argument, given the totality of the evidence suggesting the contrary. Neither do we. If anything, the length of time Trooper Torres spent explaining the rights is indicative of his desire to ensure that Petitioner understood those rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b695-9\">. In their unreported opinion in this case our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals expressed the same sentiment this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-10\">[Wlhere officers are required to provide the <em>Miranda </em>warnings in a foreign language, we believe that the better practice is to either record the advisement of rights or, at a minimum, create a record of the words that the officer used so that a reviewing court can determine if the officer gave the warnings properly.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\">. We too have listened to the audiotaped interrogation and agree with the suppression court\u2019s conclusion that, judging from both the tempo and substance of Petitioner's responses, he appeared to understand Trooper Torres\u2019s Spanish interpretation of Detective Nelson\u2019s questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\">. The panel of the Court of Special Appeals in its unreported opinion referred (as we have done) to the fact that Petitioner did not testify at the suppression hearing. Petitioner contests in his third question presented that, by doing so, the panel shifted the burden to him to prove that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and his waiver were unconstitutional. He directs us to the following excerpt from the panel opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\">At the suppression hearing, Gonzalez failed to present any evidence to support his position that he did not understand Spanish when Trooper Torres informed him of his rights.... Although, at a suppression hearing, the burden to prove a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of rights rests with the State, <em>Johnson </em>[v. <em>Zerbst], </em>304 U.S. [458,] 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 [(1938)], where the State satisfies that burden and the defendant appeals, the defendant must be able to present sufficient evidence to support its allegation of error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">The panel, however, expressly disavowed any suggestion that it was shifting the burden to Petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Our conclusion should not be understood as placing the burden of proof in a suppression hearing on the defendant. As we stated above, the burden of proof quite clearly rests with the State----However, where the State satisfies that burden below, we require more than a proffer by the defendant\u2019s attorney to conclude that the trial court erred in reaching a factual conclusion. The trial court is in a better position to make such factual determinations, and we do not believe that there is sufficient evidence in the record to conclude that it was wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">We do not read the excerpt of the unreported opinion of the Court of Special Appeals upon which Petitioner relies as demonstrating a flawed analysis by that court of his <em>Miranda </em>claims. Indeed, this Court has noted that once the State had presented legally sufficient evidence to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights, <em>and </em>the suppression court credits that evidence and is persuaded by it, the defendant is hard-pressed on appeal to contend, as Petitioner has done here, that the suppression ruling was legally incorrect. <em>See Lee v. State, </em>418 Md. 136, 160, 12 A.3d 1238 (2011) (noting that the petitioner, though moving to suppress his statement to police as involuntarily obtained, did not testify that his confession was the product of the interrogating detective\u2019s coercive comment; thus, \"we do not have even [the petitioner\u2019s] word that [the detective\u2019s] improper comment overbore his will and produced his confession\u201d). But even if we were to conclude that our colleagues had intimated a burden shifting (which, as the panel opinion reflects, they did not) that conclusion would avail Petitioner not at all, because we are obliged to make an independent assessment of the suppression court's ruling.

Specifically, once the warnings are administered, \u201c[i]f the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>right to retained or appointed counsel.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 475, 86 S.Ct. at 1628, 16 L.Ed.2d at 724.

Second, the waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it. Only if the \u2018totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u2019 reveals both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda </em>rights have been waived.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-6\"><em>Moran v.

While in custody, charged with the murder of Cheryl Williams, the petitioner made the inculpatory statement whose admission is at issue in this case. In the statement, he admitted to having sexual intercourse with the victim, being present when she was bludgeoned to death, and helping Rutilio Melo, another suspect in the murder, hide her body. The petitioner\u2019s statement also suggested that the murder was premeditated.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">The petitioner subsequently moved to suppress his inculpatory statement. At the suppression hearing, Trooper Ed Torres, who gave the petitioner the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, testified as to how that process proceeded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Trooper Torres, who is fluent in Spanish but has no knowledge of Mixtee, gave the <em>Miranda </em>warnings in Spanish, using Maryland State Police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>(\u201cMSP\u201d) form 180.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He testified that it took twenty-two minutes to complete the warnings and get the petitioner\u2019s waiver, twenty-one minutes longer than usual. Describing the procedure he followed, Trooper Torres stated that he initially read the form in English, then translated it, word-for-word, to Spanish. In addition, he read the rights as set forth on a Spanish version of a <em>Miranda </em>card. When the petitioner would indicate that he did not understand what he was being told, Trooper Torres testified that he would simply rephrase those parts of the warning, in an effort to explain further, until the petitioner indicated that he understood. Trooper Torres testified that the petitioner indicated specifically that he did not understand the Spanish words for \u201ccourt\u201d and \u201cattorney.\u201d Not being fluent in Mixtee, Trooper Torres obtained what was purported to be the Mixtee words for \u201ccourt\u201d and \u201cattorney\u201d from the sister of the other suspect in the case, and then re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>read that portion of the rights form using those words. Trooper Torres did not testify as to what the Mixtee words were that he used, conceding that he could not remember them. Nor were the words reflected in any way in the trial record. Indeed, unlike the taking of the statement, the warning process was not recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">After obtaining the petitioner\u2019s written acknowledgment and waiver, Detective Nelson proceeded to conduct a pre-interview of the petitioner in English, with Trooper Torres translating to Spanish. According to the officers, the petitioner answered the questions without hesitation, and did not, at any time, ask for further explanation of the questions asked. A transcript and audiotape of the officers\u2019 subsequent interrogation was introduced into evidence, to enable the suppression judge to corroborate the description provided by Detective Nelson and Trooper Torres of the interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">On the basis of this testimony, and in light of the evidence before it, the suppression court denied the motion to suppress, finding that the petitioner knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">\u201cWe know that the question is not one of form with respect to <em>Miranda, </em>but rather, whether the defendant, in fact, knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in the <em>Miranda </em>case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">\u201cUnder the totality of the circumstances, the Court must determine whether defendant acted voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently in waiving his rights under <em>Miranda. </em>The Court must, as indicated, assess the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">\u201cIn this case, the Court believes the testimony of Trooper Torres to be both truthful and persuasive. He was a person in the best position as he is fluent in Spanish and English to review the <em>Miranda </em>form with the defendant to assess the defendant\u2019s level of understanding of the <em>Miranda </em>form. \u201cThe Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence, under the totality of the circumstances, after considering the testimony and the exhibits, that the defendant voluntarily, know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>ingly, and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>Rights, and his statement made thereafter was made without force or coercion, or was made \u2014 and was not made after any hope or promise made to the defendant. For those reasons, the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">A trial was then held, following which a jury convicted the petitioner of first degree murder, first degree assault, and second degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The petitioner\u2019s arguments, made on appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, that the State failed to prove either that he was properly advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights or that he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived those rights, were rejected by that court. The intermediate appellate court, heavily relying on the testimony of Detective Nelson and Trooper Torres, professed to be satisfied that \u201cthe State ... met its heavy burden to show that Gonzalez understood his rights and freely waived them,\u201d although it also concluded that \u201c[a]t the suppression hearing, Gonzalez failed to present any evidence to support his position that he did not understand Spanish when Trooper Torres informed him of his rights.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The petitioner subsequently petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted, <em>Gonzalez v. State, </em>425 Md. 396, 41 A.3d 570 (2012), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>\u201c1. Can the State ever meet its burden of persuasion in establishing that the language used by an advising officer reasonably conveyed the content of the Miranda, warnings and that the defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his rights when the officer issues the warnings in a foreign language and the State fails to place the content of those warnings into the record at trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u201c2.- Did the State fail to meet its burden in establishing that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings issued to the Petitioner reasonably conveyed his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that his waiver of those warnings was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary where the advising officer issued the warnings in a combination of Spanish and Mixtee, a Pre-columbian indigenous language with no relation to Spanish that was foreign to the officer; where the State failed to introduce the Mixtee language warnings used; where the officer testified that Petitioner had difficulty understanding the warnings, including the terms \u201ccourt\u201d and \u201cattorney\u201d; and where Petitioner was an 18 year old Mixtee Indian who has recently immigrated to the United States with no prior knowledge of the court system and no education?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\u201c3. Did the Court of Special Appeals improperly shift the burden of persuasion in the determination of the constitutionality of the <em>Miranda </em>waiver to the Petitioner when it required that the Petitioner present sufficient evidence that he did not understand Spanish when he was informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The majority affirms the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, and thus of the suppression court, largely on the basis of the suppression court\u2019s credibility determination regarding the testimony of Trooper Torres. <em>Gonzalez, </em>429 Md. at 651-53, 57 A.3d at 495-96. It concludes from that determination that the petitioner not only \u201csufficiently comprehended the <em>Miranda </em>warnings,\u201d but that this comprehension enabled the petitioner \u201cto make a valid waiver of the right described therein.\u201d <em>Id., </em>429 Md. at 652-53, 57 A.3d at 496. To be sure, the majority acknowledges that \u201c\u2018it is not sufficient for [a] police officer to simply state that he advised the accused of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>Miranda </em>rights,\u2019 \u201d and that the State must set forth \u201c \u2018a clear-cut showing in the record that the requisite warnings were in fact given.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>429 Md. at 656, 57 A.3d at 498 (quoting <em>Hale v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 326, 330, 247 A.2d 409, 411 (1968)). Nonetheless, agreeing with the State, that Trooper Torres\u2019 testimony, along with the MSP 180 form signed by the petitioner, was sufficient to \u2014 and did, in fact \u2014 prove that <em>Miranda </em>advisements were reasonably conveyed to the petitioner, it is convinced that \u201cthe suppression court, upon hearing\u2014 and fully crediting \u2014 the testimony of Trooper Torres, properly ruled that the State had carried its burden to prove the constitutionality of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>Id., </em>429 Md. at 657, 57 A.3d at 498. As to Trooper Torres\u2019 testimony, the majority views it as indicating that, \u201c(1) with the exception of two words (\u2018court\u2019 and \u2018attorney\u2019) Trooper Torres painstakingly \u2014 and, ultimately, successfully \u2014 conveyed to Petitioner in Spanish the balance of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings accurately set forth on the MSP 180 form; and (2) Trooper Torres\u2019s use of the phonetic spelling of what he understood to be the Mixtee words for \u2018court\u2019 and \u2018attorney\u2019 sufficiently conveyed to Petitioner, based on his reaction to the trooper\u2019s pronunciation, the meaning of court and attorney.\u201d <em>Id., </em>429 Md. at 653, 57 A.3d at 496 (footnote omitted). It consequently holds that \u201cthe suppression court reasonably could find, from the totality of the evidence offered by the State ... that the State proved both that proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings were adequately conveyed to Petitioner and that he knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights, before he was interrogated and made the statement he sought to suppress.\u201d <em>Id., </em>429 Md. at 659-60, 57 A.3d at 500. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">I believe, as does the petitioner, that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings given to the petitioner in this case could not, and did not, pass constitutional muster.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> What is at issue is the sufficiency of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>the <em>Miranda </em>warnings given by Trooper Torres, not just the Trooper\u2019s credibility. Those warnings, except for two words, were given in Spanish, the language in which the Trooper was fluent, and not in Mixtee, the defendant\u2019s native language, with which the Trooper was unfamiliar. Significantly, the record does not contain the two actual, purported Mixtee words (the source of which was the sister of Melo, the other suspect, a person not known by Torres, and whose knowledge of Mixtee was not established) that were used and it reveals that the interpreter did not know Mixtee and does not recall what Mixtee words he used in informing the petitioner of his rights. Under these circumstances, where, other than the acceptance of the warning officer\u2019s testimony, there is absolutely no evidence to corroborate the warning officer\u2019s conclusion that the defendant understood the rights of which he was apprised, a court would have to presume, based solely on that testimony, that the defendant understood those rights. It follows, then, that the petitioner\u2019s subsequent waiver of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, whether or not voluntary, was certainly not knowing and intelligent. The petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress his custodial statement should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">There is a \u201cheavy burden\u201d of proving that a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was adequate \u2014 intelligently, knowingly and voluntarily done. That heavy burden rests squarely on the State. 384 U.S. at 475, 86 S.Ct. at 1628, 16 L.Ed.2d at 724. This is so because \u201cthe State is responsible for establishing the isolated circumstances under which the interrogation takes place and has the only means of making available corroborated evidence of warnings given during incommunicado interrogation .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, an important component of the State\u2019s burden to prove adequate waiver is the responsibility to demonstrate the sufficiency of the warnings that were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>administered to the suspect, to show that they were such as would permit a suspect to waive his or her rights. That means, as we have seen, that those warnings must have been such as would have \u201cadequately and effectively apprised\u201d the suspect of the privileges afforded to him by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 467, 86 S.Ct. at 1624, 16 L.Ed.2d at 719. Anything less would enable, indeed facilitate, a court\u2019s \u201ccreat[ion of] a presumption that [a] defendant understood his constitutional rights and plac[ing] the burden of proof upon the defendant, instead of the state, to demonstrate whether the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel,\u201d <em>Tague v. Louisiana, </em>444 U.S. 469, 470, 100 S.Ct. 652, 653, 62 L.Ed.2d 622, 624-25 (1980) (quoting <em>State v. Tague, </em>372 So.2d 555, 558 (La.1979)), against which the Supreme Court of the United States has cautioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">The suppression court could not, and should not have found, based primarily on the testimony of Trooper Torres, that the petitioner\u2019s waiver was knowing and intelligent. In so doing, the suppression court, in the absence of evidence to support that conclusion, simply presumed, on the basis of the Trooper\u2019s deficient testimony, which it found credible, that the warnings he gave were adequate, that the petitioner understood them and that he knowingly waived them. As already pointed out, the issue in this case is not one resolvable by reference, or deference, to the court\u2019s first level fact-finding. Rather, the issues are the adequacy of the warnings given and whether the petitioner properly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, mixed questions of law and fact. In'the absence of a recording reflecting what the petitioner was told with regard to his rights, the suppression court could not have, and should not have, concluded that the warnings were constitutionally adequate or that the petitioner\u2019s waiver of the rights was intelligently and knowingly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">This record is clearly and undisputedly deficient. First, there is no record of the actual warnings given. To be sure, Trooper Torres, who had no knowledge of the petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>native tongue, testified that he used the Mixtee words for \u201cattorney\u201d and \u201ccourt\u201d in place of the Spanish translation when the petitioner indicated that he did not understand them. But underscoring the inadequacy of the record, as well as the problematic nature of the warning process, is the fact that Trooper Torres could not testify as to the Mixtee words that he did use to convey this portion of the warnings, because he did not remember them; thus, the record does not reflect what words he did use. \u201cCourt\u201d and \u201cattorney\u201d are important, if not essential, to the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and are at the core of not simply the voluntariness inquiry, but also in the waiver analysis. Whether the petitioner understood those concepts is critical to both the adequacy issue and the waiver issue. Without knowing precisely what the petitioner was told with respect to those concepts, it is no more possible for the court to have concluded that the Trooper adequately advised the petitioner than it would be if the officer testified to having given <em>Miranda </em>warnings without delineating what they were. Trooper Torres was not a certified translator of even Spanish. He testified that the warnings, which ordinarily took less than a minute, took over twenty in this case, because the petitioner had trouble understanding them as delivered. It was simply improper for the suppression court to conclude, on the basis of evidence demonstrating not only that the petitioner was administered warnings in a language entirely distinct from his own, but also that the officer who administered these warnings did so in an unreliable and uncorroborated combination of Spanish and Mixtee, that those warnings \u201creasonably conveyed\u201d the essence of the petitioner\u2019s rights under <em>Miranda. Duckworth, </em>492 U.S. at 203, 109 S.Ct. at 2880, 106 L.Ed.2d at 177. Furthermore, with no actual record of the warning, the court had no grounds, beyond the officer\u2019s own testimony concerning his first-hand impressions, to find that the petitioner comprehended those warnings as administered. The majority, thus, should have held that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The inadequacy of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings necessarily invalidates the petitioner\u2019s subsequent waiver of his rights, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>required to be knowing and intelligent, that is, \u201cmade with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u201d <em>Moran, </em>475 U.S. at 421,106 S.Ct. at 1141, 89 L.Ed.2d at 421. Because the evidence does not support a conclusion that the petitioner comprehended his rights as they were read to him by Trooper Torres, it was error for the suppression court to conclude that his waiver was valid, as he could not have fully understood those rights, nor the consequences of waiving them. By affirming the conclusion of the suppression court, the majority improperly places the burden of demonstrating a lack of comprehension on a defendant who is administered <em>Miranda </em>warnings in a language that is foreign to him or her. The majority has, in essence, created a presumption of comprehension in favor of the State, and has done so under circumstances that clearly favor an opposite conclusion, and at the expense of the petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights. This is a clear contradiction of <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>prophylactic purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Judges HARRELL and GREENE authorize me to state that they join in the views expressed in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-10\">. Detective Nelson, the lead investigator in the case, also testified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b703-4\">. Maryland State Police Form 180 delineates 5 rights, consistent with <em>Miranda </em>rights, to be read to detainees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">\u201c1. You have the right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">\u201c2. Anything you say or write may be used against you in a court of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">\u201c3. You have the right to talk to a lawyer before answering any questions and to have a lawyer present at any time before or during questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">\"4. If you now want the assistance of a lawyer but cannot afford to hire one, you will not be asked any more questions at this time and you may request the court to appoint a lawyer for you without charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">\"5. If you agree to answer questions, you may stop at any time and request the assistance of a lawyer, and no further questions will be asked of you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">The form includes the acknowledgment, \u201cI have read or have had read to me this explanation of my rights.\u201d Finally, the form includes a \"Waiver of <em>Miranda </em>Rights,\u201d which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-11\">\"I fully understand each of these rights and I am willing to answer questions without consulting a lawyer or having a lawyer present at this time. My decision to answer questions is entirely free and voluntary and I have not been promised anything nor have I been threatened or intimidated in any manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">In this case, the petitioner signed both the acknowledgment and the Waiver. This was done, according to Trooper Torres, after he, using the same procedure, interpreted the \"Acknowledgment\u201d and the \u201cWaiver\u201d portion of the MSP 180 form, word for word, subsequently obtaining the petitioner's signature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\">. Apparently aware of the potential for interpreting the latter conclusion as shifting the burden of proof, the Court of Special Appeals was quick to disavow any such intention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">\"Our conclusion should not be understood as placing the burden of proof in a suppression hearing on the defendant. As we stated above, the burden of proof quite clearly rests with the State to demonstrate a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of rights. However, where the State satisfies that burden below, we require more than a proffer by the defendant\u2019s attorney to conclude that the trial court erred in reaching a factual conclusion. The trial court is in a better position to make such factual determinations, and we do not believe that there is sufficient evidence in the record to conclude that it was wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">I do not believe that this disclaimer actually lays a claim of burden shifting to rest. Indeed, I believe it makes it even more problematic and real.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\">. The petitioner maintains, and therefore argues, that, given the language barrier, involving both the Trooper and himself, in the absence of a recording, transcript, notes, or the officer\u2019s own recollection regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>ing certain parts of the warnings, the suppression court could not reasonably have formed a complete picture of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, and thus, could not make an accurate determination concerning the petitioner\u2019s comprehension of the warnings. I agree; however, we need not go so far in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
