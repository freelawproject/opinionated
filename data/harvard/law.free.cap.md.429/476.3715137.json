That protection is triggered not only by a properly-labeled \u201cacquittal\u201d but also by a \u201cruling of the judge, whatever its label, [that] actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Applying the principle that the substance of a decision controls for double jeopardy purposes, our Court has held that a putative \u201cdismissal\u201d of charges was in substance an acquittal that triggered the protection against double jeopardy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This case presents another variation for application of that principle. The trial judge in the District Court denied a defense motion for judgment of acquittal on three charges against the defendant. The court then terminated the prosecution of those charges for a purely procedural reason \u2014 noncompliance with the rule on service of process \u2014 that the court made clear was unrelated to guilt or innocence but recorded its action on the docket sheet as <em>\u201cNG\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., \u201cnot guilty\u201d \u2014 a label that seemingly denotes an acquittal. This case raises the question whether the protection against double jeopardy precludes the State from pursuing an appeal of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The Circuit Court for Talbot County held that, in these circumstances, the trial court\u2019s action was tantamount to a preliminary motion to dismiss and that the State could therefore appeal the trial court\u2019s decision concerning service of process. We agree with the Circuit Court \u2014 and with the courts in other jurisdictions that have confronted similar situations \u2014 that a mis-labeled dismissal of charges for a purely procedural reason unrelated to guilt or innocence does not trigger the protection against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">On March 28, 2011, Angela Jones Kendall was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of Maryland Code, Transportation Article (\u201cTR\u201d), \u00a7 21-902(a)(l); driving or attempting to drive a vehicle while impaired by alcohol, in violation of TR \u00a7 21 \u2014 902(b)(1); driving or attempting to drive a vehicle while impaired by drugs or alcohol and drugs, in violation of TR \u00a7 21-902(c)(l); and failure to control vehicle speed to avoid a collision, in violation of TR \u00a7 21-801(b). The case came to trial in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Talbot County, on June 1, 2011. Ms. Kendall entered a plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>of \u201cnot guilty\u201d on all charges and elected to have the charges tried by the District Court in a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The State called five witnesses. After the State rested its case, defense counsel made a \u201cmotion for judgment,\u201d arguing that the investigating police officer had failed to obtain a blood sample from the defendant to determine her blood alcohol concentration following the arrest in accordance with Maryland Code, Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d) \u00a7 10-305.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As an additional ground, defense counsel argued that the defendant had not been properly served with the charges as required by Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 212(h), which provides that \u201c[t]he person issuing a citation, other than for a parking violation, shall serve it upon the defendant at the time of its issuance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The trial judge agreed that the officer had failed to comply with CJ \u00a7 10-305 and granted the defense motion on that ground as to the charge of driving while under the influence of alcohol.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court denied the defense motion with respect to that ground as to the remaining three charges. After denying the motion, the court expressed a willingness to discuss case law on the service of process issue. There followed a discussion between the court and counsel about an appellate decision that construed the rule governing service of criminal citations, and the court permitted the State to recall a police officer to testify briefly about how he served the citations that commenced the prosecution. The officer testified that he had given the citations to Ms. Kendall\u2019s mother, not Ms. Kendall. There was no testimony as to the substance or the merits of the charges in the citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>After the testimony, the trial judge heard additional argument from counsel as to the adequacy of the service of the citations; none of that argument concerned Ms. Kendall\u2019s guilt or innocence of the charges. At the conclusion of the argument, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">THE COURT: I\u2019m going to grant the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: I would note, just for the record, Your Honor, that Judge Moylan addresses that exact same rule [in <em>Darrikhuma v. State, </em>81 Md.App. 560, 568 A.2d 1150 (1990) ].<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">THE COURT: I understand that but I\u2019m looking at, I read the rule and it says \u201cshall.\u201d And the officer is there, Ms. Kendall is there. It\u2019s not a situation where she is unconscious or undergoing surgery, she\u2019s in fact, he\u2019s standing out in the hall and she is in a room. And instead of going in and serving her, he hands it to her mother. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the rule contemplates____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\"><em>[the trial court then referred to the </em>Darrikhuma <em>case and the practice of other officers serving citations in hospitals in other cases]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">... In this case she was there, he was there, and he served somebody else and that\u2019s not what the rule says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\">THE COURT: So I think that he, the rule in this case was not complied with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: For the record to entertain that motion as a preliminary motion to dismiss?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-14\">THE COURT: Maybe, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: Thank you. Nothing further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-16\">THE COURT: I\u2019m going to grant this motion based upon, I think that this is one of those situations where although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Judge Moylan has an analysis I think the facts in this case fly directly in the face of the requirements of the rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">THE COURT: And there is no justification for not complying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">At the same time that he rendered his decision on the defense motion, the trial judge completed and signed a docket sheet for each charge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The docket sheets offer the following choices to record a disposition: \u201cG\u201d (guilty), \u201cNG\u201d (not guilty), \u201cPBJ\u201d (probation before judgment), \u201cDismissed,\u201d \u201cMerged,\u201d \u201cABD\u201d (abated by death), \u201cNCR\u201d (not criminally responsible), \u201cNC\u201d <em>(nolo </em>contendere), and \u201cJA\u201d (judgment of acquittal). The trial judge recorded \u201cNG\u201d as to each charge and, in that regard, did not differentiate his disposition of the driving while intoxicated charge for non-compliance with CJ \u00a7 10-305 from his termination of the other three charges for faulty service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The State subsequently noted an appeal to the Circuit Court for Talbot County with respect to the termination of the prosecution of the three charges for improper service, characterizing the trial court\u2019s action as a \u201cdismissal.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ms. Kendall moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the District Court action was an acquittal on those charges and that the State\u2019s action violated her constitutional and common law protections against double jeopardy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>The Circuit Court held that the District Court had clearly acquitted Ms. Kendall on the first charge of driving while intoxicated \u2014 an issue not contested by the State. However, the Circuit Court found that the record was \u201csufficiently clear\u201d that the trial court had <em>not </em>acquitted her of the other three charges. Rather, the Circuit Court held, the trial court\u2019s action was equivalent to granting a preliminary motion to dismiss for improper service. The \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdicts on the abbreviated docket forms, the Circuit Court held, \u201cwere released in error.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Circuit Court therefore denied Ms. Kendall\u2019s motion to dismiss the State\u2019s appeal on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">On April 20, 2012, we granted Ms. Kendall\u2019s petition for certiorari on her double jeopardy claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\n<em>Double Jeopardy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The federal Constitution provides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d United States Constitution, Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That protection is also a fundamental part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Maryland common law. <em>See State v. Taylor, </em>371 Md. 617, 629-30, 810 A.2d 964 (2002). In a nonjury trial, jeopardy ordinarily attaches when the first witness is sworn, <em>Crist v. Brete, </em>437 U.S. 28, 37 n. 15, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 57 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978), although in some circumstances it may attach without the appearance of a witness if the defendant is \u201csubjected to the risk of conviction.\u201d <em>Daff v. State, </em>317 Md. 678, 688-89, 566 A.2d 120 (1989) (acquittal following failure of prosecution witnesses to appear for trial). For each offense for which the defendant is thereafter acquitted, both the federal Constitution and State common law prohibit a second prosecution. <em>See Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 796, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969) (federal Constitution); <em>Gianing v. State, </em>320 Md. 337, 342, 577 A.2d 795 (1990) (Maryland common law). \u201cIf the innocence of the accused has been confirmed by a final judgment, the Constitution conclusively presumes that a second trial would be unfair,\u201d even if the acquittal was based on an \u201cegregiously erroneous foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 </em>U.S. 117, 129, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980); <em>see also Fong Foo v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 141, 82 S.Ct. 671, 7 L.Ed.2d 629 (1962).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nor are double jeopardy protections vulnerable to judicial second thoughts. \u201c[Ojnce the trier of fact in a criminal case, whether it be the jury or the judge, intentionally renders a verdict of not guilty, the verdict is final and the defendant cannot later be retried on or found guilty of the same charge.\u201d <em>Pugh v. State, </em>271 Md. 701, 706, 319 A.2d 542 (1974) (even though trial judge changed mind after initially finding evidence insufficient on drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>charge, further prosecution of defendant on that charge was barred); <em>Brooks v. State, </em>299 Md. 146, 153-54, 472 A.2d 981 (1984) (trial judge could not \u201creconsider\u201d and submit conspiracy charge to jury after first ruling that evidence was insufficient to establish that offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">It is also well established that, if a defendant seeks to have a prosecution terminated without any submission to a judge or jury as to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of the charges and the court grants that motion, further prosecution is not barred. The critical question is \u201cwhether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977) (Brennan, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">For example, in <em>United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978), the defendant moved, both before and during trial, to dismiss the drug charges against him on the basis of prejudicial pre-indictment delay. The trial court initially denied the motion, but later granted it in the midst of trial. The Government then sought to appeal the dismissal. The defendant asserted that further prosecution was barred on double jeopardy grounds. The Supreme Court held that double jeopardy principles did not bar the Government\u2019s appeal and potential future prosecution, as the trial court\u2019s action was not in substance an acquittal. The Court reiterated its statement in <em>Martin Linen </em>that the label that a trial court attaches to its decision does not determine the significance of that ruling for double jeopardy purposes. 437 U.S. at 96, 98 S.Ct. 2187 (\u201cthe trial judge\u2019s characterization of his own action cannot control the classification of the action\u201d). The Court identified the critical question: \u201c[W]here the defendant himself seeks to have the trial terminated without any submission to either judge or jury as to his guilt or innocence, an appeal by the Government from his successful effort to do so is not barred ...\u201d 437 U.S. at 101, 98 S.Ct. 2187.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>In applying double jeopardy principles under Maryland common law, this Court has adopted the approach set forth in <em>Martin Linen </em>and <em>Scott. </em>In <em>State v. Taylor, </em>371 Md. 617, 810 A.2d 964 (2002), this Court considered the consolidated appeals of two cases. In each case the State and the defendants had stipulated to certain facts in connection with pre-trial motions and the trial court had granted, before trial, a defense \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d the charges on the basis that the stipulated facts revealed that the State would be unable to prove an element of the charges. This Court held that the trial courts exceeded the permissible scope of a motion to dismiss by considering the sufficiency of the evidence. In both cases, the grants of the motions to dismiss \u201csubstantively constituted judgments of acquittal and therefore must be given effect as such for double jeopardy purposes.\u201d 371 Md. at 644, 810 A.2d 964. \u201cAlthough cloaked in the form of the grant of motions to dismiss, the substance of the trial judges\u2019 rulings was to grant judgments of acquittal and so we must treat them for double jeopardy analysis .... dismissal of a criminal information or indictment based on an assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence is tantamount to an acquittal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648-49, 810 A.2d 964. In reaching this conclusion the Court relied on the trial courts\u2019 explanations of their rulings, noting how they depended on an evaluation of facts bearing on whether the defendants were guilty of the crimes charged. <em>Id. </em>at 652-53, 810 A.2d 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\n<em>Application of Double Jeopardy Principles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The application of double jeopardy principles in this case turns on the nature of the District Court\u2019s ruling on the three charges in question. It is abundantly clear, and the parties agree, that if the District Court acquitted Ms. Kendall of the charges against her \u2014 even if in error \u2014 the State is barred from appealing that decision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But the label \u201cacquit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>tal\u201d does not fit the trial court\u2019s action. The record reveals the following sequence of events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">\u2022 At the close of the State\u2019s case, defense counsel moved \u201cfor judgment.\u201d In context it appears clear that she was asking for a \u201cjudgment of acquittal,\u201d as permitted by statute and rule.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">\u2022 The trial court entertained argument which dealt, in part, with the State\u2019s compliance with a statute requiring it to obtain a certain type of evidence (blood sample) in certain circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">\u2022 Based on the evidentiary issue, the trial court granted the defense motion as to the driving while intoxicated charge, but <em>denied </em>the motion as to the other three charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">\u2022 The court then entertained further discussion of a procedural issue \u2014 whether the police officer had properly served the statement of charges. There was no further discussion of the blood test or any other evidentiary matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">\u2022 The court permitted the prosecutor to put on testimony concerning how the police officer physically served the citations; that testimony did not concern the substance of the charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">\u2022 Counsel and the court then discussed the Maryland rule on service of citations and a Court of Special Appeals decision construing that rule. There was no discussion of the substance of the charges or the evidence against Ms. Kendall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">\u2022 The trial court then \u201cgranted the motion\u201d as to the three remaining charges and entered \u201cNG\u201d on the docket sheets, on the ground that the State had not complied with the rule on service of citations. The court explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the basis of its ruling was the presence of the word \u201cshall\u201d in the rule concerning service of process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">\u2022 The trial court agreed with the observation of the prosecutor that the \u201cmotion\u201d that was being granted as to the three charges was actually a preliminary motion to dismiss and repeated that the basis of its decision was the interpretation of the rule on service of process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">By definition, a motion for judgment of acquittal is based \u201con the ground that the evidence is insufficient in law to sustain a conviction[.]\u201d Maryland Code, Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 6 \u2014 104(a)(1). Here the trial court clearly <em>denied </em>the motion as to the three charges to the extent it was based on the sufficiency of the evidence as to those charges. One who reads solely the portion of the record after the court denied the motion for judgment of acquittal as to the three charges would have no idea of the substance of the charges or the evidence in the case \u2014 because no mention at all was made of them. In that portion of the record, the court and counsel have turned their attention entirely to the mechanics of service of process in this case, the rule governing service, and an appellate decision concerning the consequences of a failure to comply with that rule. It could not be clearer \u2014 even if the trial court had not explicitly said so \u2014 that the termination of the prosecution of those three charges was based on a purely procedural ground having nothing to do with Ms. Kendall\u2019s guilt or innocence of those charges. This was not \u201ca resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense[s] charged.\u201d Accordingly, the protection against double jeopardy was not triggered by that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">To be sure, the trial court entered \u201cNG\u201d on the docket sheets for the three charges. Yet it appears that those notations are, at most, the equivalent of a \u201cmisspoken verdict.\u201d <em>See Pugh v. State, </em>271 Md. 701, 706-7, 319 A.2d 542 (1974). The trial court did not utilize either of the more appropriate options on the docket sheets. While the court did not check off \u201cdismissed\u201d on the docket sheets for the three charges in question, it is also notable that the trial court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>not check off \u201cJA\u201d (judgment of acquittal) for the first charge of driving while intoxicated, even though it is plain on the record \u2014 and there is no dispute \u2014 that the court in fact granted a motion for judgment of acquittal on that charge. Indeed, the trial court appeared to regard \u201cNG\u201d as simply an indication that the case had been terminated in favor of the defendant rather than an indication of the exact nature of decision that it had made.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In contrast to this case are the prior decisions of this Court where it was held that double jeopardy principles precluded further prosecution because a dismissal was based on the insufficiency \u2014 or complete lack \u2014 of evidence on the charges in case. For example, in <em>Daff v. State, </em>317 Md. 678, 566 A.2d 120 (1989), the prosecution\u2019s witnesses failed to appear at the time the case was called for trial because of an unexplained failure of the clerk\u2019s office to issue subpoenas for them. The defendant was ready to proceed with the trial, and the circuit court offered to nol pros the charges for the State. When the prosecutor declined that option, the court denied a postponement and entered a finding of not guilty. This Court held that a re-institution of the charges was barred by double jeopardy principles, noting that, even if the trial judge erred in denying the State\u2019s request for a postponement, it \u201cwould [not] affect the finality of an acquittal thereafter entered on the ground of <em>insufficiency </em>of the evidence.\u201d 317 Md. at 685, 566 A.2d 120 (emphasis added). <em>See also Farrell v. State, </em>364 Md. 499, 774 A.2d 387 (2001) (relying on <em>Daff </em>to hold that the State may not re-institute charges after the State\u2019s witnesses failed to appear for trial and a not guilty verdict was entered on the charges).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">There are numerous cases from other jurisdictions where state appellate courts have held that a trial court\u2019s \u201cjudgment of acquittal\u201d or \u201cnot guilty\u201d was not in fact an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes because the trial court did not purport to be resolving any factual question relating to the offenses charged. <em>See, e.g., Connecticut v. Kruelski, </em>250 Conn. 1, 737 A.2d 377 (1999) (trial court judgment of acquittal that was based solely on statute of limitations and that did not resolve any element of offense charged did not trigger double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>jeopardy); <em>Hawaii v. Dow, </em>72 Haw. 56, 806 P.2d 402 (1991) (following <em>Martin Linen </em>and declining to \u201cinterpret the judgment of acquittal in a hypertechnieal manner, elevating form over substance\u201d); <em>People v. Williams, </em>2000 WL 33407356, 2000 Mich.App. LEXIS 968 (Mich.App.2000); <em>Petition of the State of New Hampshire (State v. Johanson), </em>156 N.H. 148, 932 A.2d 848 (2007); <em>North Dakota v. Melin, </em>428 N.W.2d 227 (N.D.1988); <em>Pennsylvania v. McDonough, </em>533 Pa. 283, 621 A.2d 569 (1993). Federal appellate courts have similarly applied the principle stated in <em>Martin Linen </em>and <em>Scott. See, e.g., United States v. Council, </em>973 F.2d 251, 254 (4th Cir.1992) (when district court granted \u201cjudgment of acquittal\u201d as to certain counts at close of prosecution case solely on grounds of discovery violation by government, that ruling was actually a \u201cdismissal\u201d that did not bar retrial of those counts); <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>617 F.2d 1358, 1362 (9th Cir.1980) (\u201cjudgment of acquittal\u201d in the midst of trial was \u201cin substance an order of dismissal\u201d and therefore did not preclude prosecution appeal); <em>United States v. Appawoo, </em>553 F.2d 1242, 1244 (10th Cir.1977) (even though the ruling was labeled a \u201cjudgment of acquittal\u201d, \u201cthe record here demonstrates that the ruling was unrelated to any facts developed by the Government\u2019s case\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Alvarez, </em>351 F.3d 126 (4th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Mackins, </em>32 F.3d 134, 139 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court was confronted with a case with facts remarkably similar to those of this case and concluded that the trial court\u2019s action did not implicate double jeopardy. In <em>Commonwealth v. Babb, </em>389 Mass. 275, 450 N.E.2d 155 (1983), the defendant was charged with several offenses related to driving under the influence of alcohol. The defendant waived a jury trial on the charges. At the conclusion of the bench trial, defense counsel moved for a \u201cnot guilty\u201d determination on the vehicular homicide charges on the ground that the officer who had written the citations had failed to file them with the court within the time period required by a state statute. The trial judge discussed with counsel an applicable state appellate decision concerning the pertinent statute and ultimately concluded that the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>should be concluded in the defendant\u2019s favor. While the judge indicated he regarded his action as a \u201cdismissal\u201d of the charges, he wrote \u201cNG\u201d (not guilty) together with his initials on the charging documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">On appeal, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court first recited the principles derived from <em>Scott </em>and <em>Martin Linen </em>that whether a trial court\u2019s action is an \u201cacquittal\u201d does not depend on the label attached to the ruling but whether that ruling resolved some or all of the factual elements of the crimes charged. 450 N.E.2d at 159. The Supreme Judicial Court found that it was clear that the trial judge had dismissed the charges solely on the basis that the police had failed to comply precisely with the statute on the filing of charging documents and the judge had not made a determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence on those charges. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court held that the prosecution appeal was not barred on double jeopardy grounds.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Like <em>Babb, </em>this is an unusual case. This is a rare instance in which the record is absolutely clear that the trial court denied a motion for judgment of acquittal on substantive grounds, then immediately thereafter entertained a discussion of a purely procedural matter (service of process) having nothing to do with proof of guilt or innocence, received addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>tional evidence on that issue alone, heard legal argument from counsel that concerned that issue alone and did not touch upon evidence concerning guilt or innocence, and explained its ruling based on that issue alone without any reference to evidence relating to the substance of the charges against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">By contrast, many trial court judgments on putatively procedural matters in criminal cases may be interlaced with facts related to the merits of the charges. Under <em>Taylor, </em>such a decision terminating the case in favor of a defendant after jeopardy has attached will likely bar further prosecution under double jeopardy principles. Thus, our holding in this case should not be taken as an invitation to prosecutors to parse every adverse judgment for a procedural aspect to serve as an appellate foothold.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The District Court\u2019s decision to terminate the prosecution of the three charges against Ms. Kendall that are the subject of this appeal was not based on a resolution of \u201csome or all of the factual elements\u201d of the offenses charged. For that reason, the trial court\u2019s action did not trigger the protection against double jeopardy. The State may pursue its appeal of that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Judgment of the Circuit Court for Talbot County Affirmed.

It is well established under Maryland common law that, in a criminal trial, once jeopardy attaches and a verdict of acquittal is rendered intentionally, that verdict is final and may not be set aside.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>State v.

In the instant case, the District Court judge had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the Petitioner, Angela Jones Kendall. The State presented its evidence and rested its case. In response to defense counsel\u2019s motion for \u201cjudgment,\u201d the trial judge evaluated the evidence presented and \u201cgrant[ed] the motion.\u201d Later the trial judge checked the \u201cNG\u201d (\u201cNot Guilty\u201d) box on the docket sheets for each of the four counts against Petitioner and signed the documents. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Talbot County and remand the case to that court to dismiss the State\u2019s appeal and affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">On March 29, 2011, Officers Larry Horney and Scott Kakabar responded to a single vehicular accident in St. Michaels, Talbot County. When the Officers arrived at the scene of the accident, they found a car facing downward in a ditch. The Officers testified that when they arrived the vehicle engine was running, the vehicle lights were on, and the car appeared to have struck a mailbox. Petitioner was observed in the driver\u2019s seat and was described as \u201c[n]ot kind of responsive\u201d and \u201cdisoriented,\u201d with \u201c[slurred] speech,\u201d and \u201ca faint odor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>an alcoholic beverage coming from her person.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One Officer testified that Petitioner told him she had taken Cymbalta,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a prescription drug. The Officers contacted paramedics to assist Petitioner and she was taken to Easton Memorial Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">When Petitioner arrived at the hospital, she required assistance getting into her hospital gown. Hospital staff described her as \u201c[v]ery clumsy in her movements\u201d and \u201cnot able to stand on her own at all.\u201d A physician met with Petitioner, and the physician\u2019s assistant noted on an observation sheet that Petitioner, at some point in time, which is unexplained in the record, had suffered seizures, nausea, problems with vision, and vomiting. The observation sheet also indicated that the air bag in Petitioner\u2019s car had deployed. The assisting nurse testified that during her interaction with Petitioner, Petitioner said that \u201cshe had swerved off the road and into La] ditch.\u201d While at the hospital, Petitioner was scheduled to receive a CT scan of her head. Prior to undergoing the CT scan, Officer Kakabar asked Petitioner to complete the DR-15 form.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>tioner, however, refused to submit to a breath test. Apparently, at that time, the Officers prepared citations charging Petitioner with various speed, alcohol, and drug related offenses, and served the papers on Petitioner\u2019s mother who was present at the hospital. The Officers did not ask hospital staff to administer a blood test for alcohol or drugs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Approximately two to three hours after Petitioner arrived at the hospital she was released to go home.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The relevant trial court proceedings began in the District Court for Talbot County when Petitioner entered a plea of \u201cNot Guilty\u201d to the charges of driving or attempting to drive a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in violation of Md.Code (1977, 2012 Supp.), \u00a7 21-902(a)(l) of the Transportation Article (\u201cTR\u201d); driving or attempting to drive a vehicle while impaired by alcohol, in violation of Md.Code (1977, 2012 Supp.), TR \u00a7 21-902(b)(l); driving or attempting to drive a vehicle while impaired by drugs or alcohol and drugs, in violation of Md.Code (1977, 2012 Supp.), TR \u00a7 21-902(c)(l); and failure to control vehicle speed on a highway to avoid a collision, in violation of Md.Code (1977, 2009 RepLVol.), TR \u00a7 21 \u2014 801(b). The Petitioner waived her right to a jury trial, and elected a bench trial in the District Court. Thereafter, the State called each of its five witnesses, presented the entirety of its evidence, and rested its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>At the end of the State\u2019s case, defense counsel \u201cmove[d] for judgment[,]\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and advanced two arguments to support the motion. She argued that Petitioner needed medical attention, and that the attending law enforcement officials failed to give her a blood test to determine her blood alcohol concentration in accordance with Maryland Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d) \u00a7 10-305. This law mandates that in certain circumstances, such as when an individual sustains injuries which require removal to a medical facility, or when an individual is unconscious or otherwise incapable of refusing to take a test to determine alcohol concentration, a blood test must be administered to determine the individual\u2019s blood alcohol content. CJ \u00a7 10-305(a). Similarly, this Article also requires that \u201c[t]he type of specimen obtained from the defendant for the purpose of a test or tests to determine drug or controlled dangerous substance content shall be a blood specimen.\u201d CJ \u00a7 10-305(b). Defense counsel cited <em>State v. Werkheiser, </em>299 Md. 529, 474 A.2d 898 (1984), to support her motion for a judgment of acquittal because the State failed to obtain a blood test from Petitioner. <em>Werkheiser </em>stands for the proposition that although a chemical analysis is not a prerequisite to a prosecution, in the special circumstances when an individual is otherwise incapable of refusing and cannot withdraw consent to a blood test, the \u201cappropriate remedy available [to a defendant] would be to allow an inference that had the test been administered, the result thereof would have been favorable to [the defendant].\u201d <em>Werkheiser, </em>299 Md. at 538-39, 474 A.2d at 903-04. Defense counsel also advanced an argument about the absence of service of process under Maryland Rule 4-212(h). This rule requires that \u201c[t]he person issuing a citation ... shall serve it upon the defendant at the time of its issuance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>With the entirety of the evidence before the judge, as well as several arguments advanced by counsel, the judge ruled on the motion for judgment, saying first that, \u201cI\u2019m going to grant the (A),\u201d referring to the motion for judgment of acquittal as to the charge of driving while under the influence of alcohol, \u00a7 21-902(a)(l).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The State did not contest the court\u2019s ruling then, or now, on appeal. The trial judge then explained that he would deny the motion as to the other three charges \u201cat this stage at the end of the State\u2019s case.\u201d (Emphasis added). Following a discussion between the court and counsel concerning the service of process issue,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the trial judge ruled, \u201cI\u2019m going to grant the motion.\u201d Thereafter, discussion on the service of process issue continued and the State asked the trial judge to \u201centertain that motion as a preliminary motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>dismiss?\u201d The judge replied, \u201c[m]aybe, yeah[,]\u201d and then repeated that he would \u201cgrant the motion based upon, I think that this is one of those situations where although Judge [Moylan] has an analysis I think the facts in this case fly directly in the face of the requirements of the rule.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Later, the judge checked the box on the docket sheet for \u201cNG\u201d (\u201cNot Guilty\u201d), and signed his name next to the docket entry for each of the four charges.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Following the entry of the \u201cNot Guilty\u201d verdict for each of the four charges, the State appealed to the Circuit Court for Talbot County. The State argued that the District Court judge did not acquit Petitioner of three of the four charges. Instead, the State maintained, the District Court dismissed the three outstanding charges on the grounds of improper service. In response, Petitioner moved to dismiss the appeal on the basis that the Court granted an acquittal, and double jeopardy barred the State from appealing the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Treating the State\u2019s appeal as proper, the Circuit Court held that the District Court judge\u2019s actions with regard to the three charges did not amount to an acquittal. In ruling for the State, the Circuit Court explained that the trial judge must have interpreted the service issue raised by Petitioner\u2019s motion for judgment as a preliminary motion to dismiss for improper service. The Circuit Court also concluded that the \u201cNot Guilty\u201d entries on the docket sheet were \u201creleased in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>error[,]\u201d because the District Court judge dismissed the remaining counts against Petitioner based upon the motion to dismiss. Subsequently, the Circuit Court denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">When the trial judge granted the motion and terminated the proceedings, he had before him the entirety of the evidence presented by the State. This evidence constituted all of the evidence the judge needed to make a judgment on the sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence. The judge further confirmed his intention to acquit by checking \u201cNG\u201d on the docket sheet. On appeal, therefore, we cannot assume, as the majority holds, that the judge intended to dismiss the case on procedural grounds when the record of the proceedings demonstrates an intent to acquit. As such, double jeopardy was triggered when the verdict of acquittal was rendered, and accordingly \u201cthat verdict is final and cannot be set aside.\u201d <em>Pugh v. State, </em>271 Md. 701, 705, 319 A.2d 542, 544 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">First, the transcript of the proceedings indicates that the trial judge intended to acquit Petitioner. When the trial judge \u201cgrant[ed] the motion,\u201d the only motion pending at that time was a motion for a judgment of acquittal. Only after the judge granted the motion did the State ask the trial judge to convert the motion or \u201centertain that [previously granted] motion as a prehminary motion to dismiss,\u201d and the judge responded with an ambiguous, \u201c[m]aybe, yeah.\u201d When the judge first granted the motion, the most logical conclusion, therefore, is that he was referring to the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Moving beyond the oddity of considering a preliminary motion to dismiss at the conclusion of a trial, even if the judge wanted to change his mind as to the nature of the motion granted, he would have been barred under Maryland\u2019s double jeopardy jurisprudence, which holds that a judge may not intentionally grant an acquittal and then change his or her mind. For example, in <em>Pugh v. State, </em>the trial judge entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>a \u201cNot Guilty\u201d verdict, and then moments later changed the verdict, presumably based on remarks made by the State after the initial acquittal. This Court held that \u201c[o]nce a trial judge intentionally renders a verdict of \u2018not guilty\u2019 on a criminal charge, the prohibition against double jeopardy does not permit him to change his mind.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>271 Md. at 707, 319 A.2d at 545. Similarly, in <em>Brooks v. State, </em>after the trial judge granted a motion for judgment of acquittal on a conspiracy charge, the State convinced the judge to reconsider and later deny his ruling on the motion. The jury thereafter convicted defendant of the conspiracy charge. On appeal, we reversed and explained that once the judge intentionally granted the motion, \u201c[i]t was effective as a final disposition of the conspiracy charge.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>299 Md. 146, 152-55, 472 A.2d 981, 986 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">These cases support the proposition that once a motion to acquit is intentionally granted, a judge may not reverse the judgment, even if he or she intends to do so only moments after the acquittal is rendered. The same rule would apply to this case. Once the trial judge granted the acquittal, he was not permitted to change his mind. Therefore, even if we were to interpret the judge\u2019s ambiguous response to the State\u2019s request as a change of heart, because of double jeopardy\u2019s prohibition, the judge was barred from changing his affirmative decision to acquit.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Next, the critical flaw in the majority\u2019s position, that the trial judge actually granted a procedural motion to dismiss, is that when defense counsel asked for a judgment of acquittal, the trial judge was required to consider the entirety of the evidence presented. This included not only the arguments advanced by defense counsel, but also an assessment of all of the evidence or lack of evidence presented. Merely because the trial judge reviewed arguments on service of process deficiencies immediately before granting the motion, does not mean that the judge <em>only </em>considered the adequacy of the service issue before making his judgment. Ordinarily, when a trial judge is asked to consider the sufficiency of the evidence, the judge\u2019s duty is to consider <em>all </em>of the evidence, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>any reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence in favor of the State. Without evidence indicating that the judge did not consider the presence or absence of evidence, we will assume that he or she did. <em>See Brooks, </em>299 Md. at 154-55, 472 A.2d at 986 (noting that when the trial court granted the motion, evidence relating to the charge was before the court and \u201c[i]t is obvious that the grant of the motion was predicated, as it had to be, on a review by the judge with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence ... \u201d). In other words, we will presume that the trial judge followed the law. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Keiner, </em>421 Md. 492, 508, 27 A.3d 153, 163 (2011) (citations omitted) (stating that \u201cbarring explicit evidence in the record to the contrary, we presume that any hearing judge in conducting ... any [ ] legal proceeding, understands and carries out his or her obligation to follow the law\u201d); <em>State v. Chaney, </em>375 Md. 168, 179-81, 825 A.2d 452, 458-59 (2003) (citations omitted) (discussing the long standing presumption that \u201ctrial judges know the law and apply it properly ...\u201d); <em>Rock v. Rock, </em>86 Md.App. 598, 613, 587 A.2d 1133, 1140 (1991) (citations omitted) (\u201cUnless the record is clearly to the contrary, we assume the trial judge knew and followed the law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Moreover, the majority is quick to conclude that the \u201ctrial court clearly denied\u201d the motion as to the other three charges with regard to the sufficiency of the evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When the trial judge granted the judgment of acquittal on the first charge of driving while under the influence of alcohol, TR \u00a7 21-902(a)(l), the State did not then, and does not now, dispute the proposition that the trial judge did not limit his consideration of the charges against Petitioner to procedural issues. There is no reason to believe that the trial judge would not have approached his disposition of the remaining charges in a similar manner. Rather, the acquittal and the lack of evidence before the court indicates that the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>was addressing the sufficiency of the evidence relating to the charges filed against Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The fact that the remaining charges were all variations of TR \u00a7 21-902(a)(l), driving while under the influence of alcohol, further supports the conclusion that the judge considered the sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence as to all of the charges. For example, TR \u00a7 21 \u2014 902(a)(1) requires proof that the alcohol consumed by the driver <em>\u201csubstantially </em>impaired the person\u2019s normal coordination.\u201d One of the other charges against Petitioner, TR \u00a7 21 \u2014 902(b)(1), driving while impaired by alcohol, requires proof that the alcohol consumed by the driver \u201cimpaired [the driver\u2019s] normal coordination to some extent.\u201d <em>See Turner v. State, </em>181 Md.App. 477, 490, 956 A.2d 820, 828 (2008) (emphasis added) (citations omitted). The distinction between these two offenses is only a matter of degree. <em>Id. </em>The deficiencies the trial judge could have found in the State\u2019s evidence with regard to the charge of driving while under the influence of alcohol could have also related to the charge of driving while impaired by alcohol. For example, given the nature of the evidence presented by the State, the trial judge had no substantial basis to conclude that the accident was the result of Petitioner\u2019s consumption of alcohol. Absent evidence of why the accident happened, or the level of alcohol in Petitioner\u2019s system, or the effects, if any, alcohol had on Petitioner\u2019s ability to drive her vehicle safely, the trier of fact would have been left to speculate on the potential guilt or innocence of Petitioner as to TR \u00a7 21 \u2014 902(b)(1), just as the trier of fact would have had to speculate on the Petitioner\u2019s guilt or innocence as to TR \u00a7 21-902(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Also related to these charges is TR \u00a7 21-902(c)(l), driving while impaired by drugs or drugs and alcohol, which requires a showing that the \u201cdrug so impaired the accused that he [or she] was unable to drive safely.\u201d <em>See Cook v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 634, 641, 490 A.2d 1311, 1314 (1985). Similar to the other charges, there was a lack of evidence to support a conviction of TR \u00a7 21-902(c)(l). The State\u2019s evidence consisted of testimony from several witnesses indicating that Petitioner told them that she had taken Cymbalta, cold medicine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>or muscle relaxers. There was no toxicology report or any other evidence presented by the State to demonstrate the effects, if any, some drug would have had or did have on Petitioner\u2019s ability to operate a vehicle safely. There was also no evidence to show that Petitioner was actually driving unsafely before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Moreover, the State failed to show that Petitioner acted unreasonably in controlling the speed of her vehicle to avoid the collision under Tit \u00a7 21-801 (b). In essence, the law requires a driver \u201cto reduce speed, from what otherwise would be a lawful maximum speed, to that which is reasonable or prudent in light of existing conditions that present an \u2018actual or potential danger[,]\u2019 \u201d such as, for example, a possible collision with a person or vehicle. <em>See Warren v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 153,161-63, 882 A.2d 934, 940 (2005). In the present case, the State failed to present any evidence related to why the accident happened, other than Petitioner\u2019s statement that she \u201chad swerved off the road and into [a] ditch[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Thus, there is no reason to believe that the trial judge did not rule on the sufficiency of the evidence for the remaining charges after he had already ruled on the sufficiency of the evidence to support the related charge <em>of </em>driving under the influence. Given the lack of evidence in this case, and the relationship of the charges to each other, we cannot say that the trial judge did not rule on the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The majority emphasizes that because the judge did not discuss the substance of the charges or the evidence in the case before granting the motion, the judge did not intend to acquit Petitioner. The fact that the trial judge did not discuss the substance of the evidence in granting the motion, however, does not, in itself, indicate that he did not consider the evidence and substance of the charges. When a trial judge grants a motion for judgment of acquittal or enters a verdict of acquittal, the judge need not explain the reason for his or her decision. The Maryland Rules provide that \u201c[although not required, the court <em>may </em>state the grounds for its decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>either in open court or by written memorandum.\u201d Md. Rule 4-328 (emphasis added). Providing an explanation or discussion of the grounds for reaching a conclusion, therefore, is optional. <em>See Pugh, </em>271 Md. at 707, 319 A.2d at 545 (\u201cNothing more is required under the rule for a \u2018verdict\u2019 other than a deliberate pronouncement of \u2018guilty\u2019 or \u2018not guilty\u2019 in light of the facts and the law.\u201d). Thus, the absence of an explanation would not imply that the judge did not intend to enter the verdict of acquittal. We have said that the grant of a motion to acquit is akin to the grant of a directed verdict, and has the same force and effect as a verdict of not guilty. <em>See Brooks, </em>299 Md. at 151, 472 A.2d at 984 (explaining that in Maryland, a motion for a judgment of acquittal \u201chas been substituted, in criminal causes, for a motion for a directed verdict of not guilty ... [,]\u201d and the grant of acquittal \u201cwas intended ... as an instruction that the evidence is insufficient in law to sustain a conviction, which would call for the rendering of a verdict of not guilty\u201d). It follows from our case law, therefore, that a judge is not required to explain the grounds for his or her ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal either. <em>See, e.g., Brooks, </em>299 Md. at 151, 154 n. 5, 472 A.2d at 984, 985-86 n. 5, (noting that the docket entry made by the judge\u2019s clerk, \u201cMotion for Judgment of Acquittal heard and granted[,]\u201d next to the judge\u2019s name, \u201cwas sufficient to indicate [procedural] compliance\u201d under (the current version of Md. Rule 4-324(b), Motion for judgment of acquittal)).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">In the present case, the trial judge did not discuss the substance of the remaining three charges when he granted the motion. The absence of a detailed explanation as to the sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence, however, does not render the decision to acquit any less forceful or binding. Nor does it give us reason to conclude that the trial judge must not have intended to grant a motion for judgment. Rather, in granting the motion, the judge entered a verdict of acquittal and no additional discussion by the judge was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Moreover, even if the judge erred in granting the motion, Maryland common law mandates that once jeopardy attaches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>in a trial, a judgment of acquittal or a verdict of acquittal must stand, even if it is based on a mistake of law including a procedural error, or a mistake of fact. <em>See Farrell v. State, </em>364 Md. 499, 507-10, 774 A.2d 387, 391-93 (2001) (citations omitted) (maintaining that it is impermissible to retry a defendant acquitted at trial for the same crime, even if the judge\u2019s legal rulings were erroneous); <em>Block v. State, </em>286 Md. 266, 273-74, 407 A.2d 320, 324 (1979) (explaining that \u201cthe fact that the court may not have been authorized under the rules to render the verdict does not make it void for double jeopardy purposes ... an improper or defective exercise of jurisdiction does not deprive an acquittal of its finality\u201d); <em>Shields, </em>49 Md. at 303 (noting that once granted, an acquittal cannot be set aside, even if the verdict is a result of a misdirection on a question of law, or a misconception of fact). In the present case, therefore, even if the trial judge was not correct in concluding that the State\u2019s evidence was insufficient to support a conviction, the verdict still stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Finally, there is additional evidence supporting the view that the trial judge intended deliberately to terminate the proceedings and enter an acquittal. At the conclusion of the trial proceedings, the trial judge granted the motion, checked \u201cNG\u201d for \u201cNot Guilty\u201d on the docket sheet for each of the four charges, and signed his name at the bottom of the docket sheet. Though there were also boxes available for \u201cJA\u201d (Judgment of Acquittal) and \u201cDismissed,\u201d the granting of a not guilty verdict supports the view that the judge, at the very least, intended Petitioner\u2019s trial to end with an acquittal as to all charges. It is also further evidence that the judge had no intention of dismissing the case on purely procedural grounds, or by granting a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Thus, whether the trial judge wished to end the proceedings through a grant of judgment of acquittal, or a \u201cNot Guilty\u201d verdict on the merits, the judge made clear his intentions to acquit the Petitioner of the charges against her. Under either scenario, the verdicts of acquittal in favor of Petitioner were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>rendered on the evidence. Thus, the verdicts of \u201cNot Guilty\u201d should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge BATTAGLIA join in the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-12\">.
