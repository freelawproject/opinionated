Cort Kirkwood, and Ann K. Robinson are beneficiaries of a testamentary trust who have sued the trustee, Respondent PNC Bank, NA (PNC). Petitioners allege that PNC improperly demanded that each beneficiary execute a broad release agreement prior to distribution and misapplied the provisions of the Maryland Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Tax-General Article,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in calculating the amount of inheritance tax owed on the trust\u2019s assets and the amount of commission to which PNC was entitled as trustee. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County granted summary judgment in PNC\u2019s favor, finding no legal impropriety in PNC\u2019s distribution plan or its calculation of the tax and commission. Petitioners appealed and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court in an unreported opinion. We granted certiorari to decide whether PNC\u2019s actions are in accord with Maryland law and, for the reasons that follow, hold that they are. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">In 1995, Marion W. Bevard executed a Last Will and Testament that directed the disposition of his estate by, in part, providing for the establishment of a trust. The will appointed Mercantile Safe Deposit and Trust Company (Mercantile) to serve as trustee and mandated that the trust be divided into four equal shares. The will granted one of those shares to Marion\u2019s sister, Rebecca \u201cReba\u201d Bevard, for the duration of her life (the Trust). Following Marion\u2019s death in February 2002, his estate was probated in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore County. Pursuant to the terms of the will, the personal representative of the estate established the Trust and funded it with a $450,450.98 contribution. Under the terms of the Trust, Reba was to receive income from the Trust as well as discretionary distributions of the Trust principal, for life. Upon her death, the remainder of the Trust was to be distributed to Robert B. Kirkwood and, if he died before Reba, the remainder was to be distributed in equal shares to his descendants. The Trust, therefore, had two components: the life estate created for the benefit of Reba, <em>see </em>\u00a7 7-201(c)(2)(i), and the remainder interest, which qualifies as a \u201csubsequent interest\u201d for tax purposes, created for the benefit of Robert B. Kirkwood or his descendants, <em>see </em>\u00a7 7-201(e)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Robert B. Kirkwood predeceased Reba, who died on October 11, 2007. Therefore, upon Reba\u2019s death, the remainder of the Trust \u2014 the subsequent interest \u2014 passed to Robert B. Kirkwood\u2019s four children: Petitioners Barbara Hastings, R. Cort Kirkwood, and Ann K. Robinson; and their brother, Robert Garth Kirkwood. Because Reba was the testator\u2019s sister, the income and principal she received through the Trust was not subject to inheritance tax. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-203(b)(2)(vii). Petitioners and their brother, however, inherited as collateral heirs, so they were obligated to pay ten percent (10%) of the value of the assets on the subsequent interest in the Trust.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The inheritance tax was owed, prior to distribution of the assets to Petitioners and their brother, because the personal representative had not opted to prepay the tax on the subsequent interest, as authorized by \u00a7 7-219, at the time the Trust was created.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus PNC, as the successor trustee to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Mercantile, filed an Application to Fix Inheritance Tax on Non-Probate Assets with the Register of Wills for Baltimore County on December 8, 2007. In its filing, PNC reported that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the Trust had a fair market value of $261,306.72 on the date of Reba\u2019s death, October 11, 2007. Of that amount, approximately $218,100.00 constituted the remainder of the original $450,450.98 principal contributed by Marion\u2019s estate, and the remaining approximate $42,200.00 was income earned on that principal. To calculate the necessary inheritance tax and commission it was entitled to draw as trustee, PNC used the fair market value of the Trust \u2014 $261,306.72. PNC first subtracted a one-half percent final-distribution commission ($1306.53), to which it was statutorily entitled according to \u00a7 14-103(e) of the Maryland Code (2001, 2011 RepLVol.), Estates and Trusts Article (ET),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as a separate trustee fee ($366.69). From the resultant difference of $259,633.50, PNC applied the ten percent inheritance tax rate. Consequently, PNC tendered a $25,963.35 check to pay the inheritance tax, drawn from the Trust account, that was accepted and recorded by the Register of Wills on December 17, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">With the inheritance tax paid, PNC began the task of distributing the Trust\u2019s assets to the beneficiaries. To that end, PNC sent to each Petitioner and Robert Kirkwood a letter that included, among other things, an accounting of the entire Trust and a \u201cWaiver, Receipt, Release and Indemnification Agreement\u201d (Release Agreement). The letter directed that, if the beneficiaries approved of the accounting, they should sign the attached Release Agreement and return it to PNC. The letter further explained that, \u201c[ujpon receipt of the executed Releases from all of the [beneficiaries], we will be in a position to have the cash disbursed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The Release Agreement provided that \u201cthe Trust has terminated; and ... the parties in interest have requested that PNC distribute the Trust assets ... without the filing, audit and adjudication of an account of PNC\u2019s administration of the Trust with a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d In consideration of terminating the Trust by \u201csettling] PNC\u2019s administration of the Trust on an informal basis without having an accounting filed with [a] Court,\u201d the Release Agreement requested, among a number of items, that the beneficiaries: (1) acknowledge that they had consulted with an attorney (or had chosen affirmatively not to do so); (2) declare that they had reviewed the books, records, and statements of the Trust, and; (3) approve of PNC\u2019s handling and administration of the Trust. Pertinent to this appeal, the Release Agreement contained a clause releasing PNC from liability and requiring the beneficiaries to indemnify PNC tor certain expenses attached to the termination of the Trust (release and indemnity clause). That clause read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">[Ejach of the undersigned hereby: ... Releases, indemnifies and holds PNC, in its corporate capacity and as Trustee, harmless from and against any and all losses, claims, demands, surcharges, causes of action, costs and expenses (including legal fees), which may arise from its administration of the Trust, including, but not limited to, the overall investment strategy of the Trustee, all decisions made and actions taken or not taken with regard to the administration of the Trust, and PNC\u2019s distribution of the assets to the Beneficiaries as set forth on the attached schedule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">By letter dated January 2, 2008, John M. Robinson, an attorney and the husband of one of the Petitioners, Ann K. Robinson, objected on behalf of all four beneficiaries to PNC\u2019s plan for distribution of the Trust assets. The objection touched off a flurry of correspondence between Mr. Robinson and PNC during the subsequent four months. Mr. Robinson voiced two major objections on behalf of the beneficiaries: (1) the release and indemnity clause was far too favorable to PNC and the beneficiaries could not be required to execute it before receiving their distributions; and (2) PNC misinterpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>provisions of the Tax-General Article, which caused it to over-calculate its commission and the inheritance tax owed on the Trust assets. The beneficiaries therefore demanded an immediate distribution of the Trust assets and the return of overpaid monies paid to the Register of Wills on the Trust\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In response, PNC defended its calculation of the inheritance tax and explained that execution of the Release Agreement, including execution of the release and indemnity clause, was not a required step towards obtaining a distribution. PNC advised that, instead of utilizing a private agreement, under Maryland law it could petition a court for a final accounting and termination of the Trust to obtain the protection it had sought in the release and indemnity clause. The agreement and clause were offered to the beneficiaries as a matter of industry practice, \u201csince the majority of beneficiaries prefer to terminate their trust via private agreement instead of petitioning a court.\u201d Nonetheless, PNC released a partial distribution of $33,319.97 to each of the beneficiaries, seemingly in response to their objections, while predicating final distributions upon the execution of the appropriate Receipt and Release Agreement or court approval of a final accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Petitioners, contemporaneous with the partial distribution and therefore without knowledge of it, filed a three-count complaint for declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In Count I Petitioners alleged that \u201c[njothing in Maryland law gives PNC the right to demand the Agreement and withhold payment absent its execution.\u201d Petitioners sought a judgment declaring unlawful PNC\u2019s \u201cdemand\u201d for the execution of the release and indemnity clause prior to the distribution of any funds from the Trust. Count I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>also prayed for declaratory relief directing PNC to distribute the entire corpus of the Trust without further delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">In Counts II and III Petitioners addressed their challenge to PNC\u2019s calculation of the distribution commission and inheritance tax. Petitioners alleged that PNC wrongly based its calculation on the $261,306.72 fair market value of the Trust, because that amount included the income earned on the $218,130.00 remaining principal that had been contributed by Marion\u2019s estate. Instead, according to Petitioners, PNC should have computed the tax solely on the amount of principal because \u00a7 7 \u2014 203(j) provides that \u201c[t]he inheritance tax does not apply to the receipt of property that is income, including gains and losses, accrued on probate assets after the date of death of the decedent.\u201d PNC\u2019s alleged failure to use the correct value resulted in a $4,313.71 overpayment in inheritance taxes and a $69.59 overpayment in the distribution commission. Count II prayed for relief declaring \u201cthat PNC must use $218,130.00 as the basis for calculating inheritance tax in this case\u201d; Count III prayed for similar relief in the calculation of PNC\u2019s commission. Both counts prayed for monetary damages from loss of income, prejudgment interest, and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">PNC timely filed an answer and a counterclaim. In the answer PNC raised a number of defenses to liability and in the counterclaim petitioned the Circuit Court to assume jurisdiction over the Trust pursuant to Rule 10-501.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The counterclaim further prayed that the court \u201ceventually approve a Final Account by the Trustee, approve distributions to the interested persons, and release and discharge PNC Bank as Trustee from further liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">After a period of discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. PNC filed a motion requesting sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>mary judgment on Counts II and III, arguing that Petitioners suffered from a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding of the Maryland Inheritance Tax scheme as it applies to Trusts and remainder interests.\u201d PNC asserted that Petitioners\u2019 reliance on \u00a7 7-203(j) was misguided because that subsection, by its own terms, applies only to \u201cprobate assets,\u201d and the funds in the Trust were not probate assets. According to PNC, those funds constituted only a subsequent interest, so \u00a7 7-210(c), establishing the method for calculating the inheritance tax on a subsequent interest, provided the only proper method for determining the value of the Trust. That subsection states: \u201c[T]he inheritance tax on the subsequent interest shall be determined based on the value of the interest when it vests in possession.\u201d PNC argued that, because the Petitioners\u2019 interest in the remainder of the Trust vested upon Reba\u2019s death and the Trust\u2019s fair market value was $261,306.72 on the date of Reba\u2019s death, $261,306.72 was the correct value for calculating the inheritance tax and the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">PNC did not move for summary judgment on Count I because it believed that its counterclaim, asking the Circuit Court to assume jurisdiction over the Trust, \u201cmoot[ed]\u201d that issue. PNC agreed with Petitioners that a trustee could not demand the execution of a private release and indemnity clause. PNC argued, though, that it did not demand that the Petitioners sign the Release Agreement or accede to the release and indemnity clause; it <em>requested </em>that the Petitioners do so in order that the Trust could be terminated expeditiously while obtaining the same protection the Trust would have received from a court\u2019s accounting. Therefore, according to PNC, the lawfulness of a demand for a release and indemnity clause became moot when PNC withdrew its request and moved, by counterclaim, to terminate the Trust by filing a petition with the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Petitioners responsively moved for summary judgment on all three counts. On Count I they argued that, by demanding execution of the release and indemnity clause, PNC required the Petitioners to release and indemnify PNC against all losses and expenses that arose from the administration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Trust. Petitioners asserted that nothing under Maryland law granted PNC the ability to demand as much, and no court in the State could grant an order that released PNC from liability and indemnified PNC for expenses as broadly as the proffered clause. In relation to Counts II and III, Petitioners reasserted that \u00a7 7-2030), excepting the inheritance tax from \u201creceipt of property that is income ... accrued on probate assets after the date of death of the decedent,\u201d applied to the Trust. As a result, $218,130.00 was the proper amount on which the inheritance tax should have been calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">After a hearing, the Circuit Court issued an order assuming jurisdiction of the Trust. By the same order, the court also granted PNC\u2019s motions on Counts II and III and entered judgment on those counts in PNC\u2019s favor, agreeing with PNC\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 7 \u2014 203(j) and 7 \u2014 210(c). The court denied Petitioners\u2019 motion on all counts and specified in its order, in relation to Count I, that Petitioners \u201cwere not required to sign any [Release Agreement].\u201d The court, however, did not enter judgment in favor of either party on Count I, reasoning that there remained a question of whether Petitioners lost income because of PNC\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">PNC subsequently filed with the court an inventory and final accounting of the assets in the Trust. PNC also filed a Petition for Attorney\u2019s Fees and a Petition for Court Approval of Final Account and Termination of Trust and for Discharge of PNC Bank, N.A. as Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Because no judgment had been entered on Count I, Petitioners renewed their Motion for Summary Judgment as to Count I. After a second hearing, the Circuit Court granted in part PNC\u2019s Petition for Attorney\u2019s Fees, awarding PNC $20,000 in fees, and issued an order terminating the Trust, directing distribution of the Trust assets, and discharging PNC from further responsibility following the distribution. Finally, the court denied Petitioners\u2019 renewed motion for summary judgment, specifically finding that PNC requested, rather than \u201crequired,\u201d that the release and indemnity clause be executed. Because the court could not \u201cfind ... any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Maryland Law against a fiduciary requesting a [Release Agreement] as was done in this case,\u201d the court entered judgment in favor of PNC on Count I and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Petitioners noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. That court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court in an unreported opinion. Petitioners sought, and we granted, a writ of certiorari, <em>Hastings v. PNC Bank, NA, 424 </em>Md. 291, 35 A.3d 488 (2012), to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">1. Whether a Maryland trustee can lawfully demand or request an indemnity from its beneficiaries that is broader than the protection that the trustee could have obtained through a court order or a release like that permitted for a personal representative?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">2. Whether Section 7-203(j) of the Tax-General Article should have been applied to the trust assets in this case being distributed to remaindermen so as to exempt the income and gains they received from any inheritance tax?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">In this appeal, the Circuit Court entered summary judgment in favor of PNC on Counts I and II<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the complaint. \u201cA trial court may grant summary judgment when there is no genuine dispute of material fact and a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Appiah v. Hall, </em>416 Md. 533, 546, 7 A.3d 536, 544 (2010) (quoting <em>120 West Fayette Street, LLLP v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>413 Md. 309, 329, 992 A.2d 459, 471 (2010)). Our task on appellate review is therefore two-fold: we \u201cmust first determine whether there is any genuine dispute of material facts,\u201d <em>Beka Indus., Inc. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Worcester <em>Cnty. Bd. of Educ., </em>419 Md. 194, 227, 18 A.3d 890, 910 (2011) (quoting <em>Dashiell v. Meeks, </em>396 Md. 149, 163, 913 A.2d 10, 18 (2006)), and then determine the legal correctness of the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment, <em>Appiah, </em>416 Md. at 546, 7 A.3d at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Petitioners\u2019 challenge to the Court\u2019s judgment in PNC\u2019s favor on Counts I and II are grounded in purely legal arguments, to which we accord a non-deferential standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\n<em>Legal Validity of the Release Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Petitioners\u2019 first challenge relates to the Release Agreement that PNC sought to have Petitioners and their brother execute. They focus on the following clause in the Agreement, which we restate for clarity and ease of reference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">6. Releases, <em>indemnifies and holds PNC, </em>in its corporate capacity and <em>as Trustee, harmless from </em>and against <em>all losses, </em>claims, demands, surcharges, causes of action, costs and expenses (including any and all legal fees), <em>which may arise from its administration of the Trust, including, </em>but not limited to, the overall investment strategy of Trustee, <em>all decisions made and actions taken or not taken with regard to the administration of the Trust, </em>and PNC\u2019s distribution of the assets to the Beneficiaries as set forth on the attached schedule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">(Emphasis added by Petitioners.)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Petitioners argue that PNC demanded unanimous execution of the release and indemnity clause \u201cas a condition precedent to any distribution,\u201d and such a demand \u201cviolates the Maryland law of trusts by turning it on its head.\u201d They cite several provisions of the Estates and Trust Article but make no argument that any of those provisions, either expressly or by implication, prohibits the action PNC took. The heart of Petitioners\u2019 argument, instead, is that the release and indemnity clause is over-broad. In Petitioners\u2019 words, the release and indemnity clause would force them to release and indemnify PNC \u201cagainst <em>all losses and expenses </em>that arise from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>[PNC\u2019s] administration of the Trust.\u201d (Emphasis added). Such terms, according to Petitioners, are so favorable to PNC that the clause, in effect, \u201cattempt[s] to contractually place the beneficiaries in the position of protecting the trustee when it should be the other way around.\u201d Petitioners claim that PNC, by requesting execution of the clause, breached its common law, \u201cuniversally recognized[,] basic duty of good faith\u201d by placing its own interests before the interest of Petitioners. Not surprisingly, PNC disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Generally, to determine whether a trustee wields lawful authority to take certain actions in connection with trust matters we look to three different sources: (1) the instrument that creates the trust; (2) applicable statutes; and (3) the common law. <em>See </em>ET, \u00a7 15-102(b)(2); <em>see also </em>Restatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a7 85 (2007)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (\u201cIn administering a trust, the trustee has, except as limited by statute or the terms of the trust, (a) all of the powers over trust property that a legally competent, unmarried individual has with respect to individually owned property, as well as (b) powers granted by statute or the terms of the trust.\u201d). In this case, the creating instrument <em>(i.e. </em>Marion Bevard\u2019s Last Will and Testament) and applicable statutes are of no assistance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Disposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>this appeal, therefore, requires us to determine whether PNC\u2019s request for execution of the release and indemnity clause contravenes Maryland common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Preliminarily, nothing in the testator\u2019s will precluded the trustee from exercising whatever authority the trustee was already allowed by law. The law of Maryland, moreover, permits a trustee to request a release, and Petitioners do not argue the contrary. As for Petitioners\u2019 assertions of breach of fiduciary duty and overbreadth, both fall short.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">A trustee owes to the beneficiaries of a trust duties of administration, prudence and loyalty. The trustee\u2019s duty of loyalty \u2014 as the duty is known in this state \u2014 is well-established in the common law. <em>Bd. of Trustees v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>317 Md. 72, 109, 562 A.2d 720, 738 (1989). Broadly put, the duty prohibits a trustee from using the property of a beneficiary for the trustee\u2019s own purposes. <em>Gianakos v. Magiros, </em>238 Md. 178, 185-86, 208 A.2d 718, 722 (1965). A trustee is otherwise prohibited from \u201cplacing himself in any position where his self-interest will or may conflict with his duties as trustee,\u201d and \u201cusing the advantage of his position to gain any benefit for himself at the expense of the beneficiary.\u201d <em>Hughes v. McDaniel, </em>202 Md. 626, 632, 98 A.2d 1, 4 (1953). A trustee also must refrain from using the advantages of the fiduciary relationship for the benefit of a non-beneficiary third party. <em>Bd. of Trustees, </em>317 Md. at 109, 562 A.2d at 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Of course, it is equally well-established that the restrictions associated with the duty of loyalty are not absolute. <em>See, e.g., Goldman v. Rubin, </em>292 Md. 693, 705-06, 441 A.2d 713, 720 (1982); <em>Turk v. Grossman, </em>176 Md. 644, 666, 6 A.2d 639, 650 (1939). A trustee may engage in an otherwise-prohibited course of action if authorized \u201cby statute, by the instrument creating the trust, or by the court having jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>tion of the subject matter.\u201d <em>Goldman, </em>292 Md. at 706, 441 A.2d at 720 (quoting <em>Harlan v. Lee, </em>174 Md. 579, 593, 199 A. 862, 869 (1938)); <em>accord </em>Restatement, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 78 cmt. (a); 3 Austin Wakeman Scott et al., <em>Scott and Ascher on Trusts, </em>\u00a7 17.2 at 1084 (5th ed.2007). Likewise, and important for the purposes of this appeal, a trustee may engage in a self-interested course of action so long as the beneficiaries provide valid, informed consent. <em>Goldman, </em>292 Md. at 706, 441 A.2d at 720; <em>Grossman, </em>176 Md. at 666, 6 A.2d at 650; <em>accord </em>Restatement, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 78 cmt. (c)(3) (\u201cA particular transaction that would otherwise violate a trustee\u2019s duty of loyalty may be authorized by consent properly obtained from or on behalf of all of the trust beneficiaries.\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">It almost goes without saying that, if the law countenances consent to what would otherwise be a breach of the duty of loyalty, the law also must countenance requests for consent. If not, then a trustee would be unable to solicit consent without first breaching the duty. Put simply, one must be able to ask for permission in order to obtain it. It is easy to see, then, that PNC could not have breached its duty of loyalty in this ease merely by asking Petitioners and their brother to execute a reasonable release and indemnity clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The terms of the release and indemnity clause, moreover, are not so broad and one-sided as to place impermissibly PNC\u2019s interests before those of Petitioners. The clause, as we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>read it, contains two terms: First it \u201c[releases\u201d PNC, \u201cin its corporate capacity and as Trustee,\u201d from \u201cany claims,\u201d \u201cdemands,\u201d and \u201ccauses of actions\u201d arising from the administration of the Trust; and second, it requires that PNC be \u201cindemnifie[d]\u201d for \u201call\u201d \u201csurcharges,\u201d \u201ccosts,\u201d and \u201cexpenses (including legal fees)\u201d arising from the administration of the Trust. These two terms track closely, although not perfectly, to the terms PNC would have received had it petitioned for (and received) a court order formally approving the accounting and termination of the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Maryland Rule 10-501 authorizes a fiduciary or any \u201cinterested person\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to \u201cfile a petition requesting a court to assume jurisdiction over a fiduciary estate other than a guardianship of the property of a minor or disabled person.\u201d A trustee or beneficiary may invoke Rule 10-501 to obtain instruction from a court on how to proceed with the distribution of trust funds when there is some doubt as to the powers or duties of the trusteeship. <em>See </em>Restatement, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 71. A trustee may choose to petition a court under Rule 10-501 to obtain a court order that approves of the trustee\u2019s accounting of the trust\u2019s corpus. <em>See </em>Restatement, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 71 cmt. (c). Generally, a trustee will do this because \u201cthe judicial settlement of a trustee\u2019s account renders <em>res judicata </em>all matters in dispute and determined by the court in settling the account, as well as all matters that were open to dispute but not actually disputed,\u201d 4 Scott, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 24.25 at 1789; thus, \u201ca court order approving all or part of a trustee\u2019s accounts discharges the trustee from liability (or further liability) for matters appropriately disclosed,\u201d Restatement, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 83 cmt. (c). <em>Accord Harlan v. Gleason, </em>180 Md. 24, 30, 22 A.2d 579, 581-82 (1941) (\u201cThe long-accepted practice in closing trust estates, as indicated by all the authorities, ... is for the trustee to collect all trust funds, report to the court, have an audit stated, and actually distribute the fund accordingly as the court orders. That procedure must be followed, otherwise the trustee could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>not secure proper and binding releases so as to relieve himself and his bond.\u201d); Restatement, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 71 cmt. (b) (\u201c[IJnstructions provided by an appropriate court will bind the trustee and beneficiaries who ... are properly made parties to the proceedings.\u201d); 4 Scott, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 28.1 at 1645 (\u201cJudicial approval of a trustee\u2019s accounts generally gives the trustee the defense of <em>res judicata </em>as to all matters adequately disclosed. Thus, judicial approval generally bars the beneficiaries from subsequently surcharging the trustee with respect to anything that is within the scope of the accounting.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Moreover, a trustee is generally entitled to indemnity for expenses incurred reasonably and properly in the course of administering a trust. Restatement, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 38(2). Maryland law provides explicitly for this right to indemnification, mandating that \u201ca trustee ... [i]s entitled to reimbursement from trust property for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of fiduciary services.\u201d ET \u00a7 14-405(m)(l). Satisfaction of the trustee\u2019s right to indemnification can be accomplished by lien; that is, the trustee gains a security interest in the trust\u2019s assets upon incurring reasonable and proper expenses on the trust\u2019s behalf. 4 Scott, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 22.1.1 at 1627. This security interest takes priority over the interest of the beneficiaries, so \u201c[t]he beneficiaries are not entitled to distribution of the trust property until the trustee has been indemnified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1629. Finally, the amount of indemnification to which a trustee is entitled can be \u201cenlarged or diminished by agreement between the trustee and the beneficiaries.\u201d Restatement, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 38 cmt. (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">All this is to say that, before PNC presented the Release Agreement to Petitioners and their brother, PNC was legally entitled to some measure of protection and indemnity. With or without the consent of Petitioners, PNC was free under Rule 10-501 to begin judicial proceedings to audit and terminate the Trust. Those proceedings eventually would have resulted in a court order that would have barred, as <em>res judicata, </em>all matters disputed and open to dispute in settling the Trust account. Moreover, PNC was entitled to indemnifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>cation for \u201creasonable expenses incurred in the performance of fiduciary services,\u201d ET \u00a7 14-406(m)(l), before distribution of the Trust\u2019s corpus took place. No matter what occurred in connection with the Release Agreement, then, Petitioners, in this narrow and specific context, would have ended up in a position where their interest in the distribution of the Trust\u2019s funds was subordinated to PNC\u2019s interest in protection from legal liability and indemnification for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Against this backdrop, the terms of PNC\u2019s release and indemnity clause are not a radical departure from the common law protection and statutory right to which PNC already was entitled. To be sure, the release and indemnity clause sought protection for PNC in its role as trustee <em>and </em>\u201cin its corporate capacity.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The clause also sought a right to indemnification for \u201call\u201d costs arising from the administration of the Trust, rather than all costs reasonably and properly incurred. These differences are material and represent a fairly sizeable increase in the amount of protection PNC would have received, as trustee, from liability and cost. The differences, though, are of degree rather than kind. The differences do not represent a reorientation of the interests that PNC and Petitioners respectively possess, but represent, at bottom, PNC\u2019s arm\u2019s length request to exchange increased protection and indemnity for a quicker and less costly distribution of trust funds. Petitioners retained the choice to accede to that request, perhaps negotiate a release agreement not as broad in its protection of PNC, or simply reject it out of hand and accept the delay in distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>It is also worth noting that, no matter the terms of the clause itself, the Release Agreement could not protect PNC from liability arising from fraud, material mistake or irregularity on PNC\u2019s part. <em>See Allen v. Ritter, </em>424 Md. 216, 229-30, 35 A.3d 443, 450-51 (2011). Had PNC presented a fraudulent or inaccurate accounting to a court, that court\u2019s order approving the accounting, distribution, and termination of the trust would not have stood as a <em>res judicata </em>bar to those matters fraudulently or inaccurately represented. <em>See </em>Restatement, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 83 cmt. (c) (\u201cBecause a trustee has an affirmative duty to disclose relevant information, a matter involving sensitive issues must be revealed in the accounting with sufficient clarity to invite attention to the issue if the court order is to protect the trustee as a matter of issue preclusion.\u201d); <em>see also, 4 </em>Scott, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 23.1 at 1645 (\u201cOf course, a trustee who in rendering the account is guilty of fraud or fraudulent concealment is not protected.\u201d). Moreover, \u201cthis Court has consistently held that fraud can and will invalidate an otherwise-complete release of liability.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>424 Md. at 229, 35 A.3d at 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We therefore hold that the Circuit Court correctly denied Petitioners\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to Count I. PNC\u2019s request for execution of the release and indemnity clause was only that \u2014 a request for consent to take a certain course of action. Moreover, PNC\u2019s request, though expanding upon an interest already possessed, was not in its terms so one-sided as to place impermissibly its own interests ahead of those of Petitioners. PNC\u2019s action, not prohibited by statute, was likewise lawful under the common law. The Circuit Court properly entered judgment in PNC\u2019s favor on Count I of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\n<em>Application of the Inheritance Tax Rate to the Trust</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">We turn next to Petitioners\u2019 challenge to the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of PNC on Count II of the complaint, which assailed the method used by PNC to calculate the amount of inheritance tax due the Register of Wills prior to distribution. On this issue the parties are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>generally in accord. They agree that Petitioners are collateral relatives of Marion Bevard, owing a ten percent inheritance tax on the value of the Trust assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">The parties part company, though, on the value of the assets upon which the tax rate should be calculated. Petitioners argue that the tax should be assessed on the $218,130.00 that constitutes the remainder of the original contribution from Marion\u2019s estate, while PNC asserts that $261,306.72, which includes income accrued on that contribution, is the correct figure. Understanding how each party arrives at its respective figure necessitates a brief explanation of the application of inheritance taxes in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Section 7-202 of the Tax-General Article imposes a ten percent inheritance tax \u201con the privilege of receiving property that passes from a decedent and has a taxable situs in the State.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-204(b) (\u201cThe inheritance tax rate is 10% of the clear value of the property that passes from a decedent.\u201d). The tax applies broadly to property passing by devise, including property held in trust. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-201(d)(l)(i). A devisee need not hold a vested, absolute interest in the devised property for the inheritance tax to apply; by law, the inheritance tax is applicable to a range of future and non-absolute interests. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7-208, 7-209. Pertinent to this case, the inheritance tax applies to property in which a devisee holds only a \u201csubsequent interest,\u201d which is defined as \u201ca vested or contingent remainder, executory or reversionary interest, or other future interest that is created by a decedent and will or may vest in possession after the death of the decedent.\u201d \u00a7 7 \u2014 201(e)(1). Because operation of Marion\u2019s will granted the beneficiaries a remainder interest that vested only upon the deaths of Reba Bevard and Robert Kirkwood, Petitioners and their brother each held only a subsequent interest in the assets of the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Taxation of a subsequent interest proceeds differently than taxation of a present possessory interest because a subsequent interest does not vest into possession when it is created. Under Maryland law, a subsequent interest can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>taxed by either of two methods. A personal representative administering an estate that contains a subsequent interest may prepay the inheritance tax or defer payment. Prepayment is accomplished when the personal representative pays the inheritance tax at some \u201creasonable time\u201d after the initial valuation of the devised property, but before the interest vests in the devisee\u2019s possession. \u00a7 7-219(a). Alternatively, deferring payment is accomplished by merely waiting to pay the tax until the subsequent interest vests into a present, possessory interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In terms of the present case, prepayment could have occurred at some reasonable time after Marion\u2019s death in 2002, when Marion\u2019s estate was administered and the Trust was established. Deferred payment could only happen after Reba\u2019s death in 2007, when Reba\u2019s life estate terminated and the beneficiaries\u2019 remainder interest vested in their possession. The personal representative of Marion\u2019s estate opted not to prepay the tax upon creation of the Trust. Petitioners, moreover, filed no application to prepay. They, therefore, necessarily chose to defer payment. This choice is important for a number of reasons, chief among them is that the value used for the calculation of the inheritance tax differs depending on whether a devisee prepays or defers payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 7-210, the general rule for calculating inheritance tax on a subsequent interest is as follows: after a personal representative elects when to pay, the inheritance tax payment is made in the amount of ten percent of the value of the subsequent interest <em>at the time of the payment. </em>This is because Maryland law provides that for inheritance tax purposes, a subsequent interest is valued at the time of the payment, \u00a7 7-210(a)(l) &amp; (c)(l)(i), and the tax amount is based on that timely value, \u00a7 7-210(a)(2) <em>&amp; </em>(c)(l)(iii). In practice, this means that, if a personal representative prepays, the personal representative pays a ten percent tax on the value of the interest at the time of the devisor\u2019s death. More important, if a personal representative defers payment, the remainderman pays a ten percent tax on the value of the interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>when it vests, regardless of whether the interest has appreciated or depreciated from its original valuation, <em>Skaughnessy v. Perlman, </em>198 Md. 619, 626, 85 A.2d 38, 41 (1951), because the inheritance tax is a tax on \u201cthe estate as it passes to the beneficiary, and not merely ... the estate as it passes from the person who dies \u2018seized and possessed thereof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lilly v. State, </em>156 Md. 94, 104-05, 143 A. 661, 665 (1928) (quoting <em>Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. State, </em>143 Md. 644, 648, 123 A. 50, 51 (1923)).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Petitioners argue that PNC miscalculated the amount of inheritance tax due on the assets of the Trust. Specifically, they argue that, in addition to \u00a7 7-210, \u00a7 7-203(j) applies to the taxation of subsequent interests. That provision states: \u201cThe inheritance tax does not apply to the receipt of property that is income, including gains and losses, accrued on probate assets after the death of the decedent.\u201d Petitioners thus argue that, when a devisee chooses to defer payment, the devisee pays inheritance tax on the value of the interest at the time it vests <em>less any income gained or lost during the running of the prior estate. </em>In other words, according to Petitioners, the value of a vested subsequent interest is derived only from the property that was devised from the devisor to the devisee and not from any income that may have accrued during the intervening estate. Consequently, they assert, PNC should have calculated the inheritance tax on the $218,130.00 value of the beneficiaries\u2019 interest that constituted property devised from the estate, instead of using the $261,306.72 figure that included the principal plus accrued income.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">In support of their reading of the Tax-General Article, applying \u00a7 7-203(j) to the taxation of subsequent interests, Petitioners cite a number of secondary sources and testimonial letters from the legislative history. Their reading, however, relies primarily on two assertions: first, that the assets of the Trust are \u201cprobate assets\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7-203(j); and second, that \u00a7 7 \u2014 203(j) can be read in harmony with \u00a7 7-210 so as not to render superfluous or nugatory any provision in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>In support of the former assertion, Petitioners rely on a treatise definition of \u201cprobate assets\u201d that includes \u201cremainder interests.\u201d In support of the latter assertion, Petitioners argue that the structure of \u00a7 7-210 itself provides for what they claim is the proper result.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Specifically, Petitioners point to \u00a7 7 \u2014 210(c)(l)(ii), which dictates that when a devisee defers payment, the subsequent interest \u201cshall be valued when it vests in possession in the manner stated in subsection (a).\u201d Petitioners assert that this provision grants a reader license to move to subsection (a), skip over subsection (a)(1), and apply subsection (a)(2) to those instances in which a devisee who has deferred payment must calculate the inheritance tax due. Subsection (a)(2) provides that \u201c[t]he total inheritance tax on all interests in the property valued shall equal the inheritance tax that would have been due if an absolute interest in the property passed from the decedent.\u201d Petitioners explain that, if an absolute interest in the Trust had passed to them from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the estate, it could not have included income accrued on the Trust\u2019s assets, and therefore \u00a7 7-210 can be read harmoniously with \u00a7 7-203(j) in excluding income from the calculation of the inheritance tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">PNC disagrees with Petitioners\u2019 reading of the Tax-General Article, as does Amicus Curiae State of Maryland.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> PNC\u2019s argument proceeds as follows: the beneficiaries\u2019 remainder interest in the Trust is a \u201csubsequent interest,\u201d as that term is defined by \u00a7 7-201(e). As a result, only \u00a7 7-210, entitled \u201cSubsequent interests,\u201d governs the taxation of the beneficiaries\u2019 interest. Subsection (c) of that provision specifically controls the calculation of the inheritance tax for a devisee who defers payment, providing that the tax amount \u201cshall be determined based on the value of the interest when it vests in possession.\u201d Subsection (c) makes no mention of excepting income from the value of the interest when it vests in possession; therefore, income is not so excepted. Moreover, \u00a7 7-203(j), by its own plain language, applies only to \u201cprobate assets.\u201d The assets in the Trust were probate assets only while held by the personal representative of the estate during administration of it. Those assets lost their character as probate assets and became Trust assets when, at the close of probate, they were used to fund the Trust. As a result, \u00a7 7-203(j) is inapplicable to this case, and $261,306.72 was the correct value upon which to base the inheritance tax calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">PNC provides the better interpretation of the pertinent provisions. The primary goal of statutory interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>tation is to effectuate the intent of the legislature. <em>Allen, </em>424 Md. at 223, 35 A.3d at 446. The task of interpretation begins with an examination of the plain language of the statute. <em>Id., </em>35 A.3d at 446. \u201cA plain reading of the statute assumes none of its language is superfluous or nugatory.\u201d <em>Newell v. Runnels, </em>407 Md. 578, 640, 967 A.2d 729, 766 (2009) (quoting <em>Bost v. State, </em>406 Md. 341, 350, 958 A.2d 356, 361 (2008)). We do not add or delete words from an unambiguous statute, nor do we entertain a forced or subtle interpretation that extends or limits a statute\u2019s meaning. <em>Id. </em>at 640-41, 967 A.2d at 766. \u201cWhen a statute\u2019s plain language is unambiguous, we need only to apply the statute as written, and our efforts to ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent end there.\u201d <em>Carven v. State Ret. &amp; Pension Sys., </em>416 Md. 389, 407-08, 7 A.3d 38, 49 (2010) (quoting <em>Crofton Convalescent Ctr., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>413 Md. 201, 216, 991 A.2d 1257, 1266 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The first defect in Petitioners\u2019 interpretation is the definition Petitioners assign to \u201cprobate assets,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 7-203(j). We agree with the State, amicus in this appeal, that income earned by a trust during the life tenancy of a beneficiary is not income \u201caccrued on probate assets.\u201d As the State points out, neither the Tax-General Article nor the Estates and Trusts Article explicitly defines \u201cprobate assets,\u201d but ET \u00a7 1-301 provides insight into the term\u2019s meaning. That section, in outlining the type of property subject to the provisions of the Estates and Trusts Article, provides that \u201c[a]ll property of a decedent shall be subject to the estates of decedents law, and upon the person\u2019s death shall pass directly to the personal representative, who shall hold the legal title for administration and distribution.\u201d ET \u00a7 l-301(a). We can surmise then, that whether an asset is a \u201cprobate asset\u201d is linked inexorably to whether legal title to that asset is held by a personal representative for administration and distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">We agree with PNC and the State that the personal representative of the estate did not hold legal title to the assets of the Trust after Reba\u2019s life estate was established. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>The personal representative only held title to those assets during the administration of the estate. The assets of the Trust, therefore, were only \u201cprobate assets\u201d during the administration of Marion\u2019s estate. Once the administration concluded and the assets were contributed to the Trust, to be administered by a trustee, the assets lost their character as \u201cprobate assets\u201d and became simply trust assets. Consequently, the assets of the Trust do not qualify for the exemption laid out in \u00a7 7-203(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">The assets also could not qualify as \u201cprobate assets\u201d because such a reading of \u00a7 7-203(j) would conflict with the mandates of \u00a7 7-210. As our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals illustrated, Petitioners\u2019 reading of \u00a7 7-210 forces an interpretation that does not comport with the statute. Specifically, \u00a7 7 \u2014 203(j) can only be made to harmonize with \u00a7 7-210 if the latter, parallel to \u00a7 7-203(j), excepts income from the calculation of inheritance tax on subsequent interests. In order to read \u00a7 7-210 as doing that, one would need to accept that \u00a7 7-210(a)(2) governs the determination of inheritance tax when the personal representative defers payment. There is no conceivable support for such a contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Subsections (a) and (c) of \u00a7 7-210 are distinct subsections. Subsection (a) governs the valuation and calculation of inheritance tax for personal representatives who elect to prepay, while subsection (c) does the same for those who defer payment. Subsection(c)(l)(i) begins by directing that \u201cthe whole property shall be valued when the subsequent interest vests in possession.\u201d Subsection (c)(l)(ii) then adds that \u201cthe value of the subsequent interest shall be valued when it vests in possession in the manner stated in subsection (a).\u201d The last six words of that subsection \u2014 \u201cin the manner stated in subsection (a)\u201d \u2014 direct the reader to the provision in subsection (a)(1) that prescribes how a subsequent interest is valued (\u201csubtracting the value of all preceding and concurrent interests from the value of the whole property\u201d). Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 argument, those six words do not direct the reader to subsection (a)(2), which describes how the inheritance tax is calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Instead, \u00a7 7-210(c)(l)(iii) provides explicitly for the determination of inheritance tax when a personal representative defers payment. That subsection states that \u201cthe inheritance tax due on the subsequent interest shall be determined <em>based on the value of the interest when it vests in possession </em>and on the relationship of the original decedent to the person in whom the interest ultimately vests in possession.\u201d (Emphasis added). It is clearly intended to be the sole provision governing deferred payment, never sharing that duty with \u00a7 7-210(a)(2). Simply put, if, as Petitioners argue, \u00a7 7-210(c)(l)(ii) directed that \u00a7 7-210(a)(2) governed the calculation of inheritance tax for a personal representative who deferred payment, it would directly conflict with and render nugatory the provision in subsection (c) that explicitly mandates how to calculate inheritance tax after deferring payment. Reading \u00a7 7 \u2014 210(c)(l)(ii) as Petitioners do essentially reads \u00a7 7-210(c)(l)(iii) out of the law, which we are not permitted to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Only \u00a7 7 \u2014 210(c)(l)(iii) was intended by the General Assembly to govern the determination of the amount of inheritance tax owed on a subsequent interest when a personal representative chooses to defer payment. Under Petitioners\u2019 interpretation, \u00a7 7-210 cannot be harmonized with \u00a7 7-203(j). Section 7-203(j) excepts income from the inheritance tax, and we have repeatedly interpreted the language of \u00a7 7 \u2014 210(c)(l)(iii) as including income in the inheritance tax calculation. <em>See Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. State, </em>264 Md. 455, 464, 287 A.2d 502, 507 (1972) (noting that when payment is postponed under Article 81 \u00a7 161, which is now \u00a7 7-210(c), the remainderman \u201cpays a tax on the value of the interest at the time it comes into possession\u201d); <em>Shaughnessy, </em>198 Md. at 626, 85 A.2d at 41 (stating that the statutory inheritance tax scheme provides that \u201cthe taker pays on the basis of what he gets, whether more or less than the value at the date of the testator\u2019s death\u201d); <em>Lilly, </em>156 Md. at 105, 143 A. at 665 (noting that the inheritance tax is a tax \u201con the transmission of the estate, and is a premium for the enjoyment of the benefit thereby secured,\u201d therefore the tax must be valued on \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>current money and the appraised assets thus transmitted and acquired\u201d) (quoting <em>Safe Deposit Trust Co., </em>143 Md. at 649, 123 A. at 52). We cannot assume that the legislature intended two provisions, \u00a7 7-203(j) and \u00a7 7-210, both to apply to the taxation of subsequent interests and to conflict directly with one another. Under Petitioner\u2019s interpretation, \u00a7 7-203(j) cannot be made to harmonize with \u00a7 7-210. We therefore hold that the legislature did not intend for \u00a7 7-203(j)\u2019s \u201cprobate assets\u201d to include assets like those found in the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">PNC correctly included the income that accrued on the assets of the Trust in its valuation of the Trust for inheritance tax purposes. The Circuit Court properly entered judgment in PNC\u2019s favor on Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">In conclusion, PNC\u2019s request for execution of the Release Agreement did not contravene Maryland common law. The request was simply that \u2014 a request \u2014 and it did not ask for a reorientation of the parties\u2019 interests. It only asked to redefine the scope of protection and indemnity to which PNC was already entitled, in return for a less costly and more efficient distribution of trust funds. Moreover, PNC was correct in its calculation of the inheritance tax owed on the assets of the Trust. Section 7 \u2014 203(j), excepting income on \u201cprobate assets\u201d from the inheritance tax equation, is not applicable to the tax scenario presented here. The Circuit Court therefore was legally correct in granting summary judgment in favor of PNC.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

As mentioned, Petitioners\u2019 brother, Robert Garth Kirkwood, a resident of Florida, did not join the suit.

It is not applicable to distributions like the one at issue in the present appeal and therefore not applicable to resolution of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">In regards to applicable statutes, we have interpreted ET \u00a7 9-111 to \"allow[] a personal representative to obtain a release from legatees even when acting pursuant to the distribution order of an orphans' court, and such a court may order those legatees to sign the release when the personal representative so requests.\u201d <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Ritter, </em>424 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>216, 231, 35 A.3d 443, 452 (2011). ET \u00a7 9-111, though, by its own terms, applies only to the power of a personal representative making a distribution from an estate. There exists no comparable subsection in the Maryland Code applicable to trustees making a distribution from a fiduciary trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\">. The dissent accuses PNC of not providing the beneficiaries with \"full and complete information\u201d explaining their rights sufficient to overcome this prohibition against self-interested dealings. We do not dispute that a trustee has the duty to provide beneficiaries with \"full information and complete understanding of all the facts.\u201d <em>McDaniel v. Hughes, </em>206 Md. 206, 220, 111 A.2d 204, 210 (1955). But that is not the question before this Court, and the parties did not brief or argue that issue on appeal. Instead, we are asked to decide whether a Maryland trustee lawfully can request the type of indemnity PNC sought here, not whether PNC's release agreement provided sufficient information to the beneficiaries. We note, however, that trustees seeking similar indemnification agreements in the future should adhere to the principle of \"full information\u201d in order to allow beneficiaries to make informed decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b65-5\">. Maryland Rule 10-103(f)(2) defines \"interested person\u201d as, among other things, \"a current income beneficiary of the fiduciary estate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b67-6\">. We note that such language would not extend protection to other services provided to the Trust by PNC. For example, although the trust department of a financial institution could obtain a release of liability and indemnification agreement for the activities of its trust department in administering the trust, it could not seek a release of liability of its securities brokerage for brokerage services provided to the trust, if the trustee happened to employ the institution\u2019s own brokerage division to execute trades on behalf of the trust. Otherwise, the financial institution would effectively use its position as trustee to obtain a release for its securities division, which would appear at odds with the duty of loyalty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b72-5\">.

The State did so on behalf of the Comptroller of the Treasury and the Registers of Wills.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b77-10\">ADKINS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AG\">Dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Just last term, this Court reiterated that \u201cin no state are trustees, whether individuals or corporations, held to a stricter account than in Maryland.\u201d <em>D\u2019Aoust v. Diamond, </em>424 Md. 549, 605, 36 A.3d 941 (2012) (citation and quotation marks omitted). The Majority\u2019s opinion in this case is a sharp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>departure from that principle. The Majority sees \u201cmaterial\u201d differences between the protection the trustee sought under a release and indemnification agreement and the protection it could obtain from the court. Despite that, the Majority approved this practice. This will encourage more widespread use of such unlawful releases, and enable banks and other trustees to cite this case to justify other breaches as one \u201cof degree rather than kind.\u201d Maj. Op. at 29, 54 A.3d at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Alternatively, the Majority holds that, even if the release and indemnification agreement breached the trustee\u2019s duty of loyalty, a beneficiary may always consent to a breach of trust. In so holding, the Majority ignored the issue of whether the trustee provided the beneficiaries with full and complete information, which is required in any dealings between trustees and beneficiaries, and concluded all too swiftly that the beneficiaries in this case were in a position to give a \u201cvalid, informed\u201d consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">I do not share the Majority\u2019s view and respectfully dissent. In this case, the trust beneficiaries (\u201cBeneficiaries\u201d) sought a declaratory judgment on the issue of whether \u201cPNC\u2019s policy of requiring [a broad release and indemnification prior to the distribution of trust funds] violates Maryland law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, I would hold that it does. I would add that, although beneficiaries may consent to a breach of trust, they can only do so when they have full and complete information regarding the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">I. PNC\u2019s Practice of Seeking Release and Indemnification</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">No one disputes that it is PNC\u2019s common practice to seek release and indemnification agreements such as the one at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>issue in this case. All along, PNC has characterized such agreements as \u201ccustomary\u201d and \u201ca prevalent practice.\u201d In this case, the preamble to the Release and Indemnification Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) recited that the Beneficiaries \u201crequested\u201d trust fund distribution \u201cwithout the filing, audit and adjudication\u201d of the final accounting by a court, when in fact they had not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the Beneficiaries protested, pointing out that it \u201cis not true\u201d that they made such a request, PNC continued to insist that it would not \u201cbe in a position\u201d to make distributions without the Agreement. It explained that, even though there was no request, \u201c[tjhis is standard language and is based on the fact that there is no reason to petition the Circuit Court to terminate the trust.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Without any explanation of why \u201cthere is no reason\u201d to seek court approval of the final accounting, or the differences between the proposed Agreement and distribution pursuant to a court order, PNC asserted: \u201cthe majority of beneficiaries prefer to terminate their trust via private agreement instead of petitioning a court.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">II. The Impermissible Breadth of the Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">No one denies that the Agreement would give PNC broader protection from liability than a court order. The Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Court noted that \u201cit must have been frustrating to have this demand for the <em>extremely broad </em>Waiver Release and Indemnity Agreement that was used____\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The Majority concluded that there were <em>\u201cmaterial [differences </em>that] represent a fairly sizeable increase in the amount of protection PNC would have received\u201d under a court order. Op. at 29, 54 A.3d at 728 (emphasis added). Yet, the Majority condones PNC\u2019s self-initiated upgrade in protection, at the risk and the expense of the Beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\n<em>\u201cMaterial \u201d Differences the Majority Noticed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The Majority acknowledges two aspects in which the Agreement went too far. First, the Agreement \u201csought protection for PNC in its role as trustee <em>and </em>\u2018in its corporate capacity.\u2019 \u201d Maj. Op. at 29, 54 A.3d at 728. The Majority admits that this clause would allow PNC to \u201ceffectively use its position as trustee to obtain a release for its securities division, which would appear at odds with the duty of loyalty.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>n. 10. Second, the Agreement \u201calso sought a right to indemnification for <em>\u2018all\u2019 </em>costs arising from the administration of the Trust, rather' than all costs <em>reasonably and properly </em>incurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 54 A.3d at 728 (emphasis added). Inexplicably, however, after assessing these differences as \u201crepresenting] a fairly sizeable increase in the amount of protection PNC would have received,\u201d the Majority proceeds to hold that the Agreement is \u201cnot so broad and one-sided as to place impermissibly PNC\u2019s interests before those of [the Beneficiaries].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26-27, 54 A.3d at 726-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">The dichotomy between the Majority\u2019s perception of the \u201cmaterial\u201d differences and its holding is striking. The Majority minimizes the differences by later characterizing them as \u201cdifferences ... of degree rather than kind,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 29, 54 A.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>at 728, but this rationalization is unconvincing. In my view, these two \u201cmaterial\u201d differences should have led the Court to conclude that the Agreement was overly broad and entitled the Beneficiaries to declaratory relief in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\n<em>The Indemnification Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Supplementing the two \u201cmaterial\u201d differences noted by the Majority, I add a third, arguably the most significant one: the indemnification of PNC from \u201cany and all liabilities, relating in any way to its administration of the Trust.\u201d Unlike a court order approving trust funds distribution, which would have discharged PNC from liability to the Beneficiaries, but not third parties; and unlike the limited common-law indemnity right, this broad indemnification clause shifts all liability for the trustee\u2019s actions to the beneficiaries, even if the liability arose out of the trustee\u2019s own negligence. This shift is significant because a trustee\u2019s negligence is a risk <em>it </em>assumes in undertaking the often-lucrative<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> position as a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The Majority, however, fails to see this third material difference by focusing exclusively on the release clause and whitewashing the indemnification clause, reading it in such a way that it only pertains to expenses, surcharges, and costs, but not to claims, liabilities, and causes of action by third parties.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Majority\u2019s reading of the Agreement is wrong. Paragraph 6 of the Agreement states that, by signing, the beneficiary \u201c[rjeleases, indemnifies, and holds PNC ... harmless from and against any and all losses, claims, demands, surcharges, causes of action, costs and expenses (including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>legal fees).\u201d From a grammatical standpoint, paragraph 6 consists of two complete predicates or clauses: (1) a release and (2) an indemnification of PNC against \u201cagainst any and all losses, claims, demands, surcharges, causes of action, costs and expenses (including legal fees).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The Majority, however, dilutes the indemnification clause into something it considers palatable by redacting the terms \u201cany claims,\u201d \u201cdemands,\u201d and \u201ccauses of action\u201d and limiting it to \u201csurcharges,\u201d \u201ccosts,\u201d and \u201cexpenses.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Maj. Op. at 26-27, 54 A.3d at 726-27. This allows the Majority to conveniently avoid the analysis of PNC\u2019s attempt to get the Beneficiaries to agree to indemnify it against all possible claims. Instead, the Majority quickly addresses only (1) a release from liability to the beneficiaries, <em>id. </em>at 27, 54 A.3d at 727, concluding that a release would have been similar to <em>res judicata </em>resulting from a court order, and (2) indemnification, i.e. reimbursement, for expenses, holding that trustees are entitled to reimbursement for reasonable expenses. The Majority\u2019s one-sided analysis of the release and indemnification clause comes at a great cost to all trust beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Under common law, upon full disclosure by the trustee, a beneficiary generally may agree to release a trustee from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>liability for \u201cbreach of trust\u201d and \u201cthereby extinguish such cause of action as may exist.\u201d George G. Bogert <em>&amp; </em>George T. Bogert, <em>The Law of Trusts and Trustees </em>\u00a7 943 (rev.2d ed.1981). Similar to a release, when a trustee or another interested party petitions a court for trust fund distribution under Maryland Rule 10-501, the court\u2019s approval of the final accounting \u201crenders <em>res judicata, </em>matters which were open to dispute, whether or not actually disputed.\u201d See also <em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts </em>\u00a7 220 cmt. a (1959). What this means for our purposes is that once the court approves a final accounting, a beneficiary is barred from suing the trustee on a claim that was or could have been addressed by the court in the first instance. <em>See Anne Arundel County Bd. of Educ. v. Norville, </em>390 Md. 93, 106-07, 887 A.2d 1029, 1036-37 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Barred claims are, for example, a claim for loss by the beneficiary caused by breach of duty of loyalty, breach of duty of impartiality, breach of trust by selling trust property, breach of trust by improperly investing funds, and breach of trust by failing to make proper investment. <em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts </em>\u00a7 183, \u00a7\u00a7 206 through 212. So long as the trustee makes no \u201cmisrepresentation or concealment in presenting [the] account or in obtaining the approval of the court,\u201d the court\u2019s approval of the final accounting renders these beneficiaries\u2019 claims against the trustee <em>res judicata. Restatement (Second) of Trusts </em>\u00a7 220 cmt. a. A release or <em>res judicata, </em>however, does not go as far as the Agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Unlike res <em>judicata </em>that only bars relitigation of the same or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>similar claim by the same parties,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> an agreement to indemnify \u201cis a promise to safeguard or hold the indemnitee harmless against either existing and/or future loss liability\u201d to \u201ca third person, or against loss resulting from the liability.\u201d 41 Am. Jur.2d <em>Indemnity </em>\u00a7 4. Thus, no court approval of a final accounting would ever have the effect of indemnifying the trustee against third-party claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">These third-party claims may be significant, too. The Restatement (Second) of Trusts gives examples:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">[ ] A is a trustee of a tailoring business. He negligently allows the floor of the premises to fall into disrepair. A customer falls through the floor and breaks an arm. Although A is liable to B, he is not entitled to indemnity out of the trust estates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">[ ] A is trustee of an apartment house. By statute owners of apartment houses are required to maintain escapes. A fails to provide such a fire escape. The house burned and as a result of the lack of a fire escape B is in the fire. Although A is liable to B, he is not entitled to indemnity out of the trust estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">[ ] A is trustee of a grocery business. He employs B to deliver groceries. A knows that B is not a competent driver. In delivering groceries by automobile B negligently runs over C. Although A is liable to C, he is not entitled to indemnity out of the trust estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-9\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts </em>\u00a7 247 cmt. d.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">As these examples illustrate, under common law, a trustee\u2019s right to indemnification is limited. Indemnity for liability upon a contract with third parties or for liability in tort to third persons is only available to a trustee if the liability \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>properly incurred\u201d and the trustee \u201cwas not personally at fault in incurring the liability.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts </em>\u00a7 246, \u00a7 247.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Not so for PNC under the Agreement. The Agreement sought to expand PNC\u2019s protection \u2014 at the Beneficiaries\u2019 expense \u2014 to include \u201cany and all losses, claims, demands [and] causes of action.\u201d In this regard, the Agreement is impermissibly broad. I see no justification for shifting liability for potential misdeeds of the trustee over to the beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">III. Lack of Full and Complete Disclosure</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The Majority brushes off the Trustee\u2019s over-reaching, preferring instead to focus on the doctrine that \u201ca trustee may engage in self-interested course of action so long as the beneficiaries provide valid, informed consent.\u201d Maj. Op. at 26, 54 A.3d at 726 (citations omitted). In supporting its conclusion that a valid and informed consent would have negated a breach of the duty of loyalty, the Majority quotes comment c(3) to Section 78 of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts, which, <em>inter alia, </em>states: \u201cA particular transaction that would otherwise violate a trustee\u2019s duty of loyalty may be authorized by consent properly obtained from or on behalf of all of the trust beneficiaries.\u201d Maj. Op. at 26, 54 A.3d at 726. To the Majority, PNC\u2019s efforts to get the Beneficiaries to sign the Agreement are \u201cat bottom, [an] arm\u2019s length request to exchange increased protection and indemnity for a quicker and less costly distribution of trust funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 54 A.3d at 728. The Majority comforts itself with the idea that the Beneficiaries \u201cretained the choice to accede to that request, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>... negotiate one not as broad in its protection of PNC, or simply reject it____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The Majority\u2019s analysis of consent, however, misses an important point: a beneficiary cannot properly consent to a breach of fiduciary duty without having full and complete information relating to the breach.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Restatement (Third) of Trusts </em>\u00a7 78 cmt. g (for a beneficiary\u2019s consent to be valid, the trustee \u201cmust be able to show that the dealings were fair and that all relevant and material information that was known, or that should have been known, by the trustee was communicated to the beneficiary or beneficiaries involved.\u201d). This Court has emphasized that in all dealings between trustees and beneficiaries, the beneficiary must have \u201cfull information and complete understanding of all the facts\u201d pertaining to an otherwise-prohibited transaction. <em>McDaniel v. Hughes, </em>206 Md. 206, 220, 111 A.2d 204, 210 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">This is particularly true when the trustee has superior knowledge of the transaction at issue, such as when the trustee is an attorney for the beneficiaries and is \u201cexperienced in the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In those instances, \u201c[transactions for the personal advantage of a trustee ... are even more improper than similar dealings between laymen,\u201d and \u201c[t]o sustain such a tranaction [sic] the trustee must show that there was a full and complete disclosure on his part of all the facts essential to an intelligent understanding by the beneficiaries of the subject matter and the consequences of the transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221, <em>111 A.2d </em>at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">PNC did not provide the Beneficiaries with full information explaining their rights or the consequences of their signing of the Agreement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Importantly, PNC failed to explain to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Beneficiaries how the liability protection it sought under the Agreement was more favorable to the bank than the protection it would have received upon the court\u2019s approval of a final accounting.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Furthermore, PNC\u2019s demanding tone demonstrates that PNC failed to give the Beneficiaries \u201cfull and complete information\u201d or explain that they were free to reject the Agreement\u2019s sweeping provisions and go to court. In at least two communications with the Beneficiaries, PNC stated that\u2014 unless the Beneficiaries executed the Agreement \u2014 it would not be \u201cin a position\u201d to distribute the trust funds. For instance, in the closing line of the letter accompanying the Agreement, PNC stated: \u201cUpon receipt of the executed Releases from <em>all </em>of the distributees, we will be in a position to have the cash disbursed.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Even the Circuit Court, which ultimately held that there was no \u201cdemand,\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> agreed that \u201cany reasonable person looking at PNC\u2019s correspondence would understand that PNC Bank was not going to release funds until all of the beneficiaries had signed off on this agreement.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Unlike the Majority, I do not find comfort in the Beneficiaries\u2019 purported ability to reject a disadvantageous proposal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>As a fiduciary \u2014 and especially as a fiduciary with superior knowledge on the transaction in issue \u2014 PNC was only permitted to engage in negotiations of an agreement advantageous to it upon full and complete disclosure to the Beneficiaries of all relevant information. <em>See McDaniel, </em>206 Md. at 220, 111 A.2d at 210. This record reveals no such disclosure.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We should not condone the practice of a bank\u2019s asking beneficiaries to provide the bank insurance against the bank\u2019s own blunders.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge GREENE have authorized me to say that they join this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\">. In addition to the declaratory judgment on this issue, in their Complaint filed on April 28, 2008, the trust beneficiaries (\"Beneficiaries\u201d) sought loss of income, prejudgment interest, and attorney fees, all resulting from PNC's insistence that the Beneficiaries release and indemnify PNC prior to the trust distribution. The Complaint\u2019s other two counts were for declaratory relief in relation to the inheritance tax and PNC\u2019s final distribution fee. I concur in the Majority\u2019s holdings with respect to these other counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b79-6\">. The Waiver, Receipt, Release and Indemnification (\u201cAgreement\u201d) began by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">the parties in interest have requested that PNC distribute the Trust assets to the beneficiaries ... without the filing, audit and adjudication ... with a court of competent jurisdiction ..., and PNC has agreed to do so, provided that the parties in interest waive the filing with and auditing of an account of PNC\u2019s administration of the Trust with the Court and release and indemnify PNC from any and all claims and liabilities relating in any way to its administration of the Trust.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\">. Elaborating further, PNC maintained that the release and indemnification agreement in lieu of seeking approval of an accounting by a court \"is based more on practice than the procedure of asking the Distributees if they want to incur additional expenses to Petition the Court, legal fees, etc. Accordingly, there is no formal \u2018request.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b79-9\">. According to PNC, \u201cTrustees, both institutional and individual, request such Agreements on a daily basis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b80-9\">. The Circuit Court went on to say that although \"it must have been frustrating ... it was not improper.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b80-10\">. Without further elaboration, the Majority chose to read this broad clause narrowly by noting in a footnote that \"such [corporate capacity] language would not extend protection to other services provided to the trust by PNC.\u201d Maj. Op. at 29 n. 12, 54 A.3d at 728 n. 12. I would, instead, declare this provision illegal and unenforceable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b81-7\">.

The gravity of such a mis-reading is magnified when the risk is not disclosed to the Beneficiaries, as I discuss below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\">. The Majority\u2019s reading of the term \"indemnifies\u201d only in conjunction with the terms \"surcharges,\u201d \"costs,\u201d and \"expenses\u201d does not comport with the parties' understanding of the clause. PNC did not limit the indemnification clause to expenses as the Majority did. Indeed, in the preamble to the Agreement, PNC expressly stated that by way of the Agreement, the beneficiaries would \"release and indemnify PNC from any and all claims.\u201d The Beneficiaries also read the term \"indemnifies\u201d to pertain not only to expenses but to the other terms contained within paragraph 6 of the Agreement, including \"any and all losses, claims, demands [and] causes of action.\u201d To illustrate, in his letter to the motions court, one of the beneficiaries complained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">I do not own a law dictionary; but, in my dictionary of the English language, the word \"indemnify,\u201d is defined as: \"compensate (someone) in respect of harm or loss; secure (someone) against legal responsibility for their actions.\u201d ... So, in order for me to receive my inheritance, my 25% of the Trust, I have to agree to indemnify the bank from any claims, losses, liabilities, legal fees etc. related to this Trust. This is an intolerable situation.... I [will not] sign a document, which promotes deflection of personal responsibility from the bank onto me.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b83-5\">. The parties appreciated this difference too. At the last summary judgment motion hearing, the Beneficiaries\u2019 counsel emphasized this difference, arguing that, although PNC continuously referred to the Agreement as a \u201cRelease Agreement,\u201d \u201c[i]t wasn't [just] a release. It was a waiver and indemnification in which PNC Bank asked the beneficiary to indemnify and hold harmless PNC from its entire administration of the trust estate.\u201d At oral argument before this Court, PNC likewise acknowledged that \u201c[T]he release is probably better than a court order\u201d because it contains an indemnity clause. Oral Argument at 10:34, <em>Hastings v. PNC Bank, NA </em>(No. 109, Sept.

Similarly, the current Draft of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts discusses the \"now-prevalent practice\u201d of authorizing third parties to file suits against the trustee in its representative capacity, \"whether or not the trustee is personally liable, with the trustee protected from personal liability to the extent the trustee acted properly.\u201d <em>Restatement (Third) of Trusts, </em>(Tentative Draft No. 6, March 14, 2011), \u00a7 106, Reporter\u2019s Notes.

As discussed earlier, the Agreement not only failed to contain full information, but it also contained a misrepresentation. The Agreement stated that the Beneficiaries \u2014 rather than PNC \u2014 was the party initiating distribution of trust funds without court approval. Although this may seem like a minor misrepresentation, because there are four beneficiaries in this case (each receiving the Agreement), this statement has a great potential to mislead. After all, each of the four beneficiaries may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>have gotten the impression that the other three beneficiaries had requested distribution of trust funds in this manner, when, in fact, they had not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b88-16\">.

PNC seemingly was impatient with explanations. Although the Beneficiaries insisted upon explanation of PNC\u2019s tax and fees calculations, those requests seem to have irritated PNC. In one letter to the Beneficiaries, PNC wrote: \u201cThe trust document that you request is in your possession....
