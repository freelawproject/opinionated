The property was subject to zoning restrictions<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that prohibited such activity except as authorized by the Charles County Board of Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) through a special exception. In order to undertake the development, WSG applied to the Board for a special exception and was opposed in its application by various citizens, some of whom remain as Respondents herein. In deciding upon the application for special exception, the Board held three public hearings, taking testimony and accepting documentary evidence from WSG and the citizens. The Board also conducted one trip to the property in question, which has been referred to by the parties as a \u201csite visit\u201d and which is the subject of this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Board allowed representatives from WSG as well as two citizens to attend, but it prohibited any other members of the public from attending and kept no transcript or other record of that which transpired.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">The Board granted WSG\u2019s application, and various individuals jointly filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Charles County, contending among other things, that the Board conducted the visit to the subject property in a manner that was closed to the public in violation of Article 66B, the Charles County Code, and the Board Rules of Procedure.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Circuit Court remanded the case to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Board for an articulation of its findings regarding the consistency of the proposed use with the Charles County Comprehensive Plan,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but affirmed the decision of the Board in all other aspects. Respondents appealed, and both WSG and the County cross-appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which, in a published opinion, held that the Board violated the open meetings provisions of Section 4.07 of Article 66B and Rule III of the Board Rules of Procedure, reversed the decision of the Circuit Court and remanded to the Board for a new hearing and decision. <em>Bowie v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs of Charles </em>County, 203 Md.App. 153, 170-71, 36 A.3d 1038, 1048 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">WSG filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari presenting the following three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals err when it found that objections to the site visit were preserved for appellate review, and that there was no recorded vote or any recogni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>tion that the exclusion of some members of the public were subject to the procedural requirements of the state open meetings act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err when it found that the March 17, 2009 site visit violated the open meeting requirement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">3. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in its decision to reverse the judgment and remand the matter to the Board for another hearing and decision without further instruction to the Circuit Court and Board?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">We granted the Petition. 426 Md. 427, 44 A.3d 421 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">We shall hold that Respondents preserved their objections to the site visit under the public meetings provisions of Section 4.07 of Article 66B, Sections 412 and 415E of Chapter 297 of the Charles County Code, as well as Rule III of the Board Rules of Procedure. We shall further hold that the site visit constituted a \u201cmeeting\u201d which was required to be open to the public by Section 4.07(c)(4) of Article 66B, as implemented in the Charles County Code, and Rule III of the Board Rules of Procedure. Because the Board violated the open meeting provisions of Article 66B, the Charles County Code, and Rule III of its own Rules of Procedure, we shall remand the matter to the Board for a new hearing, thus affirming the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">The property in question, described by WSG in its application for a special exception, is an 80 acre tract of land consisting of approximately 18 acres of open space and 62 acres of woodland<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> located in Nanjemoy. WSG intended to build a facility consisting of a firing range, a driving track, and an office complex in which to conduct research. The property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>was zoned as an Agricultural Conservation Zone,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and as such, the operation of such a facility is not permitted except by special exception granted by the Board.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> WSG submitted its application dated October 22, 2008, and the Board held three public hearings on the application, one on February 24, 2009, another on March 10, 2009, and a third on April 14, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">At the first hearing, WSG presented four witnesses who testified about the utility of the proposed site for the intended purposes, that the site would be used only for tactical research, rather than for training, and that no real biological and chemical agents would be used. Regarding the impact of the firing range and tactical driving course on the surrounding environment, neighboring landowners, and the rest of the Nanjemoy community, one of WSG\u2019s witnesses opined that the firing range would be enclosed in such a way that there would be no impact on the surrounding wetlands and no escaping bullets and that the site would be engineered so that noise from the firing range and the driving course would not affect neighboring landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Members of the public testified, but were limited by the Board to three minutes for each individual and five minutes for each group. Over the course of the first two hearings, thirty people testified, including twenty-two who opposed the facility. Some opponents asserted that the site was not fit for the facility contemplated by WSG<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and specifically noted that such uses were normally confined to much larger tracts of land. They further contested the extent of the environmental impact, citing concerns about noise pollution and wetlands devastation. Additional opponents\u2019 testimony asserted that the site would transform the scenic character of the community and that allowing such development would destroy the integrity of the \u201clongest undeveloped shoreline in the Mid-Atlantic region.\u201d Contending that gunfire and screeching tires would affect their property values and their quality of life, the opposition additionally testified that the Nanjemoy community was not equipped to absorb the increased traffic that the facility would generate.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">At the March 10, 2009 hearing, a petition containing over three hundred signatures of \u201ccitizens and residents of Nanjemoy and Charles county [sic]\u201d was submitted to the Board, requesting that the Board deny WSG\u2019s special exception application.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Additionally, Robert O\u2019Neil,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> a Nanjemoy landown<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>er, filed an opposition brief arguing that the application should be denied, contesting WSG\u2019s intention to use the property for research, and asserting that WSG instead sought to perform tactical training at the site. Mr. O\u2019Neil also contended that WSG should have filed multiple applications because the proposed development contained several different uses, each of which would have an inordinate impact on the Nanjemoy community especially with regard to pollution in the form of hazardous metal runoff and noise.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">After the testimony concluded and documents were submitted, the Chairman of the Board proposed visiting the land in question, suggesting that the Board, along with its counsel, representatives of WSG, and select members of the opposition, travel to the property to see \u201cits proximity to everything else and the topography and that sort of thing.\u201d The Chair discussed the logistics of the excursion, stating that it would not be open to the general public but that a representative could attend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">CHAIRMAN MOWER: I would like to have one representative from the community meet us there or it can be Mr. Wolfgang [counsel for neighboring landowner Robert O\u2019Neil,] if you all so choose, Mr. Mudd, [WSG\u2019s counsel,] Mr. Buchanan, [county attorney acting as counsel to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Board,] a member of the staff and the Board members. Was there anybody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">MR. BUCHANAN: Mr. Mudd can pick one member from Washington Security Group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">CHAIRMAN MOWER: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">MR. BUCHANAN: Mr. Wolfgang, and if he wants to select somebody with expertise or something....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">CHAIRMAN MOWER: Right, right. But we\u2019re not going to go down there and have another hearing with 100 people there. We want the representatives there and we want to see it ourselves, but it\u2019s not fair for us to even see it ourselves without members of the community and members of the Applicant\u2019s staff and that sort of thing being there present, also.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The Chair, thereafter, called for a representative of the citizens to be selected and assigned Dr. Chad Stoltz to that role, apparently using some measure of applause from those present and a name shouted by an unidentified audience member:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-10\">CHAIRMAN MOWER: Okay. Now, is there someone that the people in opposition to this would like to appoint to represent them at this meeting? Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-11\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (Inaudible) I don\u2019t know his name, but he\u2019s a Ph.D. and he seemed quite knowledgeable. I would request that he go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-12\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-13\">(Applause).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-14\">CHAIRMAN MOWER: Doctor, what was your last name, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-15\">DR. STOLTZ: Stoltz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-16\">MR. BUCHANAN: You can get with Mr. Wolfgang and he\u2019ll show you where to meet....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-17\">The Chair closed the record, and also set the final hearing for April 14, 2009 at which time a vote would be taken on WSG\u2019s application. The Board never discussed that the visit to the property was subject to any public meetings provisions or procedural mandates, never took a vote to limit attendance at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>the property, nor does the record reflect that anyone present objected to the restrictions placed on public attendance at the visit. The motion for the visit was approved by the Board and scheduled for March 17, 2009 at 10:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">On March 17, 2009, the Board conducted its visit. The participants included the entire Board, two representatives from WSG, including its attorney, as well as Kurt Wolfgang, counsel for Robert O\u2019Neil and Dr. Chad Stoltz.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> An adjoining property owner, Charles E. Parmley, attempted to join the group gathered at the site, but was denied access.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">No record was kept of the March 17, 2009 visit to the property, and contentions abound as to what transpired.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Respondents contend that WSG made a presentation before the Board regarding the location and impact of the planned development, that Board members questioned WSG representatives about matters outside the scope of the mere layout of the site, and that WSG submitted to the Board a document regarding prior County approval for use of the property as an airport.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Respondents further contended that the trip was fragmented and that the Board separated into different groups on various portions of the property, with each group hearing presentations by WSG at different times.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">After the visit, two weeks prior to the final vote by the Board, Robert O\u2019Neil filed a \u201cMotion for Appropriate Relief\u2019 in which he alleged that, during the trip to the property, the owner of an adjoining piece of property, Charles E. Parmley, attempted to attend and was turned away, in violation of the public meeting provisions of the Charles County Code, the Board\u2019s Rules of Procedure, and, Section 4.07(c)(4) of Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>66B. With regard to the trip to the property, Mr. O\u2019Neil asserted that the Board held a non-public session at which it allowed WSG to introduce evidence, including testimony, without affording opponents any opportunity for review or rebuttal. Mr. O\u2019Neil asserted that the trip to the property was not limited to observation alone, but was instead a forum for WSG to influence the Board outside the presence of the public.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>With regard to the relief he sought, Mr. O\u2019Neil contended that immediate action was necessary by the Board to cure the public meeting violations. He attempted to convince the Board to reform the record, noting the Board\u2019s closure of the site visit and its failure to record anything that transpired might not survive judicial review. He proposed measures for the Board to allegedly cure its missteps, including creating a summary of that which occurred at the site visit, re-opening the record to allow for cross examination, and allowing written rebuttal of the evidence and testimony adduced by WSG at the property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">[T]his protestant would prefer that the respective rights of the applicant and protesting property owners be resolved on the basis of a complete and fairly developed record, and not turn on procedural defects. Toward that end, the Board is respectfully requested to reopen the record and establish the following procedures:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">a. The Board of Appeals should attempt to create a document summarizing what transpired during the March 17th site visit, including any factual representations or legal arguments made the applicant of its counsel [sic]. This document should be entered into the public record of the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">b. The Board should re-open the record and allow for reasonable cross-examination of the applicant\u2019s witnesses and following any re-direct by the applicant\u2019s counsel allow protestants to submit written evidence and be subjected to cross-examination by applicant\u2019s counsel on that evidence. This is a uniquely complex matter and due process demands that protestants have more than more than [sic] three minutes for cross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>examination. If the Board is concerned about unreasonably lengthy cross-examination, it can require that a protestant desiring to conduct cross-emanation [sic] file a request with the Board for a specified amount of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">d. All of these remedies should be afforded after adequate notice to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">e. The applicant has closed its evidence, except for rebuttal. Indeed, the Applicant has supplemented its evidence in the site visit. It should not be able to submit further evidence, except in rebuttal. It should be afforded cross examination and re-cross of any new testimony as the rules provide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In response, WSG filed a Motion of Ne Recipiatur, which urged the Board to strike Mr. O\u2019Neil\u2019s Motion for Appropriate Relief on the grounds that it was \u201cfiled too late and not in the mode required by law and [was] insufficient in substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">At the beginning of the April 14 hearing, the Chair denied WSG\u2019s Motion of Ne Recipiatur, and granted Mr. O\u2019Neil\u2019s Motion for Appropriate Relief in part, by accepting Mr. O\u2019Neil\u2019s written testimony, and denying all other relief sought by Mr. O\u2019Neil\u2019s motion. By a majority of its members, the Board voted to approve WSG\u2019s application for a special exception.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Subsequently, on June 9, 2009, the Board filed its written Decision and Order memorializing its decision, which included the \u201csite visit\u201d in the bases for the decision:<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>2. The Board found that the proposed use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, and general welfare as the use is providing adequate safety measures for the firearms research.... Additionally, the driving tactics research area ... will be buffered by existing trees on all sides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">5. The Board found that the proposed facility will not be detrimental to the use, peaceful enjoyment, economic value or development of surrounding properties or the general neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">6. Based upon the Applicant\u2019s submittal, testimony presented and exhibits, the Board found that the proposed use will not cause an impact on traffic nor cause objectionable noise, type of physical activity, fumes, odors, dust or glare. The noise generated on site regarding firearm or driving tactics research should be minimal and not cause objectionable impact, in any form, to neighboring properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">11. A site visit was conducted on Tuesday, March 17, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">Based upon this visit, the Board found the site consistent with the Applicant\u2019s testimony and site plan for the use of \u201cResearch Facilities and Laboratories without processing of materials\u201d (Use # 704.100).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">Respondents, among others, filed a Petition for Judicial Review of the decision of the Board of Appeals and supporting memorandum in the Circuit Court for Charles County, in which they contended, among other allegations, that \u201c[t]he decision of the Board of Appeals should be vacated because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>is irrevocably tainted by the Board\u2019s denial of due process, violation of relevant state and county laws, failure to adhere to its own rules, and the absence of substantial evidentiary support.\u201d Specifically, with respect to open meetings and the site visit, the memorandum alleged that the public was denied access to the site visit conducted by the Board in violation of Section 4.07(c) of Article 66B, Section 297-412 of the Charles County Code, and the Board\u2019s Rules of Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The County responded, arguing that no procedural rules were violated because the \u201ccitizens present\u201d at the meeting at which the Board announced it would conduct the site visit \u201cwere asked to agree on a representative [and] [t]hey selected a Dr. Chad Stoltz.\u201d WSG separately argued that the due process violation claims were baseless and not supported by the record, because no person objected either to the site visit or to the manner in which the Board selected representatives of the public prior to the visit, and therefore any objection to the visit was untimely. Furthermore, WSG argued that the exclusion of the public from the site visit was warranted because \u201cthe property is privately owned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The Circuit Court, after a hearing, issued a written opinion which held that the Board\u2019s decision did not sufficiently address whether the proposed use was in accordance with the Charles County Comprehensive Plan and remanded the case to the Board for an articulation of its findings in that regard. With respect to the trip to the property and alleged open meetings violation, the judge found that the Respondents had not preserved the issue for review and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">The first objection to either the occurrence of the March 17 site visit or to the manner in which it was conducted appears in the petition for judicial review. The visit had occurred before the April 14 Board meeting at which argument was had over what evidence submitted on or after March 10 would be received or rejected, summations were made and Board members cast their votes on the application. In the petition it is contended that the March 17 site visit was in effect a closed hearing from which the public was excluded, of which no record was preserved and at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>which substantive evidence was presented by Applicant and improperly received by the Board. At the January 5 hearing before the Court counsel who were present at the site on March 17 could not agree as to who said what during the event. Under these circumstances it cannot be said that the party(-ies) now complaining of the process properly made a record (at least on April 14) and preserved the issue for review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">The Respondents appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, questioning not only the open meetings decision but also whether substantial evidence supported the Board\u2019s findings. WSG and the County cross appealed, both questioning whether the Circuit Court erred in remanding, rather than affirming, the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, reversed the Circuit Court, for remand to the Board of Appeals, for another hearing and decision, on the basis that the site visit violated the open meeting requirements of Section 4.07(c) of Article 66B and Rule III of the Board Rules of Procedure. <em>Bowie v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs of Charles County, </em>203 Md.App. 153, 36 A.3d 1038 (2012). The Court of Special Appeals held that Respondents preserved their objection to the site visit by filing their Motion for Appropriate Relief before the Board reached its decision and held that the trip to the property was a \u201cmeeting\u201d under Section 4.07(c) of Article 66B and Rule III of the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 164-65, 169, 36 A.3d at 1044-45, 1047. The intermediate appellate court further held that \u201cthat the March 17, 2009 site visit violated the open meeting requirements of [section] 4.07(c)(4) and Rule III,\u201d noting that \u201c[e]learly, the Board was transacting public business during the site visit,\u201d and \u201c[t]he fact that the site visit occurred on private property does not transform the Board\u2019s meeting into an event exempt from open meetings requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170, 36 A.3d at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Before us, WSG contends that Respondents\u2019 objections to the property visit were not preserved for appellate review. WSG argues that no one objected to the visit when it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>proposed by the Board and that those who were permitted to attend made no objection to the way in which the visit was conducted. Even if the objection was preserved, however, WSG argues that what occurred at the property was a \u201csite visit\u201d limited to observation alone and was thus removed from the strictures of open meetings requirements. Finally, WSG argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred in faffing to give guidance to the Board to conduct the new proceeding on remand, maintaining that the proper remedy was to remand with instructions to the Board as to how to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Respondents counter that open meeting requirements cannot be waived \u201cby one or more persons attending an administrative hearing or lost by failure to protest loudly enough that the court reporter catches and records the objection.\u201d Respondents also contend that the Motion for Appropriate Relief filed by Mr. O\u2019Neil sufficiently notified the Board of the objections. With regard to the applicability of open meeting requirements, Respondents argue that, because the Board attended the visit with WSG representatives and engaged in discussion of the merits of its application, the trip to the property constituted a meeting required to be open to the public. Respondents maintain that because the Board relied upon facts that it gleaned from the trip and because the public was excluded and no record kept, the deliberative process was tainted. Finally, Respondents contend that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 remand was appropriate because there exists no requirement in Maryland that an appellate court \u201cprovide explicit directions or guidance in a remand mandate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">\u201cThe basic argument for open meetings is that public knowledge of the considerations upon which governmental action is based is essential to the democratic process.\u201d Note, <em>Open Meeting Statutes: The Press Fights for the \u201cBight to Know\u201d, </em>75 Harv. L.Rev. 1199, 1200 (1962). Open meetings legislation further ensures \u201cthe free flow of information to the electorate by requiring governmental bodies to hold public meetings,\u201d and \u201cguard[s] against corruption and deceit and promote[s] public faith in government.\u201d Teresa Dale Pupillo, <em>The Changing Weather Forecast: Government in the Sunshine in the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number><em>1990\u2019s </em>\u2014 An <em>Analysis of State Sunshine Laws, </em>71 Wash. U. L.Q. 1165, 1166 (1993). In <em>Town of Palm Beach v. Gradison, </em>296 So.2d 473, 477 (Fla.1974), the Supreme Court of Florida succinctly and clearly described the breadth of the public deliberative process embraced by open meetings legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APy\">One purpose of the government in the sunshine law was to prevent at nonpublic meetings the crystallization of secret decisions to a point just short of ceremonial acceptance____The statute should be construed so as to frustrate</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\">all evasive devices. This can be accomplished only by embracing the collective inquiry and discussion stages within the terms of the statute, as long as such inquiry and discussion is conducted by any committee or other authority appointed and established by a governmental agency, and relates to any matter on which foreseeable action will be taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">We have consistently supported the legislative purpose of requiring strict adherence to public meetings provisions through providing notice to the public and keeping a record of the meetings, among other measures. <em>See, e.g., City of Baltimore Development Corp. v. Carmel Realty Associates, </em>395 Md. 299, 321-22, 910 A.2d 406, 418-420 (2006) (describing the breadth of openness required); <em>Community and Labor United for Baltimore Charter Committee (CLUB) v.

Landmark Community Newspapers of Maryland, Inc., </em>293 Md. 595, 599-601, 446 A.2d 63, 64-66 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The public meetings mandates that apply in the present case emanate from Section 4.07 of Article 66B,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> requiring that Charles County,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> among others, establish a Board of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>to review applications for special exceptions and adopt rules and regulations governing the Board\u2019s procedures. Section 4.07(c)(4) further mandates that \u201c[a]ll meetings of a board of appeals shall be open to the public,\u201d and Section 4.07(c)(5) requires that the Board \u201cshall make a transcript of all proceedings\u201d which \u201cshall be a public record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Section 297-409 of the Charles County Code sets out the \u201c[p]owers and duties\u201d of the Board of Appeals, including that the Board shall hear and decide on, among other things, \u201c[a]pplications for special exception uses and enlargements, extensions, modifications or revocations of special exeeptions[.]\u201d Charles County Code, Section 297-409(A)(2). Section 297-412 specifies the requirements that the Board hear testimony, receive evidence, and make a record of the public hearing. Section 297-415 sets out the Board\u2019s \u201cprocedures and minimum standards for the consideration and authorization of special exception uses,\u201d Section 297-415(B), and contains a notice and public meetings provision. Section 297-415(G). With regard to notice of the hearing, Section 297-411 requires notice to adjoining property owners, posted signs on the property, and, for special exceptions specifically, publication in a local newspaper of the time and place of the meeting and information regarding the special exception sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The Board also adopted its own rules, echoing the open meeting requirements of Article 66B and articulating the requirement that hearings shall be open to the public and be electronically recorded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">The Board of Appeals may meet in a closed session for any reasons specified in the Maryland open meetings law, codified at Section 10-501, <em>et. seq. </em>of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland.... However, in that regard all hearings shall be held in open public session <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>and no evidence, argument, or other matter shall be received by the Board in a closed session, and no party in interest shall be heard by the Board of Appeals in a closed session. All evidence shall be presented to the Board of Appeals in hearings open to the public. The hearings will be electronically recorded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Rules of Procedure, Rule III. The Rules require the Board to keep a record of the visit, including all testimony and exhibits,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and that the Board \u201cwill conduct hearings in a manner best calculated to afford all parties an opportunity to present their positions and to serve the ends of justice and fairness.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Rule XII. In the present case, no one disputes that the \u201csite visit\u201d in issue did not include the public in general nor was it recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Rather, WSG argues that the Respondents had to raise their objection to the limitations of the site visit before or during the visit itself. The Circuit Court Judge agreed that Respondents had not preserved the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The Court of Special Appeals disagreed, however, and determined that the Respondents had preserved their objections, specifically noting the various hurdles that different Respondents faced. Moreover, the Court of Special Appeals noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">it was not the [Respondents\u2019] obligation to make a record of what happened at the site visit[;] ... that burden is one for the Board to bear. This is a particularly important obligation in light of the fact that in the circuit court, counsel for the parties could not agree as to what occurred during the site visit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-9\"><em>Bowie v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs of Charles County, </em>203 Md.App. 153, 165, 36 A.3d 1038, 1045 (2012) (footnote omitted). Finally, the Court of Special Appeals noted the absurdity of WSG\u2019s argument that those allowed by the Board to attend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the site visit could waive the public\u2019s objection to the visit to the property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\">[WSG\u2019s] preservation objections also do not pass muster. [Respondents\u2019] counsel, by not objecting to attendance at the site visit only by representatives and to a partially closed meeting, could not possibly have made such an agreement for those members of the public in attendance at the March 10th hearing that he did not represent and for those members of the public allegedly seeking admission to the March 17th site visit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">We agree. At the Board meeting at which the site visit was proposed, there was no discussion by any Board member of public meetings mandates, although the Board was clearly bound by the meeting mandates of Section 4.07 of Article 66B, the Charles County Code, and its own Rules of Procedure. The burden was on the Board, not those in attendance, to enforce its own strictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Mr. O\u2019Neil, further, filed his Motion for Appropriate Relief with the Board two weeks before its final hearing and before a final vote was taken. He objected to the fact that the public was not permitted to attend the site visit, citing violations of public meeting procedures prescribed by Section 4.07 of Article 66B, Section 297-412 of the Charles County Code, and the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Appeals, and proposed that a record of the site visit be made and to reopen evidence to allow rebuttal of evidence erroneously secured during the visit. The Board, however, denied the Motion without any comment. These actions certainly do not support any notion that reasoned public outcry had any impact on the Board\u2019s decision-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">In asserting that the Respondents had to interpose an objection to the visit before or during the visit, WSG relies upon <em>In re Ryan S., </em>369 Md. 26, 797 A.2d 39 (2002), and <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Theiss, </em>354 Md. 234, 729 A.2d 965 (1999), but these cases are inapposite. Neither <em>Ryan </em>nor <em>Theiss </em>involved administrative agency decisions or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>open meetings requirements. Rather, <em>Ryan </em>involved the necessity of interposing an objection to permit a judge to respond in order to avoid waiver, while <em>Theiss </em>involved the necessity of raising an objection during the context of a deposition in order to preserve the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">WSG next contends that the site visit in issue was not subject to the open meetings mandates of Section 4.07(c) of Article 66B, the Charles County Code and the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Appeals, because the visit was not a meeting but merely observatory in nature and done to confirm facts already in evidence. WSG stresses that the visit by the Board was limited to \u201cvisual orientation\u201d alone, and as such, did not need to be open to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">A site visit by a board has been called a \u201ccommon practice\u201d that serves to \u201cfreshen recollection and sharpen the board\u2019s perception of the specific problem in issue.\u201d Patricia E. Salkin, American Law of Zoning, Section 40:38, 40-16-40-117 (5th ed.2012). As \u201ccommon\u201d as site visits may be, reliance by a board upon information gleaned from the site visit implicates heightened procedural requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">If the board relies upon knowledge acquired through an inspection of the premises, and not otherwise disclosed in the record, the facts thus discovered by the board must be disclosed. The personal knowledge of the board must be spread on the record, or such knowledge will not support a conclusion of the board.... Failure to disclose such knowledge and to afford the parties an opportunity to refute it may constitute a denial of due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 40-117 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">The Court of Special Appeals in the present case identified that which elevates a site visit above mere observation, noting that when a site visit \u201cis conducted to obtain information material to issues raised in the adjudicatory proceeding, the agency should conduct the visit on the record in the presence of the parties.\u201d <em>Bowie, </em>203 Md.App. 153, 167, 36 A.3d 1038, 1045 (2012) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The court further noted that reliance by the Board upon information it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>obtained from the site visit in the present case was improper where the Board \u201cfai[ed] to disclose this information and to allow [Respondents] to challenge this evidence through cross-examination or other means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170-71, 36 A.3d at 1048. Further, the Court of Special Appeals noted the importance of creating a record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\">The Board\u2019s written decision and order state that based upon the site visit it \u201cfound the site consistent with the applicant\u2019s testimony and the site plan____\u201d This is no substitute for what happened on March 17, 2009. Such a record would have informed the parties and a reviewing court of the evidence gathered from the site visit that led the Board to credit [WSG]\u2019s testimony and approve its site plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 170, 36 A.3d at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">It may be true that site visits without observance of the nuances of public meetings strictures are permitted if the board limits itself to observation alone. <em>See In re Quechee Lakes Corp., </em>154 Vt. 543, 580 A.2d 957, 962 (1990) (noting that site visits by a board for observational purposes are appropriate as long as those visits do not form the sole basis for the board\u2019s decision). We have held, however, that a board must make a record of its site visit if the board relies upon that visit in reaching its decision in a non-public meetings context. <em>See, in this regard, Heath v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>187 Md. 296, 305, 49 A.2d 799, 804 (1946) (reversing the decision of a zoning appeals board granting a special exception because the board announced in its decision simply that it had \u201cmade a study of the premises\u201d and provided no record or other evidence of what occurred at the site). In <em>White v. North, </em>121 Md.App. 196, 708 A.2d 1093 (1998), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>356 Md. 31, 736 A.2d 1072 (1999), Judge Glenn T. Harrell, Jr., then writing for our intermediate appellate court in another non-public meetings case, explained the concerns that arise when a board obtains information from a site visit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">To the extent the Board obtains information from such an \u201con-site inspection,\u201d and such information is not already a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>matter of record in the pending case and is material to the ordinance requirements and the Board\u2019s decision, the Board would do well for itself and parties before it ... to conceive of a technique to supplement the record with such evidence before rendering its decision. In doing such, the Board needs also to be mindful of the right of opposing parties to be apprised of that additional evidence, and given an opportunity to respond.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">121 Md.App. at 229, 708 A.2d at 1109-10.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In the present case, the visit to the property, by any account, was not merely observatory, but participatory and influential. Albeit chaotic, it is clear that discussions among the Board members and WSG representatives occurred and that no record was kept. No public notice of the visit on March 17, 2009 was given.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Board also relied on the visit in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>With regard to what constitutes a meeting of the Board which must be open, Article 66B does not define the term. Neither the Charles County Code nor the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Appeals contain the term \u201cmeeting\u201d but refer to a \u201chearing,\u201d without definition. In defining, then, whether the property visit was a meeting and a hearing, we lack statutory direction. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cmeeting\u201d as \u201c[t]he gathering of people to discuss or act on matters in which they have a common interest; esp. the convening of a deliberative assembly to transact business.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1072 (9th ed.2009). Hearing, in an administrative law context, as here, is defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary as, \u201cAny setting in which an affected person presents arguments to a decision-maker &lt;a hearing on zoning variations&gt;.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">In the instant case, the visit to the property by the Charles County Board of Appeals constituted a meeting under the provisions of Article 66B and a hearing under the Charles County Code and the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Appeals. The Board was conducting a meeting when it was transacting public business as it visited the property under review. Board members interacted with WSG representatives and gathered information pertaining to the special exception at issue. The Board also was conducting a \u201chearing,\u201d because discussions occurred among Board members and WSG representatives, in contravention of the Board\u2019s own Rule that \u201cno evidence, argument, or other matter shall be received by the Board in closed session.\u201d The Board, furthermore, did not keep a record of that which occurred at the site, thereby violating the requirements of Article 66B as well as that of Section 297-412(E) of the Charles County Code and Rule V of its own Rules of Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">WSG, however, relies on 95 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 129 (2010) to support its position that the site visit did not require open meeting adherence. That opinion addressed the question of whether the Saint Mary\u2019s County Board of Education could convene in closed session. The opinion notes that \u201ccounty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>boards of education need not meet in open session when they are performing an \u2018administrative function\u2019 and when the State education law does not otherwise require an open meeting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>WSG urges that the Board in the instant case was performing administrative fact finding and not conducting the visit as part of its deliberations. Ignoring the obvious incongruity of this position, namely that any facts gathered by the Board at the property would necessarily inform their ultimate decision and thus the visit was part of the Board\u2019s decision-making process and not mere administration, WSG\u2019s reliance is otherwise misplaced. In that opinion, the Attorney General concluded that the board must hold meetings open for \u201cmany, if not most, activities that would qualify as an administrative function under the State [Open Meetings Act]\u201d because the county\u2019s own open meetings provision, governing meetings of the board in question, did not provide an exception for administrative functions. 95 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 129. Similarly, Section 4.07 of Article 66B recognizes no \u201cadministrative function\u201d exception to the requirement that boards of appeals hold open meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">WSG further contends that the Board was not bound by open meetings strictures because \u201cinformal procedures may satisfy due process requirements where they do not create procedural unfairness.\u201d The informal procedures, WSG asserts, were the selection of \u201crepresentatives\u201d to accompany the Board on the site visit and the fact that the Board set out orally the limitations on the site visit when it was proposed. In support of this contention, WSG cites our decisions in <em>Calvert County Planning Commission v. Howlin Realty Management, Inc., </em>364 Md. 301, 772 A.2d 1209 (2001), and <em>State v. Cates, </em>417 Md. 678, 12 A.3d 116 (2011), for the proposition that \u201cdue process does not always require strict adherence to statutory procedures where administrative action is governed by statute.\u201d WSG\u2019s reliance is misplaced, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In <em>Howlin, </em>we concluded that although a board failed to adopt formal rules of procedure in violation of its statutory mandate, the board\u2019s process was fundamentally fair, noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>that \u201c[d]ue process is concerned with fundamental fairness in the proceeding, not with whether the agency has failed in some way to comply with a statutory requirement.\u201d 364 Md. at 322, 772 A.2d at 1221. In <em>State v. Cates, </em>we held that a police department did not deprive its officers of due process when it reissued speed camera tickets to them, reasoning that \u201c[d]ue process does not require strict adherence to a statute by an administrative agency <em>where such adherence would provide no additional guarantees of fairness, notice, or an opportunity to be heard.\u201d Cates, </em>417 Md. at 701, 12 A.3d at 130 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Obviously, the Board\u2019s management of the visit to the property was not fair to the public, where no sufficient notice was given, no record was kept, and members of the public were excluded. To compound matters, the Board, in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, relied upon information that it gained from the site visit. The \u201csite visit\u201d was then, clearly, a meeting under the strictures of Article 66B and the attendant hearing requirements of Sections 497-412 and 415 of the Charles County Code and Rule III of the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">What remains, then, is what is the remedy for the violations of the open meetings mandates implicated in the present case? WSG argues that because the Board attempted to ensure that the public was fairly represented at the site visit, any potential violation of open meetings mandates was not \u201cwillful\u201d under the State Open Meetings Act. Respondents, however, dispute the issue of willfulness, both in its relevance and its application and urge that the decision of the Board be voided. We need not, however, address the issue of whether the State Act applies to the instant case, because it was not raised before the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The general rule when a public body acts contrary to the mandates in its charter is that its actions will be considered void <em>ab initio. </em>In <em>von Lusch v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>268 Md. 445, 302 A.2d 4 (1973), for example, we considered whether the enactment of an amendment to the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance for Queen Anne\u2019s County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>by the County Commissioners was proper, given the procedures established by Section 4.04 of Article 66B, Maryland Code (1957, 1970 Repl.Vol.), which required notice and a hearing before its passage. The County Commissioners publicized the text of the proposed amendment and held a public hearing on the matter, but, when the Commissioners rendered their decision enacting the amendment, it contained language that was materially different than that which had been published prior to the hearing. We declared \u201cinvalid and void\u201d the amendment, because Section 21.23 of the Zoning Ordinance stated, \u201c[n]o change in or departure from the proposed amendment as recommended by the Planning Commission shall be made unless the same be resubmitted to said Commission for its further recommendation. The Planning Commission shall file its further recommendation within thirty (30) days....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457-58, 302 A.2d at 10. We noted that \u201cthe word \u2018shall\u2019 is mandatory and not directory,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 457, 302 A.2d at 10, and that the County Commissioners had never resubmitted the proposed amendment to the Planning Commission, thus rendering void the amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 458, 302 A.2d at 10; <em>see also Walker v. Board of County Commissioners of Talbot County, </em>208 Md. 72, 86-87, 116 A.2d 393 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In the case <em>sub justice, </em>each of the public meetings mandates at issue provides mandatorily that the Board \u201cshall\u201d hold open meetings. Specifically, Section 4.07(c) of Article 66B provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">(4) All meetings of a board of appeals shall be open to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">(5) (i) A board of appeals shall make a transcript of all proceedings, showing the vote of each member on each question, or the member\u2019s absence or failure to vote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">(ii) 1. A board of appeals shall immediately file the transcript of its proceedings in the office of the board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">2. A transcript shall be a public record,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ8\">while the Charles County Code states, in Section 297-412:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">A. Before making a final decision on any appeal or application, the Board shall hold a hearing on the matter to be considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>B. The hearing shall be open to the public, and all people aggrieved by the outcome of the appeal or application shall be given an opportunity to present testimony and evidence and to cross-examine persons who testify,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqx\">and the Board\u2019s own Rules of Procedure state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">The Board of Appeals will hold such sessions and hearings as may, from time to time, be scheduled by the Chairperson or his/her designee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">The Board may conduct such preliminary hearings as are deemed necessary by the Chairperson. The Board of Appeals may meet in a closed session for any reason specified in the Maryland open meetings law, codified at Section 10-501, <em>et. seq. </em>of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland____ However, in that regard all hearings shall be held in open public session and no evidence, argument, or other matter shall be received by the Board in a closed session, and no party in interest shall be heard by the Board of Appeals in a closed session. All evidence shall be presented to the Board of Appeals in hearings open to the public. The hearings will be electronically recorded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">As each of these Sections makes clear, the Board violated mandatory requirements of the provisions that govern its conduct, as did the public body in <em>von Lusch. </em>Here, the public suffered an irreparable injury when the Board conducted a visit to the property, which was more than merely observatory and for which there was not the requisite notice nor record, upon which the Board relied. The Board\u2019s decision is, thus, void <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">WSG\u2019s argument that guidance upon remand is a necessity is without merit. Here, the fundamental nature of open meetings was violated so that only a process that ensures adherence to the strictures of Article 66B, the Charles County Code, and the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Appeals for Charles County can be the remedy. On remand for another hearing and decision, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that \u201cit would be up to the Board to decide whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>to hold another site visit, one that is tightly controlled, open to the public and on the record.\u201d 203 Md.App. at 171, 36 A.3d at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Of course, questions posed by the Board would be for the purpose of adducing evidence. M[r], Buchanan further stated that the role of undersigned counsel and the citizen allowed to attend (Dr. Chad Stoltz) was to listen and observe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-14\">Mr. Buchanan stressed that because the site visit was a meeting of the Board of Appeals, and all Board members needed to see and hear the same things, it was necessary for all Board members [to] stay together in one group during the visit. However, staying together was not to be. The members of the Board did not stay together; as the site visit progressed, some members took a walking tour as the applicant described the location of the driving area and then the firing range, while others viewed the property boundary and Beaver Dam Creek, which runs along the boundary line. Because the property was extremely wet and muddy, Mt. [sic] Buchanan and one of the Board Members elected to remain on high ground while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>property tours took place. Consequently, the Board members did not hear the same presentations or observe the same views at the same time.

Mr. Buchanan, the county attorney who represented the Board and attended the trip, did not contest these assertions.

Nobody was under oath. Nobody did anything other than answer questions.\u201d Mr. Mudd, attorney for WSG who also attended the trip, was similarly vague as to what actually occurred, stating at the circuit court hearing only that \u201c[the trip] was simply an orientation. It was simply \u2014 answering questions. I don\u2019t know. Assuming we\u2019re at the same meeting. Maybe there was a different one he attended.

The provision of testimony in a nonpublic setting is not consistent with the Charles County Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">Article 66B, section 4.07 requires all meetings of Board of Appeals to be open to the public. The logistical problems associated with opening a site visit to the public are understandable, but the manner in which the meeting was conducted required it. The site visit was not conducted in a fashion to simply allow the Board to view the site. It was a forum in which the Applicant was allowed to volunteer information, make legal arguments and submit evidence. The applicant was allowed to respond to questions of the Board that were outside of simple site orientation questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">The Board of Appeals rules also call for all meetings of the Board of Appeals to be open meetings, and they specifically prohibit the presence of the applicant at a meeting that is closed to the public. They further prohibit the taking of testimony or legal argument at a meeting that is not open to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">While this protestant commends the Board of Appeals and specifically the Chair in its and his attempt to gather additional information through a site visit, the visit resulted in a meeting that was improper under the rales, and was exploited by the applicant to introduce testimony and legal argument in contravention of the Board's rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">In addition, it did not appear that anyone from the Board who was taking notes attended all aspects of the tour, for the purpose of making a record of the proceeding in order to comply with the dictates of Article 66B, Section 4.07.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-12\">No matter how well intentioned a site visit was, it was not conducted in a fashion that afforded due process to all participants. The public was both generally excluded, as originally announced at the March 10th meeting, and protestants being specifically excluded, that is, the neighboring property owner, a Mr. Parmley, and his two sons who attempted to attend the meeting but were excluded. The violations, inadvertent as they may have been on the part of the Board, resulted in a significant boon to the applicant in its ability to intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>duce evidence, testimony, and argument outside the scrutiny or cross-examination of the majority of the protestants, and also outside of the closing of the record, which was closed on March 10th.

Although that court found that the issue of the board's failure to record was not preserved for review, it said that \"site visit observations on which the fact-finder intends to rely must be placed on the record in order to preserve the right of rebuttal and to facilitate review.\" <em>Id. </em>at 962. <em>See also Committee for Washington\u2019s Riverfront Parks v.

I write only to add what I believe is a necessary clarification of the relationship of the State Open Meetings Act, Maryland Code, State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d), \u00a7 10-501 <em>et seq., </em>to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">The threshold for the application of the State Open Meetings Act to a particular situation depends on affirmative answers to three questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">1\u2014 Is the entity a \u201cpublic body\u201d as defined by the Act? <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 10-502(h). The Board of Appeals fits that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">2\u2014 If so, is the public body engaged in a \u201cfunction\u201d covered by the Act? The answer, in this case, is yes. <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 10-503(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">3\u2014 If so, is the gathering a \u201cmeeting\u201d as defined by the <em>Act </em>\u2014 i.e., the convening of a quorum for the consideration or transaction of public business. SG \u00a7 10-502(g) (definition of \u201cmeet\u201d). Although there is no prior case of which I am aware that analyzes the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cmeeting\u201d in relation to site visits, I will assume that a site visit attended by a quorum of the Board of Appeals \u2014 as in this case \u2014 is a \u201cmeeting\u201d for purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">If the Act applies, the meeting must be <em>open </em>\u2014 i.e., accessible by the public \u2014 unless one of the 14 specific exceptions to the open meeting requirement pertains and is properly invoked by the public body. SG \u00a7 10-508. (There apparently has been no contention that any exception to the openness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>requirement applied to these circumstances). In addition, the entity must comply with the Act\u2019s requirements concerning notice of meetings, preparation and maintenance of minutes, procedures for closing parts of meetings, and other matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Sometimes, however, another law may separately impose an open meetings requirement on a public body. Such is the case in this matter, as carefully outlined in the majority opinion, for Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07, the Charles County Code, and the Board\u2019s own rules require open meetings. When another law imposes \u201cmore stringent\u201d <em>requirements </em>\u2014 ie., requires greater openness \u2014 the Open Meetings Act defers to that law. SG \u00a7 10-504. In my view, other open meetings provisions applicable to the site visit in this case impose \u201cmore stringent\u201d requirements related to the issues in this case and, accordingly, our opinion properly focuses on those requirements and does not fully analyze application of the Open Meetings Act here.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
