(\u201cMercy\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> also a Petitioner, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Respondents Emerson R. Julian, Jr., M.D., and his practices Emerson R. Julian, Jr., M.D., P.A., and Harbor City OB/GYN Associates, LLC (collectively \u201cDr. Julian\u201d). The issue of contribution arises in this matter because the Spences and Mercy entered into a pretrial settlement, by which the Spences agreed to dismiss their claims against Mercy for an undisclosed amount, without exacting an admission of liability; after Mercy was dismissed as a party, the case proceeded to trial against Dr. Julian, which ultimately resulted in an award to the Spences of $2,186,342.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Dr. Julian, in one of the two cases now under our review, subsequently initiated a separate action against Mercy seeking contribution. The Spences contemporaneously brought suit against Dr. Julian, seeking a declaration that he was not entitled to contribution. Both Mercy and the Spences argued before the trial court and before us that under the Maryland Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tort-Feasors Act, Sections 3-1401 to 3-1409 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1973, 2006 RepLVol.) (\u201cthe Act\u201d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> their release extinguished any right that Dr. Julian had to seek contribution against Mercy, because he did not join Mercy as a third party defendant in the original action after it was dismissed as a party. The Court of Special Appeals consolidated both cases, 201 Md.App. 562, 566, 30 A.3d 220, 223 (2011), and we continue that joinder, to consider whether Dr. Julian may pursue, in a separate action, contribution against Mercy after it had settled with, and been voluntarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>dismissed by, the Spences subsequent to the filing of suit but prior to trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The concept of a \u201cjoint tort-feasor\u201d is derived from the notion that a single injury can result from the joint actions of two or more individuals, who, putting aside defenses, may be jointly and severally liable. W. Page Keeton, Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts \u00a7 41, at 268 (5th ed. 1984). Each individual is severally liable for the entire damage, regardless of whether the conduct of one directly caused more or less injury compared to that of another, because they acted together with a common purpose resulting in responsibility for the common injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Consumer Protection Division v. Morgan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>387 Md. 125, 178, 874 A.2d 919, 950 (2005), citing William L. Prosser, <em>Joint Torts and Several Liability, </em>25 Cal. L.Rev. 413, 414 (1936); <em>see also Parler &amp; Wobber v. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, P.C., </em>359 Md. 671, 687, 756 A.2d 526, 534 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Under common law, the injured party, considered \u201clord of his action,\u201d could pursue any or all of the joint tort-feasors to recover damages. <em>E.g., </em>Prefatory Note, Handbook of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and Proceedings of the Forty-Ninth Annual Conference 240-41 (1939). The right of contribution among joint tortfeasors, so that one who paid the damages caused by several would be able to spread the loss among the group of tortfeasors, was prohibited. One basis for not permitting the apportionment of an award of damages among joint tortfeasors was that \u201cthe claimant for contribution [was thought to be] a \u2018bad man\u2019 and hence not entitled to the aid of the courts.\u201d Charles O. Gregory, <em>Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors: A Defense, </em>54 Harv. L.Rev. 1170, 1170 (1941). As the injured party could have but one recovery, one joint-tort feasor could not settle without necessitating a release of the entire claim, as \u201ca release of one joint tortfeasor releases all.\u201d Stuart M. Speiser et al., 1A The American Law of Torts \u00a7 5:42, at 577(2003); <em>accord Gunther v. Lee, </em>45 Md. 60, 67 (1876) (\u201cAll the cases, both English and American, maintain the doctrine that satisfaction from one joint tort-feasor, whether received before or after recovery, extinguishes the right as against the others.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The bar against contribution was criticized, from the viewpoint of the joint tort-feasor who had assumed total responsibility, as unfair and collusive between the injured party and another culpable person who escaped \u201cscot free\u201d from liability. Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts \u00a7 50, at 338. Nevertheless, a joint tort-feasor remained motivated to settle for less than the full amount, because of the \u201cfear of each that unless he settles he may have to bear alone the full weight of the verdict.\u201d Fleming James, Jr., <em>Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors: A Pragmatic Criticism, </em>54 Harv. L.Rev. 1156, 1161 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Contribution provided the societal benefit of a broader distribution of loss. Ernest M. Jones, <em>Contribution Among Tortfeasors, </em>11 U. Fla. L.Rev. 175, 187-88 (1958). In place of perceived unjust enrichment and favoritism towards actors who were not pursued by an injured party for recovery, the right to contribution promoted fairness under the maxim \u201cEquality is equity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182; Robert A. LeFlar, <em>Contribution and Indemnity Between Tortfeasors, </em>81 U. Pa. L.Rev. 130, 136-37 (1932). Contribution also supplied greater certainty of liability to joint tort-feasors, who were able to determine their proportional share of the common liability based on the number of joint tort-feasors. William M. Landes &amp; Richard A. Posner, Joint and Multiple Tortfeasors: An Economic Analysis, 9 J. Legal Stud. 517, 530-31 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">In conformance with these principles, the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act was promulgated in 1939 by the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform Laws to enable a statutory abrogation of the common law bar on contribution, in recognition that \u201c[t]he desire for equal or proportionate distribution of a common burden among those upon whom it rests is everywhere fundamental.\u201d Handbook of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and Proceedings of the Forty-Ninth Annual Conference, <em>supra, </em>at 240-41. A goal of the draft was to eradicate the common law rule providing a \u201cprivate, rather than judicial, control of the distribution of loss arising from a common burden of liability,\u201d which allowed the injured person to pick and choose \u201cone or more of several tortfeasors commonly liable to suffer judgment, even though trial would have proven them equally responsible....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In 1941, the General Assembly adopted the Maryland Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tort-feasors Act, modeled on the national paradigm. 1941 Maryland Laws, Chapter 344. Now currently codified as Sections 3-1401 to 3-1409 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, the Act defines joint tort-feasors as \u201ctwo or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property, whether or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them.\u201d Section 3-1401(c). In place of \u201ca release of one releases all\u201d at common law, the Act provides that a release of one joint tort-feasor does not relieve the liability of other joint tortfeasors, but instead reduces the judgment against them by either the consideration paid for the release or an amount or proportion provided in the release, whichever is greater:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">A release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor, whether before or after judgment, does not discharge the other tort-feasors unless the release so provides, but it reduces the claim against the other tort-feasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release or in any amount or proportion by which the release provides that the total claim shall be reduced, if greater than the consideration paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Section 3-1404.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Necessary to the existence of contribution under the Act is the determination of joint tort-feasor status, although the Act \u201cdoes not specify the test of liability.\u201d <em>Swigert v. Welk, </em>213 Md. 613, 619, 133 A.2d 428, 431 (1957). Our jurisprudence since the Act\u2019s passage provides that a party may qualify as a joint tort-feasor only by either having been adjudicated as liable, or having conceded or admitted liability, as a tort-feasor; threat of suit or suit itself will not suffice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALM\">As the Court of Appeals recognized long ago, \u201c[the Uniform Act] does not specify the test of liability. Clearly, something short of an actual judgment will suffice.\u201d <em>Swigert v. Welk, </em>213 Md. 613, 619, 133 A.2d 428 (1957). The fact, however, that a party has been sued or threatened with suit is not enough to establish joint tort-feasor status. <em>See Owens-Corning Fiberglas </em>[Corp.] <em>v. Garrett, </em>343 Md. 500, 531-32, 682 A.2d 1143 (1996). Tort-feasor status, in the absence of adjudication, generally rests on admission by the purported tort-feasor of such status. Thus, a party will be considered a joint tort-feasor when it admits joint tortfeasor status in a settlement agreement, <em>see Martinez, </em>300 Md. at 94-95, 476 A.2d 197, or if a default judgment has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>been entered against a party. <em>See Porter Hayden Co. v. Bullinger, </em>350 Md. 452, 473-74, 713 A.2d 962 (1998) (because a default judgment is considered an admission of liability, it is sufficient to establish joint tort-feasor status).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agr\"><em>Spangler v. McQuitty, </em>424 Md. 527, 544-45, 36 A.3d 928, 938 (2012), quoting <em>Jacobs v. Flynn, </em>131 Md.App. 342, 374-75, 749 A.2d 174, 191 (2000). Obviously, one who is not determined a joint tort-feasor is not subject to contribution under the Act; without an admission or adjudication of liability, a party who enters into a release is deemed a volunteer, not a joint tortfeasor. <em>Scapa, Dryer Fabrics, Inc. v. Saville, </em>418 Md. 496, 529-30, 16 A.3d 159, 178 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Sections of the Act in play in the present case include Section 3-1402, which enables the right of contribution among joint tort-feasors and specifies that it is only when one joint tort-feasor discharges the common liability or pays more than a pro rata share of liability that the right to pursue contribution, in the form of a money judgment, accrues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 The right of contribution exists among joint tort-feasors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">(b) <em>Discharge of liability or payment of share. </em>\u2014 A joint tort-feasor is not entitled to a money judgment for contribution until the joint tort-feasor has by payment discharged the common liability or has paid more than a pro rata share of the common liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">(c) <em>Effect of settlement </em>\u2014 A joint tort-feasor who enters into a settlement with the injured person is not entitled to recover contribution from another joint tort-feasor whose liability to the injured person is not extinguished by the settlement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u201cPro rata\u201d anticipates equal shares that are determined by dividing the common liability by the number of joint tortfeasors. <em>Hashmi v. Bennett, </em>416 Md. 707, 719 n. 13, 7 A.3d 1059, 1066 n. 13 (2010), citing <em>Lahocki v. Contee Sand &amp; Gravel Co., </em>41 Md.App. 579, 616, 398 A.2d 490, 511 (1979), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. General Motors Corp. v. Lahocki, </em>286 Md. 714, 410 A.2d 1039 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The other section of interest in this case is Section 3-1405 of the Act, which provides for the extinguishment of contribution by a released joint tort-feasor under certain conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">A release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor does not relieve the joint tort-feasor from liability to make contribution to another joint tort-feasor unless the release:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">(1) Is given before the right of the other tort-feasor to secure a money judgment for contribution has accrued; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">(2) Provides for a reduction, to the extent of the pro rata share of the released tort-feasor, of the injured person\u2019s damages recoverable against all other tort-feasors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">At issue before us presently is the impact of a release of one defendant, who does not admit joint tort-feasor status and has not been adjudicated as such, on the ability of another defending party to pursue contribution against the released defendant in a subsequent separate action. Specifically, Mercy was released by the Spences prior to trial in the original medical malpractice action; together the Spences and Mercy contend that their Confidential Settlement Release Agreement (\u201cRelease\u201d) extinguished Dr. Julian\u2019s right to contribution against Mercy under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The Release provided, in pertinent part, that Mercy as \u201cReleased Parties\u201d was not a joint tort-feasor and if it were subsequently adjudicated liable, then the Spences\u2019 recovery against other defending parties, namely Dr. Julian, would be reduced by Mercy\u2019s pro rata share of the judgment, so to \u201crelieve and protect [Mercy] from any liability for contribution to any person\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">7. <em>Joint-Tortfeasor Nature of Agreement:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">a. The [Spences] and the Released Parties agree and understand that this is a <em>\u201cSwigert </em>Release\u201d as set out in the case of <em>Swigert v. Welk, </em>213 Md. 613, 133 A.2d 428 (1957), and, in accordance with that decision and the Maryland Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tort-Feasors Act, Md. Code Ann. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. 3-1401 et seq. (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.) (\u201cthe Act\u201d), <em>the Released Parties are neither deemed joint tortfeasors for purposes of this Release, </em>nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>are [the Spences] hereby releasing any other person or entity, whether or not a named party to this agreement. Any person or entity, other than the Released Parties, whom the [Spences] claim are liable to them for the injuries, losses and damages which are the subject of this action shall not be entitled to any reduction of the damages the [Spences] are claiming against them by reason of the payment herein, unless and until the Released Parties have been adjudicated to be Joint Tortfeasors with said other person or entity. <em>In the event the Released Parties are adjudicated to be Joint Tortfeasors liable to the [Spences] for damages, the [Spences] agree that their damages recoverable against all other tort-feasors, including but not limited to [Dr. Julian], will be reduced to the extent of the </em>pro rata <em>share of the Released Parties pursuant to the Maryland Uniform, Contribution Among Joint Tort-Feasors Act, Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.Code Ann \u00a7 3-1405 (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol., 2005 Supp.). </em>This provision is further intended to relieve and protect the Released Parties from any liability for contribution to any person, firm, partnership or corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">(Emphasis added). The Spences further agreed to indemnify Mercy for any and all claims of contribution asserted by Dr. Julian against Mercy and to hold in escrow one half of any judgment rendered against Dr. Julian until Dr. Julian\u2019s claim for contribution had been extinguished:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">8. <em>Indemnity &amp; Hold Harmless &amp; Escrow:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGa\">a. The [Spences] hereby covenant and agree for themselves and their successors, heirs, administrators, executors and assigns to indemnify and hold harmless the Released Parties for any and all claims, demands, actions, cross-actions, causes of actions [sic], judgments, suits or complaints of any kind that may be asserted by any person, persons, firms, corporations or other entity against the Released Parties as a result of or in any way connected with any claim, cross claim, demand, action, indemnity claim, contribution claim, lien, suit, judgment, or finding of any Court in any way arising out of or relating to the Occur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>rence, or any alleged injuries claimed by or allegedly sustained by the [Spences] individually or on behalf of the Estate of CALEB SPENCE or any claim for damages by any person claiming a right to recover due to the death of CALEB SPENCE. This duty to indemnify includes any and all claims, demands or actions for contribution and/or indemnity, or disputes over the number of joint tortfeasors that may be asserted against [Mercy] by [Dr. Julian] or anyone acting on their behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">b. If there is a judgment in favor of the [Spences] against [Dr. Julian], the [Spences] shall hold in escrow one half of the amount of such judgment (upon receipt of payment) in an interest bearing account. The escrowed funds are intended as security for the benefit of the Released Parties for any future indemnity payments that the [Spences] are obligated to pay to the Released Parties under this Release Agreement. Said funds shall be es-crowed for three years from the date of judgment or until [Dr. Julian\u2019s] claim for contribution has been extinguished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azq\">Mercy\u2019s liability was never adjudicated in the original medical malpractice action. Although Dr. Julian apparently objected,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Spences voluntarily dismissed Mercy from the case prior to trial, as they had agreed to do so in the Release.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A jury returned a verdict of more than $8,000,000 against Dr. Julian, which was subsequently reduced to $2,186,342.50 pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>suant to the statutory cap on non-economic damages;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Dr. Julian satisfied the judgment in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The two companion cases now under our review followed. In September 2009, Dr. Julian filed a complaint for contribution against Mercy. Mercy moved to dismiss, or in the alternative for summary judgment, arguing that the Release satisfied Section 3-1405 of the Act, by \u201cspecifically providing] for a <em>pro rata </em>reduction in favor of [Dr. Julian] in the event Mercy or any of its agents or employees was adjudicated to be a joint tortfeasor liable to the Spences,\u201d and therefore extinguished the right to contribution against it. Mercy alternatively argued that Dr. Julian could have, but waived, the opportunity to seek contribution during the original medical malpractice claim and therefore his separate action for contribution was barred. In opposing the motion, Dr. Julian contended that Section 3-1405 was not applicable, because Mercy had yet to be determined a joint tort-feasor, and he did not waive his right to contribution by not pursuing it in the original medical malpractice action because he was not man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>dated by the Maryland Rules to file a cross-claim against Mercy.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">In a Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Mercy\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Without Prejudice, the Circuit Court Judge concluded that Mercy\u2019s Release complied with the requirements of Section 3-1405. The judge concluded that the Release limited Dr. Julian to pursuing a reduction in the original medical malpractice action, by way of \u201ccross claim or motion,\u201d which he did not do and barred a separate contribution action against Mercy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">[W]hen [Section 3-1405]\u2019s requirements are met, released defendants may be brought into or retained in a case, for example by cross claim or motion, for the sole purpose of seeking a reduction in judgment and not for the purpose of contribution. Defendants thus released are compelled to participate in the trial only in order to have it determined whether they are joint tortfeasors, the unreleased defendant having \u201can extremely valuable right in retaining [the released defendant] in the case, because, if the jury should find [the released defendant] to be a joint tortfeasor, [the unreleased defendant\u2019s] liability to plaintiffs would be cut in half.\u201d <em>[Swigert, </em>213 Md. at 622, 133 A.2d 428].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">Because the release (1) occurred before Dr. Julian\u2019s right of contribution accrued under [Section] 3-1402 and (2) provided for a pro rata reduction as understood in <em>Swigert, </em>Mercy is relieved from any liability for contribution in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">CONCLUSION:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">On the basis of the statutes and case law above, this Court must conclude that Dr. Julian\u2019s contribution claim against Mercy is barred. That is the only decision consistent with [Section] 3-1405 and with <em>Swigert. </em>Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss will be granted without prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">(Internal footnote omitted). Dr. Julian appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">In April 2009, upon learning that Dr. Julian was pursuing a contribution action against Mercy, the Spences filed a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Court for Baltimore City. The Spences requested a declaration that Dr. Julian was barred from the right to pursue contribution from Mercy because he had failed, in the original action brought by the Spences, to prove that Mercy was negligent or, alternatively, to affirmatively plead release as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Both the Spences and Dr. Julian moved for summary judgment, agreeing that there was no dispute of material fact. Dr. Julian argued that upon paying more than his pro rata share of the liability, he was entitled to pursue, in a separate action, contribution from Mercy pursuant to Section 3-1402 of the Act. The Spences responded that their Release of Mercy satisfied Section 3-1405 and extinguished Dr. Julian\u2019s right to contribution. Alternatively, the Spences contended that as a result of the Release, the doctor\u2019s pursuit of contribution was limited to the original medical malpractice action and without pleading the affirmative defense of release, or pursuit of a cross-claim against Mercy, in that case, Dr. Julian effectively waived his right to contribution under the Act. Issuing a declaratory judgment in favor of Dr. Julian, a different Circuit Court Judge, Judge Evelyn O. Cannon, disagreed with the Spences, in part on the bases that his right to contribution was neither barred by Section 3-1405 nor waived by his decision not to file a cross-claim for contribution or plead release as an affirmative defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">Defendants [Dr. Julian] have not waived any right to assert a claim for setoff or contribution against Mercy Medical Center in connection with the judgment against [Dr. Julian] in <em>Wycinna Spence, et al. v. Emerson Julian, et al., </em>Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Case no. 24-C-05-1852. [Dr. Julian\u2019s] decision not to file a cross-claim or plead \u201crelease\u201d did not waive their right to file a claim or setoff or contribution and the claim is not barred by [Section] 3-1405 or res judicata. There has not been a judicial finding [that] Mercy Medical Center was or was not a joint tortfeasor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The Spences appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Before the Court of Special Appeals, the Spences, Mercy and Dr. Julian filed a Joint Motion to Consolidate Appeals, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>wherein they acknowledged that the appeals of the Spences in the declaratory judgment action and Dr. Julian in the contribution action were from contradictory orders of the Circuit Court from Baltimore City involving identical issues. The Court of Special Appeals granted the joint motion and consolidated the declaratory judgment action and the contribution action to consider</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\">whether, when a release provides for a reduction of damages awarded against a nonsettling defendant, but only if the settling defendant is adjudicated to be a joint tortfeasor, is the nonsettling defendant required to litigate the settling defendant\u2019s joint tortfeasor status in the underlying action, or does he have the option to litigate that issue in a separate contribution action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">201 Md.App. at 579-80, 30 A.3d at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The intermediate appellate court initially addressed whether the Release satisfied the two conditions of Section 3-1405, so as to extinguish Dr. Julian\u2019s right to contribution. Observing there to be no dispute that the first condition, requiring the release to be given before Dr. Julian\u2019s right to contribution accrued, \u201cie., before he ... has paid more than his ... pro rata share,\u201d 201 Md.App. at 582, 30 A.3d at 232, was satisfied, the court then looked to whether the Release provided for a reduction, representing Mercy\u2019s pro rata share, in the Spences\u2019 damages recovered against Dr. Julian, pursuant to Section 3-1405(2). The Release did not satisfy Section 3-1405(2), concluded the intermediate appellate court, because its terms conditioned the pro rata reduction \u201c[i]n the event\u201d Mercy was adjudicated by the trial court to be a joint tortfeasor, which had not occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 588, 30 A.3d at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The Court of Special Appeals then addressed whether the determination of Mercy\u2019s liability was required to occur in the original medical malpractice action brought by the Spences, as the judge in the contribution action had expressly determined. The intermediate appellate court concluded that there was no Maryland statute, case law or rule that prohibited an independent contribution action under the circumstances of this case. <em>Id. </em>at 588-89, 30 A.3d at 235. Affirming the decision in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>declaratory judgment action, but reversing the decision in the contribution action, the Court of Special Appeals ultimately held that Dr. Julian was not prohibited from pursuing contribution from Mercy in a separate action. <em>Id. </em>at 589, 30 A.3d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Before us, the issue continues to be whether and to what extent the release of one defending party, without admission of joint tort-feasor status, may negate or limit another\u2019s right to contribution under the Act. Historically, \u201c[t]he effect of a settlement with the plaintiff by the contribution defendant, who has received a release or a covenant not to sue, has perhaps given more difficulty than any other problem.\u201d W. Page Keeton, Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts \u00a7 50, at 340 (5th ed.1984). Mercy and the Spences challenge Dr. Julian\u2019s pursuit of contribution, because they assert that their Release complied with Section 3-1405 of the Act and thus extinguished Mercy\u2019s contribution liability to Dr. Julian. Section 3-1405, once again, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">A release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor does not relieve the joint tort-feasor from liability to make contribution to another joint tort-feasor unless the release:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">(1) Is given before the right of the other tort-feasor to secure a money judgment for contribution has accrued; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">(2) Provides for a reduction, to the extent of the pro rata share of the released tort-feasor, of the injured person\u2019s damages recoverable against all other tort-feasors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The Spences and Mercy contend that Dr. Julian\u2019s right to contribution was extinguished when the Release was given, because the following language of their Release mirrored, and consequently complied with, Section 3-1405(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">In the event the Released Parties are adjudicated to be Joint Tortfeasors liable to the [Spences] for damages, the [Spences] agree that their damages recoverable against all other tort-feasors, including but not limited to [Dr. Julian], will be reduced to the extent of the <em>pro rata </em>share of the Released Parties pursuant to the Maryland Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tort-Feasors Act, Md. Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proe.Code Ann \u00a7 3-1405 (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol., 2005 Supp.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Dr. Julian responds, as the Court of Special Appeals determined, that this language of the Release conditioned the reduction of the Spences\u2019 judgment against him on the adjudication of Mercy\u2019s liability and, because Mercy was dismissed from the original action prior to having been adjudicated as a joint tort-feasor, Mercy\u2019s liability had yet to be determined. As a result, Dr. Julian maintains that the Release\u2019s conditional language did not operate to satisfy Section 8-1405(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">For support, the Spences, Mercy, and Dr. Julian each point to our decision in <em>Swigert v. Welk, </em>213 Md. 613, 133 A.2d 428 (1957), in which we considered whether a similar release, without an admission of liability, entitled the released defending party to summary judgment and dismissal from the case. <em>Swigert </em>arose out of a two-car collision. The passenger, Evelyn Newport, sued the driver, Harry R. Swigert, who in turn filed a third party complaint for contribution against the second driver, John E. Welk. Mr. Welk moved for summary judgment, contending that he had already entered into a release with Ms. Newport that extinguished his contribution liability, pursuant to Section 24 of Article 50, Maryland Code,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> now Section 3-1405. In the release, Mr. Welk did not admit liability, but Ms. Newport agreed that her damages recoverable against Mr. Swigert would be reduced by Mr. Welk\u2019s pro rata share of the liability, pursuant to the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED that the payment of said amount by the said Payer (s) is not to be construed as an admission of liability on the part of said Payer (s), but that said payment is in compromise and settlement of my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>(our) claim which is not admitted but is denied and disputed by said Payer (s); * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\">I/we further agree that all claims or damages recoverable by me/us against all other persons, firms or corporations, jointly or severally liable to me/us in tort for my/our said damages, are hereby reduced, to the extent of the statutory pro rata share of said John E. Welk under the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, of all such damages so recoverable by me/us against all such other joint tortfeasors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtO\">213 Md. at 618, 133 A.2d at 430-31. The Superior Court for Baltimore City granted Mr. Welk\u2019s motion for summary judgment, from which Mr. Swigert appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Before us, Mr. Welk (like Mercy and the Spences in the present case) contended that his release \u201cfully complie[d]\u201d with Section 24, and, therefore, barred Mr. Swigert from pursuing contribution. 213 Md. at 617, 133 A.2d at 430. Looking to the language of the release, this Court observed that it was given before Mr. Swigert\u2019s right to contribution accrued, and' it iterated <em>verbatim </em>the second requirement of Section 24, regarding a reduction in damages representing Mr. Welk\u2019s pro rata share of the liability. We concluded, nonetheless, that the release \u201cfully complies with this section, <em>... if Welk is a tortfeasor,\u201d </em>(emphasis added), which was denied in the settlement release:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">There is no contention that it was not obtained \u201cbefore the right of the other tortfeasor to secure a money judgment for contribution\u201d had accrued, and there was thus included <em>verbatim </em>the other requirement or condition of sec. 24. It is clear the release fully complies with this section, and is also within the provisions of sec. 23,[ <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] if Welk is a tortfeasor. This, however, is denied in the release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">213 Md. at 618, 133 A.2d at 431. As a result, we reversed the grant of Mr. Welk\u2019s summary judgment in Mr. Welk\u2019s favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>and remanded the case back to the trial court; Mr. Welk remained as a third party defendant to enable adjudication of his joint tort-feasor status.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Mercy and the Spences apparently interpret <em>Swigert </em>to stand for the proposition that a defending party who is released need not stipulate to joint tort-feasor status before its release \u201cfully complies\u201d with Section 24, now Section 3-1405. Dr. Julian responds that <em>Swigert </em>does not contradict his position that the Release\u2019s conditional language does not comply fully with Section 3-1405 to relieve Mercy\u2019s contribution liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">We agree with Dr. Julian. In advocating that <em>Swigert </em>is the linchpin in our jurisprudence that a party does not have to be determined a tort-feasor to fully comply with Section 24, now Section 3-1405, Mercy and the Spences ignore the key condition of our conclusion, that being the release \u201cfully complies with this section [24], and is also within the provisions of sec. 23, <em>if Welk is a tortfeasor. This, however, is denied in the release.\u201d </em>213 Md. at 618, 133 A.2d at 431 (emphasis added). As a result of the denial of liability, we rejected Mr. Welk\u2019s argument that his release relieved him of his contribution liability, because his contribution liability was conditional. Mr. Welk, impleaded as a third party defendant, had to remain in the case as it proceeded to trial, so as to determine whether Mr. Welk was liable as a joint tort-feasor. Mercy and the Spences, therefore, neglect what we have often affirmed, that a party must have been adjudicated liable or have admitted to joint tort-feasor status for the Act, and of course, Section 3-1405,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to apply at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>In the absence of an adjudication that the released party is liable as a joint tort-feasor, a release has only evoked the Act, so as to extinguish contribution liability, when it has included an admission of the released defending party\u2019s joint tort-feasor status. In <em>Jones v. Hurst, </em>54 Md.App. 607, 610, 459 A.2d 219, 221 (1983), the release included General Motors Corporation\u2019s stipulation to be considered as a joint tort-feasor \u201cto the same extent and effect as if judgments had been rendered against [it] as joint tort-feasor[ ].\u201d Based on this concession, the intermediate appellate court held that no subsequent trial, adjudicating the corporation\u2019s liability, was necessary; the corporation was dismissed prior to trial and a judgment against another joint tort-feasor was properly reduced by the corporation\u2019s pro rata, share of the liability. <em>Id. </em>at 612-13, 459 A.2d at 222-23. A pro rata release that stipulates to the joint tort-feasor status of the released defendant allows the defendant to avoid going to trial and being adjudicated a joint tort-feasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">By contrast, a release that does not address the liability of the released defending party, and conditions the reduction in the damages recoverable required under Section 3-1405(2), complies with this provision only \u201cif [the released party] is a tortfeasor,\u201d <em>Swigert, </em>213 Md. at 618, 133 A.2d at 431. In agreeing to a conditional release, the plaintiff and the released defending party agree to take a risk by having the liability of the released party adjudicated. If the released defending party is adjudicated liable, then the provision in their release, providing for the reduction of a pro rata share in damages recoverable, protects the released party from a contribution claim. Alternatively, if adjudicated not liable, then the released party is a volunteer and the Act does not apply, which allows the plaintiff to recover the judgment from the defendants, without reduction. In both scenarios, the released defending party, whose liability is determined, may not be subject to recovery by either the plaintiff or the other nonsettling defendants. <em>Swigert, </em>213 Md. at 622, 133 A.2d at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>We have had occasion to address some of these scenarios. In <em>Spangler v. McQuitty, </em>424 Md. 527, 542-43, 36 A.3d 928, 937 (2012), for example, one of the defendants, a hospital, entered into a release with the plaintiff, without any admission of liability. The trial court granted the hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to liability and, as a result, we determined that the hospital, as a \u201cvolunteer,\u201d was not a joint tortfeasor under the Act, so that the remaining defendant, a doctor against whom judgment was rendered following trial, was not entitled to a reduction in the judgment for the hospital\u2019s release under Section 3-1404.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">In <em>Porter Hayden Company v. Bullinger, </em>350 Md. 452, 713 A.2d 962 (1998), Porter Hayden Company filed a third party contribution claim against Babcock &amp; Wilcox, who had previously settled with the plaintiff. After Babcock &amp; Wilcox failed to file an answer to the third party complaint, Porter Hayden secured a default judgment. The trial court refused to reduce the judgment against Porter Hayden for Babcock <em>&amp; </em>Wilcox\u2019s release, raising the issue of whether the default judgment established the liability of Babcock <em>&amp; </em>Wilcox as a joint tortfeasor. We reversed the trial court, concluding that \u201c[a] default judgment against a settling defendant is akin to an admission of liability\u201d and is \u201csufficient to establish one a joint tortfeasor for the purposes of the application of section 3-1404 of the [Act].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474, 719 A.2d at 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In <em>Allgood v. Mueller, </em>307 Md. 350, 513 A.2d 915 (1986), released defendants, who had not admitted to being joint tortfeasors, were found not liable at trial. The trial court, however, reduced the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment against the remaining culpable defendant in light of the release. We vacated the reduction of the judgment on the basis that the Act did not apply because the released defendants were adjudicated not liable as joint tort-feasors. <em>Id. </em>at 354, 513 A.2d at 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019s jurisprudence, in requiring that the released party\u2019s joint tort-feasor status be determined before a release\u2019s effect on contribution can be addressed, is in accord. In <em>Collier v. Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc., </em>86 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>App. 38, 45, 585 A.2d 256, 259-60 (1991), three of several defendants entered into a release, in which they denied joint tort-feasor status, and only one of the three, thereafter, was determined to be liable. The issue arose as to whether the nonsettling defendants were entitled to a reduction in the judgment against them for a portion of this release of one joint tort-feasor and two volunteers. The Court of Special Appeals remanded the case for further consideration as to the amount of the reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 585 A.2d at 269. Clearly, the adjudication of the released parties\u2019 liability remained a precondition to the consideration of how the release would impact the rights of the nonsettling defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><em>C &amp; K Lord, Inc. v. Carter, </em>74 Md.App. 68, 73-74, 536 A.2d 699, 701-02 (1988), further, involved one of several defendants who entered into a release with the plaintiffs and thereafter was determined by the trial court to be immune from liability; with the released defendant as a volunteer, the judgment against the other defendants could not be reduced for the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Mercy and the Spences, however, argue that <em>\u201cSwigert\u201d </em>releases have repeatedly been found to comply with Section 3-1405 and extinguish the right to contribution without a determination of joint tort-feasor status. They point first to <em>Martinez v. Lopez, </em>300 Md. 91, 476 A.2d 197 (1984), a case in which we quoted our determination in <em>Sivigert </em>that the release of Mr. Welk \u201cfully complies with [present \u00a7 20], and is also within the provisions of [present \u00a7 19], if Welk is a tortfeasor.\u201d 300 Md. at 102, 476 A.2d at 203, quoting <em>Swigert, </em>213 Md. at 618, 133 A.2d at 431. We quoted <em>Swigert, </em>however, solely as support for the notion that the provisions now known as Sections 3-1404 and 3-1405 are not mutually exclusive. In <em>Martinez, </em>the plaintiffs settled with one defendant, a hospital, prior to trial with a release that provided that the hospital would be considered a joint tort-feasor with the remaining defendant, a doctor, and that any recovery against the doctor would be reduced by the pro rata share of the released hospital. Ultimately, the jury award against the doctor was less than the amount of the hospital\u2019s settlement, and the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>arose as to whether a reduction in that judgment, to zero, was provided under Section 19 of Article 50, Maryland Code, now Section 8-1404 of the Act. We answered in the affirmative; clearly the issue of whether the language of the release established the released hospital\u2019s joint tort-feasor status was not contested. <em>Martinez </em>did not address, nor did it dispel, our interpretation in <em>Swigert </em>that a release without a determination of joint tort-feasor status will \u201cfully compl[y]\u201d with Section 3-1405, <em>if the </em>released party is a tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Mercy also points to two cases in which they allege that two different judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland determined that a conditional release, without an admission of liability, but providing a pro rata reduction of damages recoverable on a subsequent adjudication of the released party\u2019s liability, complied with Section 3-1405. In <em>Montgomery County v. Jaffe, Raitt, Heuer &amp; Weiss, 897 </em>F.Supp. 233 (D.Md.1995), Montgomery County brought a professional malpractice action against a Michigan law firm, Jaffe, Raitt, Heuer &amp; Weiss (\u201cJaffe Raitt\u201d), alleging that the law firm\u2019s misstatements in an opinion letter led the County to proceed with an ultimately-unsuccessful development project. 897 F.Supp. at 235-36. The County had also filed a separate action against the developers, a limited partnership and its guarantors, but this second action was dismissed after the County and developers settled. <em>Id. </em>at 238. The County\u2019s release of the developers provided no admission of liability and that the release \u201cshall serve only to reduce any recovery which may be had against the other alleged tortfeasors ... to the extent of the pro rata share recoverable by law from the releasees in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors Act of Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239. The release further conditioned this pro rata reduction on the adjudication that the developers were hable for contribution. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cAny reduction effected hereby shall not be construed to affect the recovery in any suit, cause of action or claim in which the releasees shall not have been adjudged legally liable for contribution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Jaffe Raitt asserted as an affirmative defense a right to contribution, contending that if the developers and Jaffe Raitt were found to be joint tort-feasors, then it was entitled to a reduction in a judgment for the County. In cross-motions for summary judgment, the parties disputed the issue of contribution and the court agreed with the law firm, concluding that Jaffe Raitt was entitled to recover a reduction in the subsequent judgment because it would be inequitable to permit the County to double recovery from Jaffe Raitt as well as developers, who the court described as \u201cwrongdoers,\u201d for the same harm. <em>Id. </em>at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">In response to the County\u2019s argument that the developers had to be joined as parties by Jaffe Raitt before the latter could be entitled to contribution, the court also addressed whether the release satisfied Section 20 of Article 50, Maryland Code (1991),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> now Section 3-1405, to extinguish the developers\u2019 contribution liability. The court concluded that so long as the developers are \u201clegally liable for contribution, <em>i.e. </em>that [their] status as joint tortfeasor[s] be determined,\u201d the language of the release complied with the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 239. The District Court concluded that, in the subsequent trial, a judicial determination of the developers\u2019 joint tort-feasor status was necessary before the contribution credit was permitted, even though the developers were not a party to the action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>In <em>Adams v. NVR Homes, Inc., </em>135 F.Supp.2d 675, 709 (D.Md.2001), another judge of the federal district court considered whether a conditional release, which provided that the damages recoverable be reduced by the released party\u2019s pro rata share of the liability if \u201cdetermined to be joint tortfeasors,\u201d satisfied Section 3-1405, so to protect the released defendants from a cross-claim for contribution. The court determined that the language satisfied Section 3-1405(2), so long as the released parties were found to be liable as joint tort-feasors: \u201cTherefore, to the extent that the [released parties] are found to be joint tortfeasors ... [they] are protected against the claim for contribution.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Mercy\u2019s and the Spences\u2019 position that a release, providing no admission of liability and a reduction in a judgment against nonsettling defendants if the released party is a joint tortfeasor, will alone satisfy Section 3-1405 and extinguish contribution, thus, is without support. The Spences dismissed Mercy in the original action, prior to any determination of Mercy\u2019s liability as a tort-feasor. As a result, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals and conclude that in the absence of an admission of joint tort-feasor status or an adjudication of Mercy\u2019s liability, Mercy\u2019s and the Spences\u2019 conditional release did not comply with Section 3-1405 of the Act and, consequently, did not extinguish Dr. Julian\u2019s right to contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Mercy and the Spences also, nevertheless, challenge Dr. Julian\u2019s ability to bring his contribution claim in a separate action. They assert that Dr. Julian was required to pursue his contribution claim in the original action by virtue of a cross-claim. His failure to do so, they assert, doomed his contribution claim to extinguishment. By so doing, both assert that Dr. Julian had to tether Mercy to the original action after it was voluntarily dismissed by the Spences or lose his contribution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In disagreeing with Mercy and the Spences, we initially note that there is no expression in Section 3-1405, or any other provision of the Act, that a cross-claim for contribution must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>be asserted in the original action.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rather our case law, especially <em>Swigert, </em>has suggested the pursuit of contribution in the original case to be one possibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-4\">While we know of no statute or rule of court that specifically directs the procedure to be followed by the trial Court in having the question of Welk\u2019s negligence determined, it is certain that within the scope of present rules of court an easy and practical method is afforded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><em>Swigert, </em>213 Md. at 622, 133 A.2d at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Our Rules also recognize that a contribution claim <em>may </em>be raised in the original action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">If in a single action a judgment is entered jointly against more than one defendant, the court upon motion may enter an appropriate judgment for one of the defendants against another defendant if (a) the moving defendant has discharged the judgment by payment or has paid more than a pro rata share of the judgment and (b) the moving defendant has a right to contribution or to recovery over from the other defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Rule 2-614. We have had occasion to interpret the Rules in <em>Lerman v. Heeman, </em>347 Md. 439, 445, 701 A.2d 426, 430 (1997), involving a contribution claim that followed a judgment of $3.3 million against two defendants, Dr. Sheldon H. Lerman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>and Dr. Kerry R. Heeman, of which Dr. Heeman paid $2.3 million and Dr. Lerman paid $1 million. Dr. Heeman filed a Motion for Judgment of Contribution or Recovery Over, seeking contribution for the amount that his payment of the judgment exceeded Dr. Heeman\u2019s, which the trial court granted. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Before us, Dr. Lerman contended that \u201ca right to contribution can be acquired only if it was previously asserted in a cross-claim.\u201d 347 Md. at 443, 701 A.2d at 428. We disagreed, reasoning that cross-claims are not mandatory and therefore are not prerequisites to pursuing contribution by a post-trial motion under Rule 2-614. <em>Id. </em>at 446, 701 A.2d at 430. We continued that Rule 2-614, as a procedural mechanism for recovering contribution, did not alter the original intent of the Act, which did not require the filing of a cross-claim before the pursuit of contribution against a codefendant. We recognized, also, that Rule 2-614 did not mandate the pursuit of contribution prior to judgment in the original action, nor did it bar a contribution claim in a separate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">We consulted the <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>authored by Judge Paul V. Niemeyer and Linda M. Schuett, to interpret Rule 2-614 as a \u201crule of convenience\u201d that provided the defendant seeking contribution with an alternative to bringing a separate action for contribution. <em>Id. </em>at 445, 701 A.2d at 429-30 (\u201cAlthough initiation of a separate action by defendant A against defendant B is an alternative method of proceeding, defendant A may avoid a separate lawsuit by filing a motion for judgment in the original action,\u201d quoting Paul V. Niemeyer &amp; Linda M. Schuett, Maryland Rules Commentary 475 (2d ed. 1992)). Accordingly, we affirmed the grant of Dr. Heeman\u2019s motion for contribution, as there is \u201c[n]o rule or statute imposing] the additional requirement that a co-defendant \u2018assert\u2019 that right in the original trial by filing a cross-claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446, 701 A.2d at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Similarly, Rule 2-332, regarding third-party practice, provides that a defendant may, but is not required to, bring a claim against a third party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>(a) Defendant\u2019s claim against third party. A defendant, as a third-party plaintiff, may cause a summons and complaint, together with a copy of all pleadings, scheduling notices, court orders, and other papers previously filed in the action, to be served upon a person not a party to the action who is or may be liable to the defendant for all or part of a plaintiffs claim against the defendant. A person so served becomes a third-party defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\">(d) Additional parties. A third-party defendant may proceed under this Rule against any person who is or may be liable to the third-party defendant for all or part of the claim made in the pending action. When a counterclaim is asserted against a plaintiff, the plaintiff may cause a third party to be brought in under circumstances that would entitle a defendant to do so under this Rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In <em>O\u2019Keefe v. Baltimore Transit Company, </em>201 Md. 345, 94 A.2d 26 (1953), we considered whether Section III of the General Rules of Practice and Procedure, which was titled \u201cJoinder of Parties and Claims; Third Party Practice\u201d and included the precursor to Rule 2-332,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> barred a separate action for contribution. Following a collision between a taxicab and a streetcar in Baltimore City, the widows of the taxicab passengers brought wrongful death actions against both Arthur O\u2019Keefe, the owner of the taxicab, and the streetcar company, Baltimore Transit Company. Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Transit Company entered into general releases with the plaintiffs, releasing both itself and the taxi cab company from liability. Thereafter, in a separate action, Baltimore Transit Company pursued contribution against Mr. O\u2019Keefe for one half, or its pro rata share, of the settlement amount. In that separate action, the trial court found \u201cthat the accident was due to the joint negligence of the operator of the streetcar of the Baltimore Transit Company and the driver of the cab of the appellant [Mr. O\u2019Keefe]\u201d and awarded the Baltimore Transit Company contribution. <em>Id. </em>at 359, 94 A.2d at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Before us, Mr. O\u2019Keefe argued that the Baltimore Transit Company could not secure a settlement in a pending case and then pursue contribution in a separate action. Looking to Section III, we concluded that Baltimore Transit Company\u2019s separate action for contribution was permitted, because \u201c[t]here is no requirement in these rules that an action for contribution must be brought in the original action and cannot be brought in an independent action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 94 A.2d at 28.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Mercy argues, nevertheless, that allowing Dr. Julian to proceed in a separate action for contribution would thwart the Act\u2019s purpose of \u201ctry[ing] in one action all phases of litigation among the original and impleaded parties,\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. 185, 191, 562 A.2d 1246, 1249 (1989), quoting <em>Stem v. Nello L. Teer Co., </em>213 Md. 132, 144, 130 A.2d 769, 775 (1957). The Act, however, was designed to subvert the common law\u2019s notion that the joint tort-feasor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>against whom judgment was solely collected, was thought to be \u201cbad man\u201d and not entitled to pursue a fair distribution of liability among multiple culpable actors. Charles O. Gregory, <em>Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors: A Defense, </em>54 Harv. L.Rev. 1170, 1170 (1941). Clearly, the Act, as well as the Rules pertaining to the pursuit of contribution, do not mandate the filing of a cross-claim.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">The possibility of joinder in one action, though facially appealing for the court and some of the parties, may not be appealing to the nonsettling defendant. Dr. Julian argues that his pursuit of contribution in a separate action was a matter of trial strategy, because if he had filed a cross-claim against Mercy, the Spences would have presented evidence as to his liability solely, leaving the jury confused and persuaded that Mercy was not liable: \u201cThe real parties in interest are the plaintiff and the non-settling tortfeasor, but the jury will never know this because it cannot be told of the settlement due to the same risk of jury confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The Spences separately argue, however, that Dr. Julian waived his right to pursue contribution against Mercy in a separate action, because he failed to plead \u201crelease\u201d as an affirmative defense, pursuant to Rule 2-323(g)(12),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>original medical malpractice action. They contend that Dr. Julian, as a third party beneficiary to their Release of Mercy, relies \u201cupon the Spence/Merey release as the basis for [his] contribution claim.\u201d How Dr. Julian is a third party beneficiary is truly questionable, even unfathomable, because he derives his right to contribution by statute, not as a result of a release that purports to extinguish that right.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Accordingly, Dr. Julian was not obligated to file an amended Answer in the original action to include release as an affirmative defense, prior to pursuing a contribution action against Mercy.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

It was up to the Court of Special Appeals \u2014 and now us \u2014 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>sort out who had the right of way and, more importantly, the rules of the road for similar cases in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The majority opinion does a fine job of laying out the background of this case, tracing the history of the law of contribution, describing the Maryland Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tort-Feasors Act (\u201cUCATA\u201d), and outlining the leading cases. It rules in favor of one side, but shies away from making the key choice that this case presents. I would be disposed to join what is a well constructed opinion, except that I cannot tell what decision we have made as to this question: What is the effect, as to a post-judgment action for contribution, of a release that provides for a pro rata reduction of the common liability for allegedly culpable parties conditioned on a subsequent determination of the joint tort-feasor status of the settling party?</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">At the risk of repeating what has already been well laid out, I begin by briefly summarizing my understanding of UCATA and the Court\u2019s holding in what all parties agree is the key <em>precedent </em>\u2014 Sivigert <em>v. Welk.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Atc\">\n<em>UCATA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Simply put, UCATA establishes a right of contribution among parties who are jointly and severally hable under Maryland tort law. Maryland Code, Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d), \u00a7 3-1402. A joint tort-feasor who pays more than a pro rata share of the common liability may collect contribution from the other joint tort-feasors. CJ \u00a7 3-1402(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">UCATA also establishes rules for the assessment of contribution when one or more of the allegedly culpable parties settle with the plaintiff. A settling joint tort-feasor is not entitled to contribution from another joint tort-feasor unless the settlement extinguishes the liability of the other tortfeasor. CJ \u00a7 3-1402(c). A release given by a plaintiff to a settling joint tort-feasor reduces the plaintiffs claim against the other joint tort-feasors by the amount of the settlement\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>or by a greater amount or proportion set forth in the release. CJ \u00a7 3-1404. Finally, the settling joint tort-feasor remains liable to pay contribution to other joint tortfeasors for their payment of the common liability unless the release provided by the plaintiff provides for a reduction of the common liability to the extent of the pro rata share of the settling joint tortfeasor. CJ \u00a7 3-1405(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> UCATA thus allows a defendant in a tort action to settle its liability with the plaintiff in a way that eliminates any'future obligation of the defendant to make contribution to other defendants who choose to litigate liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">This seems straightforward enough. But, virtually by definition, settlements occur before liability is adjudicated. Whether a settling party is in fact a joint tort-feasor may be unclear and UCATA\u2019s rules on contribution require further explication, as exemplified in the <em>Swigert </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\n<em>Swigert</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In <em>Swigert, </em>this Court held that the release given by the Plaintiff (Newport) to the Released Defendant (Welk) would not be effective to reduce the Litigating Defendant\u2019s (Swigert\u2019s) liability pursuant to the pro rata reduction under UCATA (now codified in CJ \u00a7 3-1405) until the Released Defendant (Welk) was adjudicated a tort-feasor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>If the Released Defendant in <em>Swigert </em>was subsequently adjudicated a tort-feasor, the Litigating Defendant\u2019s liability would accordingly be reduced pro rata under UCATA; the Released Defendant would owe nothing more to the Plaintiff (the settlement had resolved that) or to the Litigating Defendant in contribution (per CJ \u00a7 3-1405).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">If the Released Defendant was adjudicated not to be a joint tort-feasor, the Released Defendant would be a \u201cvolunteer\u201d, the Litigating Defendant\u2019s liability would not be reduced as a result of Released Defendant\u2019s settlement, and the Released Defendant would owe nothing more to either Plaintiff (again, the settlement had resolved that question) or the Litigating Defendant (contribution under UCATA may only be obtained from joint tortfeasors \u2014 CJ \u00a7 3-1402).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In either case, there would be no further recovery against the Released Defendant. The party at risk in the subsequent adjudication was the Plaintiff. If the Released Defendant was determined to be a joint tort-feasor, any judgment the Plaintiff obtained against the Litigating Defendant would be reduced; if the Released Defendant was not a joint tort-feasor, there would be no reduction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\n<em>The Majority Opinion in the Present Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In the present case, our opinion concludes that the contribution action may proceed, but is at best ambiguous on the consequences of that decision. Our opinion raises, but does not answer, the following questions: Does it matter, for purposes of CJ \u00a7 3-1405, whether a Released Defendant is determined to be a joint tort-feasor in a separate contribution action as opposed to the main action? Are we limiting or perhaps even overruling Swigert?</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Our opinion notes, correctly I think, that a contribution claim may be brought in the original action or as a separate action. Op. at pp. 374-78, 56 A.3d at 162-65. But what does this mean with respect to a Released Defendant? <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Does it matter whether the Released Defendant is adjudicated a joint tort-feasor in the original action or in a separate action for the release to absolve the Released Defendant of liability for contribution?</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In both this case and in <em>Swigert, </em>the determination of the Released Defendant\u2019s status as a joint tort-feasor would occur only subsequent to the execution of the release. In <em>Swigert, </em>the subsequent adjudication of the Released Defendant\u2019s (Welk\u2019s) status as a joint tort-feasor would occur at some point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>in the main action as the Released Defendant had been impleaded by the Litigating Defendant (Swigert) as a third party defendant. Under our holding in this case, that determination will take place in a separate contribution action by the Litigating Defendant (Julian) against the Released Defendant (Mercy).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">In our opinion in the present case, we say that a Plaintiff <em>and </em>a Released Defendant take a \u201crisk\u201d in having the liability of the Released Defendant adjudicated \u2014 presumably an adjudication that happens after execution of the release, or it would not be a \u201crisk.\u201d Op. at p. 369, 56 A.3d at 159-60. But is the Released Defendant, as well as the Plaintiff, taking a \u201crisk\u201d in that adjudication? The same passage in our opinion suggests not \u2014 after analyzing the outcomes if the Released Defendant is adjudicated liable or not liable, at the conclusion of the same paragraph we say that the Released Defendant is not subject to recovery by either the Plaintiff or Litigating Defendants \u201cin both scenarios.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, it seems that we are saying that only the Plaintiff is taking a risk in submitting the Released Defendant\u2019s tort-feasor status to adjudication\u2014 presumably the risk that the Released Defendant will be adjudged a tort-feasor under UCATA, thus reducing the Plaintiffs recovery against the Litigating Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">This analysis suggests that a Released Defendant in the position of Mercy in this case faces no additional liability from the adjudication of its tort-feasor status, whether that adjudication takes place in the context of a third-party or cross claim in the main action (as in Swigert) or as a claim for contribution in a separate action (as in the present case).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>other hand, we could decide to limit the <em>Swigert </em>approach to cases in which the post-release adjudication of tort-feasor status occurs in the litigation of a third-party claim for contribution rather than a separate action for contribution. That in fact was one of the questions on which we granted certiorari.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But our opinion now declines to answer it (other than implicitly in the paragraph described above).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aji\">\n<em>The Need to Make a Choice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">In urging us to choose one rule over the other the parties have conjured competing pictures of adverse consequences. Mercy projects that a ruling that Julian may recover money damages from it in the contribution action will encourage piecemeal litigation and undermine what it characterizes as UCATA\u2019s goals of encouraging settlements and judicial efficiency. Julian counters that, if the determination whether the Released Defendant is in fact a joint tort-feasor must take place in the main action, it would inevitably distort the truth-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>finding process and confuse the jury: the Plaintiff would have no incentive to prove the culpability of the Released Defendant while the Litigating Defendant would be placed in the untenable position of simultaneously defending its own conduct while also seeking to prove the culpability of the Released Defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">No doubt the parties to medical malpractice and other tort litigation will accommodate their practices to whatever rule we ultimately adopt for the effect of particular types of releases under UCATA. It is important, nonetheless, that we make whatever rule we adopt clear so that they may make that accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">It is sometimes not so important what rule is adopted as that some rule is clearly adopted. For example, there is no moral imperative that directs the choice between requiring drivers to stay to the right side of the road or to stay to the left. But the choice must be clearly made. If not, even the best engineered road will experience head-on collisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge HARRELL join in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-8\">. 213 Md. 613, 133 A.2d 428 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\">. The release must also be given before the right of the other joint tortfeasor to obtain a money judgment for contribution <em>arises </em>\u2014 i.e., before the joint tort-feasor seeking contribution has paid the common liability, or at least more than the payor's pro rata share. CJ \u00a7 3-1405(1); CJ \u00a7 3-1402(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\">. To keep the positions of the various players under UCATA in focus, for the remainder of this opinion I will use the term Released Defendant to identify the allegedly culpable party that enters into a settlement with the Plaintiff and obtains a release that purports to protect that party from liability under UCATA for contribution to other joint tortfeasors. Under this definition, a Released Defendant, of course, may or may not' ever formally be a defendant in the litigation and may or may not ultimately be determined to be a joint tort-feasor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">I will use the term Litigating Defendant to denote an allegedly culpable party that does not enter into a settlement or obtain a release from the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b421-6\">. Maryland adopted the 1939 version of UCATA, as did seven other states. Chapter 344, Laws of Maryland 1941. It is notable that, in 1955, the Uniform Laws Commissioners withdrew the 1939 version of the model law and substituted a revised version. In doing so, the commissioners noted that \u00a7 5 of the 1939 UCATA, which is the basis for CJ \u00a7 3-1405, \u201chas been one of the chief causes of complaint where [1939 UCATA] has been adopted, and one of the main objections to its adoption.\u201d 12 Uniform Laws Annotated, 1955 UCATA, \u00a7 4, <em>comment </em>at p. 285. The commissioners substituted a new section that combined old \u00a7 4 \u2014 the basis for CJ \u00a7 3-1404 \u2014 and \u00a7 5 of 1939 UCATA into one section and eliminated the requirement that a release provide for a <em>pro rata </em>reduction in any judgment in order to extinguish a Released Defendant\u2019s liability for contribution. No state has adopted the 1939 version of UCATA for more than 60 years. As a result, there is a relatively little law from other jurisdictions interpreting \u00a7 5 of the 1939 version of UCATA. In <em>Swigert, </em>Maryland, like two other states, followed the approach of a Pennsylvania decision that required an adjudication or admission of the Released Defendant's tort-feasor status, at least for purposes of reducing a judgment pursuant to \u00a7 4 of 1939 UCATA. <em>Davis v. Miller, </em>385 Pa. 348, 123 A.2d 422 (1956); <em>see also Scalf v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>Payne, </em>266 Ark. 231, 583 S.W.2d 51 (1979); <em>Medical Center of Delaware v.

Two federal courts, in applying Maryland law and dismissing or granting summary judgment with respect to claims for contribution, have concluded that execution of a <em>Swigert </em>release absolves the Released Defendant of liability for contribution. <em>Adams v. NVR Homes, Inc., </em>135 F.Supp.2d 675, 708-11 (D.Md.2001) (granting summary judgment to released defendants as to cross-claim for contribution on ground that right of contribution against alleged joint tort-feasors had been \"extinguished\u201d as a result of <em>Swigert </em>release prior to any adjudication of the released party\u2019s tort-feasor status); <em>Montgomery County v. Jaffe, Raitt, Heuer &amp; Weiss, P.C., </em>897 F.Supp. 233, 239 (D.Md.1995) (holding that \"the statutory terms imposing a bar against contribution\u201d had been met in a <em>Swigert </em>release and that, as a result, a litigating defendant had \"no right of contribution\u201d against the settling defendants and therefore could not implead them \u2014 again before adjudication of tort-feasor status). The majority opinion acknowledges that the two federal cases accurately quote CJ \u00a7 3-1405, but does not attempt to distinguish them, although those cases each reach a conclusion quite different from the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b423-6\">. A primary issue in a contribution action involving a Released Defendant presumably is whether the Released Defendant is in fact a joint tort-feasor. If not, the Released Defendant cannot be liable for contribution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\">. Under that analysis, the release in the present case is similar to the release in <em>Swigert </em>in that it does not acknowledge the Released Defendant\u2019s status as a tort-feasor, but allows for a pro rata reduction if that determination is made in the future. Here, if Mercy (the Released Defendant) is subsequently adjudicated a tort-feasor in the contribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>action, the release becomes effective to reduce Julian's (the Litigating Defendant\u2019s) liability pro rata and Mercy should owe nothing more. If Mercy is found not to be a joint tort-feasor, it is a \"volunteer\u201d, Julian owes the judgment, and Mercy still owes nothing more to either plaintiffs or Julian.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b425-15\">. If the choice were left to me, I would opt for judicial economy and trust our trial judges to manage litigation to avoid potentially collusive trials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\">. We granted Mercy's petition for certiorari, which included the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">If a joint tort-feasor may pursue a post-judgment action for contribution against a party released by a \"Swigert\" <em>pro rata </em>release, may he recover money damages from the \"Swigert\u201d defendant, or is the remedy limited to a reduction of the judgment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">424 Md. 628, 37 A.3d 317 (2012). This is essentially the question whether a post-release adjudication of the Released Defendant\u2019s joint tort-feasor status in a contribution action has the same effect as a post-release adjudication of that status in a third party claim or cross claim \u2014 the <em>Swigert </em>situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b424-9\">. Our reason for declining to address this question explicitly is that it calls for an advisory opinion. Op. at p. 379 n. 17, 56 A.3d at 165 n. 17. Yet we can provide an answer that is no more advisory than this Court's holding in <em>Swigert </em>that the release in that case would result in a reduction of a future judgment for the Plaintiff if the Released Defendant were later determined to be a joint tort-feasor. <em>Swigert, </em>213 Md. at 619, 133 A.2d 428. Moreover, for the reasons explained in the text, it appears to be the key question posed by these consolidated cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
