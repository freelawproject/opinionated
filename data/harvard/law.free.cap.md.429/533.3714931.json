The seemingly<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> peripheral issue is who decides this question initially: the arbitrator or the court. An additional consideration lurking beneath the surface of these two questions, but necessary to their resolution, is when a dispute may be said to arise \u201cunder\u201d an expired agreement so as to be arbitrable despite the agreement\u2019s expiration.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">We now place these concepts into the context of this case. A collective-bargaining agreement between Baltimore County and Baltimore County Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 4 (\u201cFOP\u201d) contained an arbitration clause and a retiree health-insurance provision. FOP believed the provision locked in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>place the health-insurance subsidy, as it existed at the time of an officer\u2019s retirement. After the agreement expired and the County decreased the health-insurance subsidy, FOP initiated arbitration. The County protested, arguing that it had no duty to arbitrate because the collective-bargaining agreement had expired. The County also maintained that the health-insurance subsidy was not locked in place but was subject to change from year to year. FOP was successful in arbitration and on appeal before the circuit court, but the Court of Special Appeals vacated the arbitration award. FOP presents the following issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\">1. Under Maryland\u2019s common law, should an arbitration clause in a collective bargaining agreement be enforced after that agreement\u2019s expiration when an otherwise arbitrable grievance is presented concerning vested rights that arise out of the collective bargaining agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">2. Does the common law of Maryland require the court or the arbitrator to determine the arbitrability of a postexpiration grievance arising out of a collective bargaining agreement containing an arbitration clause?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">We shall hold that an arbitration clause may survive the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement when it concerns rights that vested during the life of the agreement. We shall also hold that, when deciding the issue of arbitrability requires interpretation of the underlying agreement and consideration of the merits of the dispute, the issue of arbitrability should be initially determined by the arbitrator. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County properly granted summary judgment in FOP\u2019s favor. We thus reverse the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Baltimore County government employs approximately 8,000 employees. FOP has represented the County\u2019s 1,700 police officers for approximately 20 years. The County and FOP have been parties to a succession of one-year<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> collective bargaining agreements, called memoranda of understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d). These MOUs set forth the negotiated terms of conditions of employment for active and retired police officers. All MOUs contained an article on the grievance procedure, which provided \u2014 among other things \u2014 that all \u201cgrievances,\u201d including \u201c[a]ny dispute concerning the application or interpretation of the terms of this [MOU]\u201d that are not settled internally \u201cshall be subject to binding arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\n<em>1992 Through 1995: No Mention of Health Insurance in MOUs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">In 1991, Baltimore County instituted a Retirement Incentive Program. As part of the Program, the County agreed to pay 90 percent of retirees\u2019 health insurance premium, while the retirees would pay the remaining 10 percent. Maintenance of this 90/10 split, however, was guaranteed only to officers who retired on or before January 31, 1992. The Incentive Program also made clear that employees retiring on or after February 1, 1992 would receive the same subsidy as active employees and that the subsidy could go up or down subject to future labor negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">From February 1, 1992 to July 1, 1995, the MOUs made no reference to retiree health insurance. Officers who retired during that time received the same health-insurance premium split that active officers were receiving at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">\n<em>1995 Through June 30, 2007: Retiree Health Insurance Provision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">This changed with the 1995 negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement, when FOP was able to negotiate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>following health-insurance provision to be included in the MOU:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">Section 7.13: Retiree Health Insurance-The County shall provide the same health insurance benefits ... to retirees under the age of sixty-five (65) as it does for active employees, at the time ... the employees retire[ ]. The health insurance subsidy at the time of retirement will remain in effect until the retiree or the retiree\u2019s surviving beneficiary reaches age sixty-five (65).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">This language remained in subsequent MOUs until 2004,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> when the reference to \u201cage sixty-five\u201d was changed to eligibility for \u201cMedicare\u201d: \u201cThe health insurance subsidy in place at the time of retirement shall remain in effect until the retiree becomes eligible for Medicare.\u201d Between February 1, 1992 and June 30, 2007, the health-insurance subsidy for active employees \u2014 and therefore retirees \u2014 remained at 85 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\n<em>2007 Decrease in Health-Insurance Subsidy and FOP\u2019s Grievance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In 2007, as part of its effort \u201cto control escalating health care costs for County employees,\u201d the County negotiated a phased-in decrease in the health-insurance premium subsidy from 85 to 80 percent, which was to take effect gradually over the next five years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On July 1, 2007, the County decreased the health-insurance premium split from 85/15 to 84/16 for retirees, as well active members.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>On September 14, the FOP filed a class grievance<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on behalf of the officers who retired from February 1, 1992 to August 31, 2007, alleging that the 85/15 health-insurance subsidy split was a \u201clifetime promise\u201d to those retirees, and that, as a result, those retirees were not subject to the decreased premium split.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On November 6, 2007, Labor Commissioner George Gay conducted a Grievance Appeal Hearing, and on November 17, he denied FOP\u2019s grievance. Gay believed that MOUs are \u201cone-year agreements which are re-opened and renegotiated annually,\u201d and which, unlike pension benefits, do not create \u201cvested rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">FOP filed for arbitration. The arbitrator granted FOP\u2019s grievance, concluding that it was arbitrable even though the MOU had expired because the 85/15 health-insurance premium split was a \u201cvested right\u201d that \u201cwas not, and could not be, changed by the [subsequent] negotiations.\u201d Thus, the arbitrator ordered that the County (1) rescind the modification as applied to police officers who retired from 1995 to June 30, 2007, (2) continue the 85/15 split until those retirees became eligible for Medicare, and (3) reimburse them for wrongful deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The County filed a Complaint to Vacate the Arbitration Award in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. It argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction and exceeded his authority because the MOU containing the arbitration clause had expired, (2) \u201cthere was no agreement to arbitrate\u201d because the MOU had expired, and (3) the award \u201cinvolve[d] mistakes so gross as to constitute manifest injustice.\u201d The Circuit Court disagreed, however, and granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>summary judgment in FOP\u2019s favor, refusing to vacate the Arbitration Award.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The County appealed. The Court of Special Appeals reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in FOP\u2019s favor,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and FOP filed a petition for certiorari, which we granted. <em>Balt Cnty. Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge No. 4 v. Balt. Cnty., </em>425 Md. 395, 41 A.3d 570 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The first issue before us is whether an arbitration clause contained in an expired MOU survived the expiration of that MOU, making the dispute over the health-insurance premium split arbitrable. FOP argues that \u2014 even though the MOU expired \u2014 the County\u2019s decrease in health-insurance subsidy was an arbitrable grievance because \u201cabsent specific contractual evidence to the contrary, [a broad] arbitration clause survives expiration of the agreement and requires that disputes arising out of it, but after expiration of, the underlying agreement are arbitrable.\u201d The County argues the opposite: the arbitration clause was narrow, \u201cFOP\u2019s grievance was based upon an MOU that no longer existed,\u201d and therefore the arbitrator had \u201cno power, authority, or jurisdiction\u201d to resolve the dispute. The parties also ask us to decide who determines this very issue: the arbitrator or the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Arbitrability of a Grievance Arising After Expiration of a Collective-Bargaining Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">In deciding whether an arbitration clause may survive expiration of the agreement that gave it existence, the arbitrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>in this case relied extensively on two United States Supreme Court cases: <em>Nolde Bros. v. Bakery &amp; Confectionery Workers Union, </em>430 U.S. 243, 97 S.Ct. 1067, 51 L.Ed.2d 300 (1977) and <em>Litton Fin. Printing Div. v. NLRB, </em>501 U.S. 190, 111 S.Ct. 2215, 115 L.Ed.2d 177 (1991). FOP and the County have also spent a considerable amount of time in their briefs discussing these cases. We accept the parties\u2019 invitation and examine <em>Nolde </em>and <em>Litton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">\n<em>A. The Vesting Principles of Nolde and Litton</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Both <em>Nolde </em>and <em>Litton </em>addressed arbitrability of a grievance arising after expiration of a collective-bargaining agreement. In <em>Nolde, </em>the agreement had a broad arbitration clause and provided for severance pay upon employment termination. 430 U.S. at 245, 97 S.Ct. at 1068-69. After the agreement\u2019s expiration, the bakery closed and refused to pay any severance. It maintained that \u201csince severance pay was a creation of the collective-bargaining agreement, its substantive obligation to provide such benefits terminated with the Union\u2019s unilateral cancellation of the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 97 S.Ct. at 1071. The bakery also resisted arbitration, arguing that \u201cthe duty to arbitrate ... must necessarily expire with the collective-bargaining contract that brought it into existence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250, 97 S.Ct. at 1071. The Supreme Court disagreed: the \u201ctermination of a collective-bargaining agreement [does not] automatically extinguish^] a party\u2019s duty to arbitrate grievances arising under the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251, 97 S.Ct. at 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">If that were true, the Court explained, there could be no arbitration of a dispute that \u201carose during the life of the contract but arbitration proceedings had not begun before termination\u201d or if \u201carbitration processes began but were not completed, during the contract\u2019s term.\u201d <em>Id., </em>97 S.Ct. at 1072. Yet, in both of these instances, \u201cthe parties\u2019 contractual obligation to resolve such a dispute in an arbitral, rather than a judicial forum\u201d would continue to exist even after the contract\u2019s expiration. <em>Id. </em>Thus, even though the dispute arose <em>\u201cafter\u201d </em>the contract\u2019s expiration, because the parties\u2019 arguments were \u201cbased on their differing perceptions of a [con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>tract\u2019s] provision,\u201d the dispute arose <em>\u201cunder\u201d </em>that contract, and as such, was arbitrable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 249, 255, 97 S.Ct. at 1071, 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Almost two decades later, in <em>Litton, </em>the Court reaffirmed that \u201c[w]e presume as a matter of contract interpretation that the parties did not intend a pivotal dispute resolution provision to terminate for all purposes upon the expiration of the agreement.\u201d 501 U.S. at 208, 111 S.Ct. at 2226. The Court further delineated three circumstances in which a post-expiration grievance may be considered to arise under the expired contract: (1) where the grievance \u201cinvolves facts and occurrences that arose before expiration, [2] where an action taken after expiration infringes a right that accrued or vested under the agreement, or [3] where, under normal principles of contract interpretation, the disputed contractual right survives expiration of the remainder of the agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, 111 S.Ct. at 2225.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">\n<em>B. The Applicability of the Nolde/Litton Vesting Principles in Maryland</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">FOP urges us to adopt <em>Nolde\u2019s </em>reasoning, arguing that <em>Nolde </em>is directly on point and in accordance with our decisions and the decisions of other Maryland courts. It maintains that adopting <em>Nolde\u2019s </em>vesting principles would be consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>our treatment of broad arbitration clauses as encompassing any and all disputes not specifically excluded, <em>NSC Contractors, Inc. v. Borders, </em>317 Md. 394, 403, 564 A.2d 408, 412 (1989), and as severable from the rest of the agreement, <em>Holmes v. Coverall N. Am., </em>336 Md. 534, 547, 649 A.2d 365, 371 (1994). FOP also directs our attention to several cases in which this Court and the Court of Special Appeals have looked for guidance to federal courts in arbitration cases, including <em>NSC Contractors, </em>317 Md. at 403, 564 A.2d at 412, <em>Gold Coast Mall v. Larmar Corp., </em>298 Md. 96, 104-05, 468 A.2d 91, 95-96 (1983), and <em>Mayor of Balt. v. Balt. City Fire Fighters, Local 734, </em>49 Md.App. 60, 65, 430 A.2d 99, 102 (1981). Moreover, FOP provides a table with over a dozen cases from other states relying on <em>Nolde </em>to hold that disputes arising after an agreement\u2019s expiration but arising under it may be arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">On the contrary, the County argues that we should not adopt <em>Nolde, </em>challenging <em>Nolde\u2019s </em>applicability and insisting that <em>Nolde </em>\u201cis simply not good law,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that \u201cits holding is imprecise and embraces ... disparate, inconsistent propositions.\u201d The County contends \u201c[t]here is a sufficient body of Maryland common law\u201d on the interpretation of arbitration agreements. It also maintains that <em>Nolde </em>and <em>Litton </em>are not applicable here because they involved the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(2) (\u201cNLRA\u201d), from which labor relations between local governments and their employees are excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>We find the County\u2019s arguments unconvincing. We are aware of no Maryland case applying Maryland law in a situation like this, where the agreement containing an arbitration clause has expired, but a party seeks to arbitrate a dispute it alleges arises under that agreement. <em>Nolde </em>and <em>Litton, </em>however, provide clear guidance on this issue. Also, even though <em>Nolde </em>and <em>Litton, </em>involved NLRA, that fact did not play a role in the Court\u2019s reasoning in either of the two cases. The applicability of <em>Nolde </em>and <em>Litton\u2019s </em>vesting principles to disputes not involving NLRA is further evidenced by the acceptance of the Court\u2019s reasoning in these two cases by many state courts. <em>See, e.g., Ahtna, Inc. v. Ebasco Constructors, Inc., </em>894 P.2d 657, 663 (Alaska 1995) (applying the <em>Nolde </em>vesting principle in the context of a joint-venture agreement); <em>Ajida, Techs., Inc. v. Roos Instruments, Inc., </em>87 Cal.App.4th 534, 104 Cal.Rptr.2d 686, 694-95 (2001) (relying on <em>Nolde </em>in holding that parties\u2019 obligations to arbitrate may survive expiration of a marketing and development agreement); <em>Shams v. Howard, </em>165 P.3d 876, 879 (Colo.App.2007) (applying <em>Litton\u2019s </em>vesting principles to the vesting of rights under an expired warranty agreement); <em>Auchter Co. v. Zagloul, </em>949 So.2d 1189, 1194 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2007) (following the guidance of <em>Nolde </em>and <em>Litton </em>in deciding arbitrability of a dispute arising under an expired construction contract); <em>Homes by Pate, Inc. v. DeHaan, </em>713 N.E.2d 303, 309 (Ind.Ct.App.1999)(relying on <em>Nolde </em>in holding that \u201ca logical reading of the [residential building] warranty leads to the conclusion that, so long as a defect has occurred within the ... warranty coverage, any dispute concerning that coverage must be arbitrated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Indeed, the Massachusetts high court has applied the <em>Nolde </em>vesting principles in a situation very similar to this case. <em>See Boston Lodge 261, Dist. 38, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 389 </em>Mass. 819, 452 N.E.2d 1155 (1983). In <em>Boston Lodge 261, </em>the collective-bargaining agreement between the union and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (\u201cMBTA\u201d) called for cost-of-living adjustments benefitting union members. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>1156. The same agreement also provided for binding arbitration of any disputes arising under the agreement. <em>Id. </em>When the agreement expired and MBTA failed to make the adjustments, the union initiated arbitration. MBTA refused to arbitrate, arguing that the dispute was not arbitrable because the collective bargaining agreement had expired. <em>Id. </em>Relying on <em>Nolde, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that the dispute was arbitrable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">Although the term of the collective bargaining agreement had ended, there continued both a contractual obligation to make cost-of-living adjustments under certain conditions and an agreement to arbitrate any unresolved grievance arising out of the agreement. The fact that the term of a collective bargaining agreement has expired does not mean there can be no duty to arbitrate issues arising out of that agreement, where the agreement includes obligations extending beyond its term and where there is a broadly expressed agreement to arbitrate grievances arising out of that agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citing, among others, <em>Nolde, </em>430 U.S. at 254-55, 97 S.Ct. at 1073-74).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Following in the footsteps of our sister states, we adopt the <em>Nolde/Litton </em>vesting principles and hold that a broad arbitration clause may survive expiration of the underlying agreement when the dispute arises under the agreement. This may happen when the dispute (1) \u201cinvolves facts and occurrences that arose before expiration\u201d of the agreement, (2) where the rights that are the subject of the dispute \u201caccrued or vested\u201d during the life of the agreement, or (3) \u201cwhere, under normal principles of contract interpretation, the disputed contractual right survives expiration of the remainder of the agreement.\u201d <em>Litton, </em>501 U.S. at 206, 111 S.Ct. at 2225.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Our acceptance of the <em>Nolde </em>and <em>Litton </em>vesting principles in this situation is not inconsistent with our reliance on the Supreme Court for guidance in other arbitration cases, many of which are interlaced with the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>In addition to the Maryland cases cited by FOP, reproduced above, we have followed the lead of the Supreme Court in <em>Holmes, </em>when we held an arbitration clause to be severable from the rest of the contract, 336 Md. at 541-42, 649 A.2d at 368 (quoting Prima <em>Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967)); in <em>Curtis G. Testerman Co. v. Buck, </em>when we concluded that a non-party to an arbitration agreement may not be compelled to arbitrate, 340 Md. 569, 584, 667 A.2d 649, 656 (1995) (citing <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Const. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 20, 103 S.Ct. 927, 939, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983)); and in <em>Messersmith, Inc. v. Barclay Townhouse, </em>when we held that the issue of whether there was an agreement to arbitrate was to be decided by the court, not the arbitrator, 313 Md. 652, 661 &amp; n. 3, 547 A.2d 1048, 1052 &amp; n. 3 (1988) (citing <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.v.

Under <em>Nolde, </em>to determine that a dispute is arbitrable, the court only needs to recognize \u2014 -without deciding \u2014 that the merits of the dispute depend on the interpretation of the agreement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See </em>430 U.S. at 249, 97 S.Ct. at 1071. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>But the ultimate \u201cquestion of interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is a question for the arbitrator.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 430 U.S. at 253, 97 S.Ct. at 1073 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">In contrast, the <em>Litton </em>Court held that courts \u201cmust determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate this dispute, and we cannot avoid that duty because it requires us to interpret a provision of a bargaining agreement.\u201d 501 U.S. at 209, 111 S.Ct. at 2227.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Considering ample Maryland authority on the issue of who decides whether a dispute is arbitrable, we find it unnecessary to attempt to resolve the conflict between <em>Nolde </em>and Litton<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or adopt reasoning of either of the two cases, and instead look to our own jurisprudence for guidance on who \u2014 the arbitrator or the court \u2014 decides arbitrability of a dispute allegedly aris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>ing under an expired agreement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\"><em>A. Arbitrability </em>As <em>a Threshold Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We begin this part of the analysis by reiterating that in Maryland arbitration has often been referred to as a \u201cfavored\u201d method of resolving disputes, as it is considered \u201cgenerally a less expensive and more expeditious means of settling litigation and relieving docket congestion.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Walther v. Sovereign Bank, </em>386 Md. 412, 425, 872 A.2d 735, 743 (2005). In accordance with the public policy favoring arbitration, the courts\u2019 role in the arbitration process \u2014 whether ruling on motions seeking to compel or stay arbitration or reviewing arbitration awards \u2014 is limited. Indeed, before a court can set aside an arbitration award, there must be \u201cfraud or ... misconduct, bias, prejudice, corruption or lack of good faith on the part of the arbitrator,\u201d or if \u201cit was not within the scope of the issues submitted to arbitration,\u201d or involved a \u201cmistake so gross as to work manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Bd. of Ed. v.

Courts have a prerogative in that instance \u201cbecause the existence of an agreement to arbitrate is a threshold issue, [and] the courts must have authority to assess, independently of the arbitrator\u2019s point of view, whether or not the parties ever reached such an agreement.\u201d <em>Messersmith, Inc., </em>313 Md. at 660, 547 A.2d at 1052. As this Court noted more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>than sixty years ago, \u201c[t]he question [of arbitrability] is one of intention.... No one is under a duty to resort to [arbitration] tribunals, however helpful their processes, except to the extent that he has signified his willingness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658, 547 A.2d at 1051 (quoting <em>Cont\u2019l Milling &amp; Feed Co. v.

When Arbitrability and Merits Overlap</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Avoiding the merits of the dispute or the underlying agreement becomes more difficult in cases where the very arbitrability of the dispute overlaps with its merits. This may happen (1) when the parties have agreed to arbitrate, but the scope of the arbitration clause is unclear, making it necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>to interpret the entire contract, <em>Gold Coast Mall, </em>298 Md. at 107-08, 468 A.2d at 97; or (2) when a party challenges the validity of an arbitration clause based on some irregularity of the entire contract, which also requires inquiring into the merits of the dispute, <em>Holmes, </em>336 Md. at 534, 649 A.2d at 365. These types of arbitrability challenges may involve \u201cissues arising after the formation of the arbitration agreement, ... such as rescission, fraud in the inducement, waiver, and termination of the contract.\u201d <em>Id., </em>649 A.2d at 368. In those circumstances, \u201cfwjhether the party seeking arbitration is right or wrong is a question of contract application and interpretation for the arbitrator, not the court, ... and the court should not deprive the party seeking arbitration of the arbitrator\u2019s skilled judgment by attempting to resolve the ambiguity.\u201d <em>NRT Mid-Atl., Inc. v. Innovative Props., Inc., 144 </em>Md.App. 263, 281, 797 A.2d 824, 834 (2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">We have distinguished arbitrability issues that require interpretation of the entire contract from those that do not depend on the merits of the dispute in <em>Gold Coast Mall, </em>where the lease agreement contained conflicting language. 298 Md. at 100, 468 A.2d at 93. On the one hand, there was a broad arbitration clause requiring the parties to arbitrate any disputes arising out of the contract; on the other hand, other clauses in the contract provided the landlord with rights and remedies other than arbitration. <em>Id. </em>Appreciating the difficulty of deciding arbitrability under those facts, we identified three sets of circumstances involving arbitrability issues and explained their proper treatment by the courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">Where the language of the arbitration clause is clear, and it is plain that the dispute sought to be arbitrated falls within the scope of the arbitration clause, arbitration should be compelled. If it is apparent, on the other hand, that the issue sought to be arbitrated lies beyond the scope of the arbitration clause, the opposing party should not be compelled to arbitration, since there is no agreement to arbitrate .... A problem is created for the court when the language of the arbitration clause is unclear as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the subject matter of the dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement. Courts that have considered this problem have recognized that under such circumstances the question of substantive arbitrability initially should be left to the decision of the arbitrator, not the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 104-05, 468 A.2d at 95-96 (citing a long line of cases from other states). Unable to resolve the arbitrability issue without considering the lease agreement as a whole, we held that the \u201cquestion of substantive arbitrability should be left to the decision of the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108, 468 A.2d at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">We took the same approach in <em>Holmes, </em>336 Md. 534, 649 A.2d 365. There, a franchisee attempted to avoid arbitration, alleging fraudulent inducement and violations of the Franchise Act in an agreement with a broad arbitration clause. <em>Id. </em>at 537, 541, 649 A.2d at 366-67, 368. Stressing the difference between \u201cthe issue of the validity of an arbitration agreement in a contract\u201d and \u201cthe merits of a dispute under such a contract,\u201d we observed that the franchisee did not allege that he \u201cwas fraudulently induced into agreeing to arbitrate disputes or that the parties did not agree to arbitrate this type of dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545-46, 649 A.2d at 370-71. Rather, we emphasized, the allegations of fraudulent inducement \u201cgo to the validity of the contract as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546, 649 A.2d at 371. As such, \u201c[tjhese claims run to the merits of the dispute between the parties and do not suggest a \u2018substantial and bona fide dispute\u2019 as to the actual existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded that because the party resisting arbitration \u201chas not alleged fraud in the inducement as to the arbitration clause itself or that the parties did not intend to arbitrate this type of a dispute, ... the underlying dispute is one for the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547, 649 A.2d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Our intermediate appellate court considered the overlap of the arbitrability issue with the merits of the underlying agreement under the circumstances even more similar to this case in <em>Nowak v. NAHB Research Center, Inc., </em>157 Md.App. 24, 848 A.2d 705 (2004). There, former employees sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>stay arbitration of their employer\u2019s claims after termination of their employment. <em>Id. </em>at 30, 848 A.2d at 709. The employer relied on the arbitration clause in the employment agreements, which required that any \u201cdispute arising out of or relating to\u201d the contracts be subject to arbitration. <em>Id. </em>at 28, 848 A.2d at 708. The employees argued, however, that their duty to arbitrate under the contract expired upon termination of their employment. Finding such arguments to implicate the merits of the case, the Court of Special Appeals refused to decide the arbitrability issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">[I]t is clear that a mutually agreed upon arbitration provision existed in the Contract.... Rather, [employees] argue that the arbitration agreement ... was no longer valid once they were terminated as employees.... [T]his argument clearly goes to the merits of the contract as a whole and is a question for the arbitrator to decide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 34, 848 A.2d at 711. Thus, while \u201cthe validity of an arbitration agreement\u201d is an issue for the courts, which a circuit court reviews anew, \u201cthe merits of the contract itself\u2019 are for the arbitrator\u2019s consideration, subject only to a deferential standard of review. <em>Id. </em>at 33-34, 848 A.2d at 711; <em>see also Holmes, </em>336 Md. at 534, 649 A.2d at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">\n<em>C. The Arbitrability of FOP\u2019s Grievance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the arbitrability issue in this case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If one could decide that FOP\u2019s grievance was arbitrable without interpreting the underlying MOU or addressing the merits of FOP\u2019s claims, the arbitrability issue in this case was an issue for the court to decide initially. But if the arbitrability issue cannot be so decided, it was within the arbitrator\u2019s purview.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>The arbitration clause here was part of the 2006-2007 MOU. It defined as a \u201cgrievance\u201d \u201c[a]ny dispute concerning the application or interpretation of the terms of [the MOU]\u201d and subjected to \u201cbinding arbitration\u201d any \u201cgrievance\u201d that was not settled through other internal mechanisms. The same MOU that contained the arbitration clause also stated that \u201c[t]he County shall provide the same health insurance benefit plans offered to active employees for retirees not eligible for Medicare---- The health insurance subsidy in place at the time of retirement shall remain in effect until the retiree becomes eligible for Medicare.\u201d The MOU expired on June 30, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Before the arbitrator, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Special Appeals, the County painted a black and white picture of the arbitrability \u2014 or, rather, non-arbitrability \u2014 of FOP\u2019s grievance, arguing that the MOU\u2019s expiration rendered inapplicable the arbitration clause.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As far as the County was concerned, FOP had \u201cnothing to arbitrate because [it] ha[d] no agreement, there was no agreement in existence at the time this grievance was filed.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>FOP responds that the arbitrability issue is not that simple. It contends that the MOU\u2019s expiration does not determine the arbitrability of its grievance, but that the arbitrability depends on whether the retiree health-care clause quoted above and other clauses \u201cin each of the MOUs governing retirements between 1992 and 2007 ... reflect binding and irrevocable promises by the County to provide the retiree health insurance subsidy in effect at the time of [the officers\u2019] retirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Although the County\u2019s approach to the arbitrability issue presents a clear-cut syllogism, it is based on a faulty premise. First, the arbitration clause in question subjected to arbitration \u201cany dispute concerning the application or interpretation of this Memorandum of Understanding.\u201d As this clause \u201ccall[ed] for the arbitration of ... any and all disputes arising out of the contract,\u201d it is a broad arbitration clause,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and generally, \u201c[w]here there is a broad arbitration clause, ... all issues are arbitrable unless expressly and specifically excluded.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Gold Coast Mall, </em>298 Md. at 104, 468 A.2d at 95; <em>accord NSC Contractors, Inc., </em>317 Md. at 403, 564 A.2d at 412; <em>Crown Oil &amp; Wax Co. of Del. v. Glen Constr. Co. of Va., </em>320 Md. 546, 560, 578 A.2d 1184, 1190 (1990). Since the arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>tion clause was not limited to disputes arising during the MOU\u2019s term, we reject the County\u2019s argument that the MOU\u2019s expiration necessarily abrogated this broad arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Second, the County\u2019s logic fails because it is well-established in Maryland that \u201can arbitration clause is a sever-able contract which is enforceable independently from the contract as a whole.\u201d <em>Cheek, </em>378 Md. at 165, 835 A.2d at 671-72 (quoting <em>Holmes, </em>336 Md. at 545, 649 A.2d at 370). Indeed, our prior cases illustrate that it is possible for an arbitration clause to be enforceable even though the contract that contains it may not be valid. <em>See Holmes, </em>336 Md. at 547, 649 A.2d at 371 (\u201cBy enforcing the arbitration agreement, we merely hold that the mutual promises to arbitrate constitute a separate agreement contained in the contract in question and that the arbitration clause itself is not in dispute. The validity of the contract as a whole is a question left for the arbitrators.\u201d); <em>see also Nowak, </em>157 Md.App. at 33-34, 848 A.2d at 711. Accordingly, even though the MOU had expired, the arbitration clause was not necessarily unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Quite the opposite, <em>Nolde </em>and <em>Litton </em>teach us that a dispute arising after the expiration of an agreement may be arbitrable if it arises under that agreement. <em>See Nolde, </em>430 U.S. at 249, 97 S.Ct. at 1071. Such a dispute will be arbitrable if (1) the grievance \u201cinvolves facts and occurrences that arose before expiration, [2] where an action taken after expiration infringes a right that accrued or vested under the agreement, or [3] where, under normal principles of contract interpretation, the disputed contractual right survives expiration of the remainder of the agreement.\u201d <em>Litton, </em>501 U.S. at 206, 111 S.Ct. at 2225.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Under the <em>Nolde </em>and <em>Litton </em>vesting principles, FOP\u2019s grievance is arbitrable if the rights that are the subject of FOP\u2019s grievance vested during the MOU\u2019s term. As FOP\u2019s arguments underscore, in its view, the health-insurance clauses contained in the respective MOUs \u201creflect binding and irrevocable promises by the County\u201d to maintain the 85/15 split, but in the County\u2019s view, they did not. Thus, as in <em>Nolde, </em>where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u201cthe resolution of [Nolde\u2019s] claim hinges on the interpretation ultimately given the contract clause providing for severance pay,\u201d 430 U.S. at 249, 97 S.Ct. at 1071, in this case \u201c[t]he parties\u2019 dispute regarding the vesting of retiree health benefits ... arises from conflicting interpretations of the retiree health care provision of the MOUs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Accordingly, in this case, whether the retirees\u2019 rights to the 85/15 split vested during the MOU\u2019s term provides both the answer to the arbitrability issue and the merits of FOP\u2019s grievance. If one determines that the retirees\u2019 rights vested, then in accordance with the <em>Nolde </em>and <em>Litton </em>vesting principles, one would have to determine that FOP\u2019s grievance was arbitrable. But if one decided that the retirees\u2019 rights did not vest, one would have to conclude that FOP\u2019s grievance was not arbitrable. This analysis, however, hinges on the interpretation of the MOU, and the outcome depends on the meaning of the health-insurance premium provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">As we discussed above, Maryland\u2019s arbitrability precedents prohibit courts from considering the merits of the dispute. <em>See Cheek </em>378 Md. at 154, 835 A.2d at 665 (refusing to \u201cstray[] into the prohibited morass of the merits of the claims\u201d); <em>Gold Coast Mall, </em>298 Md. at 100,104-05, 468 A.2d at 93, 95-96 (leaving the arbitrability issue to the arbitrator when \u201cthe language of the arbitration clause is unclear as to whether the subject matter of the dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement\u201d); <em>Holmes, </em>336 Md. at 546, 649 A.2d at 371 (the allegations of fraudulent inducement \u201cgo to the validity of the contract as a whole,\u201d and as such, \u201crun to the merits of the dispute between the parties and do not suggest a \u2018substantial and bona fide dispute\u2019 as to the actual existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties\u201d); <em>Nowak, </em>157 Md.App. at 34, 848 A.2d at 711 (\u201c[The] argument [that the agreement is no longer valid because employment was terminated] clearly goes to the merits of the contract as a whole and is a question for the arbitrator to decide.\u201d); <em>Balt. v. Balt. Fire Fighters, Local 734, I.A.F.F., </em>93 Md.App. 604, 613-14, 613 A.2d 1023, 1027-28 (1992) (\u201c[T]he essence of the City\u2019s argument on this point is that the Unions\u2019 claims are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>meritorious, <em>ie., </em>the Unions have not demonstrated any \u2018right\u2019 to the benefits they claim. This is an argument to be made to the arbitrator; it is not a consideration in determining whether a dispute is arbitrable.\u201d). Thus, because both the arbitrability and the merits of FOP\u2019s grievance depend on whether retirees\u2019 rights in the 85/15 health-insurance premium split vested prior to the MOU\u2019s expiration, we conclude that in this case the issue of whether FOP\u2019s grievance was arbitrable was an issue for the arbitrator to decide in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">This holding does not take away from the courts the authority to determine the threshold issue of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate their disputes. Courts are tasked with determining arbitrability issues to ensure that only parties who agreed to go to arbitration are compelled to do so. <em>Messersmith, Inc., </em>313 Md. at 652, 547 A.2d at 1052. In this case, the County and FOP have expressed their confidence in the arbitration process and indicated their preference for the arbitral, rather than judicial, forum by agreeing that \u201cany disputes\u201d not settled through a grievance procedure be subject to \u201cbinding arbitration.\u201d Although subsequently to that agreement to arbitrate, the underlying agreement expired, that fact has \u201clittle impact on many of the considerations behind [the parties\u2019] decision to resolve their contractual differences through arbitration\u201d in the first place. <em>Nolde, </em>430 U.S. at 254, 97 S.Ct. at 1073. Thus, our holding is limited to cases like this one, where we have a broad arbitration clause, and the arbitrability issue hinges on the interpretation of the underlying agreement and the merits of the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Summary Judgment in this Case</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">We finally turn to the Circuit Court\u2019s rulings in this case. The Circuit Court entered summary judgment in FOP\u2019s favor and against the County, finding that FOP\u2019s grievance was arbitrable and that FOP was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Before we analyze the court\u2019s rulings, however, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>take another detour and make clear what standard of review we must apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Neither in their briefs nor in oral arguments were the parties clear on what standard of review governs this case. FOP did not address this issue in its brief but at oral argument conceded that questions of substantive arbitrability, <em>i.e. </em>whether an agreement to arbitrate exists or whether an arbitration clause governs the dispute in question, are subject to a non-deferential standard of review. In contrast, issues that go to the merits of the dispute, such as whether the right to a certain health-insurance premium split is a \u201cvested\u201d right, are subject to a deferential standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The County advocated a different approach: it analogized the \u201creview\u201d of arbitration awards to judicial review of administrative decisions.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Citing a number of cases reviewing decisions of administrative agencies without explaining their relevance, the County maintained: \u201c|a]lthough the judicial act being appealed is the Circuit Court\u2019s Order granting summary judgment to FOP, this court should look not so much at the Circuit Court Order as through it to the July 15, 2008 Award of the Arbitrator.\u201d The County continued, \u201ca review on the ultimate merits is now being conducted by the appellate court. The court is not reviewing the procedural correctness of the earlier review by the circuit court. It is undertaking its own de novo review of the earlier administrative decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The parties\u2019 arguments are misplaced. It is true that most jurisdictional conclusions, <em>i.e. </em>that a dispute is arbitrable, are reserved for the courts in the first instance, and arbitrators\u2019 findings in that regard are typically subject to non-deferential review by a court. <em>Messersmith, Inc., </em>313 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>at 663, 547 A.2d at 1053. Moreover, when it comes to the merits of the parties\u2019 claims, \u201cmere errors of law or fact would not ordinarily furnish grounds for a court to vacate or to refuse enforcement of an arbitration award.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty. Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>309 Md. at 99, 522 A.2d at 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">But, as we have recently explained, \u201c[w]hen it comes to appellate procedure, ... the standard of review in either this Court or the Court of Special Appeals is determined by the circuit court\u2019s disposition of the matter.\u201d <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Fraternal Order of Police, </em>427 Md. 561, 571, 50 A.3d 579, 585 (2012). For example, in <em>Montgomery County, </em>one of our most recent cases involving arbitration, the circuit court reviewed the arbitrator\u2019s determination of arbitrability de novo, granting summary judgment on the matter. 427 Md. at 572, 50 A.3d at 585. When the dispute reached this Court, however, we did not review the arbitrator\u2019s determination anew but instead \u201creviewed] the circuit court\u2019s disposition for legal error,\u201d which is the proper standard of review for summary judgment dispositions.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Messing v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>373 Md. 672, 684, 821 A.2d 22, 28 (2003) (\u201cThe standard of review of a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment on the law is ... whether the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions were legally correct.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The same standard of review applies in this case. Our task is limited to ensuring that, in granting summary judgment in favor of FOP and against the County, the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Court\u2019s decision to leave undisturbed the arbitrator\u2019s findings was legally correct. In other words, we must make sure that FOP was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Wash. Homes, Inc. v. Interstate Land Dev. Co., </em>281 Md. 712, 717, 382 A.2d 555, 557 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">\n<em>B. The Circuit Court\u2019s Grant of Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Thus, the Circuit Court would be legally correct in granting summary judgment in FOP\u2019s favor, if (1) it reviewed the arbitrator\u2019s findings under a proper standard of review and (2) if FOP was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">As the arbitrability of FOP\u2019s grievance was a decision to be initially made by the arbitrator, that decision was subject to the same deferential standard of review as the arbitrator\u2019s findings on the merits. Thus, the Circuit Court needed to make sure that both the arbitrator\u2019s findings (1) that FOP\u2019s grievance was arbitrable and (2) that FOP was entitled to relief did not constitute a \u201cpalpable mistake of law or fact apparent on the face of the award or a mistake so gross as to work manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty. Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>309 Md. at 105, 522 A.2d at 941 (quotation marks omitted). Because the Circuit Court was unsure what standard to apply in reviewing the arbitrator\u2019s arbitrability finding, the Circuit Court subjected that finding to both a deferential and non-deferential standard of review. As for the award itself, the court \u201cawarded great deference\u201d to the arbitrator\u2019s findings. Accordingly, the Circuit Court applied a proper standard of review in both instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">We now look to the arbitrator\u2019s findings to determine whether the Circuit Court was legally correct in granting summary judgment in FOP\u2019s favor. The arbitrator began his opinion by acknowledging the County\u2019s argument about the supposedly preclusive effect of the MOU\u2019s expiration on the arbitrability of FOP\u2019s grievance. Relying on <em>Nolde </em>and <em>Litton, </em>the arbitrator responded to the County\u2019s challenge by stating that \u201c[t]he end of a labor contract, however, does not always signal the death of negotiated rights thereunder, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>eluding the right to have a dispute over that matter resolved through arbitration.\u201d The arbitrator then discussed <em>Nolde </em>and <em>Litton </em>for their vesting principles and concluded that \u201cthe ultimate question is whether the retiree rights at issue may be considered vested and thus capable of continuing enforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">In the arbitrator\u2019s view, the question of vesting \u201cis answered directly by the unequivocal language of the MOUs: The statement that \u2018the health insurance subsidy in place at the time of retirement shall remain in effect until the retiree becomes eligible for Medicare\u2019 is subject to no interpretation other than that here proposed by the FOP.\u201d He continued, \u201c[w]hen the parties bargained this language, they made a binding promise to retirees that the subsidy would remain at whatever level existed at their retirement. That is a vested right, and it was not, and could not be, changed by the [subsequent] negotiations.... \u201d The arbitrator concluded: \u201c[o]fficers who retired on or after February 1, 1992 and before July 1, 2007 have a vested right to retain the health insurance split applicable to them as active officers at the time of their retirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The County attacks the arbitrator\u2019s findings on several fronts. In addition to arguing against the application of <em>Nolde </em>and <em>Litton </em>to this case, the County suggests that the \u201cArbitrator acknowledged, but did not address, the County\u2019s argument that all obligations under the Agreement expired, including both the healthcare obligations and the independent obligation to arbitrate.\u201d According to the County, this alleged failure to consider whether the arbitration clause had expired gives basis to vacate the arbitration award not only for a palpable mistake in law, but also for failure \u201cto consider all matters submitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The County also argues that the healthcare subsidy was not a vested right. Here, the County asserts that \u201c[t]here is no \u2018vested right\u2019 to future health insurance benefits and subsidies in the expired FY 2007 MOU, based on evidence, long-standing practice, and applicable law.\u201d In support of this state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ment, the County mentions the Labor Commissioner\u2019s testimony, where he stated that \u201cthere is no vested right to health insurance benefits and there never has been such a right in Baltimore County.\u201d The County also points out that \u201cthere is no statutory requirement that County employees be provided with health care benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The County\u2019s arguments are unavailing. First, we agree with FOP that \u201cas a corollary to his express findings that the right had vested, and as a necessary precondition to his granting the grievance, the arbitrator necessarily determined that the arbitration clause was enforceable and that the grievance was arbitrable.\u201d The arbitrator\u2019s consideration of the arbitrability of the dispute and the merits of the case illustrates the interconnectedness of these two issues in cases where arbitrability depends on the interpretation of the underlying agreement. Having found that the retirees were entitled to the health-insurance premium split in effect at the time of their retirement, the arbitrator necessarily also found, by implication, that the arbitration clause survived the MOU\u2019s expiration, and the dispute was arbitrable. <em>See Nolde, </em>430 U.S. at 249, 97 S.Ct. at 1071 (\u201c[I]n determining the arbitrability of the dispute, the merits of the underlying claim for severance pay are not before us. However, it is clear that, whatever the outcome, the resolution of that claim hinges on the interpretation ultimately given the contract clause providing for severance pay.\u201d); <em>Litton, </em>501 U.S. at 205-06, 111 S.Ct. at 2225 (\u201cA postexpiration grievance can be said to arise under the contract only where it involves facts and occurrences that arose before expiration, where an action taken after expiration infringes a right that accrued or vested under the agreement, or where, under normal principles of contract interpretation, the disputed contractual right survives expiration of the remainder of the agreement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Second, like the Circuit Court, we see no reason to disturb the arbitrator\u2019s finding of vesting. The County\u2019s arguments on the lack of county employees\u2019 statutory entitlement to health care based on Commissioner Gay\u2019s testimony simply miss the point. The arbitrator found that the rights had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>vested based on his interpretation of the underlying MOU, which stated that \u201cthe health insurance subsidy in place at the time of retirement shall remain in effect until the retiree becomes eligible for Medicare.\u201d We do not think that the arbitrator\u2019s reading of this clause as a \u201cbinding promise\u201d constituted a \u201cmanifest disregard of the law\u201d or resulted in \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty. Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>309 Md. at 105, 522 A.2d at 941. On the contrary, we agree with the Circuit Court that the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of this language was consistent with the objective theory of contract interpretation that Maryland adheres to, under which courts give primary effect to the terms of the agreement. <em>Cochran v. Norkunas, </em>398 Md. 1, 16, 919 A.2d 700, 709 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">In any event, the arbitrator\u2019s findings are awarded a great deal of deference and should not be disturbed, unless the arbitrator demonstrates a \u201cmanifest disregard of the law ... beyond and different from a mere error in the law or failure on the part of the arbitrator[ ] to understand or apply the law.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty. Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>309 Md. at 102, 522 A.2d at 939. Since we see no such mistakes here, we conclude that the Circuit Court correctly determined that FOP was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Thus, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">We agree with the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to leave undisturbed the arbitrator\u2019s findings in this case. The fact that the MOU has expired does not mean the County had no duty to arbitrate disputes arising out of that MOU. A dispute may be arbitrable after the expiration of the underlying agreement, if the agreement contained a broad arbitration clause and the rights that are the subject of the dispute accrued or vested during the life of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The MOU\u2019s arbitration clause was broad. It did not exclude grievances arising after the expiration of the MOU but pertained to \u201c[a]ny dispute concerning the application or interpretation\u201d of the MOU. The arbitrator found that FOP\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>grievance was arbitrable even after the MOU\u2019s expiration because \u2014 based on the arbitrator\u2019s reading of the MOU\u2019s health-insurance clause \u2014 retirees\u2019 rights to an 85/15 health-insurance premium split had vested at the time of their retirement. The Circuit Court was legally correct in granting summary judgment in FOP\u2019s favor after subjecting the arbitrator\u2019s findings to a deferential standard of review. Thus, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-12\">.

Baltimore County Fraternal Order of Police (\u201cFOP\u201d) also poses a third question, stemming from the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 ruling: \u201cDid the [the Court of Special Appeals] err in holding that \u2014 in the Arbitration Opinion and Award at issue in this litigation \u2014 the arbitrator failed to address the question of whether the arbitration clause had expired?\u201d Our opinion resolves this issue in the course of addressing the County\u2019s arguments for vacating the arbitration award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b576-11\">. There was, however, a four-year Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\u201d) from July 1, 1987 to June 30, 1991, and no MOU between July 1, 1991 and June 30, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">. Additionally, the 1995 MOU provided that this split was to apply retroactively to officers who retired between February 1, 1992 and July 1, 1995, which was the FY 1995 MOU\u2019s effective date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b577-9\">. The only change to the Retiree Health Insurance provision was the language concerning the retroactive application of the provision to retirees who retired between 1992 and 1995. That language was taken out in 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b577-10\">. The bargaining agent for FOP and other County unions, Health Care Review Committee (\"FICRC\u201d), agreed to this proposed change, but the FOP representative voted against it. The HCRC has been the collective bargaining agent on health care issues for various County unions, including the FOP, since 1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b578-6\">. On July 9, 2007, FOP also filed an Unfair Labor Practice Complaint challenging the County\u2019s refusal to bargain with it. That complaint was dismissed on the ground that HCRC was the bargaining agent for the FOP, and the County had not committed an unfair labor practice by refusing to negotiate with FOP directly after HCRC had approved of the change.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\">. In FOP\u2019s view, \"[o]nce an employee retires, their health insurance subsidy is locked in.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\">. The Court of Special Appeals held that the arbitrator\u2019s Opinion and Award failed to consider a required factor: whether <em>\u201cthe arbitration clause itself had expired.\u201d </em>Reasoning that \u201c '[vjested\u2019 rights were necessary for arbitration, but so was the arbitration clause\u2019s survival despite the MOU's expiration,\u201d the court held that the Arbitration Award \u201cshould have been vacated.\u201d Notably, neither party made that argument before the Circuit Court or the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\">. In reaching that conclusion, the Court observed: \"the parties\u2019 obligations under their arbitration clause survived contract termination when the dispute was over an obligation arguably created by the expired agreement.\u201d <em>Nolde Bros. v. Bakery &amp; Confectionery Workers Union, </em>430 U.S. 243, 252, 97 S.Ct. 1067, 1072, 51 L.Ed.2d 300 (1977) (citing <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons v. Livingston, </em>376 U.S. 543, 555, 84 S.Ct. 909, 917, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964)). The Court went on to hold that \u201cwhere the dispute is over a provision of the expired agreement, the presumptions favoring arbitrability must be negated or by clear implication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 97 S.Ct. at 1074. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">The parties must be deemed to have been conscious of [the] policy [favoring arbitration]. Consequently, the parties' failure to exclude from arbitrability contract disputes arising after termination, far from manifesting an intent to have arbitration obligations cease with the agreement, affords a basis for concluding that they intended to arbitrate all grievances arising out of the contractual relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuM\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b582-5\">. For this proposition, the County cites Frank Elkouri &amp; Edna Asper Elkouri, <em>How Arbitration Works </em>134 (6th Ed.2003), who wrote: \"The majority of federal courts have read <em>Nolde </em>narrowly, holding that for a grievance to be arbitrable, after the expiration of the contract, it must involve either rights that have accrued or vested during the term of the agreement, or disputes that arose under the agreement while it was still in effect.\u201d We are of the opinion that the vagueness of <em>Nolde </em>concerning whether a dispute arose \"under\u201d the expired agreement \u2014 if any\u2014 was cured by <em>Litton, </em>which set forth the three situations when contract disputes arising after the agreement's expiration may still be arbitrable. <em>See Nolde, </em>430 U.S. at 249, 97 S.Ct. at 1071; <em>Litton Fin. Printing Div. v. NLRB, </em>501 U.S. 190, 206, 111 S.Ct. 2215, 2225, 115 L.Ed.2d 177 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b585-7\">. The <em>Nolde </em>court stated: \"Of course, in determining the arbitrability of the dispute, the merits of the underlying claim for severance pay are not before us. However, it is clear that, whatever the outcome, the resolution of that claim hinges on the interpretation ultimately given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the contract clause providing for severance pay.\u201d 430 U.S. at 249, 97 S.Ct. at 1071.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\">. The Court reasoned that the issue was for the arbitrator because \u201d[i]t is the arbitrator\u2019s construction which was bargained for; and so far as the arbitrator's decision concerns construction of the contract, the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from his.\u201d <em>Nolde, </em>430 U.S. at 253-54, 97 S.Ct. at 1073 (quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>United Steelworkers of Am. </em>v. <em>Enter.

This tension between <em>Nolde </em>and <em>Litton </em>is borne out by the dissenting Justices Stevens, Marshall, Blackmun, and Scalia, who argued that, like in <em>Nolde, </em>the <em>Litton </em>majority should have left the arbitrability issue \"reaching the merits\u201d of the dispute \"to an arbitrator in the first instance, pursuant to the broad agreement of the parties to submit for arbitration any dispute regarding contract construction.\u201d <em>Litton, </em>501 U.S. at 218, 111 S.Ct. at 2231-32 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (Blackmun &amp; Scalia, JJ., joining); <em>id. </em>at 211, 111 S.Ct. at 2228 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (Blackmun &amp; Scalia, JJ., joining). Justice Marshall emphasized that in <em>Nolde, </em>the Court \"carefully avoided expressing any view as to whether the substantive provisions of the expired agreement had any posttermination effect precisely because the parties had expressed their preference for an arbitral, rather than a judicial interpretation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213-14, 111 S.Ct. at 2229. In contrast, the <em>Litton </em>approach \"invites protracted litigation about what rights may 'accrue' or 'vest' under the contract \u2014 litigation aimed solely at determining whether the dispute will be resolved by arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 214, 111 S.Ct. at 2229.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\">. The Circuit Court recognized that \"[w]hile the Supreme Court\u2019s language [in <em>Litton </em>] expresses a fairly clear standard that is applicable to the facts of the case,\" the <em>Litton </em>Court\u2019s holding with respect to who (the arbitrator or the court) decides the mixed issue of arbitrability and the merits of a dispute contradicts the Maryland law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b587-9\">. This may be particularly true in labor disputes because labor arbitrators often have more expertise in those matters than do courts. <em>See United Steelworkers of Am., </em>363 U.S. at 582, 80 S.Ct. at 1353 (\"The ablest judge cannot be expected to bring the same experience and competence [as a labor arbitrator] to bear upon the determination of a grievance, because he cannot be similarly informed.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\">. To illustrate, in <em>Messersmith, Inc. v. Barclay Townhouse, </em>the parties disputed the very existence of the agreement to arbitrate, arguing that the construction contract containing the arbitration clause had not been signed. 313 Md. 652, 656, 547 A.2d 1048, 1050 (1988). Determining the arbitrability of a dispute regarding the scope, quality of work of the contractor, and the payment for its services did not require consideration of the contract as a whole or deciding the merits of dispute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b591-9\">. Arbitration agreements in Maryland are governed by common law, unless they expressly provide that the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act (\"MUAA\u201d) should apply. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 2006 Repl.

Because the MOU here did not expressly provide that MUAA applies, common law principles guide our inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\">. The County did not address the arbitrability issue in its brief before us, arguing that \u2018\u2018[t]he argument presented in FOP\u2019s Brief relates to a completely different question from that posed in its Petition for Writ of Certiorari. In its Questions Presented, it focuses on whether the court or the arbitrator determine arbitrability. In its Argument, it contends that the arbitrability should be determined without regard to the merits.\u201d We see no meaningful difference between FOP\u2019s Questions Presented and its arguments. As we explained above, typically when deciding whether a dispute is arbitrable requires considering the merits of the dispute, the arbitrability issue is for the arbitrator to decide. Thus, the distinction pointed out by the County is superficial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\">. The County also argued before the Circuit Court that \u201d[t]he duty to arbitrate 'is a matter of contract,' and any duty here is created by the Memorandum of Understanding.... The agreement died on June 30, 2007. The grievance filed here on September 14, 2007 fails as a matter of law because the contract expired.\u201d The County continued to argue before the Court of Special Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">FOP's grievance was based upon an MOU which no longer existed. Thus, the Arbitrator in this matter had no power, authority or jurisdiction to arbitrate a grievance which occurred after the expira<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>tion of the MOU. He had no jurisdiction and the grievance was not arbitrable.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\">. The County insists that the arbitration clause in question is narrow, but the language of the arbitration clause supports the opposite conclusion. The County concedes that \u201cthe grievance filed by FOP ... falls within [the] definition of a grievance,\u201d but argues that the grievance procedure set forth in the MOU \u201climit[ed] the Arbitrator's role to resolving the dispute concerning application and interpretation of the MOU and prohibited] the Arbitrator from ... rewriting the MOU.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">Even if the MOU somehow limited the arbitrator\u2019s authority in deciding disputes, this \"limiting\u201d language did not narrow the scope of arbitrable disputes arising out of \u201cthe application or interpretation\u201d of the MOU's terms: \u201cAny dispute concerning the application or interpretation of the terms of this Memorandum of Understanding ... shall be subject to binding arbitration.\u201d Thus, we reject the County\u2019s argument that the arbitration clause here is narrow.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b593-9\">. There is no doubt that, if this dispute had arisen during the MOU\u2019s lifetime, it would have been arbitrable. But in light of the MOU\u2019s expiration, the clause\u2019s continued vitality is not so clear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b597-9\">. The County did not produce a standard of review in its brief to this Court but incorporated by reference the standard of review it placed in its Court of Special Appeals\u2019 brief. Had the County reproduced the standard of review here, it might have realized that the standard of review it proposed to the Court of Special Appeals was incorrect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b598-6\">. Likewise, in <em>Messersmith, Inc., </em>which is frequently quoted for the de novo standard of review, when we said that the reviewing court may base its decision to stay an arbitration proceeding \"upon its independent assessment of the evidence,\u201d we were not speaking of this Court or the intermediate appellate court but were referring to the circuit court instead. 313 Md. at 663, 547 A.2d at 1053.
