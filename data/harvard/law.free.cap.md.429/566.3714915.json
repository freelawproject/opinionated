Perkins Hospital, waiting to become competent to stand trial for a crime he allegedly committed in 2001. In 2009 the charges against him were dismissed pursuant to Section 3-107(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d) of the Maryland Code (2001, 2008 RepLVol.), which requires dismissal of charges upon passage of certain time periods. Shortly after the dismissal, however, the State re-indicted Ray, who once again was found incompetent and dangerous and placed at Perkins for another round of incompetency-to-stand-trial (\u201c1ST\u201d) treatment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ray challenges his re-indictment, arguing that the State should not be allowed to \u201ccontinue to confine\u201d him \u201cby simply re-indicting [him] on the same charges that were required to be dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 3-107.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">While we appreciate Ray\u2019s indignation, his arguments are misdirected. He conflates re-institution of charges with commitment, suggesting that the State impermissibly confined him because of the re-indictment. But indictment is just one of several prerequisites to 1ST commitment. Under the Maryland incompetency statutes, 1ST commitment is appropriate only when the defendant is facing criminal charges, is incom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>petent, dangerous, and substantially likely to become competent in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, when the circuit court placed Ray in 1ST commitment, it made no finding as to whether Ray was likely to become competent, <em>ie. </em>whether he was \u201crestorable.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is the lack of such a finding \u2014 but not the re-indictment itself \u2014 that should have been the focus of Ray\u2019s challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Ray\u2019s argument challenging re-indictment is not only misdirected; it also has no support in the statutes. CP \u00a7 8-107 expressly provides that a dismissal of charges is without prejudice, and nothing in the legislative history suggests that the General Assembly intended to place a limit on the State\u2019s power to re-indict after a CP \u00a7 3-107 dismissal. Thus, we hold that the State may re-indict a defendant after a CP \u00a7 3-107 dismissal without establishing his competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">This does not mean, however, that the re-indictment resets the clock for constitutionally-permissible 1ST commitments. The dismissal deadlines under CP \u00a7 3-107 provide yardsticks for determining the reasonable amount of time necessary to determine if a defendant is restorable. Once these statutorily-prescribed time periods expire and charges are dismissed, there is a presumption that the time necessary for determining whether an individual is restorable has passed. To then place a re-indicted defendant in 1ST commitment without overcoming the presumption that he was unrestorable would contradict the legislative intent behind the recent amendments to our incompetency statutes. Accordingly, the <em>error </em>below was not that the circuit court allowed the State to re-indict Ray after a CP \u00a7 3-107 dismissal, but that it placed him in 1ST commitment, when there was a presumption that he was unrestorable. We give the circuit court an opportunity to correct this error on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Many pages of appellate reports have been devoted to Ray\u2019s mental disease and his psychotic delusions. <em>See Ray v. State, </em>410 Md. 384, 978 A.2d 736 (2009) <em>(\u201cRay I\u201d); Adams v. State</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>204 Md.App. 418, 41 A.3d 572 (2012) <em>(\u201cRay II </em>\u201d). It suffices to say that Ray is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic -with violent thoughts toward others and delusions about his involvement with law enforcement. <em>Ray I, </em>410 Md. at 390, 393, 395, 978 A.2d at 739-40, 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The Initial Charges and 1ST Commitment</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">In 2001, Ray was charged with first-degree attempted murder and lesser included offenses in connection with an alleged attack on his former girlfriend. <em>Id. </em>at 387, 978 A.2d at 737. Ray entered a plea of not criminally responsible and was found incompetent to stand trial in 2002. He was committed to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cDHMH\u201d) and placed at Clifton T. Perkins Hospital in Jessup, Maryland. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Until 2004, Ray did not want to take medications because he believed they impeded his \u201cpsychic powers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394, 396, 978 A.2d at 741, 742. Later, he was back on medication with varying success. For instance, in the opinion of one of his doctors in 2007, Ray responded to treatment with Rispiridon \u201cenough to not be a danger to others while in the hospital\u201d but not enough to truly understand \u201cthat he has a mental illness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396, 978 A.2d at 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">During the initial five years at Perkins, there was a time when Ray\u2019s doctors believed he may have become competent. In 2005, he was referred to a pretrial criminal responsibility evaluation, but it revealed that the doctors were wrong. Ray continued to be delusional and, as a result, incompetent to stand trial. <em>Id. </em>at 390, 978 A.2d at 739. Other than this incident of mistaken competence, Ray\u2019s annual competency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>evaluations consistently declared him incompetent to stand trial. <em>Id. </em>at 389, 978 A.2d at 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Ray\u2019s First Motion to Dismiss Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In 2007, Ray filed a motion to dismiss charges under CP \u00a7 3-107, arguing that a dismissal was proper because five years had gone by without his restoration to competency. <em>Id. </em>The State opposed the motion. It contended that because Ray was incompetent and dangerous, but restorable, there was an \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d allowing the charges to stand. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Four psychiatrists testified at a hearing on Ray\u2019s motion. The Director of Pretrial Services at Perkins, a supervisor of incompetent patients at Perkins, and a fellow in forensic psychiatry at Perkins all testified in general terms that they believed Ray was restorable because he was partially responding to his current medications and that \u201che certainly has not had an exhaustive trial of all the available antipsychotic medications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389-94, 978 A.2d at 739-41. Ray\u2019s treating psychiatrist was more specific. He indicated that, despite Ray\u2019s partial improvement, \u201che was too delusional in the sense he was still having fixed false ideas of multiple situations that were also described in his admission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394, 978 A.2d at 742. Nevertheless, Ray\u2019s treating psychiatrist also believed Ray could be restored to competency with proper medication, such as Clozapene.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 396, 978 A.2d at 743. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Circuit Court for Harford County found \u201cextraordinary\u201d cause to extend the time to maintain Ray\u2019s criminal charges and denied Ray\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 402, 978 A.2d at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The First Appeal: Ray I</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Ray appealed the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling. Prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, we granted certiorari. <em>Id. </em>at 388, 978 A.2d at 738. The issue before us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>was \u201cwhether \u2018extraordinary cause\u2019 existed to extend the time for Ray\u2019s criminal charges or whether the charges should have been dismissed, because five years had elapsed since Ray was found not competent to stand trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405-06, 978 A.2d at 748. We held that there was no \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d to extend the statutorily-prescribed time<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and directed the Circuit Court to dismiss Ray\u2019s charges. <em>Id. </em>at 419-20, 978 A.2d at 756-57. We noted, however, \u201cthat under the statute the State may re-institute charges and that civil commitment proceedings may be initiated against Ray.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420, 978 A.2d at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The Re-Institution of Charges and Ray\u2019s Second Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The State took our recognition that charges may be re-filed as an invitation to immediately re-charge Ray.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He filed a motion to dismiss the new charges, arguing that the State\u2019s re-institution of charges nullifies CP \u00a7 3-107(a) and denies him \u201cany of the statutory remedies and civil commitment process provided in [CP \u00a7] 3-106(a) through (e).\u201d While his motion was pending, Ray alleged incompetency to stand trial. In accordance with CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 101(f), the Circuit Court for Harford County ordered a competency examination. The order required the DHMH to examine Ray and \u201cdetermine whether [he] is able to understand the nature or object of the proceeding or to assist in his defense\u201d and whether he \u201cwould be a danger to himself or the person or property of another if released.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>The examination confirmed that Ray\u2019s mental illness is not malingered and that he was both incompetent and dangerous. The competency evaluation report, dated January 28, 2010, revealed that, since the last examination in 2007, Ray had been treated with Clozapene, and that at that time he was taking Ability, Depakote, Ecotrin, and Niacin. The report also stated that during Ray\u2019s stay at Perkins, he had been treated with other antipsychotic medications, including Seroquel, Risperdal, and Geodon. Although these medications brought some \u201cimprovement in [Ray\u2019s] symptoms,\u201d according to the psychiatrist, \u201cthere was never complete resolution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The psychiatrist noted that although \u201cRay has an advanced understanding of courtroom proceedings and terminology\u201d and \u201cagreed that he has Schizophrenia,\u201d he \u201ccontinued to talk about details of the case in a delusional manner.\u201d The psychiatrist concluded: \u201cIt was apparent that Ray has no actual insight [into his illness]. He continues to think that his delusions are reality.... These delusions make him unable to assist in his defense. Therefore, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, Ray is not competent to stand trial.\u201d Additionally, because of the persistent psychotic delusions and \u201ca history of dangerous behaviors in response to his delusions,\u201d the psychiatrist considered Ray dangerous and recommended that he \u201cbe maintained within a hospital setting.\u201d The report did not say anything about whether Ray could still be considered restorable.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Based on the report and following a hearing, on March 1, 2010, the Circuit Court found Ray dangerous and incompetent and ordered that he be placed in 1ST commitment in accordance with CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 106(b). Thereafter,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on March 31, 2010, the Circuit Court denied Ray\u2019s motion to dismiss the new charges.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The Second Appeal: Ray II</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Ray appealed the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the Court of Special Appeals reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling. <em>Ray II, </em>204 Md.App. at 439, 41 A.3d at 584. The intermediate appellate court read CP \u00a7 3-107 as \u201cestablishing] the maximum period that an indictment may remain pending against an untried but incompetent defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, 41 A.3d at 582. Although the court acknowledged that \u201cthe General Assembly contemplated that, at one point in time, the State could decide to re-indict after [a CP \u00a7 3-107(a) ] dismissal,\u201d it held that the State may not do so \u201cuntil it can articulate a good faith basis to believe that the defendant has become competent to stand trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 437, 41 A.3d at 582, 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The State filed a petition for certiorari, which we granted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Ray, </em>426 Md. 427, 44 A.3d 421 (2012). The State presents the following question for our review: Given that this Court held in <em>Ray v. State, </em>410 Md. 384 [978 A.2d 736] (2009), that the State may re-institute crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>nal charges against defendants who succeeded in having those charges dismissed under Section 3-107 of the Criminal Procedure Article, did the Court of Special Appeals err in reversing the lower court\u2019s proper denial of Ray\u2019s motions to dismiss those re-instituted charges?</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The answer to the State\u2019s question requires an examination of the Maryland incompetency statutes. As we have observed many times, \u201cthe paramount goal of statutory interpretation is to identify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute(s) at issue.\u201d <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335, 748 A.2d 478, 483 (2000). We always begin \u201cour analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>Friedman v. Hannan, </em>412 Md. 328, 337, 987 A.2d 60, 65-66 (2010) (quoting <em>People\u2019s Ins. Counsel Div. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>408 Md. 336, 351-52, 969 A.2d 971, 979-80 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">We need look no further than the statutory text \u201c[i]f the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous.\u201d <em>Id., </em>987 A.2d at 66 (quoting same). But if \u201cthe language is subject to more than one interpretation, or when the language is not clear when it is part of a larger statutory scheme,\u201d we try \u201cto resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting same). In this endeavor, our goal is to \u201cdiscern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision.\u201d <em>Id., </em>987 A.2d at 65 (quoting same).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">The issue before us is whether the State may re-indict a defendant after his charges were dismissed under CP \u00a7 3-107 without some showing that the defendant has regained competency. To answer this question, we first turn to the plain language of the Maryland incompetency statutes. We also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>review the historical background and the legislative history of the most recent amendments to our incompetency laws. We see nothing suggesting that the General Assembly intended to limit the State\u2019s power to re-indict.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The plain language of the 2006 amendments and their legislative history show that the General Assembly\u2019s main concern was putting an end to indefinite 1ST commitments, which it sought to do by requiring periodic judicial reviews of restorability and prohibiting 1ST commitments of unrestorable defendants. The dismissal deadlines of CP \u00a7 3-107 further helped ensure that the State does not confine an incompetent defendant in 1ST commitment longer than is necessary to determine whether such a defendant is restorable. These changes impact the 1ST commitment procedures but do not affect the State\u2019s ability to re-indict.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The Plain Language of CP \u00a7 3-107</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The Maryland incompetency statutes do not directly address re-indictment of defendants after their charges were dismissed under CP \u00a7 3-107. The parties hinge their arguments for and against the re-institution of charges on two provisions in CP \u00a7 3-107. Ray focuses on the mandatory dismissal language of CP \u00a7 3-107(a), which requires a \u201c[djismissal of charges for certain crimes after certain time.\u201d He argues \u201cthat five years is an almost absolute upper bound on the power of the State to hold a pre-trial detainee under the status of incompetent to stand trial, even if he is dangerous and restorable.\u201d In Ray\u2019s opinion, the State should not be allowed to circumvent this upper limit by re-instituting the charges against an incompetent defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Central to the State\u2019s argument is another paragraph in CP \u00a7 3-107, namely, the requirement in CP \u00a7 3-107(b) that charges be dismissed \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d The State relies on this provision to conclude that \u201c[njothing in the statutory scheme of CP \u00a7 3-107 precludes re-instituting charges after dismissal for a dangerous restorable<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> criminal defendant.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>(Footnote added). Quite the opposite, the State argues, \u201cthe statutory scheme condones reinstitution of charges against a defendant of this quality by expressly setting forth that dismissal under that section is without prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The Court of Special Appeals adopted Ray\u2019s position. It was of the opinion that the \u201cdismissal deadlines in section 3-107(a) provide yardsticks for measuring \u2018the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether [a defendant is restorable].\u2019 \u201d <em>Ray II, </em>204 Md.App. at 435-36, 41 A.3d at 582. This led the intermediate appellate court to conclude that \u201cthe State may not re-indict after a section 3-107(a) dismissal until it can articulate a good faith basis to believe that the defendant has become competent to stand trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 41 A.3d at 583. The court was concerned that \u201c[ojtherwise, the only purpose that can be served by re-indictment is the constitutionally impermissible purpose of continuing the defendant\u2019s confinement under a criminal commitment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Ray and the intermediate appellate court treat re-indictment and commitment as the same. We have a different view of this. Although one must be indicted in order to be considered for 1ST commitment, one is not subject to 1ST commitment just because of the indictment. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 3-106(b)-(d). As we discuss in detail below, in addition to being charged with a crime, there are three other prerequisites to 1ST commitment: (1) incompetence to stand trial, (2) dangerousness, and (3) restorability. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 3-106(b). Accordingly, a defendant who is incompetent and dangerous but nonrestorable would not be subject to 1ST commitment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Neither would a defendant who is incompetent and restorable but not dangerous. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">While Ray reads too much into the dismissal deadlines of CP \u00a7 3-107(a), the State oversimplifies the issue by focusing only on the \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d provision of CP \u00a7 3-107(b). As a result, the only thing that these conflicting accounts do well is illustrate that, although CP \u00a7 3-107 is unequivocal on the issue of the dismissal of charges, it leaves open to debate the issue of when the State may re-indict a defendant following a CP \u00a7 3-107 dismissal. In search of an answer to this question, we turn to the legislative history of our incompetency statutes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The Maryland Incompetency Laws</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The Maryland incompetency statutes set forth a process through which a defendant charged with a crime may allege (1) incompetence to stand trial, (2) be adjudicated incompetent, and (3) depending on whether she is dangerous and likely to become competent in the foreseeable future, be released, become subject to incompetence commitment, or become civilly committed. These statutes have undergone several changes since their inception. An appreciation for these transformations aids in understanding the legislative intent behind the most recent amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">\n<em>An Indefinite Commitment and Discretionary Dismissal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Prior to 1967, Maryland had no mechanism for terminating 1ST commitment of individuals who were not likely to ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>become competent. <em>See, e.g., </em>McLCode (1951), Article 59, \u00a7 8. Once a defendant was found incompetent to stand trial, he was to be confined in a mental institution \u201cuntil he or she shall have recovered,\u201d at which time \u201cthe court shall proceed with the trial of the charge pending against such person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At that time, there was also no requirement of periodic incompetence review by the court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In 1967, the General Assembly repealed and re-enacted this statute to give courts discretion to dismiss charges against an incompetent defendant upon expiration of certain time periods. Namely, after the 1967 amendments, courts could dismiss charges if \u201cso much time has elapsed since the finding of incompetency that it would be unjust to resume the criminal proceedings.\u201d Chapter 709, \u00a7 8(b) of the Acts of 1967 (codified at Md.Code (1957, 1964 Repl. Vol., 1967 Cum.Supp.), Article 59, \u00a7 8(b)). Still, unless a court exercised discretion, an incompetent defendant could be confined in a mental institution indefinitely. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The discretionary dismissal language of Section 8(b) remained substantially the same until 1982, when the statute was amended and re-codified as Section 12-105 of Health-General (\u201cHG\u201d) Article.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section 8(a) was also repealed and re-codified in the Health-General Article.

Accordingly, as of 2001, dismissal of charges against incompetent defendants in Maryland was discretionary upon expiration of certain time periods and, absent the exercise of discretion or the defendant\u2019s becoming competent, an 1ST commitment could still continue indefinitely. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 3-107 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">\n<em>The 2006 Amendments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In August of 2004, Maryland Disability Law Center (\u201cMDLC\u201d) filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, challenging the Maryland incompetency statutes as unconstitutional. <em>See </em>Complaint, <em>Swann v.

Judicial Proceedings Comm., Floor Rep. on HB 795, at 7 (2006). The workgroup was attended by Delegate Kathleen M. Dumais and Senator Brian E. Frosh and included representatives of MDLC, the courts, the Office of the Public Defender, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Office of the Attorney General, Maryland Crime Victims Resource Center, and other interested groups and individuals. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">As a \u201cresult of long discussion and compromise\u201d among the members of the workgroup, House Bill 795 came to life. State of Md. Office of the Pub. Defender, Position on Proposed Legis.: HB 795 (Feb. 22, 2006). On February 8, 2006, Delegate Dumais introduced the bill, which was assigned to the House Judiciary Committee. The Committee held a hearing where it accepted oral and written testimony in support of and against the bill.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Between the first and the third reading, HB 795 underwent several alterations, including, significant for this appeal,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the change from the requirement that charges against incompetent defendants be dismissed \u201cwith prejudice\u201d to \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d The predecessor statute, which gave discretion to the courts to dismiss charges upon expiration of certain time periods, did not specify whether such dismissals were to be with or without prejudice. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 3-107 (2001). But the original version of HB 795 changed the discretionary language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>to mandatory and added the \u201cwith prejudice provision.\u201d Without elaboration on the record,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the House Judiciary Committee issued a favorable report with an amendment to substitute \u201cwith\u201d for \u201cwithout\u201d prejudice. This proposed amendment was adopted when the bill was read for the second time on March 7, 2006, and became part of the final version of the bill signed into law.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The enactment of HB 795 brought comprehensive changes to Title 8 of the Criminal Procedure Article, as it substantially revised CP \u00a7\u00a7 8-104 through 3-108 and 3-123. Chapter 353 of the Acts of 2006. The amendments relevant here are the changes to CP \u00a7 3-106 and CP \u00a7 3-107. CP \u00a7 3-106(b) was amended to provide that 1ST commitment was only appropriate so long as a defendant is incompetent, dangerous, and there was \u201ca substantial likelihood that the defendant will become competent to stand trial in the foreseeable future.\u201d Specifically, CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 106(b) now provides that if \u201cthe court finds that the defendant is incompetent to stand trial and, because of mental retardation or a mental disorder, is a danger to self or the person or property of another, the court may order the defendant committed to the facility that the Health Department designates,\u201d but this commitment may only continue \u201cuntil the court finds that: (i) the defendant no longer is incompetent to stand trial; (ii) the defendant no longer is ... a danger to self or the person of property of others; or (iii) there is not a substantial likelihood that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>defendant will become competent to stand trial in the foreseeable future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">CP \u00a7 3-106(c) was also re-written to require courts to reconsider a defendant\u2019s suitability for 1ST commitment, <em>ie. </em>that the defendant is incompetent, dangerous, and restorable, every year from the date of commitment, within 30 days after the filing of a motion by a party, or after receiving a report from the Health Department presenting new findings. If this examination reveals \u201cthat the defendant is incompetent and is not likely to become competent in the foreseeable future,\u201d the 1ST commitment must end.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 3-106(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">HB 795 also re-wrote CP \u00a7 3-107. It added a paragraph that mandates dismissal of charges upon expiration of requisite time periods. Namely, dismissal of charges is now required in a capital offense case involving an incompetent defendant after the expiration of ten years; \u201ca felony or a crime of violence as defined under \u00a7 14-101 of the Criminal Law Article, after the lesser of the expiration of 5 years or the maximum sentence for the most serious offense charged,\u201d and other offences after three years. CP \u00a7 3-107(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">HB 795 maintained the language that was present in the statute since 1967 in paragraph (b) but changed it from discretionary to mandatory and added that a dismissal be \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d: \u201cWhether or not the defendant is confined, if the court considers that resuming the criminal proceedings would be unjust because so much time has passed since the defendant was found incompetent to stand trial, the court shall dismiss the charge without prejudice.\u201d CP \u00a7 3-107(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Re-Indictment After a CP \u00a7 3-107 Dismissal</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The parties draw different inferences from these statutory changes. The State argues that \u201cthe re-institution of charges initially dismissed under CP \u00a7 3-107 is supported by the fact that the legislature specifically stated that dismissal under CP \u00a7 3-107 is \u2018without prejudice.\u2019 \u201d Not surprisingly, Ray disagrees. He argues that the State\u2019s act of \u201cre-indicting immediately after the mandatory dismissal ... is inconsistent with the purpose of \u00a7 3-107 in light of the constitutional requirements of <em>Jackson.\u201d </em>Ray emphasizes that \u201c[ujnder <em>Jackson, </em>the State may not hold an incompetent detainee longer than the time necessary to determine if there is a substantial probability that he will become competent in the foreseeable future.\u201d Thus, Ray concludes: \u201cif the State seeks to continue to hold such a detainee beyond the manifestly unreasonably long period of five years, it should bear the burden of justifying its decision with proof of a then-present probability of restorability in the near future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">We agree with Ray that, in order \u201cto hold\u201d a detainee after a CP \u00a7 3-107 dismissal, the State must show that the detainee is restorable. But holding a detainee is not the same as merely charging him. It is true that under CP \u00a7 3-106 to be \u201cheld\u201d in 1ST commitment a defendant must be restorable, but we see nothing in our incompetency statutes that would require the State to make a restorability showing when it re-indicts a defendant. The legislative history supports this view: it was the lack of a rational relationship between 1ST commitments and restorability and the resulting indefinite 1ST commitments under the predecessor statute that fueled the 2006 amendments, not any pending criminal charges. This is evident from the General Assembly\u2019s awareness of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Jackson v. Indiana, </em>the legislators\u2019 statements regarding what they hoped the 2006 amendments would accomplish, and the amendments themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">\n<em>The Significance of Jackson v. Indiana</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The Supreme Court\u2019s holding and reasoning in <em>Jackson v. Indiana </em>was the foundation of the MDLC lawsuit that trig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>gered the 2006 amendments. In <em>Jackson, </em>the Court held that an indefinite 1ST commitment of an incompetent defendant\u2014 who is unlikely to ever become competent \u2014 violated both the equal protection and the due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The equal protection clause was implicated because the mere pendency of criminal charges gave the state of Indiana an easier path to the commitment of incompetent individuals and resulted in \u201ca more stringent standard of release than those generally applicable to all others not charged with offenses.\u201d 406 U.S. at 730, 92 S.Ct. at 1854. Due process was violated because there was no \u201creasonable relation\u201d between the \u201cnature and duration of commitment\u201d and \u201cthe purpose for which the individual is committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 738, 92 S.Ct. at 1858.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Indeed, if there is no substantial probability that the 1ST commitment will result, in the defendant\u2019s gaining competence in the foreseeable future, the purpose of the commitment is no longer making the defendant competent<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> but rather punishing him for a crime of which he has not been convicted<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or protecting public safety without going through the civil com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>mitment process. In those circumstances, the Court held, the state must either release the individual or \u201cinstitute the customary civil commitment proceedings that would be required to commit indefinitely any other citizen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on these principles, the Court famously held that an incompetent defendant charged with a crime \u201ccannot be held more than the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that he will attain that capacity in the foreseeable future.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The participants of the HB 795 workgroup appreciated the significance of <em>Jackson </em>and its emphasis on restorability in 1ST commitment determinations. For instance, the Office of the Public Defender urged the House Judiciary Committee to issue a favorable report on HB 795, relying on <em>Jackson </em>and arguing that \u201cthe Maryland statutory scheme for incompetent defendants does not provide the necessary safeguards [under <em>Jackson </em>] and is, therefore, unconstitutional.\u201d State of Md. Office of the Pub. Defender, Position on Proposed Legis.: HB 795 (Feb. 22, 2006). MDLC testified that HB 795 \u201cwill bring the statute in compliance by providing periodic reviews and providing the required standard for continuing commitment under the Criminal Procedures Act.\u201d MDLC, Testimony in Support of HB 795. Likewise, the Maryland Department of Disabilities focused on the periodic restorability reviews: \u201cPeople who have psychiatric disabilities who find themselves involved with the courts should be assured that they will not be held as incompetent to stand trial for indefinite periods of time without the benefit of periodic reviews of their competency. This bill addresses that need.\u201d Md. Dep\u2019t of Disabilities, Position Statement: In Support of HB 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Perhaps the most significant among the 2006 amendments was the expansion of CP \u00a7 3-106 to (1) exclude from 1ST commitments defendants who are not dangerous or unrestorable; (2) mandate periodic judicial reviews that not only consider whether a defendant is incompetent but also ensure that the defendant is actually restorable; and (3) require initiation of civil commitment proceedings or proceedings under HG \u00a7 7-503. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 3-106(b), (c) &amp; (d). The General Assem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>bly also added two other sections to CP \u00a7 3-106, one subjecting \u201cthe continued retention of a defendant civilly committed\u201d to the provisions of Title 10 of the Health \u2014 General Article, and the other instituting periodic hearings for defendants who are incompetent but not dangerous. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 3-106(e) &amp; (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Although the General Assembly put these safeguards in place in an effort to prevent indefinite 1ST commitments declared unconstitutional in Jackson,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Ray argues that the <em>Jackson </em>holding requires more. He maintains that \u201c[i]t follows [from <em>Jackson </em>] that if the State seeks to continue to hold such a detainee beyond the manifestly unreasonably long period of five years, it should bear the burden of justifying its decision with proof of a then-present probability of restorability in the near future.\u201d Nothing in <em>Jackson, </em>however, suggests that the State cannot re-indict a defendant after a CP \u00a7 3-107 dismissal unless he has become competent. In fact, the <em>Jackson </em>Court expressly refused to consider Jackson\u2019s argument that his criminal charges should have been dismissed. 406 U.S. at 739-40, 92 S.Ct. at 1858-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The Court took that position even though there was no substantial probability that Jackson would become competent in the near future, and even though the Court considered Jackson\u2019s commitment unconstitutional. This demonstrates that the Court viewed pendency of charges as being separate from 1ST commitment. Indeed, in declining to decide the issue of Jackson\u2019s charges, the Supreme Court observed that arguments for a dismissal of charges against an incompetent defendant are usually based on the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, or \u201cthe denial of due process inherent in holding pending criminal charges indefinitely over the head of one who will never have a chance to prove his innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>at 740, 92 S.Ct. at 1859. Neither argument, however, was made by Jackson.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">\n<em>Restombility and 2006 Amendments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Just as there is no support for Ray\u2019s argument in <em>Jackson, </em>there is also no indication that the General Assembly had any intention to make the State\u2019s ability to re-indict a defendant dependent on the defendant\u2019s having been restored to competency. The legislators\u2019 statements support the view that their concern was the creation of judicial oversight over 1ST commitments, not limiting the State\u2019s ability to re-charge incompetent defendants after a CP \u00a7 3-107 dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">When Delegate Dumais introduced HB 795, she characterized it as \u201cnecessary\u201d legislation that served three goals: (1) \u201csettling] out a process for periodic judicial review of an individual\u2019s progress and hearings to determine whether the person continues to meet the commitment criteria;\u201d (2) \u201cplac[ing] a limit on treatment to restore a person to competency to stand trial;\u201d and (3) \u201caddressing] public safety concerns by allowing the Court, in appropriate circumstances, to have the individual detained in the custody of the Department of Mental Health and Hygiene for consideration of civil commitment.\u201d Del. Kathleen M. Dumais, Testimony in Support of HB 795 (Feb. 22, 2008). Delegate Dumais urged the adoption of HB 795 because the previous version of CP \u00a7 3-106 \u201cviolate[d] due process and fundamental fairness,\u201d as it did \u201cnot provide a process for review\u201d and provided only one way out of 1ST commitment, which was when the defendant became competent or was no longer dangerous. In Dumais\u2019 opinion, HB 795 \u201caddress[ed] a very critical question: How long do we keep these individuals locked up and forgotten?\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Likewise, the Floor Report of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee summarized the 2006 amendments as dealing primarily with periodic judicial reviews. Although the Report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>mentioned the dismissal of charges, it said nothing about limits on the State\u2019s ability to re-institute charges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">This bill makes several changes to the law regarding incompetency of defendants to stand trial. Changes include extending the availability of incompetency determinations to violation of probation proceedings, and allowing the court to reconsider the incompetency of a defendant at any time before final judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">In addition, this bill provides for regular judicial reviews of incompetent to stand trial commitments and includes a procedure, should commitment be terminated, for the individual to be either civilly admitted to a state psychiatric facility or returned to a state residential center under the developmental disability administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">The bill provides time requirements for dismissal of criminal charges if the defendant remains incompetent to stand trial. The bill also includes a requirement by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) to submit a report containing a plan for services for individuals being recommended by the Department for a finding of competent to stand trial, incompetent but not dangerous, or not likely to be restored to competency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Accordingly, we see nothing in the legislative history of the 2006 amendments that would lead us to believe that the General Assembly intended the result Ray advocates. Instead, the legislative history points in one direction: the creation of a rational relation between 1ST commitments and their purpose, which the General Assembly sought to achieve through mandatory periodic reviews, not by limiting the State\u2019s ability to re-indict.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">\n<em>Mandatory Dismissals and Restorability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A90\">Contrary to Ray\u2019s contention, reading the Maryland incompetency statutes in this way does not \u201crender[ ] the time limits of [CP \u00a7 3-107(a) ] meaningless.\u201d Ray maintains that \u201c[i]f the statute\u2019s time limits require nothing more than the ministerial dismissal and refiling of charges every five years ... [s]uch an interpretation is unreasonable as a matter of statutory con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>struetion.\u201d We disagree. Like Ray and the Court of Special Appeals, we appreciate the significance of the mandatory dismissal deadlines but find them significant for a different reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Although the Supreme Court in <em>Jackson </em>made clear that incompetent defendants may only remain in 1ST treatment for the time necessary to determine if they will become competent in the foreseeable future, it declined to indicate what this \u201cnecessary\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d time may be. 406 U.S. at 738, 92 S.Ct. at 1858. Forty years later, there is still no consensus among psychiatrists or states\u2019 legislatures on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The concept of restorability remains relatively new in the field of forensic psychiatry because the research in this area did not begin until the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960) (affirming a defendant\u2019s right to have a competency evaluation prior to trial) and <em>Jackson v. Indiana. </em>George F. Parker, <em>The Quandary of Unrestorability, </em>40 J. Am. Acad. Psychiatry <em>&amp; </em>L. 171, 171 (2012). Although many states use Jackson\u2019s phrase \u201csubstantial probability\u201d when discussing restorability, \u201cthere is no agreed-upon definition of substantial probability\u201d in the psychiatric literature. <em>Id. </em>at 174. There is also no \u201cconsensus in the literature as to when a defendant can be called unrestorable or which disorders might qualify a defendant for this finding.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">What further complicates restorability findings is that factors other than a defendant\u2019s mental state affect those determinations. Research shows that \u201c \u2018[pjrevious criminal history and a current violent charge are significantly related to restor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>ability predictions.\u2019 \u201d J.W. Looney, <em>The Arkansas Approach to Competency to Stand Trial: \u201cNailing Jelly to a Tree\u201d, </em>62 Ark. L.Rev. 688, 700 (2009) (alteration in original) (quoting Karen L.

Forensic Mental Health 145, 153 (2003)). This may be so because \u201c \u2018examiners are subjected to more political pressure to have violent offenders with previous criminal histories prosecuted which, in turn, could result in more predictions as being restorable for defendants with violent, criminal histories.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 700 n. 144 (quoting same).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Additionally, because restorability literature suggests that a high percentage of defendants can be restored to competency,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> \u201cclinicians will over-predict restorability.\u201d Debra A. Pinals, M.D., <em>Where Two Roads Meet: Restoration of Competence to Stand Trial From a Clinical Prospective, </em>31 New Eng. J.Crim. &amp; Civ. Confinement 81, 105 (2005). But \u201ceven when a forensic evaluator writes that it is unlikely or very unlikely that a defendant will be restored to competence, court participants may well conclude that it is still possible the defendant will be restored and thus deny designation as unrestorable.\u201d Parker, <em>supra, </em>at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>In the midst of this uncertainty of what \u201csubstantial probability\u201d of becoming competent means or how to predict whether an individual is restorable, states have taken different approaches in their efforts to comply with <em>Jackson. </em>Many states placed express limits on how long an incompetent defendant may remain in 1ST commitment for the purposes of determining her restorability. In several of these states, the length of a maximum 1ST commitment does not depend on the crime charged.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Other states tie the length of the maximum 1ST commitment to the maximum length of the sentence for the charged crime.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The length of permissible 1ST commitment varies in this group of states as well. Some states, like Colorado, allow 1ST commitment up to the length of the maximum possible sentence, while others, like Ohio, create a tier system that assigns certain time periods to certain crime categories.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Other states, in addition to or instead of express limitations on the length of competency treatments, permit or require a dismissal of charges against incompetent defendants.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>other states, there is no express limitation on the length of 1ST commitment, but there is a provision for discretionary or mandatory dismissal. For example, the Florida legislature mandates that the charges be \u201cdismissed without prejudice to the state if the defendant remains incompetent to proceed 5 years after\u201d he was first found incompetent to stand trial.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 916.145 (West 2011 &amp; Supp.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Our incompetency statutes fall into the category of the statutes that control the length of 1ST commitments through a mandatory dismissal of charges upon expiration of time. Although tying dismissal deadlines to the charges may not be the ideal approach,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> it does provide a bright-line rule that may be appropriate, considering the uncertainty surrounding restorability determinations. By mandating dismissals upon the expiration of ten, five, and three years \u2014 regardless of whether the psychiatrists still deemed the defendant restora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ble \u2014 the General Assembly created the upper limit on how long the State may attempt to work toward the goal of making an incompetent defendant become competent, at least with respect to that indictment. Accordingly, on this point, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals: \u201cThe dismissal deadlines in section 3-107(a) provide yardsticks for measuring \u2018the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether [a defendant is restorable].\u2019 \u201d <em>Ray II, </em>204 Md.App. at 435-36, 41 A.3d at 582 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">But we do not draw the same conclusion from this acknowledgment as did the intermediate appellate court. That the dismissal deadlines are statutory cutoffs for restorability determinations does not mean that the State may not re-indict such an individual unless he has been restored to competency. What these dismissal deadlines are is the General Assembly\u2019s way of saying that \u2014 if a defendant, charged with a particular crime and placed in 1ST commitment, does not become competent within ten, five, or three years depending on the severity of the crime \u2014 there is no substantial probability that the defendant will become competent in the foreseeable future. In other words, the passage of time in 1ST treatment \u2014 without the defendant\u2019s gaining competency \u2014 and the resulting dismissal under CP \u00a7 3-107 create the presumption that the defendant is not restorable.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">This reading of CP \u00a7 3-107 reconciles, on the one hand, the requirement of CP \u00a7 3-107(a) that charges be dismissed upon expiration of time; with, on the other hand, the provision of CP \u00a7 3-107(b) that any dismissal be \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d Even more importantly, such a reading of CP \u00a7 3-107 carries out the General Assembly\u2019s intent of making sure that unrestorable defendants are not \u201clocked up and forgotten.\u201d Del. Dumais, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Accordingly, the statutorily-mandated dismissal of charges under CP \u00a7 3-107 gives the State an opportunity to reevaluate its case against the defendant and the likelihood that the case would ever go to trial. It is possible that, considering the defendant\u2019s prolonged incompetency, the State may decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>not to re-indict at all. In that case, the individual against whom the charges were dismissed will be considered for civil commitment in accordance with the civil commitment provisions of Title 10 of the Health \u2014 General Article. Alternatively, the State may re-indict an individual after the dismissal of the original charges, as it did in this case. If the State chooses to do that, the presumption that the defendant is unrestorable, stemming from the CP \u00a7 3-107 dismissal, remains, but is rebuttable by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Although CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 106(b) does not require that a restorability determination be made before the initial 1ST commitment,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> not looking into restorability in a situation such as the one before us would render meaningless the mandatory dismissal provision of CP \u00a7 3-107. After all, a defendant who comes before a court after his charges were re-instituted has already spent at least three, five, or ten years in 1ST commitment; and in accordance with CP \u00a7 3-107, the maximum amount of time in 1ST commitment has already passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The Court of Special Appeals incorrectly assumed in this case that it was established in 2010 that Ray \u201cmight be restored to competency with supervised medication and treatment.\u201d <em>Ray II, </em>204 Md.App. at 429, 41 A.3d at 578. In reality, neither Ray\u2019s counsel, the State, nor the Circuit Court brought up the issue of whether Ray was actually restorable after nine years of unsuccessful 1ST treatment and in light of his original charges having been dismissed under CP \u00a7 3-107. The Circuit Court should make that determination on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Thus, we vacate the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 ruling and remand this case to the Court of Special Appeals with directions to affirm the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of Ray\u2019s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>dismiss charges and remand this case to the Circuit Court so that it may make the required restorability determination and proceed in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Ray and the Court of Special Appeals attributed Ray\u2019s continued 1ST commitment to the State\u2019s re-institution of charges. They read the dismissal deadlines of CP \u00a7 3-107 as a prohibition against re-indictment of an incompetent defendant after his charges were dismissed under CP \u00a7 3-107. But CP \u00a7 3-107 expressly provides that a dismissal of charges is without prejudice. There is no indication in the legislative history that, by mandating dismissals, the General Assembly sought to impose a limitation on the State\u2019s power to re-indict.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Nevertheless, Ray\u2019s current 1ST commitment is not proper. The dismissal deadlines of CP \u00a7 3-107 set limits on how long the State may confine an incompetent defendant for the purpose of determining whether he is restorable. Thus, the passage of five years without Ray\u2019s becoming competent and the resulting dismissal of his original charges under CP \u00a7 3-107 created the presumption that Ray could not be restored to competency. The State may overcome that presumption after re-indictment, but ordering Ray in 1ST commitment, while the presumption that he was unrestorable was in place, was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE HARFORD COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT\u2019S DENIAL OF MOTION TO DISMISS CHARGES AND REMAND FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN PETITIONER AND RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\">.

Although parties refer to commitment under CP \u00a7 3-106(b) as \u201ccriminal commitment,\u201d incompetent-to-stand-trial (\u201c1ST\") commitment is a more accurate term.

Mere pendency of criminal charges no longer results in such commitment.
