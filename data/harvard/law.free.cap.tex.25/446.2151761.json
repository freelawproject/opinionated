The case was tried before Hon. Hat. M. Bureord, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-8\">Goodman sued Sayre and Thomas as a firm on two promissory notes, hut at the trial he dismissed as to Sayre, and took judgment by default against Thomas. The sheriff served the summons or writ upon Thomas, and made a proper return of such service, but neglected to sign his return. The fact of his not signing his return was overlooked, and judgment taken against defendant, Thomas. The transcript shows that, during vacation, the sheriff amended his return, and filed an affidavit that he served Thomas in the manner stated in his return. This affidavit was made after service of citation in error. Thomas had alleged for error want of service, because\u2019there was no signature to the sheriff\u2019s return.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b462-9\"><em>Geo. W. Guess, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai0\">\u2014This was a judgment by default, hut the return upon the writ was not <em>signed </em>by the sheriff or other officer. This is fatal to the judgment on error. (Hart. Dig., Art. 2894; O. &amp; W. Dig., Art. 416-417, and reference; Blossman v. Letchford, 17 Tex., 647; Underhill v. Lockett, 20 Tex., 130; also 22 and 23 Tex.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-10\">The attention of the court is called particularly to the last page of the transcript, where it will be seen that, on the 6th day of October, 1860, about ten months after the rendition of said judgment, there has' been an attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>made to complete the service by falsifying and changing the record; and that, too, when there was no court in session. And the clerk, to keep from certifying to a falsehood, has tried to obviate the difficulty by inserting the word <em>\u201ccontains ,\u201d </em>&amp;c.; meaning, I suppose, that though there is a part inserted which is no part of the record, yet still the <em>true </em>record is in the transcript <em>somewhere. </em>It is not supposed that the papers filed as \u201creturned on summons amended,\u201d and the affidavit filed on 6th October, 1860, will be at all considered by the court. They are certainly not \u201c a copy of the proceedings had in the case,\u201d and as such the clerk should not have inserted them in the transcript, and he only gets around what he knows to be wrong by making an equivocal certificate to the transcript. Hence he puts in the word <em>\u201ccontains.\u201d</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-6\"><em>Nicholson Ferris, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b463-7\">Bell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AD5\">\u2014The returp. upon the original citation was not signed by any one, and the service was therefore insufficient. Judgment by fault was rendered. Afterwards, and when the court was not in session, the sheriff filed an affidavit, stating that service was duly made of the writ, and proceeded to amend his return. This affidavit was made by the sheriff, and the amendment of his return was made long after service of citation in error, and without any authority from the court. These acts cannot be regarded as any part of .the proceedings in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The judgment is reversed because of the insufficiency of the service, and the cause is remanded fol* proper proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
