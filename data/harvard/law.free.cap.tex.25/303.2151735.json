Evans v. State of Texas.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b319-11\">Art. 475 of the Penal Code reads as follows: \u201c The use of any unlawful violence upon the person of another, with intent to injure him, whatever be the means or the degree of violence used, is an assault and battery. Any attempt to commit a battery, or any threatening gesture showing in itself, or by words accompanying it, an immediate intention, coupled with an ability to commit a battery, is an assault.\u201d (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 2137, Note 600.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>This act follows the common law upon the subject of assault and battery.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b320-5\">And so the 476th art. declares, \u201cWhen an injury is caused by violence to the person, the intent to injure is presumed, and it rests with the person inflicting the injury to show the accident or innocent intention.\u201d This is following the common law. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 2138.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b320-6\">And \u201c it is not necessary to state anything in the indictment which it is not necessary to prove.\u201d (Code of Grim, Pro., Art. 396; Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 2864, Note 721.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b320-7\">The common law form may well be adopted in an indictment for an aggravated assault.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-8\">Appeal, from McLennan. The case was tried before Hon. iST. W. Battle, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-9\">The defendant, Evans, was indicted for a violent assault, for that with force of arms, &amp;e., upon the body of Grisham Lee, &amp;c., he did make an aggravated assault, with premeditated design, and with a stick, &amp;c., did inflict upon the said Lee great bodily injury. Evans moved to quash the. indictment, because it did not state any offense. The motion was sustained, and the indictment quashed, upon which the State appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-10\"><em>Geo. Flournoy, Attorney General, </em>for the State.\u2014There are three objections stated to the indictment :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-11\">1. \u201cThat it does not appear from the face of the indictment that any offense against the law was committed by this defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-12\">The indictment is not very artistically drawn, but substantially and clearly charges the offense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-13\">Penal Code, Art. 488, O. &amp; W. Dig., p. 519, states, that an assault becomes aggravated'\u201c when a serious bodily injury is inflicted upon the person assaulted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-14\">The grand jury seemed to have had in view the statute, and have charged the offense in almost the precise language of the statute; certainly the indictment conforms' sufficiently with the statute.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-15\"><em>Richard Coice, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2T\">\u2014The ruling of the court below, sustaining the motion to quash, is correct, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the \u201cintent to injure,\u201d which is a necessary ingredient in the offense sought to be charged, is not alleged in the indictment. (See Arts. 475, 483 Penal Code, O. &amp;W. Dig.; The State v. West, 10 Tex., 555; Art. 399 Code Crim. Pro., O. &amp; W. Dig.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b321-6\">Roberts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWe\">\u2014The objection made to the indictment is, that it does not allege that the violence was inflicted \u201cwith intent to injure\u201d the person assaulted, or some other person. That is an element which always enters into this offense. Our Penal Code simply follows the common law upon this subject. (Penal Code, Art. 475.) It also adopts the presumption of the common law, which is, that \u201c when an injury is caused by violence to the person, the intent to injure is presumed, and it rests with the person inflicting the injury to 'show the accident or innocent .intention.\u201d (Penal Code, Art. 476.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u201cIt is not necessary to state in an indictment anything which it is not necessary to prove.\u201d (Code Crim. Pro., Art. 896.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Ko reason is perceived why an indictment for this offense, in the forms adopted and sanctioned by the common law, is not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">This indictment plainly alleges an assault and battery, substantially in accordance with the recognized precedents, and it was error to sustain the exceptions to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Judgment reversed, and case</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
