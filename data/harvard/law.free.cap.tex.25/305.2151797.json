Hughes,\u201d recovered a judgment in the Superior Court of Eulton county, Georgia, against \u00a1Nelson for $1,110 25. This record was certified in accordance with the act of Congress of the 26th May, 1790. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 3709, \u00a1Note 835; Paschal\u2019s Annot. Const., Notes 218, 219, pp. 215-222.) Bagby sued Nelson upon this judgment, describing himself \u201cas the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of the estate of Willis H. Hughes, deceased.\u201d Nelson put in an exception, denying the right of the plaintiff to sue. He also plead <em>nil debet </em>to the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">The exception or \u201cplea in abatement,\u201d as it was wrongly called in the record, was overruled, and there were a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-8\">The defendant prosecuted error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-9\"><em>Thomas </em>Harrison, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhE\">\u2014That an administrator in another State has no right to sue here, by virtue of his letters of administration there, is clear. (Story on Conflict of Laws, 421, 422, 431, 432; Cobb v. Norwood, 11 Tex., 560; Clay v. Clay, 13 Tex., 200.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-10\">The appellant sues in the capacity of administrator <em>de bonis non </em>by virtue of letters of administration granted to him in the State of Georgia.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-11\">This should determine the case in favor of the appellant; but it may be argued that the description of himself as administrator will be treated as surplusage, and that he has the right to sue in the courts of Texas for the recovery of this debt as due to himself personally, the original debt being merged in the judgment. That this is the rule of other States cannot be doubted; but Hemphill, C. J., in Clay v. Clay, 11 Tex., 560, doubts the propriety of its application to Texas, on account of our peculiar system of ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>ministrations, and I rest the argument on this point on his observations thereon.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-6\"><em>Ay cock \u00a3 Stewart </em>recovered the judgment in the court below, but the <em>Reporter </em>finds no brief with the record.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b323-7\">Roberts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5zI\">\u2014The petition of plaintiff below commences as follows: \u201cYour petitioner, Thomas Bagby, as the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of the estate of \"Willis H. Hughes, deceased, a resident citizen of the State of Georgia, humbly complaining of Allison Kelson,\u201d &amp;c., and it proceeds to set out, as the cause of action, a judgment recovered in the State of Georgia by Bagby, in that capacity, against Kelson and another. Kelson excepted to the petition, upon the ground that Bagby had no right to bring the suit in that capacity, which exception was overruled, and that is the error complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The words \u201cas administrator,\u201d &amp;c., may he treated as surplusage, being an unnecessary description of the capacity in which he had recovered the judgment in Georgia. It was immaterial by what right he had recovered the judgment there; it stood in force in his name, and, although others may have an equitable interest in it as a right of action, having the legal title, he could sue in Ms own name upon it. (Gayle <em>et al. </em>v. Ennis <em>et al., </em>and authorities cited, 1 Tex., 184; Lipscomb <em>et al. </em>v. Ward <em>et al., </em>2 Tex., 277; also, Ib., 412; Claiborne v. Yoeman, 15 Tex., 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">We are of opinion that the court did not err in sustaining the petition thus excepted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
