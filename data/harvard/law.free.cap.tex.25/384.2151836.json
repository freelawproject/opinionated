S. Hall, deputy sheriff of Parker county, which is marked exhibit \u201cA.\u201d Exhibit \u201cA\u201d showed no service of the summons of the justice whatever. But in another part of the record there was a citation and return corresponding to the allegation. The <em>ad interim </em>injunction was granted by Judge Burford. The complainant discontinued as to the justice. Kaufman &amp; Kleaver, the plaintiffs in the justice\u2019s judgment, filed a general demurrer, upon which the court dissolved the injunction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>dismissed the petition, and ordered a <em>procedendo </em>to the justice. The transcript from the justice showed that the judgments of the justice were rendered on promissory notes, payable \u201cin the town of Dallas.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-6\"><em>F.

(Edrington v. Allsbrooks, 21 Tex., 186; Willis v.

P. Witt. Upon motion the injunction was dissolved in the court below for want of equity in the bill. The suit in the magistrate\u2019s court was upon a promissory note made payable in Dallas. Witt was a resident of Parker county, and the suit was brought in Dallas. The only complaint worthy of notice, set out in the bill, is, that the writ or summons served upon Witt was directed to the sheriff) or other officer of Dallas county authorized to execute, and, as the bill shows, the sheriff of Parker county executed and returned the'writ. Hence plaintiff in error says he had no service. In reply to that, we say, if he had no legal notice of the suit, his remedy was not by injunction, but by <em>certiorari. </em>He had a full, complete, and perfect remedy at law, and there were no grounds for invoking the interposition of a court of equity. If Witt were not legally served, he should have shown that fact, and attended the magistrate\u2019s court for the purpose. He could not absent himself from that court, decline asserting his right at law, for the purpose of applying to a court of equity to relieve him from the consequences of his own laches, and negligence. If he chose, however, not to attend the magistrate\u2019s court, his remedy was by <em>certiorari. </em>The authorities, we think, fully sustain us in these positions.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b402-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Wheeler, 0. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqz\">\u2014There was no legal service upon the defendant to appear and answer to the suit \"before the justice. A citation, directed to an officer of Dallas county to execute,-was no authority to the sheriff of Parker county to execute the process. Service of the 'process by him was, in contemplation of law, no service. The court, therefore, had not jurisdiction of the person of the defendant, and the judgment was consequently void. The defendant, therefore, was entitled to have it so declared, and the proceedings under it enjoined. But the court having obtained cognizance of the case for one purpose, would retain it for \u2022 the further purpose of doing full and complete_ justice between the parties, and would give judgment for the plaintiff upon the cause of action on which the judgment of the justice was rendered, if, upon the merits, the .plaintiff was entitled to judgment. Such is the practice as settled by the decisions of this court. (Edrington v. Allsbrooks, 21 Tex., 186; Willis v. Gordon, 22 Tex., 241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">We are of opinion that the court erred in dismissing the petition, for which the judgment must be</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
