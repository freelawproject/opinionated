The house of Gehrung was built in 1845 or 1846, with windows overlooking Klein\u2019s lot, thus affording the uninterrupted use of light and air, until Klein erected his fence, in December, 1857. The fence being ten feet high, and near the windows, obstructed the light, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>damaged the property at least $25.

It is true, that the English rule on the subject of \u201cancient lights\u201d has been followed by several of the older States. By others it has been repudiated, for reasons, too, that seem peculiarly applicable to the condition of the towns of this State. The English rule, derived from the civil law, may do very well for an old, settled country; it may answer a good purpose in such places as the city of London; but its adaptability to a countiy like this is an entirely different question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-9\">In 2 Greenl. on Ev., \u00a7 539a, the following language is used: \u201cIt seems that to constitute an <em>adverse </em>enjoyment of an incorporeal hereditament, the act of enjoyment must be of such a character as.to afford ground for an action by the other party. It must be either a direct invasion of his vested rights, or else consequently injurious to their free exercise. * * * * Thus, in the case of lights, if the building in which they are made is erected on the party\u2019s own land, and no building stands on the land of the adjoining proprietor, it has been held, that against the latter no right is acquired by lapse of time.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-11\">The case of Pierre v.

The appellant believes that the District Court clearly erred in refusing to give this instruction. \u201cIn order that the enjoyment of an easement in another\u2019s land may be conclusive of the right, it must have been adverse, that is, under a claim of title, with the knowledge and acquiescence of the owner of the land, and uninterrupted; and the <em>burden of proving </em>this is on the party claiming the easement. If he leaves it doubtful whether the enjoyment was adverse, known to the owner, and uninterrupted, it is not conclusive in his favor.\u201d (2 Greenl. on Ev., \u00a7 539; Sargent v.

Justices of the peace have jiu'isdiction of all suits for injuries to any kind of property wherein the damages claimed do not exceed $100, and the power to award and decree the appropriate relief ^must follow of course. The relief 'prayed for, in this case is not materially \"different from the <em>decrees </em>necessary in suits for the recovery of specific articles, to determine the right of property, or to restore detained premises; in all of which justices of the peace are competent to decree the appropriate relief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-6\">The doctrine declared in the decision upon which appellant seems to rely, (13 Shepl., 436,) viz, that a person, by the exercise of a lawful right, cannot be guilty of an encroachment upon others\u2019 rights, cannot be sound. Under such a conception of the exercise of legal rights, it would be lawful for any person to erect a <em>powder </em>or any kind of manufactory upon any lot he may own, regardless of the character or quality of the improvements upon the adjoining ones, and yet be not guilty of an encroachment upon Ms neighbor\u2019s rights. Such cannot be the law in any civilized community, for it would authorize and tolerate the most pernicious consequences. Under such a <em>rule, </em>lot-owners in towns and cities must make their improvements under the risk of having them rendered wholly useless in case the adjoining lots are vacant, and their owners think \u2019 proper to erect anytMng upon them that will be incompatible with the proper and intended use and enjoyment of <em>their </em>improvements. The sound <em>maxim, </em>that every person must so use his property as not to injure another\u2019s, had better not be departed, from. The inconvenience arising from an adherence to it will be much less injurious in operation than that arising from its abandonment. In the occupancy and enjoyment of real property some security must be extended by law to priority of appropriation, otherwise the consequences above intimated are certain to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>follow, as in the case under consideration. TJpon this subject Kent says, on page 448, volume 3: \u201cThe elements of light and air are rights or incidents attached to the enjoyment of real estate, and the law gives weight and effect to the first appropriation of them. * * * If I build my house close to my neighbor\u2019s wall, I cannot compel him to demolish it, though it may obstruct my light, for the first occupancy is in him. But, on the other hand, the owner of a house will be restrained by injunction, and be hable to an action' on the case, if he make any erections or improvements so as to obstruct the <em>ancient </em>lights of an adjoining house. * * * In modern times the period of prescription or limitation has been shortened, and the uninterrupted and exclusive enjoyment\" of window-lights for twenty years has been held to be sufficient to raise a presumption of title to the unobstructed enjoyment of that protection. In Daniel v. North, 11 East\u2019s R, 371, it was considered as settled law, that twenty years\u2019 quiet and uninterrupted possession of a window-light was sufficient ground for a jury to presume a grant or covenant, provided that there was evidence that the owner of the opposite premises had knowledge, during the twenty years, of the fact.\u201d And Greenleaf says, in sec. 543, of his 2d vol. on Evidence: \u201cErom this view of the present state of the law on this subject, it appears that the plea of prescription will be maintained by any competent evidence of an uninterrupted, exclusive enjoyment of the. subject prescribed for during twenty years, with a* claim of title, and with the actual or presumed knowledge of those adversely interested.\u201d If it is lawful for appellant to stop appellee\u2019s windows with his fence, it is also lawful for him to use his premises for any business that is lawful in itself, though the exercise of it may render the adjoining tenements unfit for habitation. Such a <em>rule </em>will annul all the law on the subject of nuisance, and leave the well-disposed part of every community to the whims and caprices of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>selfish and. malicious, that may become owners of adjoining lots.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-5\">The conclusion or hypothesis upon which the decision in the case of <em>Parker </em>v. Foote is based, is, that no person, without an actual invasion of the rights of another by the commission of an actual trespass thereon, can acquire a beneficial interest by prescription in his land, which, with due deference to the learning of the judge that decided that case, is believed to be wholly fallacious.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b254-6\">Wheeler, G. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ7\">\u2014\u201c Thedoctrine of ancient lights is not much relished in this country, owing to the rapid changes and improvements in our cities and villages.\u201d In the case of Parker v. Foote, 19 Wend., 309, the Supreme Court of Hew \"Fork held, that \u201cthe modern English doctrine of a prescriptive right to prevent obstructions to window-lights, adopted in analogy to the statute of limitations, is an anomaly in the law, and not adapted to the circumstances or existing state of things in this country;\u201d and they refused to recognize it as the common law. ' Mr. Justice Bronson examined the subject in an elaborate opinion, and stated the argument upon which the court arrived at its conclusion with great clearness and force. \u201c Most of the cases on the subject we have been considering (he said) relate to ways, commons, markets, water-courses, and the like, where the use or enjoyment, if not rightful, has been an immediate and continuing .injury to the person against whom the presumption is macle.\u201d His property has either been invaded, or his beneficial interest in it has been rendered less valuable. The injury has been of such a character that he might liave immediate redress by action. But in the case of windows overlooking the land of another, the injury, if any, is merely ideal or imaginary. \u25a0 The light and air which they admit are not the subjects of property beyond the moment of actual occupancy; and for overlooking one\u2019s privacy no action can be maintained. The party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>has no remedy but to build on ttie adjoining land opposite the offensive windows. (Chandler v. Thompson, 3 Camp., 80; Cross v. Lewis, 1 Barn. &amp; Cress., 686, per Bayley, J.) Upon what principle the courts in England have applied the same rule of presumption to two classes of cases so essentially different in character, I have been unable to discover. If one commit a daily trespass on the land of another, under a claim of right to pass over, or feed his cattle upon it, or divert the water from his mill, or throw it back on his land or machinery\u2014in these and the like cases, long-continued acquiescence affords strong presumptive evidence of right. But in the case of lights there is no <em>adverse user, </em>nor, indeed, any- use whatever of another\u2019s property; and no foundation is laid for indulging any presumption against the rightful owner.\u201d The learned judge adverts to the acknowledged principle, that a man may build at the extremity of his own land, and that he may lawfully have windows looking out upon the land of his neighbor, and proceeds to say: \u201cThe reason why he may lawfully have such windows must be, because he does his neighbor no wrong, and, indeed, so it is adjudged, as we have already seen; and yet, somehow or other, by the exercise of a lawful right in his own land for twenty years, he acquires a beneficial interest in the land of his neighbor. The original proprietor is still seized of the fee, with the privilege of paying taxes and assessments; but the right to build on the land, without which city and village lots are of little or no value, has been destroyed by a lawful window. How, what is the acquiescence which concludes the owner? Ho one has trespassed upon his land, or done him a legal injury of any kind. He has submitted to nothing but the exercise of a <em>lawful </em>right on the part of his neighbor. How, then, has he forfeited the beneficial interest in his property? He has neglected to incur the expense of building a wall twenty or fifty feet high, as the case may be, not for his own benefit, but for the sole purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>annoying Ms neighbor. That was his only remedy. A wanton act of this kind, although done in one\u2019s own land, is calculated to render a man odious. There is, I think, no principle upon which the modern English doctrine on the subject of lights can be supported. It is an anomaly in the law. It may do well enough in England, but it cannot be applied in the growing cities and' villages of this country, without working the most mischievous consequences.\u201d (19 Wend., 316, 317, 318.) This opinion was approved and the same doctrine reaffirmed by the decision of the Supreme Court of Hew York, in 1851, in the ease of Myers v. Gammell, (10 Barb., 537.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The Supreme Court of Maine held the same opinion, upon an examination of the subject on principle and authority, in the case of Pierre v. Ferand, 13 Shepl., 436. The court there held this language: \u201cHothing in law can be more certain, than one\u2019s right to occupy and use his own land as he pleases, if he \"does not thereby injure others. He may build upon it, or occupy it as a garden, grass-plot, or passage-way, without any loss or diminution of his rights. Ho person can acquire any right or interest in it, merely on account of the manner in which it has been occupied. When one builds upon his own land, immediately adjoining the land of another person, and puts out windows overlooking that neighbor\u2019s land, he does no more than exercise a legal right. This is admitted. (Cross v. Lewis, 2 B. &amp; C., 686.) By the exercise of a legal right he can make no encroachment upon the rights of his neighbor, and cannot thereby impose any servitude, or acquire any easement, by the exercise of such a right for any length of time.\u201d He does no injury to his neighbor by the enjoyment of the flow of light and air, and does not, therefore, claim or exercise any right adversely to any rights of his neighbor; nor is there anything of similitude between the exercise of such a right and the exercise of rights claimed adversely. It is admitted that his neighbor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>cannot obtain redress by any legal process; in other words, that his rights have not been encroached upon, and that he has no cause of complaint. And yet, while thus situated, for more than twenty years he loses his right to the free use of his land, because he did not prevent his neighbor from enjoying that which occasioned him no injury, and afforded him no just cause of complaint. The result of the doctrine is, that the owner of land not covered by buildings, but used for any other purpose, may be deprived of the right to build upon it by the lawful acts of the owner of the adjoining land, performed upon his own land, and continued for twenty years. It may safely be affirmed, that the common law contained no such principle. The doctrine, as stated in the more recent decisions, appears to have arisen out of the misapplication in England of the principle, by which rights and easements are acquired' by the adverse claims and enjoyment of them for twenty years, to a case in which no adverse or injurious claim was either made or enjoyed.\u201d (Ib., 440, 441.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">This language is quoted with approval in a note to Qreenleaf\u2019s Treatise on Evidence, (2 Qreenl., \u00a7 589a,) and it is there said by the author, \u201cIt seems, that to constitute an <em>adverse </em>enjoyment of an incorporeal hereditament, the act of enjoyment must be of such a character as to afford ground for an action by the other party. It must be either a direct invasion of his vested rights, or else consequently injurious to their free exercise. The foundation of prescriptive title is the presumed grant of the party whose rights are adversely affected; but where it appears that the enjoyment has existed by the consent or license of such party, no presumption of grant can be made. Thus, in the case of lights, if the building in which they are made is erected on the party\u2019s own land, and no building stands on the land of the adjoining proprietor, it has been held, that against the latter no right is acquired by the lapse of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>These authorities, sustained as they most clearly are by principle, we think sufficient to warrant us in holding, that by the common law, a prescriptive right to prevent the adjacent proprietor from inclosing or building upon his own land cannot be acquired by the use of an adjoining house having windows looking out upon his land, and receiving light and air from that direction, for a period of ten years. If, as has been supposed, a contrary doctrine to that which has been maintained by these authorities would be of mischievous consequences in other States, where; in analogy to their statutes of limitations, a prescriptive title cannot be acquired until the lapse of twenty years, much \u25a0 more must it have such tendency'in this State, where, by the same analogy, the right to an easement may be acquired by an uninterrupted use and enjoyment for the shorter period of ten years. I apprehend, that the principle upon which it has been held such a right may be acquired has never been applied to the case of lights, to give a right within the period and under the circumstances upon which it is asserted in the present case. The occupant of a log-house in a new town, which had been founded but little more than ten years when the .right was asserted, denies the right of the adjoining proprietor to put a fence around his ldt, because it will occasion a partial obstruction of the light and air previously enjoyed by,the occupants for that period. The windows, it seems, are so low, that a fence of ordinary height cannot be built without obstructing the light, and the witnesses think the house diminished in value $25; and the plaintiff thereupon claims the prescriptive right to have her windows protected as \u201c ancient lights;\u201d and thereby, if need be, wholly to deprive the adjacent proprietor of the use of Ms lot, at least to deprive Mm of the right to build or improve upon it in such manner as his interest or fancy may dictate.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">It may safely be asserted, that the denial of the right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>another to the enjoyment and use of his property, upon a user of such a nature, and for such a length of time, has never been sustained by any court. The consequence of the admission of the right claimed by the plaintiff would be, that the occupants of low and inferior houses, such as are usually the first erected in new towns, at the end of a few years, would acquire rights without any act of adverse possession, which might render useless and waste the most valuable lots for business purposes or residences in onr growing towns and cities. A doctrine fraught with such consequences cannot be the common law of this country. Formerly, we are told, it was holden, that a party could not maintain an action for a nuisance to an ancient light, unless he had gained a right to the window by prescription. (1 Leon., p. 188; Oro. Eliz., p. 118.) But the modern doctrine is, that, upon proof of an adverse enjoyment of lights for twenty years or upwards, unexplained, a jury may be directed to presume a right by grant or otherwise. (2 Saund., 175a.) The modern doctrine may very well be applied to the acquisition, upon the presumption of a grant, of those easements of which there is such adverse enjoyment and user, as to lay a foundation for that presumption against the party who had so long suffered an invasion and \u25a0 denial of his rights, without asserting them. But, in a case like the present,' as has been seen, there is no such adverse enjoyment. No right of the defendant has been encroached upon by the use of the plaintiff\u2019s windows; and there can be no foundation for presuming a grant, as in the case of an adverse enjoyment of a right in analogy to the statute of limitations. The plaintiff cannot have acquired a right or interest in the defendant\u2019s lot merely on account of the manner in which she has used her own, upon any principle analogous to that upon which the statute proceeds. Nothing, as has been said, can be more certain, than that every one has a right to use his own as he pleases, provided he does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>thereby injure others; and it is inconceivable that, upon any principle, one can acquire a right or interest in that which is another\u2019s, merely by the manner in which he uses his own. <em>If </em>he could, it would result that one\u2019s right to the use and enjoyment of his property would become lost to him by the acts of another which in .no way affected him, and against which, consequently, he had no remedy, no means of redress-, or prevention, unless, as has been said, by building a wall between himself and his neighbor. Such cannot be the doctrine of the common law. And we think it has been sufficiently shown, that we have both principle and authority for holding that the present action cannot be maintained. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Every one who builds upon the margin of his lot, in a town or city, does so with a knowledge that the adjoining proprietor has the same right; and if he would not be put to inconvenience in consequence of the exercise by h'is neighbor of his right, he must have respect to that right in the uses to which he appropriates his own; so that he may enjoy his own, and at the same time suffer his neighbor to enjoy that which is his.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Our opinion upon the right of the plaintiff to maintain the action will dispense with the necessity of our opinion of the question of jurisdiction in the justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
