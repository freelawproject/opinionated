The case was tried before Hon. A. W. Terrell, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-6\">Adams sued George on a note, which purports to have been made by one Harrison to George, and, indorsed by George, passed into Harrison\u2019s hands, and then put into market by the maker. After the lapse of nearly four years George was sued as assignor. There was no allegation that Harrison <em>was </em>insolvent when suit should have been brought. George plead, under oath, in defense, that he never indorsed or assigned the note; that his name written across it was a forgery; and that suit was not brought to the first term of the court, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-7\">The want of the use of diligence was made the subject of special exceptions to the petition. The\u2019se were overruled, and the cause went to a jury, and, on the plea of <em>non est factum, </em>they returned a verdict for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-8\">The liability, was fixed by protest. The maker of the note swore to its being an accommodation note, and swore positively that he saw George make the indorsement; and swore that he, the maker, was insolvent when it matured, and for eighteen months afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-9\">The preponderance of the evidence is against the note being in the handwriting of George, though many witnesses on both sides express doubt. One witness swore that George was in Shelbyville, Kentucky, at the date of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-10\">The court submitted to the jury the issue'of the indorsement <em>tel non.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-11\"><em>W.

Reid, 11 Tex., 581, for presumption that draft sued on was mercantile paper, and as to burden of proof to show the contrary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-7\">In Cunningham v. The State, 5 Tex., 440, it was <em>held, </em>\u201cThat one positive witness, whose testimony is not impeached, is worth more than half a dozen who are not certain as to a given fact.\u201d The first portion of the 3d instruction is not so strong as it should have been, and even its force was very much weakened by the subsequent part. \u201cBut it is the- peculiar province of the jury to determine on the weight of testimony, and to render their verdict in favor of that party in whose favor the facts and <em>circumstances </em>prep on derate. \u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-8\"><em>John Ireland, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK3\">\u2014The exceptions to the petition should have been sustained. The note was hot between merchant and merchant. (Oliphant v. Dallas, 15 Tex., 140, 141; Locke v. Huling, 24 Tex., 312, 313.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-9\">The liability of an indorser can only be fixed by protest, in cases between merchant and merchant. - (Patrick v. Payne, 21 Tex., 680.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-10\">The reason given by the court for overruling the motion for a new trial amounts to nothing. If a ruling be correct, it matters nothing that the court assigns a wrong reason.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b392-11\">Roberts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Askf\">\u2014There is no error in the charge of the court. The statement of facts shows a conflict in the evidence upon the main point at issue, to wit, the execution of the indorsement of the note, which was denied under oath. The facts in proof upon that point seem to preponderate against the verdict, supposing equal credit due to all the witnesses. Still, there is no deficiency in the evidence on the side of the verdict. The jury might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>found cither way, and there would have heen evidence sufficient to sustain their verdict. Under the facts thus presented, we do not feel warranted in interrupting the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">It is contended that the judgment should be reversed, because the court below overruled the motion for a new trial, and assigned as the reason for it; \u201c that the defendant\u2019s demurrer and special exceptions to the petition ought to have been sustained.\u201d This reason is entirely irrelevant to the motion, and it is hardly to be supposed that the district judge would have acted on that alone, had he believed it to have been proper to grant a new trial. Had he believed that the new trial should have been granted, it would surely have occurred to him, as the proper course, to set aside the verdict, and then, if the petition were not amended so as to make it good, dismiss the cause by sustaining the exceptions to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">But, suppose the reason assigned were the only one upon which the court acted; it simply amounts to the fact, that the grounds set forth in the motion for a new trial were not considered by the court when it was being acted on. The only effect which that could have would be, to remove the presumption in favor of a verdict arising from its being sustained by the court upon a motion for a new trial. The action of the court in overruling the motion would none the less be the judgment of the court upon the motion. A court declares its determination upon a question properly submitted through its recorded judgment, and not through the reasons, either relevant or irrelevant, that may be assigned for such judgment. Such judgment only is a proper subject of revision in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The judgment is therefore \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
