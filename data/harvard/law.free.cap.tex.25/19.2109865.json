Tried below before the Hon. M. P.

This application was opposed by Jonas Marks &amp; Co., and other creditors of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-5\">On a hearing of the application, it appearing to the court that the homestead set apart as aforesaid was encumbered with a claim for the purchase money thereof, to the amount of three hundred dollars, and the widow having paid that amount in order to perfect the title, it was ordered and adjudged by the court, that the sum of three hundred dollars be appropriated out of the estate and allowed her, in addition to the homestead set apart as aforesaid, with interest thereon from the date of payment. From this order she appealed to the District Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-6\">On the 80th day of October, 1857, the cause was determined in the latter court, and the judgment of the County Court was affirmed. The petition for a writ of .error was filed on the 14th day of March, 1859, by the plaintiff in error, describing herself therein as administratrix of the estate of David Peabody, deceased; and on the 5th day of January, 1860, she filed a bond for costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-7\">The defendants in error filed a motion' to dismiss the writ of error, because the bond was not filed, and the writ of error was not granted in the court below before the expiration of two years from the rendition of the judgment complained of.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-8\"><em>Allen &amp; </em>Hale, for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-9\"><em>Ballinger &amp; </em>Jack, for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyP\">In 6 Tex.

Rep., 400, it was decided, that a writ of error might be prosecuted which would not be suspensive of execution without a bond for costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-10\">The Act of February 5th, 1858, provides that \u201cno writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>error to remove a cause from the District to the Supreme Court, shall in any case issue, unless the plaintiff in error give bond, with sufficient security, for all the costs which may accrue in the Supreme Court, and which may have accrued in the District Court.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-5\">The provision, that \u201c no security shall be exacted of executors or administrators of deceased persons\u2019 estates in appeals taken in suing for such money or property, or in defending suits brought against such estates for money or property,\u201d (Oldham &amp; White\u2019s Digest, Art. 532,) does not apply:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-6\">1. Because this is not an \u201cappeal,\u201d at all; nor <em>from a </em>suit, such as is contemplated by the statute. The statute will not be extended by construction. (Ledbetter, adm\u2019r, v.

The writ of error is by the widow, in her own right, for her personal benefit, claiming in hostility to the estate, and against its judgment creditors, and is not within the statute. (Battle v. Howard, 13 T., 348.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-8\">3. The Act of February 5th, 1853, is explicit, admitting of no exception, that <em>in all cases </em>a bond for costs must be given to obtain a writ of error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-9\">There can be no doubt that this was intended, as it expresses, to <em>all cases.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-10\">The statute did not intend that the clerk of the Supreme Court should have cost bills for $10 or $15, against estates in almost every county in the State, to be paid \u201cin due course of administration,\u201d and on which he could have no execution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-11\"><em>Cummings, </em>also for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b29-12\">Bell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWA\">We are of opinion that the motion to dismiss the writ of error in this case must be sustained. The matter in controversy is one which concerns the plaintiff in error individually, and not in her representative capacity. The homestead rights, in relation to which the controversy arose, are accorded to her by the law, as the widow of the intestate, and not as the administratrix of his estate. She would have the same rights if she were not administratrix. The controversy being one which concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>her individually, she is required to give bond for costs before she can obtain a writ of error, in like manner as other persons are required to enter into bond by the 13th section of the Act of February 5th, 1858. (See Battle v. Howard, 13th Tex., 345.) The Act of February 5th, 1858, provides that \u201cno writ of error to remove a cause from the District to the Supreme Court shall in any case issue, unless the plaintiff in error give bond, with sufficient security, for all the costs which may accrue,\u201d &amp;c. We think that this Act, taken in connection with the provisions of the Act of 13th May, 1846, in relation to writs of error, (Hart. Dig., Arts. 793, 794,) must be held to mean, that a party applying for a writ of error must execute the bond for costs, and put himself in a condition to demand the ..citation \u2022 in error, within two years from the rendition of the judgment sought to be revised. The filing of the petition for the writ of error, without the bond for costs, secures no right to the party, and devolves no duty upon the clerk. If the party applying for the writ should file his petition for the writ at one time, within two years from the rendition of the judgment, and at a subsequent time, also within two years from the rendition of the judgment, should file his bond for costs, he would undoubtedly be entitled to the -writ. In other words, the filing of the petition, and the execution and filing of the bond, need not be simultaneous, provided both are done within two years from the rendition of the judgment. If the petition and the bond are filed within two years from the rendition of the judgment, the citation may be issued by the clerk after the two years have expired ; because, before the expiration of the two years, the party has secured the right to the writ .by filing his petition and executing the necessary bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">But if the petition and- bond are not filed within two years after the rendition of the judgment sought to be revised, the party does not entitle himself to the writ. The judgment sought to be revised in this case was rendered on the 30th of October, 1857, and the bond for costs was not filed until the 5th of January, 1860.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The motion to dismiss the writ of error is sustained. Ordered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
