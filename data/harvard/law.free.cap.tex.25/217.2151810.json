Pryor, deceased; that while witness did not keep the $800 in specie, he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>replace it from time to time as lie appropriated it for his own purposes, which appropriation he made of it when he thought proper. (Plaintiff offered and read a schedule of claimant\u2019s separate estate, which had heen recorded in accordance with the act to provide for the registration of the separate property of married women.) (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Arts. 4996-5000.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-6\">On cross-examination, the witness said: He married claimant in the State of Tennessee; both lived there at the time; claimant\u2019s father died in Tennessee; claimant, with others, (being children,) got her share of his estate; among claimant\u2019s allotment was the negro girl sold to his brother-in-law; that witness took possession of the negro girl, as the husband, and had possession of her during four years in Kentucky, prior to 1852, when he sold the negro; that he lived near the Tennessee line, in Kentucky; that he carried the negro to his brother-in-law, in Tennessee, and sold her, executed a bill of sale, and delivered her, and received the purchase-money; that the negroes now in his possession were acquired by his wife from her father\u2019s estate in the same way; that he bought the carriage in Louisiana in his own name, and thus accepted a receipt; he sold the carriage in his own name to Davis, in the summer of 1859.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-7\">Miller Davis, a witness for claimant,'said: Mrs. Keyser always claimed the carriage and horse as her separate property; has heard her claim frequently, before and after the levy of the execution.

There is no evidence that the marriage was contracted in view of a removal to the State of Kentucky, and residence in that State. The marital rights of the plaintiff in error and her husband, in respect to the negro girl which descended to the plaintiff in error from her father\u2019s estate, in the State of Tennessee, depended, therefore, upon the laws of Tennessee, and not upon the laws of Kentucky, to which State the parties removed after their marriage. There was no proof whatever respecting the laws of Tennessee. The first instruction given by the court below to the jury, was, therefore, error. That instruction was, that if the negro girl, sold in Kentucky, was inherited or received by \"will by the claimant, (Mrs. Keyser,) prior to the year A. D. 1850, and that before that time there was no statute law there (that is, in Kentucky) protecting and vesting the said property in the said claimant, as her separate property, then the possession by the husband, and the sale of said negro, vested the proceeds in the husband, and the same would- be subject to execution; and the court added, that, these things being so, the jury should find for the plaintiff in the execution. c 1</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Row, it is plain that these things might all be so, and yet, if the laws of Tennessee made the negro girl the sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>arate property of the wife, Mrs. Keyser, the girl would have remained her separate property after the removal to Kentucky; and, even after a valid sale of the girl, the proceeds would have remained the separate property of the wife. The instruction of the court was, therefore, erroneous. It required the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff in execution upon facts which did, not authorize such a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">T-he whole evidence, taken together, shows that the plaintiff in the execution was entitled to have a verdict and judgment in his favor; hut we do not feel inclined, in the exercise of jurisdiction which is strictly appellate, to affirm a judgment in a case in which the jury acted under an instruction clearly erroneous. . We will, therefore, reverse the judgment, and remand the cause for another trial, that the law of the case may he respected, as well as the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
