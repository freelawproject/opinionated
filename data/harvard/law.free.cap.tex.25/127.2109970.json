H, Boxey for $500, as the value of his services as an attorney, rendered the defendant in the prosecution of a certain .cause for murder. Four witnesses, attorneys-at-law, proved the services rendered as alleged, and that they were reasonably worth $500. One of the witnesses testified that it was worth to prosecute the case $1000 or $1500. Several of the witnesses testified to the ability and fidelity with which the plaintiff conducted the proseen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>tion. At the time of the engagement ef the plaintiff\u2019s services, he was a partner of James B. Hancock, deceased at the institution of this suit; they both attended and rendered services on the trial before the committing court. In the District Court, Hancock having died, the plaintiff rendered his services on the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-4\">The defendant introduced a witness who testified <em>\u201c </em>that Hancock said to him just after the trial before the justice of the peace, that if he were continued in the case by Doxey, in the District Court, he would charge an amount not remembered by the witness, but thinks it was not over $250, or $300, and that he had not then fixed upon a fee for what had been done.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-5\">Verdict for plaintiff for $125, and judgment accordingly.

And yet they returned a verdict for only one hundred and twenty-five dollars. The verdict appears to have been plainly contrary to the evidence. We are unable to perceive any ground upon which a new trial could be rightly refused, and are of opinion that the refusal of it was error, for which the judgment must be reversed and the cause-remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Reversed and remanded*</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
