Being made payable one day after date, th\u00e9 note did not mature and become due on the 8th of April, 1859. (O. &amp; W., Art. 411; Edwards on Bills and Promissory bTotes, 514; Chitty on Bills, 264 ; Hartford Bank v. Barry, 17 Mass., 94; Henry v. Jones, 8 Mass., 453; Hopping v.

A judgment by default was rendered, and one of the errors assigned is, that \u201c the record in this ease shows that this suit was prematurely brought, and that no right of action. had accrued to the plaintiffs against the defendants at the time of the institution of this suit; the promissory note on which the -suit is brought not being then due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">This objection is well taken. The note, though \u201cnegotiable and assignable by law,\u201d was not shown to have been a \u201c contract between merchant and merchant, their factors or agents.\u201d (O. &amp; W. Dig., Art. 99; Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 236.) Three days of grace not being allowed, it was due on the '8th day of April, 1859. The maker had the whole of that day within which to pay his debt. The case is not involved in any question of demand and protest on that day. It is therefore clear, that no right of action did accrue until after the expiration of that day.
