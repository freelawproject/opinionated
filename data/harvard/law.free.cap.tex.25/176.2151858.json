J. J. Hodges.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b192-5\">The affix of guardian or administrator to the plaintiff\u2019s name is mere personal description, and inconsistencies in such description in the record are immaterial, because the whole may be stricken out as surplusage.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Abv\">Error from Gonzales.

Fielding Jones, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-8\">Hodges, who was the guardian of the minor children of Virginia and Calpurnia Jones, heirs of A.

Hill. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-9\">The citation described \u201cHodges, administrator\u201d of A. Jones, deceased.

J. Hodges, administrator. It does not conform to the pleadings. (Whitehead v. Herron, 15 Tex., 128; Sayles\u2019 Prac., \u00a7586; Rowan v. Lee, 3 J. J. Marsh., 97.) The petition in error follows the judgment, and the citation in error served on J. J. Hodges describes defendant in error as guardian for Virginia and Calpurnia Jones.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-12\"><em>Mr. Harwood,, </em>for defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApW\">suggested delay, which opened the whole case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b192-13\">Bell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AH3\">\u2014The plaintiff describes himself, in the petition, as the guardian of the minor children, Virginia and Calpurnia Jones. The note sued on describes him as the \u201cguardian of the minor children of A. Jones, deceased.\u201d He is also described as guardian in the citation. But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>judgment is rendered in Ms favor, naming Mm as J. J. Hodges, administrator, as aforesaid.\u201d -He had nowhere before been called administrator, excejpt in the statement of the cause preliminary to the entry of judgment. He is called \u201c administrator \u201d in the bond for error and in the citation in error. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Although all this exhibits great negligenc'e in maMng up the record in the different stages of the cause, we do not think it is error, for wMch the judgment can be reversed. The words \u201cguardian,\u201d &amp;c., and \u201cadministrator,\u201d may be treated, wherever they occur, as mere surplusage, or as merely descriptive of the person named.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\"We will decline, however, to award damages, because of the suing out of the writ of error. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Apeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
