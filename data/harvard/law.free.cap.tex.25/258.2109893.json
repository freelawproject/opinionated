The title relied on by the plaintiff was a grant to Rafael Manch\u00f3la of four leagues of land, which was incomplete at the time of his death; the title of possession whereof was issued to the said Maria Jesus de Leon de Manch\u00f3la as his widow, and said possessory title was ratified subsequently by the Governor on April 25th, 1835.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-7\">The plaintiff introduced as evidence the testimonio to the said Maria Jesus de Leon de Manch\u00f3la, with the accompanying documents, as follows: The petition of Rafael Manch\u00f3la, February 12th, 1829, for four leagues of land, which he solicited on the terms prescribed by the colonization law of the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-8\">Its reference to the ayuntamiento of Goliad to report according to article 17th of the colonization law, dated Leona Vicario, February 14th, 1829.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-9\">Report as to the locality, and the qualifications of the applicant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-10\">The concession made at Leona Vicario, on the 5th February^ 1830, of four leagues, as an augmentation headright; and commissioner general directed to give possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-11\">Petition of Rafael Manch\u00f3la 8th October, 1830, that the alcalde of Goliad may give possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-12\">Corresponding direction to the alcalde.

It was contended, under the evidence on the subject by the plaintiff that she had not voluntarily abandoned her residence in Texas, and by the defendants, that she had done so, and acquired one in Mexico.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-17\">The defendants asked \u2022 the court to instruct the jury that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>they believed from the evidence, that she at any time before the institution of this suit, voluntarily fixed her permanent residence in Mexico, after it became a country foreign to Texas, by her revolution, that she lost what right she may have acquired under the testimonio, and the plaintiff cannot recover. Which the court refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">They also asked an instruction, that the testimonio of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate is void for want of authority in the alcalde to issue it under the concession to Rafael Manch\u00f3la; and is not validated by the document annexed thereto, purporting to be a ratification by the Governor of Coahuila. Which was also refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\">Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for the land sued for.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-7\"><em>Pryor Lea, </em>for the appellants</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARR\">If the title of Madam Manch\u00f3la can be sustained, it must be on one of two grounds\u2014either that she had a community interest in a vested right, or that she had a right by succession from her husband.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-8\">The first alternative presents a controlling question, whether the title passed to Rafael Manch\u00f3la by the concession. The negative is established by the principles uniformly asserted by this court, with particular reference to colonial and headright titles. (Trimble <em>et al </em>v. Administrator of Smithers, 1 Tex. R., 790; Webb <em>et als. </em>v. Webb, Administrator, 15 Tex. R., 274; Hamilton v. Menefee, 11 Tex. R., 718; Hart v. Gibbons, 14 Tex. R., 213; Morris v. Brinlee, 14 Tex. R., 285; Hancock v. McKinney, 7 Tex. R., 384.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-9\">The foregoing cases are cited, and others might be added, to show controlling analogies against the title in question. The decided cases are not like the present in all respects, but they conduce to establish certain principles, which negative the right of Madam Manch\u00f3la, and the authority of the alcalde to give her the testimonio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-10\">The concession was merely a preliminary proceeding, and not a vested right. <em>Locus pmnitentice </em>pertained to each party during the life of Rafael Manch\u00f3la. The consideration on his part was entirely prospective, for he was a Mexican inhabitant, and never paid anything, and otherwise never did any thing, to procure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>land, except to ask for it. The bounds of his claim were not defined, although they were specified in his petition, for they were rendered vague by the action of the ayuntamiento and the executive. Either from dissatisfaction, or from some other cause, the applicant never had any action on his concession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-5\">****** *</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-6\">From the premises, . which negative active consideration, and certainty of locality, and possession, the inference is plain, that Madam Manch\u00f3la had no community interest at the time of her husband\u2019s death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-7\">In the case of Hamilton v. Menefee, 11 Tex. R., 718, this court said, in substance, that the title of Buentello was good, at least, in equity, before the giving of his testimonio; but the elements of that title were full payment by most meritorious services, established possession, and express recognition of right in the empresario contract, so that the testimonio was only a form for the pre-existing substance of. a perfect right. No colonial title,, (it is believed,) has ever obtained a standing in court, when any essential element was wanting. The distinction is vital between the perfect and the imperfect, in substance. A community interest attaches on acquisition\u2014but acquisition is title\u2014and title against the government is substantial perfection. If any thing less could vest a qualified right, the smallest incipiency could, also, vest a right with additional qualifications, but nothing less can change the ownership, in a legal sense. It follows that Madam Manch\u00f3la did not have a vested community interest in the imperfect claim of her husband; and in this aspect of the case, there being no vested equity, the testimonio is without authority.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-8\">The alternative aspect presents the question, whether Madam Manch\u00f3la had any right by succession from her husband. This case is plainly distinguishable from one of ordinary headright with reference to the persons who might take. In a case of ordinary headlight, the fixed facts determined the preliminary and equal right of acquisition in each head of a family, and a surviving husband or wife took title on individual right, and not on the former marital association. Every head of a family, as such, was entitled to procure an ordinary headright. Thus far, Madam Man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>chola might have obtained a concession and testimonio without reference to any peculiar attributes, either of her husband or of herself; and, on a satisfactory showing to the governor of her own peculiar merits, she might have obtained an augmentation. But neither of these legal modes was adopted. The testimonio, therefore, must depend on the assumption and pretext of the alcalde, that a widow, as such, was entitled to take the benefit of her husband\u2019s mere concession for an undefined augmentation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-4\">No such law of succession is known. But, on the contrary, and by the express terms of article 17, augmentations were to be made on peculiar circumstances, connected with particular persons, on special judgments of the governor. The idea would seem to be necessarily absurd, that such a grant, being an exception to a general rule, a favor on individual and personal attributes in part, could be appropriated by another person who might not have any such attribute, and without any judgment of the governor on the qualifications of the recipient. The one might be worthy of all favor, while the other might be utterly unworthy ; and what might be well conceded to one person, might be denied to another, with great propriety. Moreover, if the circumstances preceding possession, as inducements for giving it, should become essentially changed, it could not be given at all. When the previously adjudicated preliminaries were not existing, the foundation of authority for giving possession would be removed. Where adjudicated personal attributes must constitute a consideration, its failure must abrogate the right to have a completion of an incipient executory arrangement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-6\">From the premises, it follows conclusively that the alcalde had no authority to give the testimonio, neither on any community interest, nor on any right of a widow by succession, and, consequently, the pretended title was simply void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-7\">From the foregoing conclusion, it appears that the District Court erred, both in refusing to give the instruction requested by the defendants, that the title was void, and in the given instructions by which the -original title was sustained, as authorized by the concession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-8\">II. A secondary and incidental question arises on the docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ment, called a ratification, which is appended to the testimonio, and purports to have been made by the governor, and authenticated by the seal of the State of Coahuila and Texas. There was no extrinsic proof of authenticity, but the seal, in appearance, was such as the law prescribes for the State seal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-5\">The question is, whether that document has any force ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-6\">The first objection is, that the document is not proved. There is no presumption in favor of it, but the presumption is adverse to it, because it is a departure from common usage and from express law. By usage and law the testimonio is the end of the title, according to decisions of this court, already cited, and quite familiar. Such pretended ratification, therefore, is not an official but a private act, without authority, and it carries no intrinsic evidence of its authenticity. A seal, when used without official authority, affords no evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-7\">But a second objection is, that this document is nugatory, even if really made as it purports, because the title was either good without such ratification or it was incapable of ratification. If the alcalde had authority to make the testimonio it needed no such aid, but if he did not have authority, the testimonio was merely void. The rule is universal, that competent authority may ratify or confirm irregular or defective grants which may have been imperfectly made by competent authority, but such, grants as are absolutely void cannot be ratified nor confirmed, there being no legal foundation for such action, and the case involving an entire creation. Even the Spanish law expressly recognizes this principle, so that the arbitrary sovereign cannot ratify a void grant, for the palpable reason that there is no legal entity on which the decree can take effect. But the bad policy of such a mode of action is given as another reason. And, in a government of distributed and defined powers, a further and conclusive reason is found in the want of authority in any officer, even the highest, to depart from the prescribed sphere of subjects and modes for his action..</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-8\">notwithstanding the pretended ratification, the testimonio remained void, and the court should have instructed the jury that the plaintiff had no title.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>McKinney, for the appellee</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOu\">The first objection is that <em>\u201c </em>the testimonio to Madam Manch\u00f3la was void for want of authority in the alcalde to issue it under the concession to Rafael Manch\u00f3la. And to that effect, appellant\u2019s counsel requested the District Court to charge the jury, which was refused, and in which the court was clearly sustained by the law and the facts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-5\">The objection (the court will see,) is not that the officer had no jurisdiction or authority to act, but that he had no authority to act in the manner in which he did act. How or why the officer acted is not a matter to be inquired into by this court. It is eno.ugh to know the officer had authority to act, and that he has acted and issued the title which is shown in this case. There is no question as to the jurisdiction of the alcalde to act in the premises. The presumption is that the officer authorized by law to issue the title has done his duty and acted in all respects in conformity to law. (Jenkins v. Chambers, 9 Tex., 167.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-6\">The officer having authority under the 17th article of the colonization law of 1825, to increase the quantity of land, was the judge of the qualifications of the applicant, and his decision was final, unless fraud be shown on the part of the grantee. (Same authority, 9 Tex., 167.) Here no attempt was made to show either <em>want </em>of <em>authority </em>in the officer to make the grant, or <em>fraud </em>on the part of the grantee in obtaining it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-7\">Whether title issued to Madam Manch\u00f3la, either on the ground that she had a community interest in a vested right, or that she had a right by succession from her husband, is not important; nor is it necessary to enquire whether the title passed to Manch\u00f3la by the concession. The testimonio is the final title; and all enquiry as to the proceedings of the officer anterior to the issuance of the grant is precluded, when it appears (as in this case) the officer had authority the make the grant, and no fraud is charged on the part of the grantee. All the proceedings necessary to the grant are conclusive. (Stringer v. Lessee of Young, 3 Peters\u2019 R., 320; United States v. Arredondo, 6 Wheat., 729; Brown v. Jackson, 7 Wheat., 218.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-8\">Under the colonization laws the wife was as much entitled to the bounty of the government as the husband, for the reason she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>often paid as much for the land in the performance of onerous duties; and it was intended that the family should be the' recipients of the bounty of the government collectively, and not individually. In the case of Jenkins v. Chambers, (9 Tex., 380,) the court say: The family is to' be provided for: it is for them that the bounty is- intended; and if the grant be made to accomplish this design, it fulfills all the purposes intended or contemplated by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-5\">The concession to Rafael Manch\u00f3la was for four leagues\u2014the grant to his widow is for two. She certainly was entitled to land, and she may have relinquished her claim to the other two; and if she were entitled to any land, the grant, in that event, could only be voidable; and a subsequent locator, having no equity at the date of the grant, could not attack the grant on that ground. (Maxcy v. O\u2019Conner, 23 Tex. R., 234.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-6\">As to the ratification of the testimonio by the governor, this was done by him in confirmation of the acts of the alcalde, and to show he had proceeded legally in the discharge of his official duty in issuing the title, and we must presume, he had authority for his act; otherwise, we would have to presume that the governor and alcalde both united to swindle the government, which will not be done; but, on the contrary, that these officers had authority to do what they did do. The testimonio proved itself\u2014it has the great seal of the State affixed by the proper authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-7\">What could have been the object of the governor in ratifying the act of the alcalde, but to do his duty both to the government and to the grantee? It could not have been to perpetrate a fraud on the government; for, if the alcalde had dono so, it needed no act by the governor to ratify a fraudulent act of the alcalde.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-8\">It has not been shown that any positive law was violated by the governor, in attaching his ratification to the grant; and until that is done, the validity of the grant can not be questioned by appellants.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b274-9\">Wheeler, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2Z\">On the question of the alleged abandonment of the country and alienage of the plaintiff, there is nothing in this case to distinguish it from the cases \"heretofore decided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>this court, in which that defence was held to he unavailing. (Hardy v. De Leon, 5 Tex. R., 211; Kilpatrick v. Sisneros, 23 Tex. R., 113, decided at the Galveston Session of 1859.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">It is insisted, for the appellants, that the title of the plaintiff was issued without the authority of law, and is void; and that no validity was imparted to it by the act of confirmation by the governor, of the 25th of April, 1835.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">It may well be doubted whether the concession to Rafael Manch\u00f3la was an authority to the alcalde to issue the title of possession to his widow. But it is not perceived that it was not entirely competent for the governor to validate the title thus issued, by his subsequent ratification of the action of the alcalde, and confirmation of the title, though it had been issued without authority. It would seem too plain to admit of question, that the power to grant must include the power to confirm a title. It was the constant practice of the authorities entrusted with the granting of lands under the former government of the country, to perfect incipient or inchoate titles by a final act of confirmation. It can not be doubted that the governor might have granted the land to Madam Manch\u00f3la; and if so, it is difficult to comprehend upon what principle his power to confirm the title already issued, though invalid for the want of a previous authority in the officer, can be denied. It is a familiar principle in the law of agency, that a subsequent ratification is as effectual to give validity to the act done, as an authority previously confirmed. It is not perceived why that principle should not apply to a case like the present, when the exercise of the granting power is not \u2018restricted to the observance of any prescribed formality which is wanting. If it be not a question of compliance with any requisite formality, but of power in the officer, it can not be denied that the power which can grant can confirm a title.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">But the admissibility in evidence of the act of confirmation was objected to on the ground that there was no evidence of its genuineness, and it is proper to decide upon its admissibility in evidence before pronouncing definitively upon its legal effect. The question is, whether, coming from the possession of the interested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>party, the instrument proves itself by its mere production in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">There is no doubt that it would have been received in evidence in the courts before the change of government; and if it were an entirely new question in this court, it might be contended, with much force, that oar courts should -officially take notice of the authentic acts of the authorities of the former government. But the question was considered by this court at an early day, and the opinion was entertained, and has been constantly acted on in practice, that, in order to the prevention of frauds, some evidence ought to be produced of the genuineness of such instruments before they are received in evidence.\" Thus, in Paschal v. Perez, (7 Tex. R., 338,) in treating of the admissibility of a testimonio or copy of an instrument which remains an archive of a now foreign government, as is the case here, Chief Justice Hemphill said: \u201cIf testimonios or copies are admitted without restrictions, a wide door is opened for the admission of fraudulent or forged titles. Their falsity and fictitious character cannot be tested by original records or evidence within the limits of our own jurisdiction.\u201d (Id., 364.) Again, it is said: \u201c Had the original testimonio, or second original as it is sometimes called, been produced, and the signature proved, it would have been, of itself, at least <em>prima facie </em>evidence of title.\u201d (Id., 363.) It was held in the same case, and again in the case of Edward v. James, (Id., 372,) that the testimonio, or second original title to lands, was within the provision of the registry act of 1836, and might legally be admitted to record, upon proof of the hand-writing of the signer. In DeLeon v. White, (9 Tex. R., 600,) proof of the execution of the testimonio was treated as being requisite. The opinion appears to have been entertained at an early day, and to have been constantly acted on in practice, that some extrinsic evidence of genuineness ought to be produced to admit these instruments in evidence. And in all the numerous cases which have come before this court for adjudication, some such evidence has been produced. In no case has it been held that the instrument proves itself, without the aid of any extrinsic circumstance tending to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>prove its genuineness. If, in any case, such evidence should <em>be </em>required, it should be the present. It is not the case of a concession addressed to an officer, whose province it was to pass upon its genuineness, and to act upon it by extending the title It derives no aid from a recognition by any other officer of the government. It is itself the final act imparting validity to the title. It does not come from the official custody of any officer of the present government, but from the possession of the interested party, more than twenty years after it purports to have issued from the office of a since foreign government, where the original is supposed to remain. . There is no evidence of its ever having been deposited, subject to examination, in any office of this government. If there is any case in which, in order to guard against frauds, some evidence of the genuineness of the document ought to be required, it is the case of an instrument offered under circumstances like the present. And we think the views which the court has hitherto entertained upon the question, and the uniform practice conforming to those views, a sufficient warrant for holding that such evidence ought to be produced. There is less reason for requiring it where the original is an archive of the general land office. But no case has come under my observation where the party relying upon the testimonio, instead of a land office copy of the original, has not seen proper to prove the execution of the testimonio, though the protocol was an archive of that office. Whether that be necessary, may be decided when the question is presented. For the present, it will suffice to say that where the original is an archive of a foreign government, and there is no means of testing its genuineness, or the verity of the proffered testimonio, by any record or other evidence within the limits of our own jurisdiction, we think it' safer to adhere to the practice which has heretofore obtained, and require the production of some extrinsic evidence of the execution or genuineness of the instrument. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the court erred in overruling the objection to the admission of the instrument in evidence. As this case must be remanded for a hew trial, it may <em>be </em>upon other. additional evidence to that produced upon the-former trial, and it may not become necessary, we think proper to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>abstain for the present from the expression of an opinion upon the other questions in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded,</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
