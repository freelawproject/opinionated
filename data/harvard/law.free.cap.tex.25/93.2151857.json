The case was tried before Hon. A. \"W.

The plaintiff prosecuted error, and assigned for error a technical objection to the service; and also, that the suit was brought before the cause of action accrued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-12\">The defendant in error suggested delay, which opened all objections apparent upon the record.

J. </em>Thornton, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyL\">\u2014\u201cIn computing the time when bills and notes, payable a certain number of days, months, or years after date, become due, the rule is, to exclude the day of the date from the calculation, and include the day of payment.\u201d (Edwards on Bills and Promissory Notes, p. 514; Chitty on Bills, p. 264; Hartford Bank v. Barry, 17 Mass. Rep., 94; Henry v. Jones, 8 Mass. Rep., 453; Ripley v. Greenleaf, 2 Vt. Rep., 129.) The note in this case, then, being dated on the 1st day of Hovember, 1857, payable eleven months after date, fell due on the 1st day of October, 1858. The rule, as set\u2022tled in the case of Osborn v. Moncure, 3 Wend., 170, is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>that the makers of a promissory note have until the last instant of the day on which it falls due in which to make the payment. (See also Hopping v. Quinn, 12 Wend., 517; Thomas v. Shoemaker, 6 Watts &amp; Serg., 179; also, Edwards on Bills and Promissory Notes, 525 to 527, where the whole question is reviewed.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">This suit having been instituted before expiration of the credit agreed upon in the note, and before any right of action on the note had accrued to the defendants in error, yet, inasmuch as the note was due at and before the time of the rendition of the judgment of the District Court, can that judgment for that reason be held to be valid? I think most clearly not. The defendants in error could only maintain their action upon a breach of the promise contained in the note, and that breach must have been made; and a right of action against the plaintiff in error must have subsisted <em>at the time </em>of the institution of the suit. Nothing which may afterwards happen, and which is not alleged in the petition, can be inquired into by the court; and the rights of the defendants in error to maintain their suit must rest upon the legal cause of complaint as it existed at the time of the institution of the suit. If they had no good cause of action against the plaintiffs in error at that time, then no good cause of action is alleged against the makers of the promissory note, and the judgment of the District Court must be reversed and the cause dismissed.

Anderson, 1 Tex., 93.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-7\"><em>John P. </em>White, for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b111-8\">Egberts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azi\">\u2014The note sued oh in this case appears, from the recitals in the petition, to have been a contract between merchant and merchant, and assignable and negotiable by law. The makers were entitled to three days of grace under our statute. (O. &amp; W. Dig., Art. 99.) Being dated on the 1st day of November, 1857, and payable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>\u201c eleven months after date,\u201d it was not due, including the three days of grace, until the 4th day of October, 1858; excluding them, it would be due on the 1st day of October. The suit was brought on the 1st day of October, 1858 ; which was certainly before any right of action had accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u201cWhen a bill is drawn, payable so many months after date, the computation is made by the calendar, and (without counting the days of grace) the bill will become due on the day of the month corresponding with the day of the date; that is, if it be dated on the 10th day of the month, it will become due on the 10th.\u201d (Edwards on .Bills and \u00a1Notes, 515.)
