To show that it charges an offence known to the law, the court is referred to Art. 409. Penal Code. The offence, too, is charged with all the strictness required by law. Alleging the ownership or character of the house is mere surplusage. (See Prior v. the State, 4 Tex. 383; Wilson v. State, 5 Tex. 31.) In the latter case the indictment charged the playing to have taken place near McFadden\u2019s grocery, in a public place, at Black Jack Springs in Fayette county. The court held the use of the term \u201cpublic place,\u201d a sufficient description of the <em>locus in quo, </em>under Art. 1474, Hart. Dig., which is similar in this respect to the article of the Code under which this indictment is found. They held, in effect, as in Prior\u2019s case, that striking out all the volume of the words of description, except public place, the indictment .Would still be good. This indictment has rejected all such surplusage, and made use of the all sufficient one <em>\u201c </em>public house.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b662-9\">Roberts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_zx\">This indictment charged that the defendant did play at a game with cards \u201cin a certain public house.\u201d The court sustained a motion to quash it on account of the generality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>snd vagueness in stating the place at which the playing took place. The term public house is generic in its character, and is intended by the law to include all houses made public by the occupation carried on in them, as inns, taverns, storehouses for retailing liquors, or those made public by the resort of numerous persons, or in any other way. These words are not appropriate to indicate the facts which constitute the par acular offence intended to be charged. (The State v. West, 10 Tex. R., 555; Ib., 309; Arch. C. Pl., 46\u20147. Wharton\u2019s A. C. L. 366 and 86, note 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Judgment affirmed, .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
