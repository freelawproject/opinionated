Clement C. Fitch.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b324-5\">The 14th section of the act of the 12th May, 1846, (which but re-enacts the 9th section of the act of the 28th December, 1836,) reads as follows: \u201cEvery sheriff and deputy sheriff shall indorse on all process and precepts coming to their hands the day on which they received them, the manner in which they executed them, and the day when they executed them, and shall sign their return officially.\" (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 5121, Note 1122.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b324-6\">To authorize a judgment by default, the return on the citation should show a compliance with the statute, and one of the plain requirements of the \u25a0statute is, that the return shall show the day when the writ was served.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b324-7\">(For full notes on the requirements for good service, see Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 1433, Bote 545, p. 352.)</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-8\">Error from Collin.

We are of opinion that the service was not sufficient to authorize the judgment, and for the reason indicated. The statute requires that \u201c the sheriff shall indorse on all process and precepts coming to his hands the day on which he received them, the manner in which he executed them, and the day when he executed them,\u201d &amp;c. To authorize a judgment by default, the return on the citation should show a compliance with the statute, and one of the plain requirements of the statute is, that the return shall show the day when the writ was served.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">\u25a0Kemanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
