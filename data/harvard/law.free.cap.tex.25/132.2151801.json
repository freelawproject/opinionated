P. </em>[l. s.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\">To the reading of this the defendants objected, for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-6\">1. Because the record did not show that the court had jurisdiction of the subject-matter, or the person of James R. Pace, at the time of the rendition thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-7\">2. Tiiat the judgment appears to have been rendered upon motion, against the defendant, when it does not appear, from the transcript or other evidence, that the defendant was ever served with notice of such motion, or that he appeared in answer thereto, either in person or by attorney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-8\">3. The judgment appears to have been rendered as upon motion, against the defendant as an officer, when there is no evidence tending to show that the defendant was an officer of any kind.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-9\">4. Because it does not appear that there was any original judgment or process, upon which to base the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-10\">5. The proceedings appear to be based upon a special statute, and in the nature of a penalty, and the proceedings do not show sufficient compliance with the provisions of law, and because no presumptions can be indulged in in favor of the proceedings of a court of limited jurisdiction, and especially when proceedings are instituted under a particular statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-11\">Which objections being sustained, the court excluded the said transcript; to which ruling the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-12\">The objections were sustained by the court, and the evidence excluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-13\">The court also excluded the evidence of the successors of the justice, to prove that there was an execution and sale under it, the land having brought two-thirds of its value; and that the execution could not be found, and the sheriff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>deed to prove the sale. Verdict and judgment for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b151-6\"><em>Jones Petty, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APG\">\u2014The first assignment of error is believed to be well taken. It will hardly be denied that the justice\u2019s judgment is, <em>per se, </em>sufficient, or that it contains all the truth that the law requires that it should contain; but it will be insisted, that it ought to appear, in some way, that the justice had acquired jurisdiction over the defendant by reason of service or notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-7\">Where the judgment does not recite service, it will be presumed. (Sutherland v. De Leon, 1 Tex., 256.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-8\">The distinction involved by appellees applies to the subject-matter; this is the extent of its reason, and therefore the limit of its application; for, aside from this, courts of general and limited jurisdiction occupy the same position, and command the same deference for their proceedings, being alike fitted for the administration of justice, according to law, in their respective spheres.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-9\"><em>Prima facie, </em>every court has the power to judge of its own jurisdiction; and, where a party pleads to the jurisdiction, the decision even of an inferior court, in favor of its jurisdiction, is generally as conclusive on parties as judgment on matter confessedly in its jurisdiction. The only exception is, where the want of jurisdiction appears on the face of its proceedings. (State v. Scott, 1 Baily, 294.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b151-10\"><em>Chandler Turner, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4x\">\u2014The execution was from a justice of the peace, and void upon its face, as no facts appeared to authorize the same, being a greater amount than the justice has jurisdiction over, or had at that time. (See Statutes of 1836, p. 143, \u00a7 9.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-11\">It does not appear that the justice\u2019s jurisdiction was ever acquired, which must appear affirmatively in courts of limited jurisdiction; in other words, the mode of acquiring jurisdiction must fully appear. (See 1 Hill N. Y. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Reg., 139; 17 Wend. N. Y. Rep., 485, 486; 5 Wend. N. Y. Rep., 172, 180; 1 Cowan, 730.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-5\">In courts of inferior jurisdiction nothing will he presumed. (See Hamilton v. Ward, 4 Tex., 356; Moore v. Moore, Dallam, 553.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b152-6\">Wheeler, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhR\">\u2014The judgment of the justice, which was offered in evidence to support the sheriff\u2019s sale, is not such a judgment as the justice could legally render in the exercise of his ordinary jurisdiction. From the terms in which it is expressed, we suppose it to have been rendered in a proceeding by motion against the defendant, as sheriff, or other officer, for failing or refusing to pay over money collected under an execution, under the provision of sec. 10 of the execution law of 1842. (O. &amp; W. Dig., Art. 865.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">It, however, does not appear, from the record of the justice, that a case was brought before him which brought into exercise his jurisdiction over such a subject-matter, or that the defendant had the notice which the statute prescribed, or, indeed, any notice of the proceeding, or that he made his appearance before the justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">It is a plain and undeniable principle, that, to give any binding effect to the proceedings of a court,, it must have jurisdiction of the person of the defendant and of the cause or subject-matter. The want of jurisdiction makes the judgment utterly void and unavailable for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">The word \u201c motion,\u201d in the transcript of the justice, is all that appears to indicate the nature of the case that was brought before the court, except the terms of the judgment itself, which was rendered by the justice. But, unless it was such as we have supposed, the court could have no authority to render such a judgment. It must be taken, we think, that it was a proceeding against an officer, under the statute to which we have referred, if any proceeding were in fact instituted to bring into exercise the jurisdiction of the justice. It was, then, a summary proceeding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>and penal in its character, and is to be construed strictly. (Hamilton v. Ward, 4 Tex., 356.) In Thatcher v. Powell, 6 Wheat. R., 128, Chief Justice Marshall said: \u201cIn summary proceedings, where the court exercises an extraordinary power, under a special statute prescribing its course, we think that course ought to he exactly observed, and those facts especially which give jurisdiction ought to appear, in order to show that its proceedings are <em>coram judice.\u201d </em>There are numerous authorities to the same effect. (Barry v. Patterson, 3 Humph. R., 313; Hamilton v. Burman, 3 Yerg., 355; Bates v. The Bank, 8 Por., 99; Levert v. The Same, Id., 104; Wright v. Warner, 1 Doug. Mich. R., 384.) In such a proceeding it ought certainly to appear by the record that the court acquired jurisdiction over the person of the defendant by service of the notice which the statute prescribes, or by his appearance, in order to render the judgment of any validity. It does not so appear, and we are, therefore, of opinion that the judgment is void, and the proceedings under it, consequently, invalid and ineffectual to vest title in the plaintiff. The court did not err in excluding the proposed evidence of the judgment of the. justice and the proceedings thereon; and there is no error in the judgment. It is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
