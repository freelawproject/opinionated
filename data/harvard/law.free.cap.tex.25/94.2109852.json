Tried below before the Hon. James M. Maxcy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-6\">Suit by Gilbert Lacour against W. C. Lacey on a note of $500, given for two tracts of land, and against G. W. Chapman as the purchaser of the land from Lacey, praying for judgment against the former for the money, and a decree subjecting the land to the vendor\u2019s lien, and a sale thereof. Suit filed January 20th, 1859. Chapman answered that when he purchased the land from Lacey on the 8th of October, 1856, he executed to him his note for $500, due two years after date, secured by a deed of trust thereon, which was duly recorded. That, before the maturity of the note, Lacey transferred the note and the deed of trust, for a valuable consideration, to one F. Simms, without notice of the vendor\u2019s' lien, and that he still holds the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">Also, that on the 1st day of June, 1858, he executed to Hiram Close and James A. Cushman two notes for $500 and $1150, respectively, one of which was due on the 1st day of January, 1859, and the other on the 1st day of July, 1859, which he secured to the payees by a mortgage on the land, which was duly recorded; and that they had no notice of the plaintiff\u2019s lien. He prayed that Simms, Close and Cushman be made defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-8\">The plaintiff excepted to the sufliciency of the answer, and the exceptions were sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-9\">Judgment by default as to Lacey.

Although Simms, and Close and Cushman might have made themselves parties to the suit, and asserted their respective rights, if they had any, yet they were not necessary parties, and their rights are in no respect affected by the judgment in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
