RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b182-22\">In this bench-trial diversity case a wholesaler seeks to recover from a retailer for carpets sold on open account and for other carpets received but not paid for by the retailer. Although the retailer admitted owing \u201csomebody\u201d about $10,000 even after deducting all expenses, he was found to owe nothing, and the receipt of monies by the wholesaler\u2019s salesman, who was found to lack either actual or apparent authority, was held to constitute payment to the wholesaler. Concluding that the district court (1) made a clearly erroneous finding of fact as to one of the shipments of carpet and (2) made an error of law as to the other, we reverse and render a judgment for the wholesaler for the amount proved due.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Textile Supplies, Inc. (\u201cTextile Supplies\u201d), a Georgia corporation, distributes carpets. One of its salesmen was Alvin Couch. Couch obtained an order from Charles Garrett, who did business under the trade names Carpet Center and Gautier Carpet Center, for carpets costing $24,093.95. Garrett issued four cheeks payable to Textile Supplies; one of these was returned because Garrett had insufficient funds to cover it. Couch somehow obtained the returned check and another of the checks, took them to Garrett, and instructed Garrett to issue two checks totaling $10,097.13 to Cartersville Textile Sales, Inc. (\u201cCarters-ville\u201d), an entity that was in effect Couch\u2019s alter ego. Garrett followed Couch\u2019s instructions and Couch then cashed the checks and appropriated the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Couch later learned that Textile Supplies had shipped carpet invoiced for $76,923.81 to Surplus and Salvage Sales (\u201cSurplus and Salvage\u201d) of Fort Walton Beach, Florida. He caused this shipment to be delivered instead to Garrett.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Garrett made a $10,-000 down payment to Couch for the shipment but never purported to pay anything more for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The president of Textile Supplies, Marion Corbett, arranged with Garrett to have the unsold part of this shipment returned to Textile Supplies. Two Textile Supplies employees went to Garrett\u2019s place of business and, after some delay, received carpet valued at $46,158.86. Textile Supplies claims reimbursement for the $5,611.39 it spent to recover this carpet, the $30,764.95 of unrecovered carpet that Garrett had already sold, and the $10,097.13 remaining unpaid on its account with Garrett from the earlier shipment of carpet.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">None of the facts appear to be controverted. Textile Supplies sent Garrett invoices on its stationery for the first shipment. These invoices were accompanied by lists of carpet on the stationery of Textilon, Inc., a corporation also managed by Corbett. Couch did not represent himself as an officer of either corporation. The district court correctly found that, when Couch instructed Garrett to write checks to the order of Cartersville and when he shipped the $76,000 of carpet from Cartersville, he had no apparent authority to represent Textile Supplies. Yet the district court also found that Garrett \u201cactually thought that he was dealing with Couch as a principal and that Couch had no accountability to anybody.\u201d Citing only one case, which held that a party who deals with a person who is in fact an agent, although his agency is not disclosed, may treat the agent\u2019s representations as if they had been made by the previously unidentified principal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court dismissed Textile Supplies\u2019 claim. The district court\u2019s opinion says nothing of the approximately $31,000 in carpet received and sold by Garrett and admittedly never paid for.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">The district court\u2019s findings of fact must be accepted unless clearly erroneous. <em>Security Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dudds, Inc., </em>648 F.2d 273, 275 (5th Cir. 1981); Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). An appellate court may consider the findings that far in error when \u201con the entire evidence [it] is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746, 766 (1948); <em>accord, e.g., O\u2019Toole </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>671 F.2d 913, 914 (5th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">There was no evidence to support the finding that Couch represented himself as a principal when he instructed Garrett to write two checks to the order of Carters-ville. Garrett testified that, when he ordered the carpet, he knew Couch to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>salesman for Textile Supplies. The invoices to Garrett stated: \u201cNONFACTORED INVOICE. PAY DIRECT TO TEXTILE SUPPLIES, INC.\u201d Garrett first wrote the checks to the order of Textile Supplies. It was only after Couch told him to issue new checks that Garrett made the checks payable to Cartersville. Obviously, he was then misled by Couch but the true fact, that Textile Supplies was the company to which the money was due, had been made clear to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Under Mississippi law,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> persons dealing with an agent have a duty to inquire into his authority and, if the agent has no authority, a principal is not bound by the agent\u2019s agreements unless the principal either ratifies them or acts with reference to them as to constitute waiver or estoppel. <em>Consumers Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Swilley, </em>243 Miss. 838, 848, 138 So.2d 885, 889 (1962). A buyer who makes payment to an agent not authorized by the principal to collect it has not paid the principal and remains liable for the sum due. <em>Sumrall </em>v. <em>Kitselman Bros., </em>101 Miss. 783, 58 So. 594 (1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The general rule holding a principal liable for the acts of an agent when the principal has entrusted the management of his entire business to the agent<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> can furnish no comfort to Garrett. It is patent that Textile Supplies had not made Couch its general manager and that he was only a salesman. One who relies on the acts of an agent to bind his principal has the burden of proving the authority of the agent. <em>Thorp Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>Tindle, </em>249 Miss. 368, 375, 162 So.2d 497, 500 (1964); <em>Cue Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Fornea Oil Co., </em>208 Miss. 810, 815, 45 So.2d 597, 599 (1950). Garrett has failed to carry that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">The second shipment of carpet requires a different analysis but yields a similar result. Neither of the parties maintains that Couch acted as Textile Supplies\u2019 agent in selling this carpet to Garrett. Textile Supplies contends Couch stole the carpet; Garrett insists it ordered the carpet in the belief that Couch represented Cartersville and not Textile Supplies. Even if, as Garrett urges, we accept the district court\u2019s conclusion that Garrett bought the second carpet shipment from Couch in the good faith belief he was a principal, or at least a representative of Cartersville and not Textile Supplies, we must reverse its judgment in favor of Garrett.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">Textile Supplies has consistently argued that Couch stole this carpet from it. Although the record is not pellucid on this point, Textile Supplies offered uncontradicted testimony that Couch stole invoices from Surplus and Salvage, forged Carters-ville\u2019s name and address on them as consignee, and diverted the carpet shipment to Cartersville and then to Garrett.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is no evidence that Textile Supplies ever dealt with Couch on this shipment. To the contrary, Corbett testified he had never heard of Cartersville. He testified further that Textile Supplies\u2019 records show only that the carpet was destined for delivery to Surplus and Salvage.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Garrett argues it nevertheless acquired valid title to the carpet under Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 75-2-403(l)(d), (2), (3) (1972).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This argument lacks merit. The wrongdoing in this case was perpetrated by Couch, who apparently never dealt with Textile Supplies on this shipment. We cannot say Couch obtained the carpet through a \u201ctransaction of purchase.\u201d <em>See Paschal v. Hamilton, </em>363 So.2d 1360, 1361 (Miss.1978). Moreover, even if there was such a transaction, it does not appear to have been between Textile Supplies and Couch. The intended transaction was between Textile Supplies and Surplus and Salvage. Thus Textile Supplies never \u201cintended, however misguidedly, that [Couch] would become the owner of the goods.\u201d <em>American Standard Credit, Inc. v. National Cement Co., </em>643 F.2d 248, 268 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>see Marvin </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>272 S.C. 425, 427, 252 S.E.2d 562, 563 (1979). Because Textile Supplies never dealt with Couch, the wrongdoer, in a transaction of purchase, Garrett could not acquire valid title under \u00a7 75-2-403(l)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">There is no evidence that Textile Supplies ever entrusted Couch with the second carpet shipment. The evidence establishes instead that Couch obtained possession of the carpet without the knowledge of, and contrary to the wishes of, Textile Supplies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because Textile Supplies never dealt with Couch to effect the alleged \u201centrusting,\u201d Garrett could not have obtained from Couch valid title to the carpet under \u00a7 403(2), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">When Couch stole the carpet from Textile Supplies he acquired only \u201cvoid title.\u201d <em>American Standard Credit, Inc. v. National Cement Co., </em>643 F.2d at 268; <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Estes, </em>345 So.2d 265, 266 (Miss.1977). He could not have passed valid title even to a good faith purchaser. <em>Id.; Gurley </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>233 Miss. 58, 61, 101 So.2d 101, 102 (1958). Textile Supplies, therefore, retained title to the carpet even after Garrett obtained it from Couch. \u201c[E]ven though the sale of the property is made to a bona fide purchaser for value, if it is stolen property, the person from whom it was stolen- is not divested of his title.\u201d <em>Walker v. Johnson, </em>354 So.2d 792, 793 (Miss. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">The portion of the second shipment that Garrett either sold or refused to return to Textile Supplies was converted by Garrett to his own use.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He thereby rendered himself liable to Textile Supplies for the value of the carpet at the time of conversion<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> plus interest to the time of trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Textile Supplies is also entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>have Garrett repay what it spent to recover the converted carpet.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Garrett\u2019s purported good faith in purchasing the carpet is irrelevant in determining the fact of conversion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although \u201c[t]he mere purchase of personal property in good faith from a person who has no right to sell it is not a conversion,\u201d a conversion nevertheless occurs when \u201cthe title of the lawful owner is made known and resisted or the purchaser exercises dominion over the property by use, sale, or possession.\u201d <em>Mississippi Motor Fin., Inc. v. Thomas, </em>246 Miss. 14, 19, 149 So.2d 20, 23 (1963). Garrett\u2019s remedy, if any, lies in an action against Couch or Cartersville under Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 75-2-312<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> for breach of the implied warranty of title to the carpet shipped to Garrett by Cartersville. <em>E.g., Marvin v. Connelly, sup</em>ra.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">The judgment is REVERSED. Judgment will be entered in favor of Textile Supplies and against Garrett as follows: $10,097.13, plus interest accrued on Garrett\u2019s open account with Textile Supplies,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> for the carpet ordered from Textile Supplies but not paid for; $30,764.95, plus interest, for the carpet received from Couch and sold by Garrett; and $5,611.39 for expenses incurred to retrieve carpet from Garrett, plus costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\">.
