W. Dawson, Esq., auditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-9\">From tbe report of tlie auditor it appeared that tbe Thompson Glasg Company, a corporation of tbe state of Pennsylvania, on July 27, 1895, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors. A large number of wage claims were presented to the auditor, \u00aband it appeared from the evidence that many if not all of the claimants wore not in the actual employ of the assignor company at the time the assignment was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-10\">The auditor awarded the fund to the wage claimants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-11\">Exceptions to the report of the auditor were dismissed by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-12\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-13\"><em>W- G. </em>Guiler, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfM\">\u2014 If the act of 1854 is applicable to the claims in this ease, then it is incumbent upon the wage claimants to show that they were employed by the corporation at the time the assignment was made, that is that the contractual relation existed between the corporation and the claimant when the said assignment was made, otherwise they cannot sustain the claim if the said act is applicable to this ease. The act must he construed strictly: Adamson\u2019s App., 110 Pa. 462; Esterley\u2019s App., 54 Pa. 194; Smith v. R.

It was rightly held by the learned auditor and court below that the fund in question should be distributed to the wage claimants, pro rata, under the act of April 22, 1854, to the extent of $100 each.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We cannot assent to the position assumed by the appellant, that the act of 1854 was intended to protect those only who were in the actual employment of the company when the assignment for the benefit of creditors was made. Such a strict and narrow construction of the act would in many cases practically defeat the object the legislature evidently had in view in giving preference to the wages of miners, mechanics or laborers employed by corporations or companies specified in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">None of the specifications is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
