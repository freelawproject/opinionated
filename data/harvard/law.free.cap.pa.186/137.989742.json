Rittenhouse is now deceased, I do, therefore appoint and depute in his stead my brother-in-law, Abraham Hunsicker, Jr., together with said Jacob Tyson to be the executors of this, my last will and testament, with full power and authority to execute the same according to the tenure thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-9\">\u201c In witness whereof, I, Charles Tyson, the testator, hereunto set my hand and seal to this codicil as and for part of my last will and testament the fourth day of November, A.

In 1886 the executors of Charles Tyson assigned, transferred and set over unto Mary Tyson all the personal estate of the testator, consisting of five Perkiomen Railroad bonds, thirty-four shares of Spring City Bank stock, farming implements and cash, aggregating in all as appraised $5,982.11. At the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>time the widow gave a receipt to the executors setting forth that she was to have, to hold and enjoy the property, according to the terms and provisions of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-5\">3.

In March, 1897, she sold the remaining real estate to her \u25a0brother James Rittenhouse, receiving as a consideration $2,500 cash, and mortgages on the premises sold, aggregating $11,500. In April, 1897, the properties were reconveyed by the brother to the widow, Mary Tyson. The consideration named was the same as that stated in the deeds to the brother. The mortgages remain unsatisfied of record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-7\">5. At the time of Mary Tyson\u2019s death the railroad bonds and shares of bank stock still stood in her name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-8\">6. The defendants demur to this bill and assign as causes for \u25a0 their demurrer, that the plaintiff has no interest in the matters alleged, that the defendants are not in any way liable to the plaintiff, that the equity court has no jurisdiction of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-9\">LEGAL CONCLUSION.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-10\">We are of opinion that the orphans\u2019 court has exclusive jurisdiction of the matter alleged in the bill. The whole controversy arises over the interpretation of the will of Charles Tyson. The estate of the testator is before the orphans\u2019 court, the surviving executor is endeavoring to administer it, and the construction of the will is specially entrusted to the orphans\u2019 court. The rival claimants to the property in dispute are also in the orphans\u2019 court. The court has control over the executors of Mary Tyson as well as over the surviving executor of Charles Tyson. Why seek the aid of another court when the parties and subject-matter are peculiarly within the control of the orphans\u2019 court ? Whether these bonds, stocks and lands belong to the estate of Charles Tyson can be determined by the orphans\u2019 court. The orphans\u2019 court alone has the authority to ascertain the amount of a decedent\u2019s property and order its distribution among those entitled to it: Phillips, Administrator, v. Railroad-Co., 107 Pa. 465. This property belongs to the husband\u2019s estate or to the widow\u2019s estate and both estates are in process of settlement in the orphans\u2019 court and all matters arising in the distribution must come under the jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>It is contended that the equity court should intervene to restrain the executors of Mary Tyson from diverting the property to the irreparable loss of the estate of Charles Tyson. But we must not forget that the orphans\u2019 court has power to prevent, by order in the nature of writs of injunction, acts contrary to law or equity, prejudicial to property over which it has jurisdiction: Appeal of Misldmins, 114 Pa. 530. Again, \u201c The authority of the orphans\u2019 court is plenary, embracing as it does all the powers of a court of chancery, .... and if need be, can enforce its mandates by proceedings for contempt: \u201d Lafferty v. Corcoran, 180 Pa. 314. After a careful consideration of the prayer of the bill, we find that the sole question is one of settlement or administration in the orphans\u2019 court. It is now the settled law, that the orphans\u2019 court has exclusive jurisdiction over all things pertaining to the settlement and distribution of estates: Linsonbigler v. G-ourley, 56 Pa. 166. No matter of settlement or touching the administration of an estate can be drawn within the power of the common pleas: Campbell\u2019s Appeal, 80 Pa. 298. The orphans\u2019 court, in a proceeding to distribute an estate among legatees, next of kin and heirs, has ample power to inquire into and determine all questions standing directly in the way of a distribution to these parties: Dundas\u2019s Estate, 73 Pa. 480. The executors of Mary Tyson are under the control of the orphans\u2019 court. If they interfere prejudicially with the property belonging to the estate of Charles Tyson they may be restrained, and the court has power to enforce its mandates. There are no facts in dispute as the case now presents itself; the sole inquiry is, what estate did Mrs. Tyson take under her husband\u2019s will ? When the orphans\u2019 court is called upon to decide this 'inquiry, its final decree must end all controversy. If we send this case into the equity court, we do so for the sole purpose of having that court interpret the will of Charles Tyson. The orphans\u2019 court alone must attend to this matter. Her grasp is already laid upon the will, and there is no authority that can wrest it from her hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-5\">And now, November 1, 1897, the demurrer to jurisdiction is sustained and the bill is dismissed at the cost of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in sustaining the demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-7\"><em>N.
