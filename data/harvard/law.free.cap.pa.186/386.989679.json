The profits were to be divided between the parties. No time was set for the termination of the contract. Defendant testified that subsequently lie stated to plaintiff that he would not continue the agreement unless he was allowed twenty-five per cent for shop expenses. Defendant\u2019s testimony on this point was supported by that of another witness, and it appeared also that he could not continue to manufacture the article profitably unless some allowance was made to him for shop expenses, and that without such allowance, plaintiff\u2019s profits would have been unreasonably large. Plaintiff denied by his own testimony that any such statement had been made by defendant, but he admitted that for two years he had settled on the basis contended for by defendant. He was contradicted by a number of witnesses upon material matters. The master found in favor of the plaintiff.

In doing \u25a0this they found it necessary to use a patent fertilizing attachment, the patent for which was owned by the Spangler Manufacturing Company; and the right to use this device was obtained, upon an agreement for the payment of a royalty, for the use of the said patent. About a year was consumed in this work of getting up a drill. The defendant expended the sum of about $2,000 in this and the plaintiff contributed his services. A patent was not obtained, more probably for the reason that the drill built, approved and adopted was not a patentable drill; and the parties entered upon the manufacture and sale of drills. The plaintiff had charge of the books pertaining to the drill business during the continuance of the business except the book containing chaz-ges for drills sold which charges wei-e kept in the books of the defendant in his general manufacturing business. These books were, during all the time of the continuance of the business between plaintiff and defendant, opezi to the.inspection and examination of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\">. At the end of the second year a settleznent was made of the business, izx which the plaintiff fell izz debt to the defendazzt izi the sum of $50.00, for which sum the defendaxxt gave the plaixztiff credit on the books. The business of 1881 and 1882 was neither extensive zzor profitable. As to the cireuxnstazzees and teznas of said settlemexit the evidence is conflicting, as well as the terms upon which the business was cozztizzued to the fall of 1886. The defezxdant cozztends that said settlement was made upon the basis of adding to the naked cost of the drills manufactured, said cost beizzg the actual cost of tbe material used and the cost of labor in their manufacture, twenty-five per cent for shop expenses, enumex-ated by hizzz, azzd that at the time of said settleznezzt he inforzzied the plaixxtiff that urxless this added shbp expenses of twenty-five per cezzt of the zzaked cost of the drills was conceded by the plaintiff, the manufacture of th\u00e9 drills could zzot cozztinue and that the plaintiff agreed, expressing the wish that the cost zzziglzt be reduced to $50.00 per drill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>not counting tlie Spangler royalty, or costs of selling. Tlie plaintiff admitted in liis testimony tliat lie settled for the first two years on tlie basis contended for by the defendant, under protest, but denied that at said settlement he was informed by the defendant that tlie business could not continue without the addition of the twenty-five per cent shop expenses, to the naked cost of the drills ; and that lie agreed to the same. He admitted that he told defendant \u201c he thought the drill could be built for fifty dollars, including Spangler\u2019s royalty. He said he would build them at that if he could.\u201d Upon this question as to how the shop cost of tlie drills should be estimated, fixed or determined, and what that cost actually was, under the agreement of the parties, the decision of this case largely depends. A great mass of testimony was heard by the learned master, the taking of which testimony was had, from time to time, between December 19,1887, and December 31,1894. After argument, the master gave notice to the counsel of his intention to file his report, when exceptions were filed. In this report lie finds the total amount received by defendant for drills in the years 1883, 1884, 1885 and 1886 was $126,040.42 and after allowing a credit for cost of drills (as found by him) and payment on account, lie finds a balance due the plaintiff including interest, of $16,201.07. Exceptions were filed by the defendant and an amended report was made and filed reducing the interest $5,065.33, leaving a balance due plaintiff of $11,135.74. This amended report was filed; the plaintiff excepted to this reduction in the interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-4\">There are no exceptions by either of the parties to the amount found by the master to have been received by the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s exceptions are to the disallowance of interest claimed. The defendant\u2019s are to amount fixed by the master as the cost of the drills in their manufacture, and the carrying over of a portion of them from one season to another, the amount found to be due to the plaintiff, the allowance of interest, and the imposition of costs upon the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-5\">We will first consider the exceptions filed by the defendant. The learned master, we think, clearly erred in treating John A, Jones, the plaintiff, as the only credible witness in the case, in reference to testimony in which there was a conflict between the testimony of the plaintiff himself and the defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>other of his witnesses. That the learned master did this is. stated substantially by. himself in his report, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-4\">\u201c A number of attempts were made to contradict Mr. Jones, who died while this case was pending, and in his argument, the solicitor for the defendant made a vigorous attack upon his veracity. The master therefore deems it his duty, in justice to the deceased and to the court, to state that in his opinion Mr. Jones was a perfectly frank and truthful witness, who answered all questions as fully and as accurately as lay in his power, in view of the complex and involved questions that were so frequently asked him, and in all cases where attempts have been made to contradict him the master has accepted and relied upon the testimony of Mr. Jones. . . . Many of these attempts at contradiction resulted in the corroboration of Mr. Jones, as appears from the letters above referred to and the testimony of John Hoff, who swore that it was the defendant and not the plaintiff who sold him the drill, and stated that the cost was fifty-five dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-5\">Since testifying, John A. Jones, the plaintiff, has died. It is not pleasant to comment unfavorably upon his testimony as we are required to do here, after his lips have been sealed in death, but it must be said that a careful reading of the testimony reveals the fact that he stands contradicted upon matters material in this case, by A. B. Farquhar, the defendant, F. James Evans, F. W. Ziegler, Henry W. Eisenhart, John Hoff, William E. Farquhar, and others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-6\">The master says in his report that Hoff does not contradict the plaintiff, but corroborates him. Is this so ? The following questions were propounded to and answered to by John A. Jones.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-7\">\u2019 \u201cQ. Did you not explain to John A. Hoff.that $55.00 was the absolute cost of a drill, or words to that effect, shortly before he bought the drill from you, or you and Mr. Farquhar ? A. No, sir. I made no explanation to Mr. Hoff, whatever. Q. Did you not state to John Hoff shortly before he bought the drill, if he bought one, that $55.00 was the absolute cost of a drill or words to that effect? A. No, sir. I never mentioned prices or figures to John Hoff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-8\">\u25a0 John M. Hoff testifies as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-9\">&gt; \u201c I asked Mr. Farquhar what he will take for a drill. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>said $55.00, that was the cost of manufacturing and the expenses, but I should go and see Mr. Jones, and ask him and see whether he was satisfied, and Jones said he was for me to hare it. Jones said that was about cost so I got the drill and paid $55.00 for it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-5\">Would Jones have said he was satisfied and was for Hoff to have the drill, \u201c that was about cost,\u201d unless Hoff had stated to him the amount to be paid \u2014 $55.00 ? Certainly not, and is not this testimony a flat contradiction of John A. Jones\u2019s testimony, just quoted? He knew the price to be paid, and declared that $55.00 \u201cwas about cost.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">Neither did John A. Jones testify with that frankness for which he is so highly complimented by the learned master, concerning the settlement in 1883 \u201c while Farquhar was washing his hands \u201d frequently repeated and interjected; and, in regard to the production of the statement demanded by Mr. Stewart, solicitor for defendant. This paper, marked \u201cNo. 1, June 21, 1893,\u201d was afterward produced and admitted in evidence, by agreement, to show the amounts received by plaintiff from the defendant, on account of the drill business with exceptions as to several items. This is virtually a confession of the correctness of the statement. It should have been promptly produced to counsel, on demand without hesitation or prevarication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-7\">The learned master having erred in his estimate of the value of the testimony of John A. Jones where the same was contradicted, he naturally fell into the error of finding that at the settlement in 1883 \u201c the defendant did not say to the plaintiff that unless the plaintiff agreed to the above method of calculating the cost of the manufacture of drills by the addition of twenty-five per cent of the naked cost of drills for shop expenses, the business must stop, and also that the plaintiff did not agree to that method of calculating the cost.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-8\">To sustain this finding he has the testimony of John A. Jones, the plaintiff, alone, while A. B. Farquhar and F. James Evans unequivocally contradicted him. Besides the circumstances bear out the testimony on the part of defendant, viz: the settlement in 1883, for the preceding years, on the basis claimed by defendant for ascertaining cost of manufacture of drills, by adding twentj^-five per cent for shop expenses; the selling of a drill to Hoff at $55.00 by the parties; Mr. Jones saying that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>was about cost; the continuance by the defendant of the business with the plaintiff when it is manifest, from the facts proved, that it required $50.00 to $55.00 for the materials, work and shop expenses, such as wear and tear of machinery, coal, oil, waste, superintendence, foremen and draymen, etc., to manufacture a drill for the <em>market; </em>all show the probability of the defendant\u2019s demand, and refusal to continue the manufacture of the drills unless his basis of estimating the cost of manufacture was accepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\">John A. Jones\u2019s admissions that he told Mr. Farquhar at the time of the 1883 settlement, that he \u201c thought the drill could be built for $50.00, including Spangler\u2019s royalty \u201d corroborates the testimony on the part of the defendant. It is not probable nor credible that the defendant, in view of the settlement of 1883, at $55.00 per drill, with a full knowledge of the naked cost, or cost of labor and material, and the certainty that shop expenses had to be added and were as much expenses of manufacture of the drill as the materials for the labor on the same, and that all amounted to about $55.00, including the royalty, would continue in the business of making the drills at naked cost, plus the $2.50 or about that, royalty. In addition to the weight of the testimony of the witnesses testifying on this branch of the case, the facts and circumstances proved in the case, the partial admission of the defendant as to the cost of the drill, above referred to, and the continuance by the defendant in the drill business, all tend to prove that the plaintiff was informed by defendant of the demand of twenty-five per cent for shop expenses, as an item of expense in the manufacture of the drill, and the agreement thereto, by the plaintiff. What was the defendant to gain by the further continued manufacture of these drills at naked cost, \u2014 the cost of work and materials. There was not any patent on the drill, and the defendant, could therefore, have continued the manufacture of the drills on his own account. The cost of manufacture was first to be deducted, also the expenses of sale and then a division of the profits. What was the defendant getting for his relinquishing shop expenses ? That shop expenses were part of the cost of manufacture is conceded bjr the plaintiff. How were the shop expenses to be ascertained and fixed except by a percentage, shown in the manufacture ? And where is the evidence in the case that twenty-five per cent is too high a rate ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>There was no time fixed for the continuation of the business and the defendant had a right to determine the alleged partnership at any time, upon notice. The defendant therefore had a right to make the demand, and if the plaintiff agreed thereto he cannot now, after the defendant has acted upon it by the outlay of large sums of money and the manufacture of drills for four years, repudiate his agreement. He may have intended to do so when Mr. Evans asked him shortly after the settlement, \u201cMr. Jones, if you were not satisfied why did you accept the settlement ? \u201d and he replied: \u201cIt is not always the best policy to show your hand,\u201d but he is estopped by his acts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-4\">For the reasons stated we think the learned master erred in not finding from the evidence facts which he says in his report would materially affect the legal aspect of the case; that at the settlement of 1883, made on the basis claimed by the defendant, the defendant informed tire plaintiff that unless that basis for ascertaining the costs of drills was agreed to he would not continue to manufacture drills under the agreement, and that the plaintiff agreed to the defendant\u2019s demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-5\">The learned master also is in error in his construction of papers \u201c Nos. 3 and 4 \u201d (estimate of costs of drills) and also in his finding that the plaintiff accepted, only the naked cost column of the estimate, paper \u201c 3.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-6\">The overwhelming testimony is that the <em>second </em>column \u201c naked cost,\u201d shows the cost of labor and material in the manufactured drill and no other element of cost or expense. The master finds that \u201c it includes all items of cost entering into the manufacture of these drills, as contended for by either party, except cost of the plant and interest on the investment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-7\">His allowance of the royalty as a separate item of cost in addition to the \u201cnaked cost \u201d <em>of </em>manufacture, and five dollars for office expenses, advertising and expense of sale for each drill, in addition, shows the fallacy in his conclusions. Besides th<em>e </em>plaintiff himself admits that the cost of carrying over, repainting drills, insurance, interest, storage, coal and steam are items of cost of manufacture. Where is there any evidence that these and other items of shop expenses, which Mr. Jones says he may have omitted, were included in the amounts set down in the \u201c naked cost \u201d column of estimate marked 3; and who testifies or where is there any proof that the said estimate is not just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>what it shows' on its face, viz: that column one is the \u201c drill or shop cost\u201d and column two the \u201cnaked cost?\u201d We have not found any such proof in the great mass of testimony which cumbers the case. The error in this finding is so manifest that we are at loss to see how the learned master could have fallen into it. So in relation to his finding that the \u201cnaked cost\u201d column, only, of estimate three, was accepted by the plaintiff, and that the other column, marked drill cost, was not accepted by him. The plaintiff himself does not even so testify. Pie says he accepted defendant\u2019s estimate. What estimate ? Why, clearly the whole of estimate three, including the column showing the \u201cdrill cost.\u201d That is the only part of the estimate showing shop expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-5\">The evidence of Samuel N. Jessop and W. A. Maigne convincingly shows that the \u201cnaked costs\u201d column of estimate \u201c 3,\u201d shows the cost only of labor and material. This testimony is full and clear as to items and particulars, and is overwhelming. It establishes the cost of labor and material as contained in the second column of the estimate. The learned master\u2019s refusal to consider this testimony, and his finding in the face of it, that in this \u201cnaked cost\u201d column was included all cost of manufacture \u201cexcept the cost of the plant and interest on the investment \u201d is to us inexplicable. The \u201c drill costs \u201d in the first column of the estimate \u201c 3 \u201d is less than $50.00, including Spangler\u2019s royalty, for which the plaintiff testified that he told defendant at the settlement in 1883 he thought the drill ought to be built. These findings of the master are so fallacious, without evidence to sustain them, that they must be set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">The learned master also erred in finding that there was no sufficient evidence to find the number of drills carried over from year to year, or the cost of carrying them over.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-7\">Many of the witnesses testified that drills were so carried over, and that from $5.00 to $7.00 per drill, so carried over and repainted, interest on same, etc., would be a reasonable sum to add to cost thereof. In regard to the other part of the master\u2019s finding, as to the number of drills so carried over, the testimony of Captain Henry B. Waltman fixes the number of drills carried over each year, at from thirty-five to fifty, and a large amount of drill materials. This is not contradicted. The master should have found the number of drills carried over each year, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>at, at least the smaller number testified to, and allowed the defendant credit for the same in the account stated. The plaintiff admitted that this is a part of the cost of the manufacturing of the drills, and the defendant is clearly entitled to a credit of $5.00, the smallest sum mentioned in the evidence, for the drills carried over, estimated at thirty-five each year, the smaller number mentioned by the witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-5\">These errors in the finding by the master lead him into an error in stating his account, attached to his report, of over $18,000, in the amount constituting the cost of the drills, and injuriously affects the defendant to that extent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-6\">The profits were enormous on the account, as stated by the master, being over thirty-three per cent of the capital invested. The plaintiff\u2019s income was, per year on that basis, $5,205.60, without the investment of a single dollar as capital by himself, or furnishing any patent, in connection with the drill. His drill points were not used to any appreciable extent, having been found too expensive. His only contribution to the business was his personal services. The largeness of the profits as found by the learned master is itself enough to show the fallacy of his conclusions. Had such profits been realized defendant\u2019s extensive shops would have been devoted, entirely, to the drill business, and instead of retaining the services of the plaintiff, without any necessity, the defendant would doubtless have dissolved his connection with the plaintiff and assumed the entire business. This was in his power, there being no time limited for the continuance of the alleged partnership. The testimony as to the receipt of average profits of five per cent by the defendant in his other business of a similar character, renders it certain that thirty-three per cent could not have been realized in this drill business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-7\">Upon the- calculation made by the court, on the basis claimed by the defendant, and allowed, the percentage of profit was over eighteen per cent, and the annual income of the plaintiff was $2,925.77, a very handsome income for one occupying his business relations, and having his business abilities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-8\">We sustain the'exceptions filed by the defendant, to the extent that they apply to the subject-matters of the errors above specified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-9\">The exception to the imposition of costs, on the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>is dismissed, for the reason, that the facts and circumstances, in our opinion require that these costs be paid by the party against whom the decree is made, hi regard to a balance claimed to be due. At the time of the filing of the bill a balance was due the plaintiff, and notwithstanding a payment of over $5,000, since the commencement of this suit by defendant to the plaintiff, a balance is still due his estate. After the long delay suffered by the plaintiff in the receipt of his moneys, and the great expense incurred in the litigation, we think it would be inequitable to require his estate to pay any part of the costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-5\">The exceptions filed by plaintiff are to the nonallowance by the master of interest on the whole balance of $10,280.43 found in his original report, instead of interest only, on the sum of $1,461.50, as in the amended report. The learned master felt bound to disallow interest on the whole balance as claimed by the plaintiff upon the authorities cited, among which are Gyger\u2019s App., 62 Pa. 73; Grubb\u2019s App., 66 Pa. 117; Brown\u2019s App.,. 89 Pa. 139; Rehill v. McTague, 114 Pa. 82. These and other cases show that as between partners, interest will not generally be allowed until a balance has been struck and the amount payable to partner claiming a balance ascertained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-6\">. The principle that \u201cin the settlement of partnership accounts the allowance or refusal of interest depends upon the circumstances of each particular case; any unyielding rule would work injustice in some case,\u201d is however clearly recognized and enunciated in these cases, as well as in the late case of Magilton v. Stevenson, 173 Pa. 560.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-7\">The business relation between the parties to this suit scarcely amounted to a partnership. It was an association for the single purpose of manufacturing and selling grain drills, a joint undertaking, the defendant to furnish the capital and manufacture the drills, the plaintiff to be in immediate charge of the drill business and assist in the sale of the drills and keep certain of the books required to be kept. They were to share equally the net profits, and no losses are shown by the proof. There was no partnership name. The drill circulars were issued in the name of A. B. Farquhar, and the testimonials therein, addressed to him. The notes were made payable to A. B. Farquhar and bore interest. The business was of such a character and in such condition, that at the time of the bringing of this suit, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>defendant could have promptly accounted to the plaintiff. This the defendant did not do, nor did he account, at any time, during the pendency of the suit. The notes he held, bore interest, and it did not matter whether they had all been collected at the time he was required to account or not. He could have said so much of the assets, in his hands, consisted of promissory notes bearing interest, and tendered the plaintiff one half of said notes, as part of his share of the profits. For the reason that he did not account when required to do so; that he drew interest on the notes until paid, and had the use, in his business, of the balance remaining in his hands \u2014 making interest on said balance\u2014 he must be required to pay interest to the plaintiff for the amount found to be due the plaintiff. If even the parties were partners, which is most questionable, the case comes within the rulings of the exceptional cases, when interest may be allowed. Here there were no intricate matters to settle, no debts to be paid, no accounts to close, or losses to adjust, by the defendant, before the profits could be ascertained. The reasons for nonliability for interest entirely fail. The partnership (if any) had ended, and the account could readily have been stated, and the rights of the parties ascertained; as in Magilton v. Stevenson, cited supra, where interest was allowed. \u201cIf a defendant offers to pay as much as in justice he ought, and the plaintiff refuses to receive it, and brings an action, it would be wrong that the defendant should pay full interest after being driven to the expense of defending himself against an unjust suit. But in the present case the fairlt does not seem to be altogether on either side. The plaintiff insisted on too much, and the defendant offered too little. There was necessity, therefore, for a suit. That being the case, and there being no reason to suppose that the defendant has not made use of the money, we think he should be chargeable with interest: \u201d Delaware Insurance Company v. Delaunie, 3 Binn. 295. So we think here, and in the account which follows we accordingly charge the defendant with interest on the balance in his hands, from time to time, as will appear fully in said account to be stated by us.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-5\">And now, February 9, 1897, on due consideration, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the report of the learned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>master be set aside.
