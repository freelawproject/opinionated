Butler Windle, who was the plaintiff; and counsel for the plaintiff having volunteered a lengthy detailed statement as requested, the substance of which is as follows: \u201cI expect to prove by this witness that the agents of the defendant in this case called upon him during the spring, summer and fall of 1892, .... and among other things, by way of inducing him to sign this release, they said to him, .... \u2018You will get the same damages that others will get who don\u2019t sign these rights of way.\u2019 .... Mr. Henderson, who has signed the release in question, as agent, .... took occasion to read over this clause to Mr. Windle: \u2018 By the acceptance of this grant, the Crescent Pipe Line Company agrees . ... to pay for actual injuries done to lands, timber, crops, fences, buildings and improvements, whatsoever, occasioned by the construction of said line through and over said land.\u2019 .... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>After reading this clause he said to him : \u2018Now this means all injuries ; none will be left out.\u2019 He repeated that two or three times. And in explaining to the witness what the one hundred dollars was for he said: \u2018 That is just to keep us from going to West Chester to fiie a bond.\u2019 .... 1 want to show also that the witness did not understand the technical legal phrase, \u2018 all actual injuries done to lands,\u2019 .... but supposed, as he was led to suppose by these agents, and by Mr. Henderson in particular, that it meant all damages, and that none would be left out. ... I will also show by this witness that the one hundred dollars given him, apparently for the right of way, if this instrument is to be interpreted literally, is a grossly inadequate price for the easement or right of way across his place, if the depreciation to the land as to its market value is to be taken into consideration. I will also prove .... that a number of times .... between 1892 .... and 1895, different agents called on him and said to him that they would be back again and try to make a settlement; that they made no offer from the time of the laying of the pipe until the fall of 1895, and then he learned for the first time that they refused to pay him consequential damages.\u201d (The above being the material quotations from the offer.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-5\">Mi-.

In his statement he declared as the owner of a farm for a trespass by an entry \u201c without authority of law or of the plaintiff,\u201d the digging Of a ditch,'and putting down of a pipe therein, the trampling of his grass, cutting of his trees, and damage by the leakage of oil from the pipe. His evidence in chief .was all upon the same lines. The defendant then put in evidence a release under seal, by which plaintiff authorized the entry and granted the defendant a right of way for its pipe, the defendant stipulating to pay for all actual injuries to lands, timber, crops, fences, buildings and improvements, and for all damages from bursting or leaking of the pipe, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">To meet this turn in his case the plaintiff then offered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>prove that the said release was obtained from him by fraud. This he would have been entitled to do if his testimony had reached the required standard. But it clearly did not. It was an offer to show that plaintiff supposed from the representations made to him that he would get the same damages as his neighbors, and that they would include \u201call damages,\u201d although the words used in the writing were \u201cto pay for all actual injuries.\u201d Without going over the long offer in detail, it is sufficient to say that there was no allegation that anything had been left out of the paper by fraud, accident or mistake, or that there was any parol promise or agreement made at the time, without which it would not have been signed by plaintiff. Nor were there any damages averred in the statement that were not provided for in the release. The offer therefore fell short, and the judge was light in rejecting it. The plaintiff\u2019s remedy appearing clearly to be on bis contract, the judge was also right in bolding that he could not recover in the present action. The extent of liis rights under the contract it would be premature to discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
