Rice, claiming the coal underlying said strip of land, for a distance of twelve hundred and five feet in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>length anti of the width of sixty feet, by virtue of title thereto derived through the original owner of the land occupied by the railroad company, has brought action in trespass against the defendant, and seeks to recover treble damages under the act of May 8, 1876, for the unlawful taking of the coal which defendant has mined as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">From the evidence, the referee finds as conclusions of fact:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">1. Prior to June 1, 1852, A. Y. Smith was the owner in fee simple of a tract of land situate in the township of Exeter, (now the borough of West Pittston) Luzerne county, and lying between Exeter street and the Susquehanna river. By deed of that date, he, together with Hiram Denison, G. W. Barber and W. C. Reynolds, owners of land over which the Lackawanna &amp; Bloomsburg Railroad Company were then projecting a route \u201c with the object in view of inducing persons to subscribe for stock in said company, and for the further consideration of one dollar to each of them in hand paid by Charles D. Shoemaker and Madison F. Myers, trustees for said proposed railroad company,\u201d granted, bargained, released and conveyed unto the trustees aforesaid, and their heirs and assigns, \u201c so much land in width across our several and respective properties and estates as may be necessary and proper for the location and construction of said railroad of single or double track, not however -to exceed the legal width. The release to operate only for the uses of such railroad, and to be void and of no effect should such railroad not be constructed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-7\">2. The Lackawanna &amp; Bloomsburg Railroad Company was incorporated by an act of assembly approved April 5,1852, and after the release above noted, occupied a strip of land under the Smith conveyance sixty feet in width and twelve hundred and five feet in length, for their tracks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-8\">3. By virtue of a writ of venditioni exponas issued out of the court of common pleas of Luzerne county, at the suit of Charles B. Drake against A. Y. Smith, bearing teste October 13, 1857. the sheriff of Luzerne county exposed the premises of said A. Y. Smith, lying on both sides of the strip of land released to the railroad company, to sale, on November 9, 1857, and sold the same in two parcels \u2014 the first thereof to R. D. Lacoe, by deed dated November 18, 1857, conveying \u201cthe right, title and interest of said A. Y. Smith in and to all that lot of land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>situate in the township of Exeter, bounded and described as follows, to wit: Beginning at a stone set for a corner in the center of Exeter street, and on the southwesterly side of lands occupied by the Lackawanna &amp; Bloomsburg Railroad Company, thence north fifty-six degrees east, thirteen hundred and thirty-two feet along lands so occupied as aforesaid to the Susquehanna river; thence down the same south twenty degrees east, seven hundred and thirty-five feet to a corner; thence south twenty-two and one half degrees east, five hundred and thirty-nine feet to a corner; thence south five and three fourths degrees east, four hundred and eighty-four feet to a corner; thence south ten degrees east, three hundred and nineteen feet to a point opposite the center of Linden street; thence south fifty-seven and one half degrees west along the center of Linden street, six hundred and eighty-three and six tenths feet to the center of said Exeter street; thence north thirty-one and one half degrees west along the center of said Exeter street, nine hundred and thirty-nine feet to the place of beginning, containing thirty-five acres of land, be the same more or less.\u201d The second parcel was sold to William C. Gildersleeve, by deed acknowledged November 25, 1857, convoying \u201call right, title, and interest of said A. Y. Smith, in and to that lot of land situate in the township of Exeter, Luzerne county, etc. Beginning at a corner in the center of the old Kisner road, now known as Exeter street, in line of lands of Wisner and Wood, thence along said lands north fifty-nine degrees east, eighty-seven perches to the Susquehanna river; thence down the river in a southerly direction along low water line to the line of lands occupied by the Lackawanna &amp; Bloomsburg Railroad Company; thence along said company\u2019s railroad south fifty-six degrees west, seventy-nine perches to the center of said Exeter street, and thence north thirty-two and a half degrees west along the center of said Exeter street, fifty-two perches to the place of beginning. Containing thirty acres of land, more or less.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\">By virtue of sundry mesne conveyances and so-called coal leases, the coal underlying the lands thus conveyed to Lacoe and Gildersleeve is vested in the Clear Spring Coal Company, the defendant. The conveyances under which the defendant claims title to the coal were made to the Clear Spring Coal Company, Limited, a company organized in the year 1882, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>latter\u2019s property and estate were subsequently transferred to the defendant company which was incorporated May 17, 1888.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-5\">4. A. Y. Smith died in December, 1881, intestate, and left surviving him four daughters, Mrs. Rosa Edgar, Mrs. Mary E. Traxler, Mrs. Sophia J. Harvey, Mrs. Hetty Kyte, one son, Isaac C. Smith, and one grandson, Harry S. Robinson, only child of a deceased daughter, Mrs. Nellie Robinson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-6\">These survivors and heirs of A. Y. Smith, in the early part of the year 1886, executed letters of attorney to Dr. Olin F'. Harvey empowering him \u201c to enter into and take possession of all such messuages, lands, tenements, hereditaments and real estate whatever of which A. Y. Smith was in any way entitled or interested in his lifetime, and of which he died seized, situate in the county of Luzerne, Pennsylvania, and of which as heirs of the said A. Y. Smith, we are or may be in any way entitled or interested, and to grant, bargain and sell the same,\u201d etc. By deed dated March 8, 1886, Dr. Harvey, for himself and for his constituents above named, conveyed to Dr. J. N. Rice, the plaintiff, in consideration of the sum of $1.00 and other valuable considerations, \u201call the coal and other minerals in, upon, and under all that certain lot, piece or parcel of land situate in the borough of West Pittston; . . . . beginning at a point one hundred and twenty-seven feet from the center line of Exeter street and in line of land occupied by the Lackawanna &amp; Bloomsburg Railroad, thence north fifty-six degrees east, twelve hundred and five feet more or less to the Susquehanna river, thence up said river north thirty-two and one half degrees east, sixty feet more or less to a corner, thence south fifty-six degrees west, twelve hundred and five feet more or less to a corner, thence south thirty-two and one half degrees west, sixty feet more or less to the place of beginning; containing seventy-two thousand three hundred square feet more or less; being the land occupied by the Lackawanna &amp; Bloomsburg Railroad as a right of way between the Susquehanna river and a line one hundred and twenty-seven feet from Exeter street,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-7\">5. After Dr. Rice had procured this deed, he gave verbal notice to J. L. Cake, then superintendent of the Clear Spring Coal Company, Limited, of his claim of title to the coal underlying the strip occupied by the railroad company. Subsequently, after the incorporation of the defendant company, this adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>claim was brought to the attention of its board of directors in the winter of 1893. The defendant mined coal from under the territory in dispute between November, 1891, and November, 1895, with the knowledge of the plaintiff, who was a member of its board of directors. This coal was taken from two veins, known as the \u201c Checker \u201d and the \u201c Red Ash.\u201d In addition to the coal mined, the defendant, between October, 1894, and November, 1895, put a slope through the \u201c Red Ash \u201d vein. The plaintiff had previous^ been made familiar with the state of mining on this and other properties operated by the defendant; knew the coal was being mined, and did not at any time, when the matter was brought before the directors, or otherwise, object to the mining of the coal for which suit is brought, or notify the defendant companjr not to mine. He talked with the president on the subject of the slope and suggested the location. The quantity of coal mined in the disputed territory by the defendant is as follows : From the Checker vein between</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-4\">November, 1891, and November, 1893,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-5\">Chestnut and larger sizes, 2633 tons, 17 cwt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-6\">Pea . . 300 \u201c 7 \u201c</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-7\">From the Red fish vein between October, 1894, and November, 1895,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-8\">Chestnut and large sizes, 2,588 tons, 2 cwt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-9\">Pea . . 314 tons, 15 \u201c</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-10\">The rates of royalty for the different sizes of coal paid by the defendant to the owner of the coal in land adjoining the right of way was twenty-five cents per ton for chestnut and larger sizes and twelve and a half cents per ton for pea coal. Under later leases the defendant has agreed to pay thirty-five cents and twenty cents per ton for the respective sizes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-11\">It is contended for the plaintiff that the conveyance of June I, 1852, from A. Y. Smith to the railroad company, followed by the location of the railroad upon the land, vested in the railroad company a fee upon condition, in the surface \u2014\u25a0 that upon forfeiture the surface would revert to the grantor \u2014 that A. Y. Smith still had a fee simple title to the underlying coal \u2014 and that this title is now in the plaintiff, by virtue of the conveyance of March 8, 1886, from the heirs of Smith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-12\">Opposed to this contention, the defendant company, owning the coal underlying all of the land of A. Y. Smith which adjoined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the railroad on either side, by title derived through the sheriff \u2019s vendees, claims that, as the sheriff\u2019s deeds called for the land occupied by the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad Company\u2014 a public highway' \u2014 the grant carried the title to the center line of said highway, and vests in the defendant the title to the underlying coal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-5\">The issue thus made presents two questions for determination: First. What is the law in reference to boundaries on highways ? Second. Is a railroad a highway ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">Text writers have treated of the rule of law in reference to grants of land bounded by highways as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-7\">In Angel\u00ed on Highways, sec. 313, it is said \u201c where the land, bounding on the opposite sides of a highway belongs to the same person, the presumption is that he owns the fee of the entire highway; where it belongs to different persons, the presumption is, that each owns to the centre of the way, \u2014 ad medium filum vise. Sec. 314. The established inference of law,\u201d says Chancellor Kent, \u201cis that a conveyance of land hounded on a public highway carries with it the fee to the centre of the road as part and parcel of the grant. The idea of an intention in a grantor to withhold his interest in a road to the middle of it, after parting with all his right and title to the adjoining land is never to be presumed. It would be contrary to universal practice; and it was said in Peck v. Smith, that there was no instance where the fee of a highway, as distinct from the adjoining land, was ever retained by the vendor. It would require an express declaration, or something equivalent thereto, to sustain such an inference, and it may be considered as the general rule, that a grant of land bounded upon a highway or river, carries the fee in the highway or river to the centre of it, provided the grantor at the time owned to the centre, and there be no words or specific description to show a contrary intent. The soil under the highway, if it passes at all, passes as parcel of the land and not as an appurtenant. Therefore, whether the soil passes or not is purely a question of intention, to be ascertained from the description contained in the deed, explained and illustrated by all the other parts of the conveyance, and by the localities and subject matter to which it applies. Sec. 315. It may be stated as the fair conclusion from the authorities, that a grant of land, described as bounded generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u2018 by,\u2019 or \u2018 on,\u2019 or \u2018 along,\u2019 a highway, carries the fee to the centre of the highway, if the grantor owned so far; and, on the other hand, where the descriptive words are \u2018 by the side of,\u2019 \u2018 by the margin of,\u2019 or \u2018 by the line of,\u2019 or expressions equivalent thereto, the soil of the way is excluded.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-5\">\u2022\u2018 Sec. 818. The law with respect to public highways and to fresh-water rivers is the same, and the analogy perfect as concerns the right of soil, and the presumptions from grants of land bounded thereon. Such grants carry the grantee to the middle of the river, unless there are expressions in the terms of the grants, or something in the terms taken in connection with the situation and condition of the land granted, that clearly indicate an intention to stop at the edge or margin of the river. There must be a reservation or restriction, express or necessarily implied, which controls the operation of the general presumption, and makes the particular grant an exception.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-6\">In Elliott on Roads and Streets, p. 549, \u201c it is said by the Supreme Court of Connecticut that there is no instance where the fee of a highway, as distinct from the adjoining land, was ever retained by the vendor. It cannot be presumed that a grantor would part with his interest in the adjoining land and yet retain the fee of the highway subject to the public easement. The general rule is, therefore, well settled that a 4 grant of land bounded upon a highway or river carries the fee in the highway or river to the center of it, provided the grantor at the tizne owned to the cont\u00e9:\u2019, and there be no words or specific description to show a contrary intent.\u2019 Thus a deed conveying land described therein as bounded \u2018by,\u2019 \u2018on,\u2019 \u2018upon,\u2019 or\u2018along\u2019a highway prima facie carries the fee to the center of the highway.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEq\">In Mitchell on Real Estate and Conveyancing, it is said : \u201c In all highways (except public rivers) the title of the owner of the land goes to the middle of the highway, and if the land be conveyed the title passes to the soil of the highway even though the description be according to the side of the street or road. This presumption of law is so strong that it requires an express reservation in the deed to overcome it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-7\">Again, the learned author says: \u201c I have in former chapters explained the rights of parties whose lai'd bounds upon a public stream of 'water or upon a highway. They own to the middle thread of the water or to the middle of the street or road, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>and a conveyance of land so bounded will cany title to the center of the stream or road although the description mentions it as being bounded by the side, unless there are express words in the deed to show that such was not the intention of the parties.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIS\">These views of the text writers appear to be the expression of the rule of construction adopted by the courts of all the states. In Pennsylvania, the leading case is Paul v. Carver, 26 Pa. 223. Lewis, C. J., citing the extracts from Kent heretofore quoted, and referring to rulings in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and elsewhere, held that \u201c where a public street, or highway is called for as a boundary or monument in a deed, it is used as an entirety to the centre of it, and to that extent the fee passes. In such cases it will require an express exception in the deed, or some clear and unequivocal declaration or certain and immemorial usage, to limit the title of the grantee to the edge of the street. And, although the measurement of the distance set forth in the conveyance brings the line only to the side of the street, this is not sufficient to control the rule of law which carries the title to the centre of it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\">In Cox v. Freedley, 33 Pa. 124, the doctrine laid down in Paul v. Carver, supra, was affirmed, and has been uniformly followed as a rule in cases decided since. In Firmstone v. Spaeter, 150 Pa. 616, Mr. Justice McCollum says: \u201cWhere then is the boundary line of the tract along the streets mentioned? In 2 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 507, the rule on this subject is stated thus: \u2018Where land is bounded by a highway or street, the location of the boundary line will in the first place depend upon the character of the public right to the road or street. If the state or municipality owns the bed of the road the boundary line of the abutting land is the nearer edge of the roadway. But if the public only have a right of way over the land, not a title to the soil, then the location of the boundary line depends upon the intention of the grantor as manifested by the language of the deed, and the same rules of construction apply as are found in practical use in the case of non navigable streams. If the land is described as \u201cbounded on,\u201d \u201crunning along\u201d the highway and the like, the boundary lin\u00e9 is the centre of the highway, although the dimensions of the lot would exclude the highway; and in all cases of doubt the presumption is always in favor of the boundary being the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>centre of the road.\u2019 This is the rule laid down in 2 Washburn on Real Property, p. 680, and in numerous decisions of this court, among which we may mention Paul v. Carver, 26 Pa. 223, Cox v. Freedley, 33 Pa. 124 and Falls v. Reis, 74 Pa. 439. In the case last cited, Agnew, J., delivering the opinion of the Court, said that \u2018 where a street is called for as a boundary, the middle line of the street is always intended unless the contrary plainly appears.\u2019\u201d In Bliem v. Daubenspreck, 169 Pa. 282, Mr. Justice Dean, affirming Paul v. Carver, supra, distinguishes the cases decided in Pennsylvania wherein it was held that the general rule did not apply because the highway mentioned as a boundary was imaginary \u2014 wholly on paper and not actually dedicated or existing \u2014 and says: \u201c Whatever apparent conflict there may be in the cases, there is really none when the dissimilarity in facts indicating the intention of the grantor is noticed; the principle adhered to in all the cases is, that the intention is controlling and that, in bounding land by a street, it will be presumed the grant is to the middle of the street, unless the contrary be manifest from other words of the grant, or the subject of it indicates plainly a different intent. Of Paul v. Carver, supra, it was said, subsequently in Cox v. Freedley, supra, \u2018It was maturely considered and unanimously pronounced. It was shown to be agreeable to the general principle of the common law, as laid dowm by Chancellor Kent, and other text writers, and as they had been applied in numerous cases in England and our own country. It was shown also to be sanctioned by the general sense and understanding of the people, and that any doubt or denial of it would introduce intolerable inconvenience, confusion and litigation.\u2019\u201d In Childs v. Starr, 4 Hill (N. Y.), 369, it was held that lines running to a monument standing on the bank, and thence running by the river, or along the river, etc., do not restrict the grant to the bank of the stream; for the monuments in such cases are only referred to as giving the lines to the river, and not as restricting the boundary on the river.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">The rule of construction extracted from these authorities is, that unless the grantor manifests an express or implied intention to limit the extent of the grant, there is a legal presumption in favor of the grantee. Therefore, when the boundary given in a deed has physical extent, as a road, street or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>monument having width, courts will so interpret the language of the description, in the absence of any apparent contrary intent, as to carry the fee of the land to the center line of such monument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-4\">Applying this rule of construction to the deeds under which the company defendant holds title to the coal underlying the lands on either side of the railroad \u2014 the boundary on one side being \u201c the southwesterly side of lands occupied by the Lackawanna &amp; Bloomsburg Railroad Company, thence along lands so occupied\u201d \u2014 and on the other \u201ctothe line of lands occupied by the Lackawanna &amp; Bloomsburg Railroad Company, thence along said company\u2019s railroad,\u201d \u2014 it seems clear that the coal under the highway passed to the defendant as parcel of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-5\">It is objected by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the railroad is not such a highway as will bring it witbin the rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-6\">Railroads are public highways, although to be used in a different manner from .the ordinary road: 9 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 365; and in Pennsylvania the question has received judicial interpretation that is as emphatic as it ought to be final. The general act of 1849, regulating railroad companies (P. L. 79) provides in section 18 \u2014 \u201cthat upon the completion of any railroad authorized as aforesaid, the same shall be a public highway for the conveyance of passengers, and the transportation of freight, subject,\u201d etc. The act \u201c To incorporate the Lackawanna &amp; Bloomsburg Railroad Company \u201d approved April 5, 1852, P. L. 669, section 1, authorized the commissioners therein named to organize the company, \u201c with all the powers and subject to all the provisions and restrictions prescribed \u201d by the act of 1849, supra. In Sharpless v. Mayor of Philadelphia, 21 Pa. 147, Black, C. \u00abL, said: \u201c A railroad is a public highway for the public benefit.\u201d In Erie and Northeast R. R. v. Casey, 26 Pa. 287, the same learned justice speaking of a railroad said (at page 307) : \u201c Is that private property ? Certainly not! It is a public highway, solemnly devoted by law to public use. When the lands were taken to build it on they were taken for public use; otherwise they could not have been taken at all .... ; the right to take tolls .... was a mere franchise. The state may grant to a corporation or to an individual the franchise of taking tolls on any highway opened or to be opened, whether it be a railroad or river, canal or bridge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>turnpike or common road.\u201d Upon a second hearing in the same litigation, the same justice delivering the opinion of the court said (at page 324): \u201c It is objected that it (an act repealing the charter of the railroad company) is an act of confiscation \u2014\u2022 takes private property for the public use of the state without compensation. . . . Railroads built under the authority of law for the general purposes of commerce are public highways.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-5\">It is further contended by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the reasons for the principle decided in Paul v. Carver, supra, as they appear in the opinion of the court, are not applicable to a railroad \u2014 and that the advantages there enumerated become positive disadvantages in respect to lands bounding on a railroad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-6\">Lewis, C. L, said: \u201c If no other reason could be assigned in support of this rule of construction, the general understanding of the people and the extensive and immemorial practice of claiming and acquiescing in such rights ought to have great weight. A contrary opinion would introduce a flood of unprofitable litigation. But the rule has its origin in the nature of the grant \u201d \u2014 and then, illustrating the immediate case under consideration \u2014 lands bounded upon a street in a city \u2014 the learned justice said: \u201c Where land is laid out in town lots, with streets and alleys, the owner\u2019receives a full consideration for the streets and alleys in the increased value of the lots,\u201d and discusses the benefits to which the abutter is entitled, such as the right to erect houses fronting on the streets, with windows and doors,' \u2014 and doorsteps and vaults extending beyond the line of the street; the right of entry into or exit from the house, and of all the enjoyments of light and air; all of which might be prohibited by the original grantor, if his right of property remained after parting with the lots.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-7\">These benefits to the abutting owner are, however, incidents attaching to land bounded on a street, and cumulative reasons merely for the application of the rule in that case. Not all of these benefits are incidental to ownership of lands abutting on a stream, ditch or river, and yet the rule of law is uniformly applied to that kind of boundary: 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 428; 6 Conn. 471.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-8\">It is true that in addition to the paramount intent of the parties, as disclosed by the conveyance, the nature of the property granted should be considered \u2014 and there are some points of dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>ference between a railroad and other roads \u2014 but as highways they may be differentiated only in the manner of their nse. The suggestion made in Paul v. Carver, supra, that \u201ca long strip of ground fifty or one hundred feet wide and perhaps several miles in length, without any access to it except at each end, is a description of property which it is not likely either party ever contemplated as remaining in the grantor of the lots on each side,\u201d is quite as pertinent and forcible in the case of a railroad as in that of a street. And when it is remembered that the present litigation is in relation to the ownership of the coal underlying the railroad \u2014 that coal in place is land \u2014 and that to occupy the coal in the legal sense, and mine and carry it away, cannot require any of the incidents essential to occupation of the surface, except the right of ingress or egress, it would seem that the distinction sought to be drawn in the nature of the properties is not well founded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-5\">The question under consideration, so far as counsel and referee have been able to ascertain, has never been judicially determined. The nearest analogy is in Wyoming Coal &amp; Transportation Co. v. Price, 81 Pa. 156. Coal was conveyed to Price under separate conveyances for two pieces of land lying on each side of a canal, and the question before the court was whether the company was liable to Price for the coal under the canal. The court below charged that, \u201c in regard to the canal, Price owned the land and the coal under the canal subject to the right of way of the canal company.\u201d This was assigned as error. In delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice MerCUR said: \u201c They (the errors assigned) involve the question whether the defendant in error owned the land and the coal under the canal. If the question were a new one, untrammeled by previous decisions, I should feel disposed to answer in the affirmative. If, however, the authorities have settled it otherwise, we must assent to them as the true exposition of the law,\u201d and, after reviewing the legislation leading to the construction of the canals by the state, he concludes : \u201c It must therefore, now be declared as the settled law of this state, that whenever the commonwealth took land for permaneilt use under the acts in question, and constructed and operated a canal thereon, she acquired an estate in the lands so taken in perpetuity, and she may dispose of the same in fee.\u201d It is a fair inference from this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>opinion that the reason why Price did not own the coal under the canal was because the statutes under which the land was taken gave the land to the state in fee and that aside from the statutory provision the general principle applicable to lands bounded on a highway would have governed. In Commonwealth v. McAllister, 2 Watts, 197, the court held that the making of public ways through a man\u2019s land does not divest him of his right to the land so appropriated, for he is still considered the owner of it, subject merely to the right of passage upon it which the public acquires by the appropriation of it to that end. The different effect as to land used by the state in the construction of a canal is predicated upon the express terms of the act of assembly authorizing such construction; and by which the state becomes the owner: 2 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 507. And where canals are constructed under private charter the land reverts, upon abandonment, in the same manner as is the rule under any other form of highway which becomes abandoned: Pittsburg &amp; Lake Erie R. R. Co. v. Bruce, 102 Pa. 23.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-4\">If the foregoing views are correct, it follows that the Clear Spring Coal Company, as owner of the coal contained in the grants from the sheriff of Luzerne county to R.

If the referee is correct in his conclusion that the conveyance from A. Y. Smith to the Lackawanna &amp; Bloomsburg Railroad Company, set forth in the first conclusion of fact, was a grant of a-right of way merely for the purposes of a railroad, leaving in himself the ownership in fee of the soil, we are of the opinion that the subsequent sheriff\u2019s sale and deeds in pursuance thereof on the judgment against said Smith, followed by the intermediate conveyances under which the defendant claims, as stated in the third conclusion of fact, vested in it the coal in question, under the general rule of construction applied by the referee, that a conveyance of land bounded on a public way carries with it a fee to the center of the road as part and parcel of the grant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-7\">If, however, the conveyance from said Smith, followed by the location of the railroad, operated as a grant of the land to it in fee upon condition \u2014 a proposition well worthy of serious consideration if necessary to the disposition of this case \u2014 we are convinced that it was a fee in both surface and coal, and not confined to the surface only, as contended in behalf of the plaintiff, and in that case the latter, claiming through the heirs of A. Y. Smith, is not the owner of the coal. We are well satisfied of the correctness of the referee\u2019s general conclusion that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-8\">The exceptions are overruled and judgment is directed to be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-9\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions to report of referee.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b82-10\"><em>F.
