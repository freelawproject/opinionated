L. c. 275, \u00a7 2. While public schools remain very safe places for children to be, with respect to this appeal, we face the important and troubling question whether, given recent, highly publicized incidents of school violence, a drawing that depicts a student pointing a gun at his teacher constitutes a threat. We conclude that it does, and thus, affirm the adjudication of delinquency.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">1. <em>Facts and procedural history. </em>On October 27, 1998, the twelve year old juvenile sat at a desk in the hall directly outside of his classroom and drew a picture. While the juvenile was awaiting the principal\u2019s arrival to address with him \u201csome issues from the previous day,\u201d a teacher at the school confiscated the drawing and showed it to the juvenile\u2019s teacher, Mrs. F. The drawing depicted a violent scene of the juvenile shooting Mrs. F. See Appendix A. Meanwhile, the juvenile left the desk, entered the classroom, took a piece of paper, returned to the desk in the hall and \u201cproceeded to draw another picture.\u201d Moments later, the juvenile reentered the classroom and stood near the doorway. He held up the second picture, which depicted the juvenile pointing a gun at Mrs. F. See Appendix B. He looked at Mrs. F and in a defiant tone said, \u201c[D]o you want this one too?\u201d From where she was standing, Mrs. F could not see the drawing. However, after seeing the first drawing, and \u201c[f]rom his posture, [and] the look on his face,\u201d Mrs. F realized that the juvenile was very upset and very angry. Because she did not want the juvenile to approach her, she instructed him to give the drawing to another student, who then gave it to Mrs. F. The juvenile returned to his desk in the hall without further comment. Mrs. F testified that, after seeing the second drawing, she became \u201capprehensive\u201d and \u201c[ajfraid for [her] safety.\u201d Apparently, as a result of these incidents, the juvenile was suspended immediately for three days and sent home. However, at the end of that same school day, both Mrs. F and the teacher who confiscated the first drawing witnessed the juvenile at the school, loitering very near Mrs. F\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Subsequently, the Worcester Division of the Juvenile Court Department issued a complaint, charging the juvenile with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>threatening Mrs. F in violation of G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial, the judge adjudicated the juvenile delinquent by reason of threatening his teacher, on the basis of the second drawing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The juvenile appealed, and we transferred the case on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">2. <em>The standard applied. </em>The word \u201cthreatened\u201d is not defined in the Massachusetts threat statute, G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliffe, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 580, 583 (1999). However, \u201c[t]he elements of threatening a crime include an expression of intention to inflict a crime on another and an ability to do so in circumstances that would justify apprehension on the part of the recipient of the threat.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. 721, 725 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robicheau, </em>421 Mass. 176, 184 (1995). See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>300 F. Supp. 665, 668-669 (D. Mass. 1969) (articulating standard for finding threat in violation of G. L. c. 275, \u00a7\u00a7 2 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Here, the juvenile claims that the judge applied an incorrect standard in finding that the juvenile\u2019s conduct met all the requisite elements of threatening to commit a crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the juvenile did not object to the judge\u2019s findings at trial, we review this alleged error under the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice standard. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gorassi, </em>432 Mass. 244, 249 &amp; n.8 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Specifically, the juvenile claims that the judge focused his ruling on Mrs. F\u2019s subjective state of mind and, in so doing, failed to make the requisite finding of the juvenile\u2019s objective intention and ability to commit a crime. While it is true that a threat must be tested objectively, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeVin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>cent, </em>358 Mass. 592, 595 (1971) (affirming violation of attempted extortion statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 25); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 497, <em>S.C., </em>432 Mass. 721 (2000) (\u201cthe decisional law requires that the threat be made in circumstances that would reasonably justify apprehension on the part of an ordinary person\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strahan, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 928, 930 (1995) (threat assessed by determining whether defendant\u2019s statements reasonably caused apprehension), we disagree with the juvenile\u2019s claim that the judge failed to do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">As the juvenile concedes, the judge based his ruling on a finding that \u201cit was reasonable to fear that the [juvenile] had the intention and ability to carry out the threat.\u201d This objective finding reflects the judge\u2019s correct application of the law. The absence of any other references to an objective standard in his ruling does not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gorassi, supra </em>at 248-249 (substantial risk of miscarriage of justice where judge incorrectly expanded definition of assault to include \u201can attempt to do psychological harm\u201d). Indeed, \u201c[w]hen a case is tried without a jury, the legal framework in which facts are to be found is not generally stated with the precision and amplitude of instructions to a jury. As an initial matter, it is presumed that the judge as trier of fact applies correct legal principles.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 308 (1992). The record supports this presumption. Moreover, the juvenile has not shown that the judge \u201cincorrectly applied a subjective standard to determine whether a threat to commit a crime [had] occurred,\u201d as the juvenile contends. Finally, the juvenile did not ask the judge for further clarification of the law being applied. See <em>id. </em>(\u201c[a] judge sitting without a jury may . . . make an express ruling on a disputed point of law . . . upon specific request of counsel who desires to preserve a point for appeal\u201d). The judge\u2019s finding was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">3. <em>Findings of fact and sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The juvenile next argues that the judge\u2019s determinations that the juvenile (1) had the intention and ability to commit a crime that would justify apprehension on the part of Mrs. F; and (2) communicated the threat to Mrs. F were clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These factual findings are subject to the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>and we conclude the judge\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Motta, </em>424 Mass. 117, 121 (1997). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>429 Mass. 169, 172 (1999) (\u201cwe defer to the . . . judge\u2019s finding of fact in the absence of clear error\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>426 Mass. 290, 294 (1997). Having reviewed the entire trial transcript, we conclude that there is ample evidence in the record to support these findings. Thus, we are not \u201cleft with the firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 146, cert, denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982). Therefore, the findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The juvenile also seems to argue that there was insufficient evidence to support the judge\u2019s finding that the juvenile threatened Mrs. F. Specifically, the juvenile contends that the judge \u201chad no evidence of [the juvenile\u2019s] ability to commit the threatened crime before [him], and therefore, the trial court based its decision on insufficient evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Initially, we note that, because the juvenile made no request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>for a required finding of not guilty, we review his insufficient evidence claim under the substantial risk of a miscarriage- of justice standard. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGovern, </em>397 Mass. 863, 867-868 (1986). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strahan, supra </em>at 929. In determining whether the evidence was sufficient to support the judge\u2019s conclusions, we view the evidence at trial in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, and \u201cdetermine whether . . . <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lodge, </em>431 Mass. 461, 465 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGovern, supra </em>at 868. We conclude that the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the juvenile threatened Mrs. F.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">There was sufficient evidence to support the judge\u2019s finding that the juvenile expressed an intent to commit the threatened crime and an ability to do so in circumstances that would justify apprehension on Mrs. F\u2019s part. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. 721, 725 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robicheau, supra </em>at 183. In making this determination, we consider \u201cthe context in which the allegedly threatening [drawing was given to Mrs. F] and all of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliffe, supra </em>at 582 (in assessing its sufficiency, evidence \u201cmust be interpreted in the context of the actions and demeanor which accompanied [it]\u201d). The juvenile\u2019s intention to carry out the threat may be inferred from several facts. First, the content of each drawing separately evidences his intent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The first drawing portrays a figure, labeled with the juvenile\u2019s name, pointing what appears to be a gun at another figure, labeled with Mrs. F\u2019s name. The Mrs. F figure has her hands clasped in front of her and is crying and pleading, \u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me.\u201d Drawn directly next to the Mrs. F figure is another unlabeled figure, whose head is falling off to the right. At the bottom of the drawing is the word \u201cBlood,\u201d written in large letters. See Appendix A. The second drawing depicts a figure labeled with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>juvenile\u2019s name, aiming a gun at another figure, labeled with Mrs. F\u2019s name. Directly above the Mrs. F figure are the words \u201cPissy Pants.\u201d The Mrs. F figure is kneeling with her hands clasped in front of her, and appears to have urinated on herself, suggesting her extreme fear of being shot. Some words are written inside a box drawn under the barrel of the gun; one of the words appears to be \u201cBang.\u201d See Appendix B. The content of both drawings makes the juvenile\u2019s intent to harm Mrs. F clear.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Second, the juvenile made not just one, but two drawings, both of which depicted images of himself perpetrating violence upon Mrs. F. The judge could have inferred the juvenile\u2019s intent from the number of drawings. Third, the juvenile\u2019s intent may be inferred from his very angry demeanor and defiant manner toward Mrs. F when he held out the drawing to her. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliffe, supra. </em>Thus, there was sufficient evidence to support the judge\u2019s finding that the drawing was \u201can expression of an intention to harm [Mrs. F].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. 721, 726 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">As to the juvenile\u2019s present ability to carry out the threat, the juvenile contends that \u201cthere was no direct evidence that the [juvenile] had the ability to commit this crime.\u201d There was, however, sufficient circumstantial evidence to support this finding. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lodge, supra </em>at 465, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nadworny, </em>396 Mass. 342, 354 (1985), cert, denied, 477 U.S. 904 (1986) (circumstantial evidence can establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>414 Mass. 343, 354, cert, denied, 510 U.S. 815 (1993) (conviction \u201cmay rest entirely on circumstantial evidence\u201d). This is not a case where the finding of ability \u201crest[s] on surmise, conjecture, or guesswork.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>395 Mass. 20, 25 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 255, 257 (1980). Indeed, as discussed above, the juvenile held the second of two very violent drawings out to Mrs. F in an angry and defiant manner. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliffe, supra </em>at 582. Moreover, prior to the incident, the juvenile was sitting out in the hall, awaiting the principal\u2019s arrival. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Although it is not clear exactly what, if anything, the juvenile had done to warrant this discipline, the teacher who confiscated the first drawing testified that \u201c[ujsually, if a student is outside the room, [the student] had done something to cause that situation . . . .\u201d Thus, the judge could have reasonably inferred that the juvenile was already being disciplined, and that Mrs. F, as his teacher, \u201cwas familiar with the [juvenile\u2019s] history\u201d at school and in her classroom. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 499 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Moreover, although there is no evidence that the juvenile possessed an immediate ability to carry out the threat at the time he communicated the drawing to Mrs. F, this does \u201cnot mean that [the juvenile] could not have carried out his threat at a later time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(presence of other individuals capable of intervening at time defendant addressed victim did not render otherwise threatening statements nonthreatening). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ditsch, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 1005, 1005 (1985) (\u201cabsence of immediate ability, physically and personally, to do bodily harm\u201d does not preclude conviction of making threats); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strahan, supra </em>at 930 (\u201c[w]hether the [juvenile] ultimately might not carry out the threat is not relevant to the question of the sufficiency of the Commonwealth\u2019s proof that a threat was in fact made\u201d). Indeed, the juvenile\u2019s ability to carry out the threat in the future could have been inferred from the fact that the juvenile was seen loitering near Mrs. F\u2019s car later the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Finally, given the recent highly publicized, school-related shootings by students, we take judicial notice of the actual and potential violence in public schools. Although we note that schools remain very safe places for children to be, such violent episodes are matters of common knowledge, particularly within the teaching community, and thus, are \u201cindisputably true.\u201d <em>Dimino </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>427 Mass. 704, 707 (1998). <em>Nantucket </em>v. <em>Beinecke, </em>379 Mass. 345, 352 (1979). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>383 Mass. 655, 656-657 (1981) (court took judicial notice \u201cthat threats of violent acts directed at court houses have given rise to an urgent need for protective measures\u201d). See, e.g., <em>In re B.R., </em>732 A.2d 633, 637 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1999) (judge took judicial notice of \u201cclimate of apprehension\u201d existing at time juvenile made threatening statements in presence of teacher due to recent, highly publicized school-related shootings by students); <em>People </em>v. <em>Pruitt, </em>278 Ill. App. 3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>194, 203 n.l (1996) (in taking judicial notice of \u201cactual and potential violence in public schools,\u201d court noted \u201c[jjudges cannot ignore what everybody else knows: violence and the threat of violence are present in the public schools .... [Tjeachers . . . have a duty to take whatever lawful steps are necessary to assure that the school premises are safe and weapon free\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Recently, \u201c[ojther children of like age [have] made similar threats . . . and [have] carried them out with tragic consequences for both juveniles and their victims.\u201d <em>In re B.R., supra </em>at 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">These factors, when considered in light of the \u201cclimate of apprehension\u201d concerning school violence in which this incident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>occurred, make Mrs. F\u2019s fear that the juvenile could carry out the threat quite reasonable and justifiable. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. 721, 726 (2000). See <em>In re B.R., supra </em>at 637-638.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Finally, we conclude that the record supports the finding that the juvenile communicated the threat, vis-a-vis the second drawing, to Mrs. F. Indeed, the obviously angry juvenile entered Mrs. F\u2019s classroom, held out the second violent picture \u2014 the content of which was directed at Mrs. F \u2014 to her and defiantly asked, \u201c[D]o you want this one too?\u201d Although Mrs. F testified that initially, she could not \u201creally see\u201d the picture, she was able to once she received it from the other student shortly thereafter. From these facts, the judge could have found that the drawing itself, when held out to Mrs. F, communicated the threat. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the combination of these factors sufficiently supports the finding that the juvenile communicated the threat to Mrs. F.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. 721, 726 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ditsch, supra </em>at 1005 (judgment affirmed where threat communicated by letter from incarcerated defendant to victim).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">This evidence, when viewed as a whole \u201cmay constitute the requisite expression [of intention to do bodily harm], and may indicate additionally, in these circumstances, ability and apprehension.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliffe, supra </em>at 582. Thus, we find that sufficient evidence supports the judge\u2019s decision that the drawing constituted a threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">4. <em>First Amendment violation. </em>\u201c[T]he First Amendment [to the United States Constitution] does not protect conduct that threatens another.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. 721, 726 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robicheau, </em>421 Mass. 176, 183 (1995). See <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Women\u2019s Health Ctr., Inc., </em>512 U.S. 753, 773 (1994) (\u201cthreats ... are prescribable under the First Amendment\u201d); <em>Watts </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 705, 707 (1969) (\u201cWhat is a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fulmer, </em>108 F.3d 1486, 1492-1493 (1st Cir. 1997) (\u201ca true threat is unprotected by the First Amendment\u201d). Because we find there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>was sufficient evidence to support the judge\u2019s conclusion that the juvenile\u2019s drawing constituted a threat, there is no violation of the juvenile\u2019s First Amendment rights. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. 721, 726 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">The adjudication of delinquency is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Justice Abrams participated in the deliberation on this case, but retired before the opinion was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Appendix A.</p>\n<p id=\"pAtt\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Appendix B.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-1\">Juvenile's name removed by the court.

I make a finding of sufficient facts in this case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The juvenile also seeks de novo review of the second drawing because \u201cthe trial court\u2019s determination of [the juvenile\u2019s] ability and intention was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>based solely on the documentary evidence of the second drawing.\u201d See <em>Balcam </em>v. <em>Hingham, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 260, 261 (1996); <em>Guempel </em>v. <em>Great Am. Ins. Co., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 845, 848 (1981). This argument is without merit because the evidence was \u201cof mixed character \u2014 live and documentary.\u201d <em>Cornwall </em>v. <em>Forger, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 336, 338 (1989). In addition to the two drawings, the Commonwealth presented live testimony from both Mrs. F and the teacher who confiscated the first drawing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b165-10\">We do this because the juvenile characterized these determinations as factual findings subject to the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard in his brief. However, it is not clear that such findings were actually factual in nature, and may be more aptly characterized as \u201cultimate findings of fact and rulings of law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, </em>420 Mass. 433, 447 (1995). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stirk, </em>16 Mass.

Such findings \u201cas they bear on issues of constitutional dimension, are open for reexamination by this court, [but] such ultimate findings are \u2018entitled to substantial deference by this court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bottari, </em>395 Mass. <em>777, </em>780 (1985). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conkey, </em>430 Mass. 139, 144 (1999) (\u201cwe give substantial deference to [such findings], but we independently apply the constitutional principles to the facts found\u201d). Indeed, \u201c[o]ur appellate function requires that we make an independent determination on the correctness of the judge\u2019s \u2018application of the constitutional principles to the facts as found.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bookman, </em>386 Mass. 657, 661-662 n.6 (1982), quoting <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 403 (1977). Nonetheless, were we to adhere to this standard, we would \u201csee no sufficient basis for interfering with the findings and conclusion of the judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bookman, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In finding that the second drawing constituted a threat, the judge considered the first drawing, which he found to \u201cportray[] an act of violence being perpetrated upon the teacher.\u201d The fact that the judge ruled that the first drawing was not a separate threat because the juvenile did not communicate it to Mrs. F, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>did not diminish its evidentiary value and he could have inferred the juvenile\u2019s intent from it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The intent that must be expressed is an intent to commit a crime. We note that both drawings depict extreme fear on the part of Mrs. F and express the juvenile\u2019s desire to instill such fear on her part. Assuming that the drawings should not be interpreted as an intent to actually shoot Mrs. F, an intent to assault her by means of a dangerous weapon would still constitute an intent to commit a crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b169-5\">We take judicial notice of the fact that, prior to this incident, the following highly publicized school shootings had occurred: On February 2, 1996, in Moses Lake, Washington, a fourteen year old fatally shot a teacher and two students and wounded another student; on February 19, 1997, in Bethel, Alaska, a sixteen year old shot and killed his principal and a student, and wounded two other students; on October 1, 1997, in Pearl, Mississippi, a sixteen year old boy shot his mother, and then went to school and shot nine students, two fatally; on December 1, 1997, in West Paducah, Kentucky, a fourteen year old student shot and killed three students and wounded five others; on March 24, 1998, in Jonesboro, Arkansas, two boys, aged eleven and thirteen years, shot to death four girls and a teacher, and wounded ten others during a false fire alarm; on April 24, 1998, in Edinboro, Pennsylvania, a fourteen year old student was charged with fatally shooting his science teacher at an eighth grade dance; on May 19, 1998, in Fayetteville, Tennessee, an eighteen year old honor student allegedly shot his classmate to death in the parking lot of their high school; on May 21, 1998, in Springfield, Oregon, a fifteen year old boy allegedly shot and killed two of his classmates and wounded more than twenty other students; on June 15, 1998, in Richmond, Virginia, a fourteen year old allegedly wounded one teacher and one guidance counselor in a high school. This tragic trend regrettably continued after the incident at issue in this case occurred. On April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, two young men fatally shot fourteen students and one teacher and wounded at least twenty-three others, before taking their own lives. See 25 Feared Dead, 20 Hurt in High School Shooting: Colorado Rampage Ends When 2 Commit Suicide, Courier-Journal (Louisville, Kentucky), April 21, 1999 at 1A; Haney, A Timeline of Recent School Shootings (April 27, 2000); ABC News, An Explosion of Violence (Mar. 28, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">We also note that, in 1985, the United States Supreme Court noted that \u201cin recent years, school disorder has often taken particularly ugly forms: drug use and violent crime in the schools have become major social problems.\u201d <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., </em>469 U.S. 325, 339 (1985). Additionally, in 1995, the United States Supreme Court in a dissent by Justice Breyer noted that \u201creports, hearings, and other readily available literature make clear that the problem of guns in and around schools is widespread and extremely serious.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 619 (1995) (Breyer, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Contrary to the juvenile\u2019s assertion, the record does not indicate that the judge considered the question, \u201cDo you want this one too?,\u201d as the sole basis for concluding that the threat had been communicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
