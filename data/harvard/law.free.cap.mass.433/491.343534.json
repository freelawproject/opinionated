L. c. 152, \u00a7 28, of the workers\u2019 compensation act (act) for the alleged serious and wilful misconduct of the worker\u2019s employer because the employer is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>insolvent and unable to repay CNA as provided in the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A judge in the Superior Court concluded that CNA must pay the double compensation and entered a final declaratory judgment to that effect. CNA appealed and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">1. On June 9, 1988, when James Sliski was eighteen years old, he fell through an elevator shaft at work and suffered spinal injuries that left him a paraplegic. At the time of his injuries, Sliski was employed by Doane &amp; Williams, Inc. (Doane &amp; Williams), which was insured by CNA. CNA accepted liability for Sliski\u2019s injury and commenced payment of weekly workers\u2019 compensation benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Sliski alleged that his injuries were the result of serious and wilful misconduct by Doane &amp; Williams, and on March 23, 1989, he filed with the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) a claim for double compensation pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28. Notice of the claim was given to both CNA and Doane &amp; Williams, but the record does not indicate what, if any, action was taken on that claim. In 1991, Doane &amp; Williams ceased to do business, and its assets were sold in lieu of foreclosure by a secured creditor. On June 2, 1992, Sliski refiled his claim for double compensation. CNA filed a denial of the refiled claim on June 5, 1992, and subsequently filed with the department a motion to dismiss, raising the statute of limitations and laches as defenses, and claiming that it was not liable for payment of double compensation to Sliski because its insured had become insolvent. An administrative judge in the department denied the motion on June 8, 1993. Sliski\u2019s \u00a7 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>claim remains pending before the department and has been stayed pending the outcome of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">2. CNA argues that, because double compensation is available to an employee only on a showing of serious and wilful misconduct by the employer, the purpose of the provision is to punish the employer and to deter other employers from engaging in such misconduct. To require CNA to make such payments to Sliski with no possibility of repayment by Doane &amp; Williams, it argues, defeats the punitive purpose of the statute, violates the public policy against providing insurance coverage for punitive damages, and violates its due process rights. It likens the \u00a7 28 double compensation to multiple damage awards for a wilful and knowing violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 11, which we have acknowledged are avowedly punitive. <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Arbella Mut. Ins. Co., </em>426 Mass. 683, 686 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The language of the statute suggests that the purpose of \u00a7 28 is to benefit an injured worker, not to punish the employer, for it describes the double payments as \u201cextra compensation.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28. See <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977) (statutory language principal source of insight into legislative purpose). See also <em>Thayer\u2019s Case, </em>345 Mass. 36, 43 (1962) (\u201cextra or double award which enures to the benefit of the injured employee under \u00a7 28 constitutes, in our opinion, compensation as that term is used in the [act]\u201d). In <em>Boardman\u2019s Case, </em>365 Mass. 185, 193 (1974), this court noted in passing that the doubling provision of \u00a7 28 \u201cmay have a punitive aspect.\u201d But we were not asked in that case to decide whether \u00a7 28 was punitive, and any suggestion to that effect does not reflect the legislative intent as evidenced by the legislative history that we discuss below.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">We have long recognized that the workers\u2019 compensation statute was enacted as a \u201chumanitarian measure\u201d in response to strong public sentiment that the remedies afforded by actions of tort at common law did not provide adequate protection to workers who were the victims of industrial accidents. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349 (1914). <em>LaClair </em>v. <em>Silberline Mfg. Co., </em>379 Mass. 21, 27 (1979). We have stressed that the statute should be given a broad interpretation, viewed in light of that purpose. <em>Roberge\u2019s Case, </em>330 Mass. 506, 509 (1953). Against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>that general background we turn to the legislative history of \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Section 28 has existed in essentially the same form since the statute was first enacted in 1911. See St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to enactment in 1911, the Commission on Compensation for Industrial Accidents submitted a report to the Legislature describing the nature of the proposed new workers\u2019 compensation laws, stating they were \u201cnot intended to be punitive <em>in any sense, </em>but [were] founded on the principle that the whole community for which production is carried on should bear the burden of all the costs of production\u201d (emphasis added). 1911 House Doc. No. 300, at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Then, in 1912, the Massachusetts Commission on Compensation for Industrial Accidents again submitted a report to the Legislature describing the history of the legislation, and providing a commentary on the new act. See Report of the Massachusetts Commission on Compensation for Industrial Accidents (July 1, 1912) (unnumbered). See also <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, </em>381 Mass. 501, 519-525 n.21 (1980). Commenting specifically on what is now \u00a7 28, the commission noted that this section \u201cgrants double compensation for injuries occasioned by the serious and wilful misconduct of the employer,\u201d adding that the provision was made because the commission \u201cthought it equitable to provide a double compensation for the injuries occasioned by serious and wilful misconduct of the employer.\u201d Report of the Massachusetts Commission on Compensation for Industrial Accidents, <em>supra </em>at 48. There is no hint of any punitive intent. Rather, the sole focus was on the equitable compensation of injured workers. We recognize, as does the dissent, that the award of double compensation is determined \u201cby the character of the employer\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 499. A worker who is injured by the \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d of an employer must forgo the recovery of tort damages that would likely be far more substantial and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>common-law claim with a greater likelihood of success than his recovery or claim could be for injuries resulting from an employer\u2019s mere negligent conduct. The Legislature could, and in our judgment did, conclude that it would be equitable to award such a worker double compensation in recognition of the greater value of the common-law claim given up. These were not punitive damages by some other name. See <em>post </em>at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In light of this unambiguous history, we conclude that the purpose of \u00a7 28 has never been punitive. See <em>Assessors of Newton </em>v. <em>Pickwick Ltd., </em>351 Mass. 621, 625 (1967) (\u201ca construction [of a statute which] would completely negate legislative intent . . . is to be avoided\u201d). One respected commentator has reached the same conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u201cThe double compensation paid the employee where the injury is the result of the employer\u2019s serious and wilful misconduct is not ... a \u2018penalty.\u2019 It is compensation, in the generic sense, encompassing all monetary payments under the act. Proceedings under [\u00a7] 28, therefore, should be subject to the general rule of liberal construction applicable to other cases under the act . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">L. Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 286, at 327 (2d ed. 1981). Because we conclude that \u00a7 28 is not punitive, we need not consider CNA\u2019s due process claim that rests on such an assumption. For the same reason, there is no merit to CNA\u2019s argument that it would be against public policy to require CNA to pay \u201cpunitive\u201d damages targeted at the employer. Public policy, as articulated by the Legislature, clearly places on CNA the obligation to pay this double compensation, however it is characterized.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">3. Our conclusion that \u00a7 28 double compensation is not punitive does not end our inquiry, for we still must decide whether the risk of an employer\u2019s insolvency should be borne by the insurer or by the injured employee. Both CNA and Sliski argue that the language of the statute compels the result each seeks. But resort to that familiar rule of construction sheds little light here. The statute unambiguously mandates double payment to the injured employee by the insurer if the employer is insured. See <em>West\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 146, 154 (1943) (under \u00a7 28, claim for double compensation \u201cin the first instance is to be paid by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the insurer\u201d). See also L. Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 289, at 341. However, the statute then provides that the employer \u201cshall repay to the insurer the extra compensation paid to the employee.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">CNA asserts that the statute \u201cclearly places the ultimate responsibility of making the \u00a7 28 payment on the employer and not the insurer.\u201d But the text of \u00a7 28 does not mandate that result: it is silent as to the allocation of risk where the employer itself is insolvent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The legislative scheme as a whole, and the legislative history of the specific provision at issue, however, suggest a resolution. The purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation laws in general, and \u00a7 28 in particular, is properly effectuated by placing the risk of the employer\u2019s insolvency on the insurer, and not the injured employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u201cThe history of workmen\u2019s compensation in this Commonwealth shows that the Legislature gradually but consistently has enlarged the scope of the laws pertaining to it, and that the courts have construed those laws liberally for the protection of the injured employee.\u201d <em>Roberge\u2019s Case, </em>330 Mass. 506, 509 (1953), and cases cited. To this end, in <em>LaClair </em>v. <em>Silberline Mfg. Co., </em>379 Mass. 21 (1979), we recognized a common-law right against the individual officers of an insolvent company for negligent failure to procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance. We noted that insolvency \u201cis a risk of the free enterprise system, and that the penalties should not be assessed on disabled employees,\u201d who are entitled to full compensation, even though their employer suffered bankruptcy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 29-30 n.ll. For much the same reason we discern that the Legislature did not intend that a worker who suffers a catastrophic injury because of the serious and wilful misconduct of his employer should bear the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>brunt of the employer\u2019s insolvency. See <em>Armstrong\u2019s Case, </em>416 Mass. 796, 801 n.9 (1994) (\u201cWe think it probable, therefore, that the reference to compensation in \u00a7 28 also contemplates benefits paid by the insurer\u201d). See also <em>Boardman\u2019s Case, </em>365 Mass. 185, 193 (1974), where we observed that double compensation is a \u201ctacit acknowledgment\u201d that the act \u201cordinarily affords the employee rather slim recovery, which deserves to be increased down the line when the employer is conceived to be seriously at fault.\u201d* <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Unlike some other States, the Massachusetts statute makes no provision insulating insurance carriers from payment of double compensation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In recent years our Legislature has enacted significant revisions to the workers\u2019 compensation statute. See, e.g., St. 1991, c. 398; St. 1985, c. 572. Had the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>intended to accomplish the result sought here by CNA, it could readily have made such a provision explicit. For example, the Legislature, in 1985, established for the first time a trust fund through which an injured employee, whose employer had illegally failed to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance, could be compensated. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65 (2) <em>(e), </em>as appearing in St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 55. There was no exphcit limitation on the compensation available to the injured worker from the trust fund, including double compensation for a worker injured by the serious and wilful misconduct of an uninsured employer. <em>Id. </em>In 1991, in response to a growing concern that the trust fund was seriously underfunded,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Legislature amended the statute to provide explicitly that the statutory fund (and only the fund) would no longer be responsible for double compensation provided under \u00a7 28.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65 (2) (&lt;?), as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 85. See generally 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.04 (1997). It is argued that when, in 1991, the Legislature specified that \u00a7 28 benefits were not payable from the trust fund, it must have intended to prohibit payment of double compensation by all insurers who would not be reimbursed by their insured, such as CNA. But it is a familiar principle of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>statutory interpretation that express mention of one matter excludes other similar matters not mentioned. <em>Spence, Bryson, Inc. </em>v. <em>China Prods. Co., </em>308 Mass. 81, 88 (1941). The Legislature has determined that only the trust fund is not responsible for payment of double compensation to an injured worker whose employer is insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 28, provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf the employee is injured by reason of the serious and wilful misconduct of an employer . . . the amounts of compensation hereinafter provided shall be doubled.

See <em>post </em>at 499, citing <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Atlantic Research Corp., </em>358 Mass. 764, 766 (1971). But that does not determine what the Legislature intended where the employer is insolvent and unable to reimburse the insurer. We acknowledged as much in <em>Burke, supra </em>at 766, where we observed that, because there was \u201cnothing in the record to indicate that the employer would be unable to reimburse the insurer for possible extra compensation,\u201d the insurer stood \u201cto suffer no loss from the plaintiff\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Burke </em>left open the question we are now asked to resolve.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\">CNA points to no law where existence of a right of indemnification relieves one of liability merely because the indemnitor is insolvent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b509-5\">CNA asserts that the \u201cslim\u201d recovery under the act referred to in our cases is no longer relevant, because the amounts of compensation awarded were increased by the Legislature in 1985. See generally St. 1985, c. 572. However, the recovery that an injured employee can expect under the act is still \u201cslim\u201d when compared to the recovery that one could expect from a successful tort action. Workers\u2019 compensation law, unlike tort law, does not seek to make an injured worker whole; workers generally recover only partial lost wages, and cannot recover for pain and suffering. See Haas, On Reintegrating Workers\u2019 Compensation and Employers\u2019 Liability, 21 Ga. L. Rev. 843, 846-847 (1987) (noting tort judgments substantially higher than workers\u2019 compensation awards). In any event we look to the purpose of the statute when enacted, not later circumstances that may change.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b509-11\">Cf., e.g., Fla. Stat.

See L. Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 13.1, at 377 (Koziol Supp. 2000). By the fall of 1987, the department was receiving fifteen to twenty claims a week. <em>Id. </em>In 1988, the trust fund paid out $1.7 million for uninsured workers. In 1989, that cost almost doubled to $3.1 million. See More and More, Employers Flout the Insurance Laws, The Boston Globe, Aug. 5, 1990, at Al. In response to these unanticipated and increasing costs, in 1991 the Legislature \u201cnarrowed the Trust Fund\u2019s obligations to pay benefits to employees of uninsured employers and vested the fund with several tools aimed at . . . controlling its expenditures.\u201d See L. Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 3.3, at 41 (Koziol Supp. 2000). The 1991 amendment that prohibited payment of \u00a7 28 double compensation by the trust fund was part of this cost-cutting legislative package.

I respectfully dissent. In my view, an award of compensation under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28, is punitive, or exemplary, in nature. Although it inures to the benefit of the party injured, that is generally true of all punitive damages awards. The award is not determined by the injury to the employee, except indirectly; it is determined by the character of the employer\u2019s conduct. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 908 (1979). We have said that \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d under \u00a7 28 \u201cis much more than mere negligence, or even than gross or culpable negligence. It involves conduct of a quasi criminal nature, the intentional doing of something either with the knowledge that it is likely to result in serious injury or with a wanton and reckless disregard of its probable consequences.\u201d <em>Thayer\u2019s Case, </em>345 Mass. 36, 39-40 (1962), quoting <em>Scaia\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 432, 433-434 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">A claim under \u00a7 28 is generally not included in the agreement for compensation. See <em>West\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 146, 154 (1943). The real party in interest is the employer, not the insurer, and \u00a7 28 permits the employer to \u201cappear and defend against such claim only.\u201d See <em>Thayer\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 44; <em>West\u2019s Case, supra. </em>The insurer\u2019s involvement is purely administrative, as the Legislature intended the insurer to be reimbursed by the employer. See <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Atlantic Research Corp., </em>358 Mass. 764, 766 (1971) (no conflict of interest between insurer and employee in third-party action brought by insurer in employee\u2019s name, pursuant to G.
