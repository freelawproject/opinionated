After prevailing in <em>Brunelle </em>v. <em>Lynn Pub. Schs., </em>428 Mass. 512 (1998) <em>(Brunelle I), </em>where we declared that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to educate their children at home could not be conditioned on evaluative home visits by school officials, the plaintiffs filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees. A judge in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Superior Court denied their motion, and they appealed. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review. Because we conclude that the plaintiffs are not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, we affirm, the Superior Court judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">1. <em>Facts and procedural history. </em>The underlying facts giving rise to this claim are set forth in <em>Brunelle I. </em>We summarize them here. The plaintiffs notified Lynn school officials of their intention to educate their children at home. As part of their examination of the submitted home education proposals, the school committee, acting on behalf of the school department, required the parents to allow \u201cthe Superintendent (or designee, i.e., the Principal) to periodically . . . observe and evaluate the instructional process and to verify that the Home Instruction Plan is being implemented as authorized by the Committee.\u201d <em>Brunelle I, supra </em>at 513. The plaintiffs refused to submit to these observations and evaluations in their homes. Consequently, the school committee disapproved both the Pustells\u2019 and the Brunelles\u2019 home education plans<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, shortly thereafter, initiated a criminal complaint against the Brunelles in the Lynn Division of the District Court Department, pursuant to G. L. c. 76, \u00a7\u00a7 2 (failure to cause child to attend school) and 4 (inducing absence of minors). A similar complaint was not filed against the Pustells, whose 1994-1995 home instruction plan was approved by the school committee in order to permit the Pustells to home school their children until the litigation was resolved. Subsequently, the criminal case against the Brunelles was removed from the Juvenile Court\u2019s docket, pending resolution of these issues through a complaint for a declaratory judgment that was filed by the Brunelles and the Pustells in June, 1995. In this declaratory action, the plaintiffs asserted that the home visit requirement deprived them of their statutory rights under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and certain provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution. On cross motions for summary judgment, the judge ruled in favor of the defendant, and found that the home visit requirement was valid. On appeal, we vacated the judgment and ordered that a new judgment be entered \u201cdeclaring that the school committee of Lynn and other school officials cannot, in the absence of consent, require home visits, as a condition to the approval of the plaintiffs\u2019 home educational plans.\u201d <em>Brunelle I, supra </em>at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In March, 1999, the plaintiffs, pursuant to the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111 (Act), filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $29,215, which was denied. The sole question before us concerns the correctness of the order denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion. We conclude the order was proper because the plaintiffs have not prevailed on a claim under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111.* <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201c[A] party prevails under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111 when he or she achieves success on a substantial question of law arising out of a common nucleus of facts that gives rise to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>cause of action under the statute.\u201d <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., </em>393 Mass. 819, 822 (1985). \u201cA claim presents a substantial question of law \u2018unless \u201cit is \u2018obviously without merit\u2019 or . . . \u2018its unsoundness so clearly results, from the previous decisions of [the Supreme Court] as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the question sought to be raised can be subject to controversy.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Guardianship of Hurley, </em>394 Mass. 554, 558-559 (1985), quoting <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 318 (1982). It is clear that the plaintiffs prevailed on a substantial question of law. <em>Brunelle I, supra </em>at 519. Thus, we turn to whether the plaintiffs satisfied the elements of a G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111, claim. See <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., supra; Guardianship of Hurley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u201cNot every violation of law is a violation of the [Act].\u201d <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>404 Mass. 325, 333 (1989). Although, as the plaintiffs assert, the Act \u201cis remedial [in nature and,] as such, it is entitled to liberal construction of its terms,\u201d <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., supra, </em>it is equally true that \u201cthe Legislature did not intend [the Act] to create \u2018a vast constitutional tort.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., </em>403 Mass. 713, 718 (1989), quoting <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Mazza, </em>394 Mass. 176, 182-183 (1985). Consequently, to establish a claim under the Act, \u201cthe plaintiffs must prove that (1) their exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of either the United States or of the Commonwealth, (2) have been interfered with, or attempted to be interfered with, and (3) that the interference or attempted interference was by \u2018threats, intimidation or coercion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Swanset Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>423 Mass. 390, 395 (1996), quoting <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of W. Boylston, </em>419 Mass. 548, 564, cert, denied, 516 U.S. 931 (1995). See <em>id. </em>at 565-566 (Legislature\u2019s insertion of \u201crequirement of threats, intimidation or coercion was specifically intended to limit liability under the Act\u201d); <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Mazza, supra </em>at 182 (\u201cLegislature explicitly limited this remedy to situations where the derogation of secured rights occurs by \u2018threats, intimidation or coercion\u2019 \u201d); G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The school committee\u2019s refusal to approve the plaintiffs\u2019 home schooling plan clearly interfered with their right to educate their children at home, as secured by G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1. <em>Brunelle 1, supra </em>at 519. Thus, the pivotal issue in this case is whether this interference was effected \u201cby threats, intimidation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>coercion.\u201d <em>Swanset Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Taunton, supra </em>at 396. The plaintiffs assert that the \u201ccriminal prosecution of the Brunelles\u201d by the school committee, i.e., the initiation of a criminal complaint, constituted \u201cintimidation or coercion.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The plaintiffs correctly assert that the statute\u2019s coercion requirement is satisfied \u201cwhere the <em>natural effect </em>of the defendant\u2019s actions [is] to coerce [the plaintiffs] in the exercise of [their] rights\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Redgrave </em>v. <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc., </em>399 Mass. 93, 100 (1987). Here, however, the school committee\u2019s actions had no such \u201cnatural effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">First, it is undisputed that, notwithstanding the school committee\u2019s initiation of the charges against the Brunelles, the plaintiffs continued to educate their children at home during the pendency of the action, free from intrusive visits from agents of the Lynn school department. Contrast <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., supra </em>at 823 (plaintiff ceased soliciting and distributing political handbills after being ordered to do so by security guard). Additionally, by agreement of the parties, the action was removed from the Juvenile Court\u2019s docket, pending resolution of the issues through the plaintiffs\u2019 civil action for declaratory judgment. Thus, this complaint could not, and did not, have an impact on the plaintiffs in the exercise of their right to educate their children at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">This defendant did not utilize physical force to interfere with the plaintiffs\u2019 right to educate their children at home. Contrast <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>417 Mass. 467, 473, 475, cert, denied, 513 U.S. 868 (1994) (defendants\u2019 \u201cphysical confrontations accompanied by threats of harm,\u201d including trespassing and intentionally using their bodies or bicycle locks to \u201cprevent others physically from entering, leaving or using medical facilities to obtain abortions to which they were constitutionally and lawfully entitled,\u201d amounted to \u201cthreats, intimidation, and coercion\u201d); <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Mazza, supra </em>at 179, 183 (allegation of physical threat and threat to do \u201canything,\u201d \u201cat any cost,\u201d to prevent plaintiffs from exercising their rights constituted sufficient threats, intimidation, or coercion to survive motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Nor did the defendant employ an unwarranted \u201cheavy-handed use of police power.\u201d <em>Reproductive Rights Network </em>v. <em>President of the Univ. of Mass., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 508 (1998). Contrast <em>Batchelder, supra </em>at 823 (finding \u201csufficient intimidation or coercion\u201d where private security guard ordered plaintiff to stop exercising his right to ballot access); <em>Reproductive Rights Network </em>v. <em>President of the Univ. of Mass., supra </em>at 507 (intimidation found where seventeen uniformed police officers prevented plaintiffs from exercising their rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Finally, the repercussions faced by the plaintiffs under the charges were de minimis,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and thus did not serve to coerce, threaten, or intimidate them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Thus, the \u201cnatural effect\u201d of these factors taken together was not to intimidate or coerce the plaintiffs in the exercise of their right to educate their children at home. <em>Redgrave </em>v. <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc., supra </em>at 100. Given the lack of coercion, threats, or intimidation in this case, the plaintiffs did not satisfy the elements of a G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, claim, and therefore, their claim for attorney\u2019s fees must fail. The order of the Superior Court judge is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In response to the school committee\u2019s rejection of their home education plan, the Pustells filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts challenging the home visit requirement on Federal constitutional grounds. The District Court\u2019s decision upholding the home visit requirement was appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that the Federal courts \u201cshould abstain from deciding the Federal constitutional issues until the State courts had determined whether the home visit requirement was valid under State law.\u201d <em>Brunelle </em>v. <em>Lynn Pub. Schs., </em>428 Mass. 512, 513 n.3 (1998), citing <em>Pustell </em>v. <em>Lynn Pub. Schs., </em>18 F.3d 50, 53-55 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\">General Laws c. 76, \u00a7 1, mandates compulsory attendance in a public day school or some other approved day school by children within certain specified age groups, but states that \u201csuch attendance shall not be required ... of a child who is being otherwise instructed in a manner approved in advance by the superintendent or the school committee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b193-10\">The defendant\u2019s alternative argument that the plaintiffs did not prevail on constitutional grounds is without merit. The fact that we found that the defendant deprived the plaintiffs of their rights under G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1, and not under the Massachusetts Constitution, <em>Brunelle I, supra </em>at 519 (\u201c[b]ecause our decision rests on G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1, . . . there is no need to consider the several arguments made by the plaintiffs under the Massachusetts Constitution\u201d), does not hinder the plaintiffs\u2019 ability to recover attorney\u2019s fees. See G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H, 111 (provides remedy for interference with \u201crights secured by the constitution <em>or laws </em>of the Commonwealth\u201d [emphasis added]). <em>Redgrave </em>v. <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc., </em>399 Mass. 93, 98 (1987) (Act \u201cprovides a State remedy for interference or attempts to interfere with the exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the . . . Constitution <em>or laws </em>of the Commonwealth\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">The defendant also asserts that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for attorney\u2019s fees fails because the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint did not raise a claim under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111. Although the plaintiffs arguably alleged a \u00a7 111 claim under the standard set forth in <em>Guardianship of Hurley, </em>394 Mass. 554, 559 (1985) (with respect to Federal attorney\u2019s fee provision in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, \u201c[a] complaint need not mention explicitly the underlying statute as long as the elements of a cause of action are pleaded\u201d), their claim nonetheless fails for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Given that the school committee did not initiate a similar action against the Pustells, it is unclear how the plaintiffs can plausibly argue that the Pustells\u2019 rights were also interfered with by \u201ccoercion or intimidation.\u201d In light of our conclusion in this case, we need not resolve the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Under G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 2, the maximum penalty is a fine of twenty dollars. Under G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 4, the maximum penalty is a fine of two hundred dollars. Neither provision includes incarceration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b196-9\">We also note that G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1, charges school committees with ensuring that all children residing within their jurisdiction attend school. Thus, despite its criminal nature, the initiation of the charges under G. L. c. 76, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 4, could arguably be characterized as an administrative action taken by the school committee in order to comply with its statutory obligation. \u201cAn administrative action, unrelated to a scheme of harassment, \u2018does not rise to the level of threats, intimidation or coercion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reproductive Rights Network </em>v. <em>President of the Univ. of Mass., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 509 (1998), quoting <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Duxbury, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 513, 518 (1996). Since the plaintiffs offer no evidence of \u201canimus\u201d against them by the defendant, a \u201cscheme of harassment\u201d has not been established in this case. <em>Id. </em>However, given the dearth of evidence of threats, intimidation, or coercion in this case, we need not resolve the issue whether the charges were administrative or not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
