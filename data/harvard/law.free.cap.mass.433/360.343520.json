After reviewing affidavits from the plaintiff, his therapist, and a psychiatrist, a Superior Court judge ruled that the statute of limitations barred the plaintiff\u2019s suit. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. On appeal, we consider whether G. L. c. 260, .\u00a7 4C, delays the accrual of a cause of action of a victim of sexual abuse where the plaintiff knew the activity occurred, but failed to make the \u201ccausal connection\u201d between the defendant\u2019s misconduct and the resulting harm. Because triable issues of fact exist regarding when the plaintiff was aware of the \u201ccausal connection\u201d between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the resulting harm to the plaintiff, we vacate the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>1. <em>Background. </em>From approximately 1968, the plaintiff, then thirteen years old, engaged in a sexual relationship with the defendant, then twenty-seven years old, that continued until approximately 1971. The sexual contact produced feelings of guilt and shame in the plaintiff. These emotions stemmed from his sense that sexual activity of this sort was \u201cwrong\u201d in the eyes of \u201csociety and the Catholic Church.\u201d When he was approximately fifteen years old, the plaintiff ended the relationship. During the next thirty years, plaintiff experienced numerous failed relationships and suffered from psychological and emotional difficulties. In 1978, he sought counselling for problems he was having with his then girl friend.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In March, 1996, the plaintiff entered into psychotherapy with a different therapist, Christopher Gruener. From the beginning of their therapist-patient relationship, the plaintiff \u201cconsciously conceived of his sexual involvement with [the defendant] as wrong and shameful, primarily because of the homosexual nature of the exchange.\u201d According to Gruener, however, the plaintiff had only \u201cbegun to be aware of the possibility of some connection between his experience with [the defendant] and some of his presenting symptoms,\u201d by the spring of 1997. The plaintiff\u2019s inability to \u201clink\u201d psychological harm to the defendant\u2019s conduct stemmed from \u201cunconscious coping or blocking mechanisms\u201d commonly found in victims of sexual abuse. In November, 1998, at the behest of his attorney, the plaintiff underwent' an evaluation by psychiatrist Dr. Larry Strasburger. During the evaluation, the plaintiff admitted that he was \u201cscared\u201d during the sexual encounters with the defendant, \u201cget[s] ill thinking about [the conduct]\u201d and realizes he \u201cshould never have been there.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Strasburger concluded that \u201c[o]nly now, some thirty years later has he begun to make the connection between his childhood experiences and his adult behavior.\u201d The experts\u2019 reports conclude that the plaintiff was suffering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>from a posttraumatic stress disorder as a result of the defendant\u2019s \u2018 sexual conduct toward him when he was a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">At some point during the first six months of his treatment with Gruener, the plaintiff contemplated litigation against the defendant. A complaint was not filed, however, until January, 1999, at which time the plaintiff alleged that he suffered psychological harm as a result of a consensual sexual relationship with the defendant in 1967.* <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After admitting that there had been such a relationship, the defendant moved for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds. For the reasons set forth by the defendant and on the authority of <em>Phinney </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 202, 205 (1995), the Superior Court judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion. On appeal, the plaintiff argues that, because he lacked any awareness that he had been harmed by the defendant until entering psychotherapy in March, 1996, the statute of limitations had been tolled. He asserts that the suit is timely given its commencement within three years of the discovery of the causal connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the resulting psychological and emotional damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 4C,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> automatically tolls the limitations period on child sexual abuse cases until the victim reaches the age of eighteen years and, at that point, fixes a three-year bar on such claims. By using the phrase, \u201cor within three years of the time the victim discovered or reasonably should have discovered that an emotional or psychological injury or condition was caused by said act,\u201d in the statute, the Legislature extended the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d to sexual abuse cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>such as the one before us.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4C. See <em>Phinney </em>v. <em>Morgan, supra </em>at 205 (Legislature determined discovery rule should extend to claims against perpetrator of abuse). Pursuant to this rule, causes of action do not accrue for limitations purposes until the plaintiff knew or should have known that he has been harmed by the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, </em>409 Mass. 239, 243 (1991) (extending discovery rule to psycho-therapeutic malpractice). <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>381 Mass. 611, 617 (1980) (extending discovery rule to medical malpractice).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Where a defendant raises the statute of limitations, we must determine if a material question of fact exists as to whether the plaintiff \u201chad \u2018(1) knowledge or sufficient notice that [he] was harmed and (2) knowledge or sufficient notice of what the cause of harm was.\u2019 \u201d <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, supra </em>at 244, quoting <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>408 Mass. 204, 208 (1990). On the record before us, we hold that such material questions of fact exist. See <em>Phinney </em>v. <em>Morgan, supra </em>at 209, citing <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, supra </em>at 240 (\u201cwe recognize that ordinarily when a plaintiff knew or should have known of [his] cause of action is a factual issue to be decided by a trier of fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Regarding the first element, it is undisputed that the plaintiff was, at all times, aware that he engaged in an improper relationship that produced feelings of shame. Regarding the second element, a survey of factually similar trial court rulings indicates a reluctance to grant summary judgment where it is unclear whether, and to what extent, a plaintiff perceived a \u201ccausal connection\u201d between a defendant\u2019s misconduct and the plaintiff\u2019s alleged psychological harm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consistent with that trend, we believe issues of fact exist regarding when the plaintiff had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>knowledge or sufficient notice, or reasonably should have known, that the cause of his harm was the earlier misconduct of the defendant. The record unequivocally indicates that the \u201ccausal connection\u201d between the defendant\u2019s abuse and the plaintiff\u2019s alleged harm was not discovered until the defendant entered therapy in 1996. See <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, supra </em>at 246 (statute of limitations tolled, in part, because plaintiff \u201ccould not make the necessary causal link\u201d between defendant\u2019s improper sexual behavior and resulting psychological injuries; response deemed \u201cnormal among the \u2018general patient population\u2019 who \u2018had been exposed to this type of exploitation\u2019 \u201d). These issues, moreover, are clearly \u201cmaterial\u201d given the Legislature\u2019s direction that \u201cthe time the victim . . . discovered that an emotional or psychological injury or condition was <em>caused </em>by [the alleged] act,\u201d is a legally relevant consideration in cases such as these. G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4C. Because the record indicates that the case commenced within three years of the realization of that \u201ccausal connection,\u201d summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In granting summary judgment, the judge adopted the defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Phinney </em>v. <em>Morgan, supra </em>at 205, is dispositive. The defendant contends that \u201cwhether a plaintiff should have known that he had been injured by long ago abusive conduct in order to toll the applicable statute of limitations\u201d is determined solely by applying the <em>Phinney </em>factors, namely: (1) an unawareness that the defendant committed a wrongful act at the time of its commission; (2) the plaintiff\u2019s trust in the defendant; (3) the defendant\u2019s control over the facts giving rise to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action; and (4) the necessity of a triggering event that makes the plaintiff aware of the defendant\u2019s potential liability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(finding claims untimely). Although judges attempting to pinpoint the moment at which a particular cause of action accrues may find these factors helpful, we do not consider the <em>Phinney </em>list exhaustive. See <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>79 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1996) (per curiam) <em>(Phinney </em>\u201clends support\u201d to decision, but <em>Phinney </em>factors not applied). First, the <em>Phinney </em>case did not turn on G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4C, and is thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>distinguishable from this case. <em>Id. </em>at 202 (suit brought against mother for failure to protect plaintiffs from sexual abuse). Second, judges have demonstrated a willingness to resolve summary judgment motions involving the statute of limitations without limiting their inquiry to the <em>Phinney </em>factors. See, e.g., <em>Armstrong </em>v. Lamy, 938 F. Supp. 1018, 1038-1041 (D. Mass. 1996) (disposing of motion without relying on <em>Phinney </em>factors); Szymczuk vs. Szymczuk, Middlesex Superior Court, No. Civ. A. 923581 (March 5, 1996), affd, <em>Avola </em>v. <em>Szymczuk, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 1114 (1998) (same). Thus, while <em>Phinney </em>v. <em>Morgan, supra </em>at 205, properly recognized \u201cthat because of the nature of the injury and the relationship of the parties, a child may . . . be unaware of any harm or its <em>cause </em>until years after the abuse\u201d (emphasis added), we do not believe the inquiry into such cause should be limited to those articulated factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">We also reject the argument that the plaintiff\u2019s contemporaneous knowledge that the contested behavior was \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cshameful\u201d constituted sufficient \u201charm\u201d to trigger the statute of limitations. For the statute of limitations to be triggered, the plaintiff must suffer some \u201cappreciable harm,\u201d <em>Swasey </em>v. <em>Barron, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 127, 129 (1999) (legal malpractice), but need not know the full extent of his alleged injuries. <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>408 Mass. 204, 207 (1990). For example, in <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Lamy, supra </em>at 1040, the defendant argued that, where the plaintiff felt \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d \u201cscared,\u201d and \u201cnervous\u201d at the time of the sexual contact, had insomnia during the time period of the sexual contact, and felt pain from his arm\u2019s being gripped, such \u201cconstitute[d] enough injury, as a matter of law, to put [the plaintiff] on notice, at the time of the sexual contact, that he had been injured and by whom.\u201d In denying the individual defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the judge stated \u201cany evidence that [the plaintiff] was \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 or refused to participate in some aspect of the sexual contact, is not enough to support a decision, as a matter of law, that he suffered an \u2018injury,\u2019 or to determine that beyond genuine dispute [the plaintiff] knew or should have known he had been harmed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, in the context of the parties\u2019 relationship (i.e., teacher-student), \u201ca finder of fact could reasonably find that the[] fleeting moments of physical pain were not perceived by [the plaintiff] at the time as \u2018injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, in cases where summary judgment has been granted, the alleged injuries were more extensive and tangible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>than the shame and sense of wrong that are involved here. See, e.g., <em>Phinhey </em>v. <em>Morgan, supra </em>at 208 (plaintiffs discussed bringing suit against parents; one ran away from home three times because of abuse); <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Grant, supra </em>at 2 (plaintiff filed criminal charges against father and manifested strong desire to escape repeated abuse).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Here, that the plaintiff knew his conduct was shameful and wrong does not \u201cprovide [him] with the modicum of knowledge required to trigger the statute of limitation[s].\u201d <em>Phinney </em>v. <em>Morgan, supra </em>at 209. A rational finder of fact could find that the plaintiff, a teenager at the time, felt shame or a sense of wrong because his conduct was contrary to accepted church or family morals, but he was not aware that he had suffered any appreciable or legally recognizable \u201charm.\u201d See <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Lamy, supra </em>at 1040; Gagne <em>vs. </em>O\u2019Donoghue, Worcester Superior Court, No. Civ. A. 941158 (June 26, 1996) (although alleged acts caused plaintiff to feel sick and embarrassed, whether plaintiff recognized that harm and conduct were \u201ccausally related\u201d constitutes genuine issue of material fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Next, it is not sufficient to claim that the plaintiff should have linked the emotional difficulties in his life with the defendant\u2019s misconduct decades ago. The record suggests that there are other incidents from the plaintiff\u2019s childhood (e.g., \u201cexplosions\u201d and \u201craging\u201d between the plaintiff\u2019s parents due to his father\u2019s alcoholism; drug and alcohol use during his early adolescence) that he might reasonably have identified as the source of his problems. These reasons, together with the plaintiff\u2019s psychological coping mechanisms prevent us from concluding that, as a matter of law, the plaintiff knew or should have known that he suffered harm caused by the defendant to trigger the statute of limitations. <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, supra </em>at 245, quoting <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., supra </em>at 208 (court considers \u201creasonable person in the position of the plaintiff\u201d (emphasis omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>We make one final observation. The plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony indicates that he participated in \u201cthree or four\u201d sessions with a therapist recommended by a \u201cfriend of the family.\u201d Although the plaintiff does not recall that therapist\u2019s name, the address of the individual who recommended that therapist is in the record and, thus, should be readily available to either party. If, based on further discovery, the judge determines that, at the time of the 1978 therapy sessions, the plaintiff was aware that the problems in his relationship were \u201ccausally connected\u201d to the defendant\u2019s conduct, a subsequent summary judgment motion would be appropriate. Absent such findings, the plaintiff has proved the existence of a triable issue of fact, thereby rendering summary judgment inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">For the reasons stated above, we vacate the entry of summary judgment. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further findings regarding the content of the plaintiff\u2019s 1978 therapy sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Given the plaintiff\u2019s inability to recall the name of the therapist who treated him, discovery regarding the content of these sessions has not yet been undertaken. In his affidavit, the plaintiff states that, during these sessions, \u201c[t]he subject of my sexual experiences with [the defendant] never came up at all. I never brought it up and I was never asked about it.\u201d For the reasons discussed below, further discovery into this matter is warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The record suggests that the plaintiff\u2019s memory of the events at issue has remained constant and unimpaired for over three decades and, thus, this case does not involve any issue concerning repressed memory. Contrast <em>Shahzade </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>930 F. Supp. 673 (D. Mass. 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint contains the following causes of action: sexual assault and battery, intentional and reckless infliction of severe emotional distress, aiding and abetting others to abuse the plaintiff sexually, aiding and abetting others to inflict serious emotional distress on the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\">General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 4, inserted by St. 1993, c. 307, provides in relevant part: \u201cActions for assault and battery alleging the defendant sexually abused a minor shall be commenced within three years of the acts alleged to have caused an injury or condition or within three years of the time the victim discovered or reasonably should have discovered that an emotional or psychological injury or condition was caused by said act, whichever period expires later; provided, however, that the time limit for commencement of an action under this section is tolled for a child until the child reaches eighteen years of age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">While the statute was not in effect at the time of the harmful conduct, the parties do not contest its application to the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\">No legislative history exists to facilitate our understanding of the statutory language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Compare Gagne <em>vs. </em>O\u2019Donoghue, Worcester Superior Court, Civ.

L. c. 260, \u00a7 4C. See Eilert <em>vs. </em>Carey, Worcester Superior Court, No. Civ. A. 951227A (June 2, 1998), citing <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, </em>409 Mass. 239, 243 (1991). Where, as here, (1) the causes of action arise from the same alleged sexual abuse and (2) similar issues of material fact exist regarding when the plaintiff made the \u201ccausal connection\u201d necessary to trigger the emotional distress statute of limitations, the remaining counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>survive summary judgment. <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, supra, </em>quoting <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>381 Mass. 611, 617 (1980) (absent statutory definition regarding when cause of action accrues, determination is \u201cthe product of judicial interpretation in this Commonwealth\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b379-7\">Sosman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aea\">(dissenting). Pursuant to G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4C, the plaintiff\u2019s action to recover for damages resulting from sexual abuse had to be brought within three years of the time he discovered \u201cor reasonably should have discovered that an emotional or psychological injury or condition was caused by\u201d the sexual abuse. Thus, where the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was not filed until January, 1999, the relevant inquiry is whether he knew or should have discovered, at any time prior to January, 1996, that any of his emotional and psychological problems were causally related to the sexual abuse perpetrated by the defendant. I agree with the majority that the plaintiff has raised a triable issue as to his lack of actual knowledge that such a causal connection existed until he learned of that causal connection in the course of recent psychotherapy. However, as to whether the plaintiff \u201creasonably should have discovered\u201d such a causal connection at some earlier date, there is no triable issue and the defendant was therefore entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of the plaintiff began in 1968, when the plaintiff was thirteen years old, and continued until sometime in 1971. During that time period, the plaintiff went to the defendant\u2019s house once or twice a week, with sexual activity occurring on most of those visits. At no time has the plaintiff repressed his memories of these repeated sexual contacts with the defendant. Throughout the many years that have elapsed since the abuse took place, the plaintiff has remained aware that the defendant instigated sexual activity with him on numerous occasions during his early adolescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">By 1978, when the plaintiff was twenty-three years old, he also knew that he had emotional and psychological problems. At the insistence of his then girl friend (who threatened to terminate the relationship unless he sought help), the plaintiff had three or four sessions with a therapist. The plaintiff recalls having difficulties with relationships, describing himself as jealous, controlling, and insecure. Since his marriage in 1981, the plaintiff has engaged in numerous extramarital affairs, including several such affairs in the early 1990\u2019s. His promiscuity notwithstanding, he also experienced sexual problems, including difficulty achieving orgasm. Starting in 1993 and continuing for the next five years, he experienced significant sleep disturbance (consisting of an inability to sleep for longer than one-half hour without waking up). Thus, for many years prior to the filing of this lawsuit, the plaintiff knew that he suffered an assortment of troubling psychological symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The only issue remaining is whether the plaintiff should have realized that there was a causal connection between the two to three years of weekly sexual abuse he suffered as a young teenager and the psychological (including sexual) problems that have plagued his adult life. While appreciating that a history of sexual abuse and its attendant consequences are painful for a victim to realize, and thus that it would be very difficult for a victim to figure out on his own that the abuse had caused subsequent psychological problems, this court can take judicial notice of the widespread publicity on these very issues, publicity that has been prevalent to the point of overwhelming for at least the last fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">By the mid-1980\u2019s, the subject of child sexual abuse and its devastating consequences was covered extensively (by both cover stories and in-depth special reports) in national magazines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>(Leo, \u201cSome Day, I\u2019ll Cry My Eyes Out\u201d: A California Case Prompts a New Awareness of Child Molestation, Time 72 [April 23, 1984]; McCall, The Cruelest Crime, Sexual Abuse of Children: The Victims, the Offenders, How to Protect Your Family, Life 35 [Dec. 1984]; Watson, Sexual Abuse: A Hidden Epidemic, Newsweek 30 [May 14, 1984]), on national television news (Note, The Unreliability of Expert Testimony on the Typical Characteristics of Sexual Abuse Victims, 74 Geo.

In 1992, allegations concerning a local priest, Father James Porter, generated enormous publicity concerning child sexual abuse, including detailed discussion of the drastic emotional and psychological damage suffered by Father Porter\u2019s many victims (\u201cPrime Time\u201d Tackles Sex-Abuse Case, Boston Globe, July 2, 1992, at 72; Porter Pleads Guilty to Sex-Abuse Charges, Boston Herald, Oct. 5, 1993, at 12; Million $ Awarded Sex Abuse Victims, Boston Herald, Dec. 4, 1992, at 1; Town Secret: The Case of James Porter, Boston Sunday Globe Magazine, Aug. 29, 1993, at 10; Sex Abuse Trials Under Fire: Prosecutors, Doctors Criticize Time Limits on Prosecutions, Telegram &amp; Gazette [Worcester, Mass.], Dec. 12, 1993, at A3). The Father Porter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>case, and others like it around the country, gave rise to another Newsweek cover story in 1993. (Press, Sex and the Church: Priests and Abuse, Newsweek 42 [Aug. 16, 1993]). Other cases involving authority figures as accused child molesters also received widespread publicity (Emotions Spill After Tragedy of Sexual Abuse, Telegram &amp; Gazette [Worcester, Mass.], Jan. 20, 1992, at A2; Quincy Man Charges Years of Sex Abuse by Uncle, a Priest, Boston Globe, July 29, 1993, at 1; Ex-altar Boy Claims Sex Abuse, Boston Herald, Aug. 4, 1993, at 25; 2 Victims File Suit vs. Priest in Sex-Abuse Case, Boston Herald, Oct. 21, 1994, at 16). National networks broadcast made-for-television movies and documentaries on the subject of child sexual abuse in 1993 and 1994 (Note, \u201cThe Best of All Possible Worlds\u201d: Balancing Victims\u2019 and Defendants\u2019 Rights in the Child Sexual Abuse Case, 63 Fordham L. Rev. 633, 664 n.10 [1994] [noting all major television networks aired documentaries and television movies on the subject of child abuse, including Not in My Family (ABC television broadcast, Feb. 28, 1993); Shattered Trust (NBC television broadcast, Sept. 27, 1993); Ultimate Betrayal (CBS television broadcast, Mar. 20, 1994)]). Newspaper advice columns published letters from readers detailing incidents of child sex abuse and the damages they were suffering as a result of the abuse. See, e.g., Dealing with Sexual Abuse, Boston Globe (May 17, 1987, at 64); Counseling Can Help Heal Scars of Abuse, Boston Sunday Globe Magazine, Oct. 24, 1991, at 78; Her Sister Won\u2019t Talk About Sexual Abuse, Boston Globe, May 26, 1994, at 71. Thus, long before the January, 1996, date at issue in this case, the print and broadcast media were saturated with reports of child sexual abuse, including extensive discussion of the victim\u2019s difficulties in reporting the abuse and detailed description of its long-lasting psychological ill effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">In applying the \u201creasonably should have known\u201d standard at issue in the discovery rule, \u201c[reasonable notice that ... a particular act of another person may have been a cause of harm to a plaintiff creates a duty of inquiry and starts the running of the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>408 Mass. 204, 210 (1990). Where, as in the <em>Bowen </em>case, newspaper and magazine articles should have alerted the plaintiff to a causal connection between the earlier conduct and the later harm, the fact that the plaintiff did not yet believe there was such a causal connection is not controlling \u201cbecause we test the accrual of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>[his] cause of action by what a reasonable person in [his] position would have known or on inquiry would have discovered at the various relevant times.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This \u201creasonable person\u201d standard takes into account any altered or impaired judgment that a reasonable person would have suffered as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct, <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, </em>409 Mass. 239, 245 (1991), thus allowing for whatever coping mechanisms or other survival strategies sexual abuse victims may adopt that might impair their ability to recognize the causal relationship between past abuse and present psychological problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">However, the standard does not allow a plaintiff to ignore more than a decade\u2019s barrage of publicity from all branches of the media that repeatedly announced, in exhaustive and compelling detail, the fact that children who have been subjected to sexual acts at the hands of adults usually suffer adverse psychological consequences later in life. Throughout all this publicity, the plaintiff was aware that his childhood and adolescent experience, like that of the many victims described in the print and broadcast media, had included extensive and repeated sexual contact with a much older man and that he was, as an adult, then suffering a variety of psychological, emotional, and sexual problems. Whatever in the plaintiff\u2019s constellation of psychological ailments prevented him from recognizing the causal connection between these two parts of his personal history on his own, the fact of such a causal connection was provided to him by way of print and broadcast media that had, since the early 1980\u2019s, widely publicized the tragic emotional injuries that resulted from adults engaging children in sexual activity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The question on this summary judgment motion is merely whether the plaintiff, or a reasonable person in his position, should have realized that the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cmay\u201d have been a cause of his harm. <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., supra. </em>In the face of overwhelming publicity over a period of many years telling everyone that sexual contact with children almost invariably causes significant long-term psychological harm to those children, the plaintiff should have been aware of at least the potential causal connection between his own lengthy history of repeated sexual encounters with the defendant and his later psychological problems, and this record demonstrates that the plaintiff was actually aware of at least a possible causal connection within two months of the relevant statute of limitations deadline (see note 1, <em>supra). </em>The majority opinion focuses almost exclusively on the question whether the plaintiff in fact understood the causal connection and virtually ignores the \u201creasonably should have discovered\u201d prong of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4C. Applying that prong, and taking judicial notice of the last two decades of extensive publicity on the issues surrounding child sexual abuse, I believe that the plaintiff\u2019s claims are time barred as a matter of law. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Indeed, the record is clear that the plaintiff himself, without benefit of any therapy addressing the subject of his prior abuse, had absorbed this common knowledge. During his very first visit to a therapist on March 25, 1996, he volunteered the information that he had had sexual encounters as a young teenager, apparently already recognizing on his own that that aspect of his personal history would likely be of significance to his therapist. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint was filed on January 21, 1999, making January 21, 1996, the relevant date for statute of limitations analysis. This initial therapy session occurred just two months after that critical date. This record contains no evidence to support the conclusion that anything occurred during the two months following January 21, 1996, that would have added to the plaintiff\u2019s understanding of the possible causal relationship between his history of abuse and his ongoing psychological problems. The plaintiff\u2019s evident awareness of that possible connection as of March 25, 1996, means that, his coping mechanisms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>notwithstanding, the plaintiff had indeed grasped at least the gist of the prior decade\u2019s worth of publicity on the subject of child sexual abuse and its potential relation to psychological problems, and there is no reason on this record to conclude that that degree of realization somehow did not occur until after January 21, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
