Riley, was convicted of murder in the second degree. On appeal, he claims that the trial judge erred in (1) denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty as to the charge of murder in the second degree on the ground that there was insufficient evidence of malice; and (2) instructing the jury on reasonable doubt. The defendant also argues that third prong malice should be abolished as a basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>murder in the second degree. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. Because the verdict rested on sufficient evidence and the jury instructions were adequate, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The defendant lawfully owned a nine millimeter semiautomatic pistol that he kept in his Brockton apartment. In general, he knew how to handle the firearm and was familiar with its operation. Having completed a National Rifle Association safety course, the defendant was schooled in the proper way to load and unload semiautomatic weapons. The defendant generally carried his weapon, loaded, \u201cmost of the time when he went out,\u201d and he regularly attended a local gun club. In addition, the defendant disassembled and reassembled the gun \u201cabout every other day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">On June 10, 1992, he invited the victim, John E. Nelson, to his apartment. Two boys, Douglas Bonebrake (then sixteen years old) and his half-brother Daniel Craig (then fourteen years old), lived with the defendant and witnessed the events leading up to the victim\u2019s death. At some point, the victim asked to see the defendant\u2019s gun. After unloading the gun, the defendant handed it to the victim. The victim looked at the gun for a few minutes and handed it back to the defendant. At this time, the defendant reloaded the gun, in such a way that he allowed a \u201cfive round into the chamber.\u201d Both witnesses testified that, on previous occasions, they had often watched the defendant load and unload his weapon, but never in the manner he used immediately before the victim was shot. When the victim again asked to see the gun, the defendant showed it to him and, according to Bonebrake, asked the victim, \u201cAre you ready?\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the victim replied \u201cYeah,\u201d the defendant pointed the gun at the victim\u2019s forehead, holding the barrel at a distance of about two to three inches.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bonebrake repeatedly warned the defendant, yelling \u201cloud enough that [the defendant] could hear,\u201d that there was still one round \u201cin there, in the chamber.\u201d The defendant ignored the warning and told Bonebrake to \u201cshut up.\u201d Craig, the other eyewitness, also knew the gun contained a five round and repeatedly told the defendant so in a \u201cconcerned voice.\u201d Again, the defendant refused to listen, telling the boys that he knew his gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The defendant pulled the trigger, the boys heard a \u201cloud bang,\u201d and the victim dropped to the floor. After the shot, the defendant washed off the gun and ordered Bonebrake, \u201cin an angry tone,\u201d to \u201ctell the police department that it was an accident, [that the victim] shot himself.\u201d If Bonebrake did not corroborate the accident story, the defendant warned Bonebrake that he would be next. Similarly, the defendant threatened Craig that, unless he told the police the accident story, he and his family would be killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">When the police arrived at the scene, they found the gun on the kitchen stove. In his statement to the police, the defendant related that, after leaving his bedroom, he heard a shot and returned to find the victim lying against the bureau with a head wound. At the station, the boys, mindful of the defendant\u2019s threats, gave separate statements explaining that the victim had shot himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In the summer of 1996, the defendant related a new version of an old story to a friend. In the course of their discussion, the defendant described the incident as follows: \u201c[The victim] had been playing around with his gun and [the defendant] didn\u2019t like it. And [the defendant] went up to [the victim]. . . . [The defendant] said that he didn\u2019t realize that he had chambered a round. And when [the defendant] pulled the trigger a bullet was expelled [into the victim\u2019s forehead].\u201d A few months later, a State police sergeant reinterviewed the boys (September 14, 1996) and the defendant (September 27, 1996). After receiving his Miranda rights, the defendant initially recalled that the victim was \u201cfooling around\u201d with the weapon and that his attempt to grab the gun caused the firing of the fatal shot. After further discussion, the defendant modified his version of events, stating the victim was \u201cfooling around with the gun\u201d and said, \u201cI want to die anyway.\u201d The defendant picked up the handgun; the victim \u201cbrought the barrel of the gun up to his forehead\u201d; and then, \u201cwithout [his] realizing it, the gun went off.\u201d The defendant gave a recorded statement to this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">On November 4, 1996, a grand jury returned an indictment charging the defendant with murder in the second degree. At trial, the jury rejected the defendant\u2019s \u201caccident\u201d defense, i.e., that in his mind he had unloaded the gun and it was safe. A guilty verdict was returned on the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">2. <em>Motion for a required finding. </em>At the close of the evidence, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty, claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ing that the evidence supported a verdict of involuntary manslaughter, but not murder in the second degree. In denying the motion, the judge stated, \u201cIn my judgment . . . there\u2019s ample evidence to support a verdict for second degree murder . . . .\u201d On appeal the defendant contends that the requisite elements of third prong malice,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> i.e., \u201cthat \u2018in the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonably prudent person would have known that according to common experience there was a plain and strong likelihood that death would follow [from his] act,\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>432 Mass. 214, 222 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Semedo, </em>422 Mass. 716, 720 (1996), could not be found where the evidence suggests that the defendant believed that the gun was not loaded. As a result of the defendant\u2019s subjective belief, he argues, the shooting amounted to manslaughter, but not murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">We view the evidence at trial in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, and \u201cdetermine whether . . . <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979). Given the extensive evidence of the defendant\u2019s familiarity with the weapon, a jury could reasonably conclude that the defendant knew when, how, and whether his weapon was loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">As to the defendant\u2019s knowledge at the time of the shooting, the jury heard even more damaging evidence. Of crucial importance is the fact that, immediately before the shooting, both boys warned the defendant that there was still one live round \u201cin there, in the chamber.\u201d \u201cYelling,\u201d and \u201cin a voice so [the defendant] could hear,\u201d the boys repeated the warning between three and five times. The defendant callously ignored their pleas, telling them to \u201cshut up\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because he \u201ckn[ew] his gun.\u201d Rather, he proceeded to hold the firearm to the victim\u2019s head and to pull the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Where two witnesses warn a defendant immediately prior to a shooting, we conclude that a rational jury could, beyond a reasonable doubt, find that the defendant knew the gun was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>loaded.* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bouvier, </em>316 Mass. 489, 496 (1944) (no evidence that defendant knew gun was loaded).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Furthermore, the experiences of this particular defendant, including his familiarity with weapons, are evidence that he should have known that a \u201cplain and strong likelihood of death\u201d would follow from his act. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>423 Mass. 288, 290 (1996) (\u201cintentionally discharging a firearm in the direction of another person creates a plain and strong likelihood of death\u201d). For these reasons, the Commonwealth produced sufficient evidence to support its theory of third prong malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">3. <em>Jury instructions on reasonable doubt. </em>The defendant claims three errors tainted the judge\u2019s reasonable doubt charge. These errors, the defendant argues, unconstitutionally lowered the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof and thereby implicated his due process rights. Where, as here, the defendant contests the adequacy of a jury instruction on reasonable doubt,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cwe examine the challenged language, in the context of the charge as a whole, in order to determine whether \u2018a reasonable juror could have used the instruction incorrectly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaBriola, </em>430 Mass. 569, 570-571 n.3 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>427 Mass. 245, 249-250 &amp; n.6 (1998). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keniston, </em>423 Mass. 304, 316 (1996), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koonce, </em>418 Mass. 367, 371 (1994). Viewing the charge as a whole, we conclude that the instruction adequately conveyed to the jury the requisite degree of certainty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>required for conviction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>425 Mass. 830, 837-839 (1997). We address each of the defendant\u2019s allegations in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">(a) The defendant challenges the omission of the \u201cstrong probability\u201d language of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bumpus, </em>362 Mass. 672, 682 (1972), vacated on other grounds, 411 U.S. 945 (1973), affd on rehearing, 365 Mass. 66 (1974), we considered whether \u201cfail[ure] to charge the jury that a strong probability of guilt is insufficient to convict and that the standard is not one of the preponderance of the evidence\u201d constitutes grounds for reversal. In upholding the convictions, this court stated: \u201cThe defendant was not entitled to have the charge phrased in the exact language requested by him since the instructions, taken as a whole, conveyed the meaning established by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keniston, supra </em>at 316-317, with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slonka, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 760, 765-766 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Here, while the judge strayed from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> supra, </em>we conclude that the instructions as a whole \u201ccorrectly conveyed to the jury the level of proof required to convict the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 254, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagliardi, </em>418 Mass. 562, 572 (1994), cert, denied, 513 U.S. 1091 (1995). At the charge conference, the judge stated his intention to \u201cgo right down the middle with <em>Commonwealth </em>and Webster\u201d and offer \u201cthe standard instruction\u201d set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>415 Mass. 161, 166-167 n.3 (1993). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>417 Mass. 358, 368 (1994), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra </em>at 166-168. The judge also acknowledged that he would not \u201cgive every word of <em>[Webster, </em>but] will give the substance of it.\u201d He instructed the jury that \u201c[a] verdict of guilty cannot be based on probability, suspicion, or speculation,\u201d and defined reasonable doubt as \u201cthat state of the case when ... the minds of the jurors are left in that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of the charge.\u201d He further explained that, \u201cif the Commonwealth has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>established only that it is more probable than not that the defendant has committed the offense, then that is not sufficient . . . [and] if your minds are left wavering, unsettled and unsatisfied because of a conscious uncertainty as to the guilt of the defendant, you must also return a verdict of not guilty.\u201d Given that the judge included <em>Webster\u2019s </em>\u201cabiding conviction\u201d language; said in essence that a strong probability of guilt is insufficient to convict; and issued a charge virtually identical to one previously upheld, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra </em>at 166-167 n.3, we believe the instruction, even absent <em>Webster\u2019s </em>\u201cstrong probability\u201d language, was constitutionally sufficient. (b) The defendant claims the jury should have been instructed that \u201c[t]he degree of certainty required to convict is unique to the criminal law.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonds, </em>424 Mass. 698, 701 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>373 Mass. 116, 130 (1977). We have never required such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">(c) The defendant argues that the judge should have made clear that reasonable doubt is equivalent to \u201cnear certitude.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, </em>419 Mass. 341, 344 (1995). The Supreme Court crafted this term in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 315 (1979), and quoted in <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 15 (1994). Subsequently, we have referred to this language, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>423 Mass. 288, 291 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 28 (1996), but have never <em>required </em>such language. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>424 Mass. 770, 788 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mack, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>425 Mass. 685, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>689-690 (1997). Furthermore, we have noted that <em>Webster\u2019s </em>\u201cabiding conviction\u201d language impresses on the factfinder \u201cthe need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>425 Mass. 830, 838 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, supra </em>at 344. For these reasons, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the instruction was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">4. <em>Third prong malice. </em>In his final argument, the defendant argues for tire abolition of third prong malice<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> because \u201cas it currently exists [it] does not require that a defendant possess a morally culpable state of mind when committing the act which results in a death.\u201d When raised at trial, the judge \u201cwas frankly stunned ... to [hear] an objection to third prong malice,\u201d stating, \u201cAs far as I know it\u2019s still good law in Massachusetts.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The judge was correct. We decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to abolish third prong malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The facts of this case illustrate the usefulness of third prong malice. The evidence of \u201cthe circumstances known to the defendant\u201d was compelling. The defendant, experienced in the use of firearms, held his pistol to the victim\u2019s head and fired it, after being warned several times, by two different people, that the weapon was loaded. On the basis of his experience and this information, the defendant should have, at the very least, reexamined the weapon or taken other precautionary measures before pulling the trigger. Ignoring that course of action was particularly grievous where his conduct, firing point blank at another\u2019s head, left no room for error. Where a defendant behaves in such a manner, we are satisfied that the degree of moral culpability necessary to support a conviction of second degree murder has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\">On cross-examination Bonebrake testified that the defendant asked, \u201cDo you dare me?,\u201d and the victim responded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b279-8\">There was evidence that on prior occasions the defendant had similarly placed his firearm to someone else\u2019s head.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The judge did not instruct the jury on the other prongs of malice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\">While it would be the height of irresponsibility to ignore such warnings from anyone, irrespective of their familiarity with firearms, we note that both boys knew about guns and occasionally shot hand rifles at a firing range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The consciousness of guilt evidence (e.g., washing off firearm, relaying false story to police) does not constitute \u201cevidence of malice aforethought,\u201d and thus does not factor into our assessment of the defendant\u2019s sufficiency claim. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Epsom, </em>399 Mass. 254, 259 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Where, prior to shooting, the defendant is warned that the firearm is loaded, he cannot avail himself of the \u201cvarious cases\u201d involving \u201cgun play\u201d or a \u201cdefendant [who] did not know that the gun contained live bullets.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>426 Mass. 290, 298, 299 (1997) (declining to sit as \u201csecond jury\u201d in Russian roulette case).

It is not a degree of certainty used in your private lives.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonds, </em>424 Mass. 698, 701 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>373 Mass. 116, 130 (1977).
