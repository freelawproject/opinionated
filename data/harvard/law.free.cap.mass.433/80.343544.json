The petition alleged that the respondent violated several provisions of the disciplinary rules arising out of a fee dispute with a Texas nonprofit corporate client.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The board referred the petition to a hearing committee. S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 5 (3) (d), 365 Mass. 696 (1974). The committee concluded that the respondent had pursued a course of conduct that was marked by a conflict of interest and that he disclosed client confidences to benefit himself and others, but because his misconduct caused no harm, it recommended that he be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Bar counsel and the respondent appealed to the board. The board adopted the hearing committee\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, but concluded that the appropriate sanction was a public reprimand. Bar counsel notified the board, pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 8 (4), as appearing in 425 Mass. 1311 (1997), that he objected to the sanction of a public reprimand. The board filed an information and record of proceedings with the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County. A single justice of this court reserved and reported the matter to the full court. We order a six-month suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts found by the hearing committee and adopted by the board. The respondent concentrates his practice in the area of animal rights law. He represented a Texas nonprofit corporation, Primarily Primates, Inc. (PPI), pro hac vice in a variety of matters beginning in 1991. PPI operates an animal sanctuary near San Antonio. Wallace Swett, the only corporate member of PPI, elected its board of trustees, of which he was a member. He was also the president of PPI and manager of the sanctuary. The respondent\u2019s services were authorized by the trustees, through Swett.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">In 1992 the respondent represented PPI in a claim against the Doelger Foundation to enforce payment of a grant that was suspended in the face of allegations that PPI had not met certain conditions of the grant. The matter was settled in March, 1993, at which time the trustees, consisting of Swett, Stephen Tello, Kay McMichael-Trevino, and Melissa Karron, approved the respondent\u2019s outstanding bills, $59,079.95, for payment from settlement proceeds expected in June.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">On June 22, 1993, as sole member of the corporation, Swett elected a new board of trustees, consisting of himself, Stephen Tello, and a third person. In late June, 1993, the respondent requested immediate payment of his fees and costs. On June 30, Swett wrote to the respondent that his bills would not be paid until they were reviewed by the new board, PPI\u2019s accountant, and other attorneys. Swett further informed the respondent that he was not authorized to represent PPI on any matter without Swett\u2019s approval, other than a particular contract dispute. On July 1, the respondent sent a letter to Trevino, Karron, Tello, and Swett, who he believed were the trustees of PPI, demanding itemization of the disputed portions of his bills and payment of the undisputed portion by July 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">On July 5, 1993, the respondent spoke with Trevino about his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>bills. She told him that the trustees had not authorized Swett\u2019s letter of June 30, and that she and Karron disagreed with the refusal to pay him. Trevino also told the respondent that she and Karron had been illegally removed as trustees, and that she intended to notify the Attorney General of Texas that Swett and Tello were misusing PPI funds, not caring properly for the animals, and sexually abusing PPI employees. Many of these same allegations had been made a year before in a complaint by John Hollrah, an animal rights activist, a matter in which the respondent had successfully defended PPI. Trevino expressed the intent to take PPI financial records to substantiate her charges. The respondent asked her to delay making a complaint, as he would inquire first to see if her concerns would be something the Attorney General might pursue, and how best to present them. In subsequent conversations, Trevino and Karron asked the respondent to assist them to freeze PPI\u2019s bank accounts, to force Swett to relinquish exclusive control over PPI, and to achieve financial accountability from PPI\u2019s officers and trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The respondent placed an anonymous call to Texas Assistant Attorney General John Vinson, at the request of Trevino and Karron, and informed him of the details of the dispute. He also asked officers at two financial institutions holding PPI assets to freeze PPI\u2019s assets because of an internal dispute that included accusations of misconduct. No bank account was actually frozen. On July 7, 1993, with the approval of Trevino and Karron, the respondent transmitted by facsimile a letter to Swett and Tello, who were out of the country, announcing that he was representing PPI on behalf of Trevino and Karron. The respondent provided details of their accusations, including a revival of the Doelger and Hollrah matters, in which he took contrary positions from those taken when he defended PPI. He also raised the issue of Swett\u2019s refusal to honor the agreement to pay his fees, and he reported that the Attorney General of Texas had been apprised of the situation, that corporate funds had been frozen, and that both Swett and Tello were suspended and relieved of their duties. He added that the Attorney General, Trevino, and Karron would seek a receivership of PPI if all matters were not settled in a manner acceptable to Trevino and Karron by July 9, the date Swett and Tello were scheduled to return from their trip abroad. PPI was a corporate client of the respondent at this time and it had not authorized his representation of Trevino and Karron.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Swett retained Attorney Karl Hays of Texas to represent PPI in the matter. Hays called the respondent on July 9 to advise that he was representing PPI. Hays asked the respondent to explain his concerns about PPI, which he did, including the allegations from the Hollrah matter. The respondent forwarded copies of the Hollrah documents to Hays. After investigating the matter, Hays transmitted by facsimile a letter to the respondent on July 13, advising him that Trevino and Karron were not trustees of PPI and that the respondent was not authorized to represent the corporation in any matter except pending litigation. Hays further requested the respondent to direct all communications to PPI through his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">On July 13, 1993, after receiving Hays\u2019s letter, the respondent spoke with Trevino and Karron, who authorized him to discuss their dispute openly with Assistant Attorney General Vinson, which he then did. Trevino delivered a letter to Vinson the same day, outlining her concerns about Swett and including financial records about PPI and documents from the Hollrah matter. She was Vinson\u2019s sole source of documents about PPI. On July 19, Swett and Tello sent a letter to the respondent terminating his services, and requesting his withdrawal from PPI litigation and the return of his files. On July 21, the respondent responded directly to Swett and Tello by letter, without first obtaining Hays\u2019s consent, questioning their authority and refusing to cease his activities until so instructed by a majority of the board of trustees. On July 21, the respondent informed Vinson about his fee dispute, explaining that \u201cit could be used to impugn my motives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">On July 14, 1993, the day after the respondent and Trevino contacted the Attorney General\u2019s office, Hays filed suit against Trevino, Karron, and the respondent and obtained an ex parte order restraining them from interfering with PPI\u2019s operations and from representing themselves as officers or agents of PPI. On July 30, the Attorney General intervened with a receivership action. Trevino and Karron were defaulted for failure to defend. The respondent removed PPI\u2019s case to Federal court, which subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of the respondent because PPI failed to establish actual damages. PPI and the Attorney General reached a settlement that required PPI to expand its membership and create a seven-member board of trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The hearing committee found that \u201cthe [respondent\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>conduct demonstrates that his primary motivation was retaliation against Swett and Tello for their refusal to pay his fees and collection of those fees.\u201d It concluded that, by assisting and representing Trevino and Karron in their efforts to require Swett to relinquish his exclusive control of PPI, the respondent violated S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 5, DR 5-101 (A), as appearing in 382 Mass. 779 (1981) (accepting employment and acting in a matter in which the exercise of professional judgment was or could reasonably be affected by personal or business interests, without the informed consent of the client), and DR 5-105 (A), as appearing in 382 Mass. 781 (1981) (engaging in concurrent and successive conflicts of interest and breach of duty of loyalty and neutrality to client). The hearing committee also found that the respondent violated S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 4, DR 4-101 (B) (1), as appearing in 382 Mass. 778 (1981) (lawyer shall not knowingly reveal a confidence or secret of client), and DR 4-101 (B) (3), as appearing in 382 Mass. 778 (1981) (lawyer shall not knowingly use a confidence or secret of his client for the advantage of himself or of a third person unless client consents after full disclosure), by informing Assistant Attorney General Vinson and two financial institutions holding PPI assets that PPI was in the throes of an internal dispute, that it was suffering from mismanagement, and that its trustees and officers were engaged in misconduct. The hearing committee further concluded that the respondent violated S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 7, DR 7-104 (A) (1), as appearing in 382 Mass. 786 (1981) (lawyer shall not communicate with party known to be represented by counsel on the subject of the representation), by writing directly to Swett and Tello on July 21, 1993, after Hays notified him that Hays was representing PPI in this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">2. <em>Bar counsel\u2019s appeal, </em>(a) Bar counsel challenges as contrary to the facts the board\u2019s conclusions that the respondent did not violate SJ.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 4, DR 4-101 (B) (2), as appearing in 382 Mass. 778 (1981) (lawyer shall not knowingly use a client confidence to the disadvantage of a client), or S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 7, DR 7-101 (A) (3), as appearing in 382 Mass. 784 (1981) (lawyer shall not intentionally prejudice or damage his client during the course of the professional relationship). In reaching these conclusions the board adopted the hearing committee\u2019s finding that PPI did not suffer harm or disadvantage as a result of the respondent\u2019s conduct. Bar counsel correctly points out that harm encompasses more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>financial damages or monetary loss. See <em>Matter of Dawkins, </em>412 Mass. 90, 94 (1992) (client subjected to lawsuits and issuance of capias); <em>Matter of Eastwood, </em>10 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 70, 74-75 (1994) (clients subjected to criminal and civil penalties). He argues that PPI was harmed because it was forced to retain Hays to enjoin the respondent\u2019s misconduct and to defend itself against a receivership action.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">The board concluded that Trevino had been preparing to press her concerns about the management of PPI with the Attorney General\u2019s office and that the Attorney General likely would have taken the action it did \u201ceven if [the respondent] had stayed out of the conflict.\u201d The hearing committee reached essentially the same conclusion, noting further that Trevino sent a letter to the Attorney General\u2019s office detailing the allegations, and that she was the sole source of documents provided to the Attorney General concerning PPL The findings of the hearing committee as to the causal relation between the actions of Trevino and Karron and the harm to PPI were not speculative, as bar counsel contends, but were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">(b) The board also adopted the hearing committee\u2019s conclusion that the respondent did not violate S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 7, DR 7-101 (A) (1) (lawyer shall not intentionally fail to seek the lawful objectives of client). Bar counsel argues that the respondent violated this rule by disclosing PPI\u2019s confidences to the Attorney General\u2019s office, and that the disclosure was directly contrary to PPI\u2019s objective to resolve its internal disputes privately.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Although the respondent claimed in his letter of July 7 that he represented PPI, he had not been authorized by a majority of the board of trustees to represent the corporation in the dispute initiated by Trevino and Karron. The board was correct in reasoning that DR 7-101 (A) (1) presupposes that the respondent represented the client on the matters at issue. Here, the respondent represented Trevino and Karron, not PPI, and thus he could not intentionally have failed to seek the lawful objectives of PPI. There is no claim that he intentionally failed to seek the lawful objectives of PPI in matters for which he had been retained by the corporation. Further, DR 7-101 (A) (1) requires a showing of prejudice, which the board correctly concluded had not been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Bar counsel\u2019s reliance on the current Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.13(b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>426 Mass. 1302 (1998), is misplaced. That rule did not become effective until January 1, 1998, after the events here had taken place. It is therefore not applicable to this controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">(c) The board made certain conclusions that bar counsel argues invaded the hearing committee\u2019s role as \u201csole judge of the credibility of the testimony presented at the hearing.\u201d S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 8 (4), as appearing in 425 Mass. 1311 (1997). <em>Matter of Tobin, </em>417 Mass. 81, 85-86 (1994). <em>Matter of Saab, </em>406 Mass. 315, 328 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Bar counsel challenges the board\u2019s conclusion that the respondent \u201cbelieved he had authority for the actions he took.\u201d The only basis for this conclusion was the respondent\u2019s testimony that he believed he was general counsel to PPI. The hearing committee implicitly rejected this testimony, finding only that the respondent \u201cwas retained ... on approximately fourteen different cases.\u201d Although the respondent claimed to be general counsel, he could point to no services he provided that would reasonably lead to that belief. He had not been asked to review any internal corporate papers or corporate filings, and he had not attended any meetings of the board of trustees. He also relied on his first fee agreement letter with PPI for his assertion, but that letter was an agreement to provide services in a particular matter, and nowhere in that agreement was he referred to as general counsel. PPI only agreed that he would be \u201csole counsel\u201d in the particular matter. The respondent cited no writing or vote of the board of trustees authorizing his actions in the dispute between its members. At best, the trustees were evenly divided, so there was no majority of trustees who could have authorized his actions. Where there was no reasonable basis for the respondent to have believed he was general counsel and where the hearing committee did not accept his testimony on the point, there was no basis for the board\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Bar counsel similarly challenges the board\u2019s conclusion that the respondent\u2019s \u201cjudgment was clouded ... by his devotion to the cause of animal rights.\u201d The board\u2019s conclusion, stated in its entirety, is that the respondent\u2019s \u201cjudgment was clouded both by his pecuniary interest in getting his legal bills paid and by his devotion to the cause of animal rights.\u201d Bar counsel relies on the respondent\u2019s testimony, expressly rejected by the hearing committee, that his desire to collect his fees had \u201czero effect,\u201d and that he was motivated solely by his \u201cconcern[] about animals.\u201d The hearing committee was not required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>reject the respondent\u2019s testimony outright, contrary to bar counsel\u2019s contention, and could have found that the respondent was motivated in part by his concern for animals. The hearing committee found that \u201chis primary motivation was retaliation against Swett and Tello for their refusal to pay his fees and collection of those fees.\u201d It did not find that the respondent had only one motive. By finding as it did, the hearing committee implicitly acknowledged that the respondent\u2019s concern for animals may have been a secondary motive. The board expressly made that conclusion. See S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 8 (4). There was no error in the board\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">3. <em>The respondent\u2019s appeal, </em>(a) The respondent argues that the hearing committee\u2019s finding that \u201chis primary motivation was retaliation against Swett and Tello for their refusal to pay his fees and collection of those fees\u201d was not supported by substantial evidence. \u201cThe scope of our inquiry is limited. While we review the entire record and consider whatever detracts from the weight of the board\u2019s conclusion, as long as there is substantial evidence, we do not disturb the board\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Matter of Segal, </em>430 Mass. 359, 364 (1999). See S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 8 (4) (\u201csubsidiary facts found by the [bjoard . . . shall be upheld if supported by substantial evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In his letter of June 25, 1993, in which he requested immediate payment of his outstanding bills for $59,079.95 in seven matters, the respondent indicated that his law firm had \u201csuffered serious financial hardship for many months . . . wait[ing to be paid].\u201d In his letter of July 1, the respondent angrily explained to the trustees that he had \u201cworked for months without being paid,\u201d and he \u201cadvanced heavy costs\u201d on behalf of PPL When he wrote to the assistant attorney general on July 21 about his unpaid bills, he acknowledged that the issue \u201ccould be used to impugn [his] motives.\u201d There was substantial evidence that the respondent\u2019s outstanding bills were weighing heavily on him. In his letter of July 7 to Swett and Tello, the respondent enveloped the various claims of Trevino and Karron around his own claim for fees. There is substantial evidence that the issue of his unpaid bills was at the fore of his representation of Trevino and Karron. The respondent\u2019s willingness to assist Trevino and Karron in their accusations of mismanagement and misconduct against Swett by taking the opposite position in the Doelger and Hollrah matters from what he took when defending PPI is substantial evidence of his retaliatory intent. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The respondent cites several points that he argues weigh against the hearing committee\u2019s finding. The strongest of these is his testimony that his sole concern was his duty to PPI and his concern for animals. The hearing committee expressly rejected that testimony. They are the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses, and notwithstanding the respondent\u2019s argument that his testimony must be accepted because it was uncontradicted, they were not required to believe his testimony. See <em>Matter of Tobin, supra. </em>S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 8 (4). His testimony was indeed contradicted by substantial evidence. The other points similarly fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">(b) The respondent challenges the board\u2019s conclusion that he violated the duty to remain neutral, in violation of Canon 5, DR 5-105 (A), as appearing in 382 Mass. 781 (1981). Relying on S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 4, DR 4-101 (C), as appearing in 382 Mass. 778 (1981), which states that \u201c[a] lawyer may reveal:. . . (3) the intention of his client to commit a crime and the information necessary to prevent the crime,\u201d he argues that he took action against Swett and Tello because they were committing crimes against his corporate client, PPI.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In his letter of July 7, 1993, to Swett and Tello, however, the respondent identified no crime that Swett and Tello were intending to commit. The letter refers to mismanagement, wasting PPI\u2019s money, and \u201cinappropriate behavior, including [Swett\u2019s] sullenness, hostility, sudden mood shifts, and sexual harassment of men.\u201d His demand that they come up with \u201ca solution to . . . all . . . problems caused by you that is acceptable to . . . Trevino and . . . Karron\u201d by 5 p.m. on July 9 suggests a civil, not a criminal, matter. The evidence does not show the respondent trying to prevent the commission of crimes against PPI. It shows him embroiled in an internal power struggle at PPI, which he tried to use to punish Swett and Tello for refusing to pay his bill, and to collect his fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The respondent\u2019s response that \u201c[tjhere was no \u2018internal dispute over control\u2019 of PPI,\u201d and that \u201cTrevino and Karron did not want control . . . [or] seek control,\u201d is not credible. The respondent himself testified that Trevino and Karron wanted Swett to relinquish control. He wrote to PPI\u2019s asset manager on July 7, 1993, and explained that Trevino and Karron were \u201cpreparing a suit to place PPI into receivership if Mr. Swett and Mr. Tello [do not] voluntarily relinquish control,\u201d and that, \u201c[m]eanwhdle, they do not authorize Mr. Swett or Mr. Tello to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>withdraw any funds.\u201d Trevino wrote to the assistant attorney general on July 12, 1993, that the trustees had \u201crepeatedly tried to wrestle control. . . from Mr. Swett.\u201d None of the participants ever viewed this dispute as anything other than an internal corporate power struggle. Nowhere in these letters does it appear that the respondent was hying to prevent the commission of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">In the course of his representation of Trevino and Karron, the respondent took positions in the Doelger and Hollrah matters that were contrary to the positions he had previously taken in those matters. His representation in those matters necessarily included representation of Swett. As such, his representation of Trevino and Karron was conflicted, and violated DR 5-105 (A). See G. Tuoni, Massachusetts Att\u2019y Conduct Manual 5-96 to 5-102, 5-117 to 5-120 (1992). Even if, as he claims, he represented only PPI and not Trevino and Karron, he should have realized that he had a conflict with Swett. The respondent should have remained neutral in the Trevino-Karron dispute, and advised them, and PPI, to engage other counsel, regardless of who he understood was purporting to act for PPI.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">(c) The respondent argues that the hearing committee and the board erroneously concluded that he violated Canon 4, DR 4-101 (B) (1), by revealing a confidence or a secret of his Ghent, and that he aggravated this violation by doing so for Trevino\u2019s, Karron\u2019s, and his own advantage. See DR 4-101 (B) (3). He again relies on DR 4-101 (C) (3), which permits disclosure of a Ghent\u2019s intention to commit a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">For the reasons discussed in Part 3(b), <em>supra, </em>DR 4-101 C (3) does not apply. The respondent never outlined any criminal act which Swett and Tello intended to commit. He never indicated he would present evidence of any such intended criminal conduct to the appropriate prosecutorial agency. Instead, he outlined a number of corporate issues in his letter of July 7 that he demanded Swett and Tello settle to the satisfaction of Trevino and Karron. His disclosure to the Attorney General and to PPI\u2019s financial institutions of the confidential internal corporate matters described in his July 7 letter, for the purpose of excluding Swett and Tello from participation in PPI\u2019s day-to-day business, violated DR 4-101 (B) (1). Where the disclosure was made for the benefit of Trevino, Karron, and himself, it further violated DR 4-101 (B) (3). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>(d) The respondent challenges the board\u2019s conclusion that he violated Canon 7, DR 7-104 (A) (1), by sending a letter to Swett and Tello on July 21, 1993, after being asked by Attorney Hays to direct all communication to PPI through his office. He bases his argument on the point that Swett and Tello lacked authority to hire Hays to represent PPI and thus Hays could not have spoken as PPI\u2019s attorney. It is true that in the absence of express authority under the by-laws of the corporation, or unless specifically authorized by the trustees, Swett, as president, had no authority to hire an attorney to represent PPI. See <em>Valley Int\u2019l Props., Inc. </em>v. <em>Brownsville Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>581 S.W.2d 222, 227 (Tex. Ct. App. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The respondent acknowledged in his letter to Swett and Tello, however, that he \u201cbelieve[d] that Karl Hays represents [them] solely in [their] individual capacities.\u201d He acknowledged, further, that because they wrote to him, he would respond directly to them, \u201cthough ordinarily I would not communicate to persons represented by counsel.\u201d Assuming that Hays was representing Swett and Tello in their individual capacities, there can be no doubt that the subject of that representation included the issue of their authority to act for PPI, and that as such they were disputing the authority of Trevino and Karron to act for PPI. The nature of Swett and Tello\u2019s challenge was laid out in Hays\u2019s July 12 letter to the respondent. Because the respondent\u2019s response to Swett and Tello went to their authority to act for PPI, and therefore the subject of Hays\u2019s representation, his letter should have been sent to Hays. The respondent\u2019s letter to Swett and Tello violated DR 7-104 (A) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">4. <em>Disposition. </em>Bar counsel urges us to adopt the recommendation of the hearing committee and order that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six months. The respondent, who insists that he conducted himself \u201cin the finest tradition of the Massachusetts bar,\u201d asks us to dismiss the charges, or, alternatively, issue nothing more severe than a public reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Bar counsel relies on several cases where six-month suspensions were imposed. In <em>Matter of Thurston, </em>13 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 776, 792 (1997), the respondent secretly assisted one of two equal shareholders who transferred all of their corporation\u2019s assets to himself while the other relied on the respondent as corporate counsel. <em>Matter of Taglino, 9 </em>Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 318, 319 (1993), involved an attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>who failed to make adequate disclosure to the seller in a commercial real estate transaction, his client, that the buyer, whom he also represented, was a regular client. The respondent drafted a mortgage of other land owned by the buyer as additional security with the knowledge that it afforded little or no protection. He also caused the seller to subsequently release his existing mortgages and substitute new mortgage financing that was disadvantageous. The respondent in <em>Matter of Tobin, </em>7 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 290, 292, 294-295 (1991), was suspended for one year for representing parties to real estate transactions whose interests differed, without disclosing the conflict. In one case he \u201cunconscionably]\u201d caused an \u201cunsophisticated homeowner to transfer to him, as trustee . . . the equity in her home in exchange for being saddled with financial commitments that he and his clients must have known she could not meet.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294. We ordered a six-month suspension of the respondent in <em>Matter of Pike, </em>408 Mass. 740 (1990), who represented a tenant in lease negotiations with a landlord without disclosing that he served as the landlord\u2019s broker in the same matter. The client suffered harm when it was subsequently discovered that the local zoning by-law barred use of a portion of the leased premises for retail purposes, the basis for the Ghent\u2019s rental of the space.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The respondent argues that those cases are distinguishable because in each the client was harmed, and the attorney either had perpetrated a fraud on the client or had exploited a vulnerable client. The cases on which bar counsel relies are good authority for a six-month suspension. Although the hearing committee and the board concluded that the harm to PPI was a result of Trevino\u2019s independent actions, the respondent counseled her on how best to inflict that harm by laying the foundation for her to contact Assistant Attorney General Vinson, as he did himself. The evidence is compelling that the respondent intended that harm to flow. Although the respondent did not act secretly or deceptively, his conduct was just as reprehensible. Moreover, there is nothing to suggest that the respondent acknowledges any wrongdoing, and he has shown no remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The cases put forth by the respondent in support of a public reprimand are distinguishable. In <em>Matter of Roberts, 9 </em>Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 271 (1993), the respondent received a public censure for representing clients having conflicting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>interests. There was a full, but delayed, disclosure. The clients otherwise were represented diligently, and the respondent did not benefit financially. The respondent in <em>Matter of Warren, </em>8 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 260 (1992), received a public censure for suing a client on a bill and attaching her home without her knowledge, while continuing to represent her. In <em>Matter of Dionisi, </em>9 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 99 (1993), a public censure was imposed on the respondent for representing a client in a transaction in which the respondent\u2019s mother had a financial interest, without disclosing the conflict and obtaining the client\u2019s consent. None of those cases involved a disclosure of client confidences or the vengeful attitude toward the client that is present here. Nor was a selfish motive as dominant as here.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">We are satisfied that a six-month suspension is required. The respondent\u2019s actions were marked by a conflict of interest, the disclosure of client confidences, and communication with persons known to be represented by counsel on the subject of his communication. His multiple serious ethical violations were motivated by selfishness and anger. The respondent\u2019s reinstatement shall be on the condition that he take and pass the multiState professional responsibility examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-14\">The petition alleged violations of the canons of ethics and disciplinary rules in effect through December 31, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
