L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, from a decision by the Appellate Tax Board (board) granting Jafra Cosmetics, Inc. (taxpayer), an abatement of sales and use taxes assessed from 1967 to 1982.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The board concluded that the consultants who sold the taxpayer\u2019s products in Massachusetts, who within the taxpayer\u2019s organization are the only persons authorized to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>such sales, were not \u201crepresentatives\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1 (5), because they were not contractually obligated to sell and they had no authority to bind the taxpayer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that, as matter of law, the board incorrectly construed the term and we therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The taxpayer, a California corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Massachusetts-based Gillette Company, manufactured a line of cosmetics and skin care products. The taxpayer sold its products through a sales force of independent contractors, referred to as \u201cconsultants,\u201d who in turn marketed the products through what is called the \u201cdirect selling method.\u201d Consultants were entry level independent contractors whose compensation was the difference between the wholesale prices charged by the taxpayer and the retail prices at which the products were sold to the consumer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Managers were consultants who met the taxpayer\u2019s requirements for promotion and could thereby receive an additional commission from the taxpayer equal to a certain percentage of the wholesale value of their sponsored consultants\u2019 sales.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> District directors were managers who had satisfied additional criteria and they earned a guaranteed, fixed commission of between $12,000 and $25,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>per year. At the highest levels, they also received paid health insurance. During the assessment period, employees of the taxpayer held meetings in the Commonwealth for the local sales force, oversaw and attended training sessions organized by the consultants, and distributed bonus and motivational gifts. Employees did not personally solicit or collect orders for sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Consultants* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> were prohibited by contract from selling through wholesale or retail establishments. The most common direct selling method was to hold classes in private homes during which consultants gave facials, make-up demonstrations, and advice about proper skin care with the purpose of soliciting orders for the products. Consumers could make subsequent purchases by contacting the consultant directly. After a customer placed an order, the consultant would send the order to the taxpayer in California for acceptance. Consultants could either prepay the order or pay for it within seven days of its receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The legal relationship between the taxpayer and its consultants was governed by a one-page \u201cIndependent Consultant Agreement\u201d (agreement). The agreement stated that \u201cthe Consultant has no authority to obligate Jaffa in any way,\u201d \u201cJafra is not responsible for Consultant\u2019s activities,\u201d and the \u201cConsultant shall assume full responsibility for collecting any taxes on goods sold that are taxable.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In contrast, \u00a7 10 of the agreement placed certain burdens and limitations on a consultant\u2019s activities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">At the hearing before the board, the taxpayer offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>testimony that the guidelines referred to in \u00a7 10 merely contained the taxpayer\u2019s suggestions on how to best succeed in business but that none was rigidly enforced. The consultant guide in which these guidelines were printed was admitted in evidence at the hearing, as was the manager guide that described the business opportunities and increased compensation available for individuals who qualified for such positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In its decision, the board concluded that the consultants were not \u201crepresentatives\u201d under G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1 (5), and that the taxpayer was entitled to an abatement of the approximately $500,000 in sales and use tax plus interest and penalties assessed against it for the $4,000,000 in sales made in the Commonwealth between 1967 and 1982. The board construed the term \u201crepresentative\u201d to refer to \u201can individual clothed in some authority vested by another to deal on its behalf. Within the scope of [her] authority, a representative can act as if [she] were the principal, i.e., fix the principal\u2019s legal relations with third parties. A representative is someone entrusted by the principal with the ability to conduct certain matters as full delegee.\u201d The board determined that the consultants were not representatives because they had no authority to act for the taxpayer and could not obligate the taxpayer. Correspondingly, it also found that the taxpayer had no control over the sales activities of the consultants. According to the board, the independent status of the consultants was dispositive of the question whether they were representatives under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The only question presented on appeal is whether the consultants were \u201crepresentatives\u201d of the taxpayer as that term was used in G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 l,* <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as then applicable. The commissioner argues that the board\u2019s construction of \u201crepresentative\u201d was incorrect as matter of law. The taxpayer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>on the other hand, contends that the board found, as matter of fact, that consultants solicited orders from Massachusetts residents for their own benefit and not for the benefit of the taxpayer, and that we must affirm the board\u2019s decision because it was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">We review decisions by the board for errors of law, <em>Towle </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>397 Mass. 599, 601 (1986), and shall disturb the board\u2019s factual findings only if not supported by substantial evidence. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. However, \u201cwe are not required to affirm the board merely on a finding that the record contains evidence from which a rational mind might draw the desired inference. Our determination must be made \u2018upon consideration of the entire record.\u2019 \u201d <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981), quoting <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>350 Mass. 246, 253 (1966). See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Concord, </em>355 Mass. 79, 92 (1968). Because the board\u2019s determination that certain facts were legally significant flowed inevitably from its flawed construction of the statutory term, we are not limited to those facts found by the board to be dispositive. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Wells Yachts South, Inc., </em>406 Mass. 661, 664-665 (1990). Cf. <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">We have not previously construed the term \u201crepresentative\u201d as it is used in the statute. General Laws c. 64H, \u00a7 1, imposes sales and use tax liability on \u201cvendors\u201d \u201cengaged in business in the commonwealth. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> From 1967 to 1971, a vendor was \u201cengaged in business\u201d if it had \u201cany representative, agent, salesman, canvasser or solicitor operating in the commonwealth for the purpose of selling, delivering or taking orders for tangible personal property.\u201d G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1 (5), inserted by St. 1967, c. 757, \u00a7 1. In 1971, the statute was amended such that, inter alia, the term \u201cagent\u201d was deleted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> St. 1971, c. 555, \u00a7 40. By using the terms \u201crepresentative\u201d and \u201cagent\u201d in the same section in the earliest version of the statute, the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>must have intended them to have different meanings. See <em>Flemings </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 374, 376 (2000). In addition, if the Legislature intended- to limit tax liability to those entities that had common-law agents located in the Commonwealth, then it would have been logical to amend \u00a7 1 (5) by omitting the term \u201crepresentative\u201d and leaving the term \u201cagent,\u201d rather than amending it as it did. We view the 1971 amendment as evidencing a legislative intent favoring a more expansive, rather than a more restrictive, view of how business was conducted in the Commonwealth by out-of-State corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The proposition that a representative is someone with less authority than an agent is found elsewhere in the statute. General Laws c. 64H, \u00a7 1 (9), provides that the commissioner may, for the efficient administration of the tax laws, deem a \u201crepresentative\u201d to be an \u201cagent.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Reading the statute as a whole, <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>319 Mass. 81, 84-85 (1946), it follows that, if the commissioner is specifically authorized to treat a representative as if he or she were an agent, then a representative may be an individual who otherwise lacks an agency relationship with the vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">It remains for us to construe the term. Analogous cases arising under analogous, although not identical, statutes are instructive. In <em>Scripto, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>362 U.S. 207 (1960), the United States Supreme Court affirmed a decision of the Florida Supreme Court upholding imposition of a use tax on an out-of-State vendor. The vendor\u2019s sales force was comprised of approximately ten \u201cjobbers\u201d who, like the consultants, were independent contractors, not employees. The Florida Supreme Court held that these jobbers were \u201crepresentatives\u201d under a statute similar to the versions of G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1 (5), at issue here. <em>Scripto, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>105 So. 2d 775, 782 (Fla. 1958), aff\u2019d, 362 U.S. 207 (1960). Jobbers were free to sell products for other manufacturers. Consultants were similarly free to sell products for other manufacturers although they were contractu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>ally prohibited from selling those other products at any demonstration or sales event at which Jaffa products were sold or on display. Also, as was the case here, the Supreme Court noted that the minimal sanctions imposed on the jobbers from a failure to maintain \u201cactive\u201d status fell short of termination.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Finally, like the agreement here, the contract in <em>Scripto </em>explicitly stated that jobbers \u201cha[d] no authority to make collections or incur debts involving [the taxpayer].\u201d <em>Scripto, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>362 U.S. at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Similarly, in <em>In re Newbern, </em>286 Ala. 348, 352 (1970), appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 813 (1972), the Alabama Supreme Court upheld the imposition of a use tax on an out-of-State vendor. There were approximately ninety individuals in the State soliciting orders from residents for the vendor\u2019s products on a commission basis. The Alabama Supreme Court eschewed legal formalism when it rejected the taxpayer\u2019s argument that the terms \u201cagent\u201d and \u201csalesman\u201d in that State\u2019s statute permitted imposition of the tax only if the individual soliciting the order had \u201csome legal relationship with the out-of-State seller not articulated in the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352. See <em>In re Scholastic Book Clubs, Inc., </em>260 Kan. 528 (1996) (teachers who collected orders for vendor \u201cact[ed] as agents or representatives under the authority of [the vendor] even if there was no formal contract between the vendor and the teachers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In construing the term \u201crepresentative,\u201d we adopt the approach used by the Florida Supreme Court and approved by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Scripto </em>and examine whether the nature and extent of the out-of-State taxpayer\u2019s involvement with its in-State sales force was sufficient to support a conclusion that the sales force was made up of representatives for purposes of G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1. See <em>Scripto, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carson, supra </em>at 781. In so doing, we reject a technical construction of the term that would permit vendors to escape sales and use tax liability by artful drafting. \u201c[W]e refuse to believe that so transparent an escape device from the sales tax was intended by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Clark Franklin Press Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>364 Mass. 598, 603 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The evidence was uncontested that the consultants had no authority to bind the taxpayer. We accept the board\u2019s finding, based on substantial evidence, that they were under no contractual obligation to fulfil the taxpayer\u2019s expectations or to adhere rigidly to the taxpayer\u2019s suggestions for how best to succeed in the business of selling its products. However, we disagree with the board\u2019s conclusion that, absent a contractual obligation to sell, the motivation to sell was wholly personal and that therefore, as matter of law, sales made were on the consultants\u2019 own \u201cbehalf\u201d and not \u201con behalf\u201d of the taxpayer. Cf. <em>In re Scholastic Book Clubs, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The record as a whole reveals that the nature and extent of the taxpayer\u2019s involvement was such that the lack of contractual authority was legally insignificant. See <em>In re Newbern, supra </em>at 351 n.2 (existence or absence of \u201c \u2018legal relationship\u2019 between seller and solicitor\u201d was immaterial). Cf. <em>Scripto, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carson, supra </em>at 211 (employee or independent contractor \u201cdistinction is without constitutional significance\u201d). The taxpayer structured its compensation opportunities so that adoption of the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cethics,\u201d \u201csharing,\u201d and \u201c \u2018caring\u2019 concept\u201d was the fastest route to financial success for the consultants. In addition, the taxpayer\u2019s financial future depended on the sales and recruiting efforts of its consultants: the taxpayer\u2019s employees did not solicit or accept orders; hence, just as a corporation cannot act except through its human representatives, absent the efforts of its hundreds of local consultants, the taxpayer would have had no Massachusetts \u201cclients.\u201d The manager guide, produced and distributed by the taxpayer, makes this financial interdependence explicit by asserting that \u201c[ujnlimited and enduring prosperity for all of us in Jaffa is assured if we comply with [the] simple regulations [for maintaining manager status] which have been in effect since January 1, 1968.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Moreover, the fact that the consultants were not contractually obligated to sell does not change the fact that if consultants indeed sold the taxpayer\u2019s products: (1) the manner and places in which they could make those sales was contractually limited; (2) the claims consultants could make about the products were contractually defined; and (3) although consultants were not contractually bound to sell the products at the taxpayer\u2019s suggested retail prices, testimony at the hearing indicated that consultants did not deviate from the suggested retail prices. Adherence to the suggested retail prices was considered part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the \u201cJafra Concept\u201d that they were invited to understand and adopt. See <em>Scholastic Book Clubs, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, </em>207 Cal. App. 3d 734, 737 (1989) (\u201c[Office [the teachers] undertake to act, they are obviously acting under [the taxpayer\u2019s] authority, and certainly as [the taxpayer\u2019s] agents or representatives\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Testimony at the hearing also established that the two guides admitted in evidence reflected the taxpayer\u2019s policies, including language that unambiguously demonstrated that the sales force of consultants was integral in the development and dissemination of those policies. For example, district directors were relied on for \u201cadvice on how best to establish and implement Company policies,\u201d and managers were issued a script to follow by which they might impart these policies to the consultants they sponsored.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The fact that consultants were not required to adhere rigidly to the policies and suggestions in the guides is immaterial where, as here, the consultant who did follow the program became, in the taxpayer\u2019s own words, \u201ca reflection of the company.\u201d The guide encouraged them to \u201c[t]alk about your Company and how comfortable our program is\u201d and to \u201c[pffiesent the Jaffa Company to the best of your ability . . . [by being] well groomed, dressed properly, and wear[ing] natural looking make-up\u201d because \u201c[t]he more attractive [a consultant] is, the more elegant she is, the greater compliment she pays Jafra.\u201d The guide further assured consultants that \u201c[n]o matter where you live, you will have a job with Jafra [because] Jafra has clients in all States including Alaska and Hawaii.\u201d The nature and extent of this out-of-State taxpayer\u2019s involvement with its in-State sales force is sufficient to establish that these independent sales people were \u201crepresentatives\u201d under G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1 (5). See <em>Scripto, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>105 So. 2d 775, 781 (Fla. 1958) (\u201c[T]o the extent of the [limited contractual] authority granted to the Florida wholesale jobbers and the services which they rendered] to [the taxpayer] . . . they [were] representative of [the taxpayer] for the purpose of attracting, soliciting and obtaining Florida customers for the [the taxpayer\u2019s] products\u201d), aff'd, 362 U.S. 207 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The taxpayer argues that a finding for the commissioner amounts to applying the most recent version of the statute retroactively to its activities during the assessment period. The current version of the statute permits the commissioner to collect sales and use tax from vendors who \u201cexploit[] the retail sales market in the commonwealth through any means whatsoever, including, but not limited to, salesmen, solicitors or representatives in the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 1 (5), as amended through St. 1988, c. 202, \u00a7 19. We disagree. While the amendment arguably expands the types of sales or marketing methods that may form the commissioner\u2019s statutory basis for imposing sales and use tax on a vendor, \u201crepresentatives\u201d have consistently been one avenue through which a vendor might effect those sales. Our decision is grounded on the determination that it was the taxpayer\u2019s elaborate involvement with its consultants that brought them within the reach of the statutory term, not the fact that the taxpayer \u201cexploit[ed] the retail sales market in the commonwealth\u201d through its consultants.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Finally, we note that the Legislature\u2019s broad grant of power to the commissioner is designed to promote the most efficient administration of the tax statutes. <em>Baker Transport, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>371 Mass. 872, 875 (1977). <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Boback, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 602, 604 (1981). Such a policy would be thwarted by a requirement that the commissioner track down hundreds of individuals in the Commonwealth who are contractually prohibited from selling products at wholesale and retail establishments. By contrast, imposing this burden on a vendor does not seem undue where the vendor knows the identity and sales volume of each sales person located in-State. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>J.C. Penney Co., </em>431 Mass. 684, 690 (2000) (\u201ceconomic and commercial reality of the taxpayer\u2019s distribution of [its] catalogs\u201d supported imposition of use tax). In fact, without conceding any tax liability, the taxpayer voluntarily collected the Massachusetts sales and use tax for sales made within the Commonwealth beginning in 1982 and had, since its inception, collected and remitted the California sales tax on the retail value of sales made in that State.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Because of our decision, we do not reach the parties\u2019 further dispute regarding the board\u2019s denial of the commissioner\u2019s motion to compel production of the names and addresses of all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the consultants located in the State, information that the taxpayer has never, over the many years of these proceedings, provided. 3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-14\">In 1984, the commissioner issued a notice of failure to file returns for sales and use tax for the tax period at issue. In 1986, the commissioner issued a notice of intention to assess sales and use tax and made its assessment in 1987. The Gillette Company paid the assessment in full on behalf of its subsidiary in 1987. The taxpayer filed an application for an abatement that the commissioner denied in 1990. Although the taxpayer timely appealed from the denial of the application, the hearing before the board was not held until January, 1999. There is no explanation in the record for this nine-year delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b268-6\">From 1967 to 1971, a vendor was \u201cengaged in business in the commonwealth\u201d if it sold \u201ctangible personal property at retail in the commonwealth, or any activity in connection therewith\u201d including but not limited to \u201chaving any representative, agent, salesman, canvasser or solicitor operating in the commonwealth for the purpose of selling, delivering or taking orders for tangible personal property.\u201d G.
