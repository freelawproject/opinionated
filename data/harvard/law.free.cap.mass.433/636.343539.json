G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3. The mother, a resident of Massachusetts, is divorced from the children\u2019s father, who resides in Oklahoma with his current wife. A judge in the Juvenile Court allowed the department\u2019s petition with respect to the mother only. He found that the father was currently unfit to assume his parental responsibility and likely to remain so indefinitely, but denied the petition as to the father because of insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The mother brought this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She challenges on statutory and constitutional grounds the termination of her parental rights where the judge did not simultaneously terminate the parental rights of the father. The mother also maintains that the judge did not make adequate findings of fact concerning the effects of a geographic separation of the three siblings. We granted the mother\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We affirm the decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">On February 5, 1997, the department filed care and protection petitions on behalf of three children, Nancy (born June 25, 1987), Willow (born December 10, 1989), and Gregory (born June 9, 1991). The department received temporary custody of all three children, who were living at the time with their mother on Cape Cod. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24. On November 24, 1997, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>the mother agreed that the children should be placed in the permanent custody of the department. The whereabouts of the children\u2019s father were unknown to the department at that time. On July 27, 1998, a judge in the Juvenile Court allowed the department\u2019s motion to amend its pleadings in order to dispense with the mother\u2019s and the father\u2019s consent to the adoption of the three children.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Over the course of these proceedings, the department established a series of service plans, each of which identified separate goals for the mother, the children and, once he was located, the father. Prior to the removal of the children from her care, the goal for the mother was to \u201cstabilize\u201d the family. In May, 1997, the goal was to \u201creunify\u201d the children with her, but in every subsequent plan the goal was \u201cadoption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In September, 1998, an attorney for the father notified the court that the father had been located and was living in Oklahoma. In October, 1998, the father appeared in court for the first time and expressed his desire to regain custody of his children. In view of his late appearance in the case, a judge ordered that previously filed court investigative reports be updated so that information concerning the father could be obtained. The goal of the department\u2019s first and only service plan for the father, covering the period April 30, 1999, through October 31, 1999, was to \u201c[rjeunify [fjamily\u201d with the children. To that end, in April, 1999, the department initiated an interstate home study to determine whether the father could properly care for his children in Oklahoma.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 6, 1999, shortly before the trial commenced, the department was informed by the Oklahoma Department of Human Services that it did not recommend that the children be placed with their father. The Oklahoma social worker who conducted the evaluation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>expressed concerns that the father, a victim of sexual abuse and a substance abuser, did not have the ability to meet the needs of the children, particularly as there were few resources available to the father in his rural community to assist him.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">By August, 1999, when a three-day trial on the department\u2019s petitions was conducted before a judge in the Juvenile Court, the department\u2019s goal for all three children was adoption. See Part II, <em>infra. </em>The department introduced in evidence its plans to recruit adoptive resources actively and to identify prospective adoptive families for the two younger children, Willow and Gregory. Its plan for Nancy, the oldest child, was adoption by her current foster family. The father testified that he sought custody of Willow and Gregory, but agreed to consent to Nancy\u2019s adoption by her foster mother. See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">On September 10, 1999, before the judge issued his decision, the department filed permanency plans providing for placement for adoption of all three children. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 29B.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither parent filed an objection, and the plans were approved by a judge on October 20, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">On December 31, 1999, the trial judge filed extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law. He determined that both the mother and the father were currently unfit to assume parental responsibility for the children, and that the unfitness of each \u201cis likely to continue into the indefinite future to a near certitude.\u201d He further concluded that it was in the best interests of all three children to terminate the mother\u2019s parental rights, but that there was not sufficient evidence to terminate the father\u2019s parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>rights. See G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 (c) (Supp. 1999). The judge adjudicated the children in need of care and protection, G. L. c. 119, and ordered that they be committed to the custody of the department \u201cuntil they reach the age of eighteen (18) years or until, in the opinion of the Department, the goal of their commitment has been accomplished.\u201d The judge dispensed with the need for the mother\u2019s consent to any legal proceeding affecting the custody, guardianship, adoption, or other disposition of the children. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26 (4). The judge also determined that Nancy\u2019s best interests would be served if she were to remain in her current foster placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The mother does not challenge any of the judge\u2019s comprehensive findings of fact, including his finding that she is unfit to parent her children. Other than her argument concerning the judge\u2019s decision not to terminate the father\u2019s rights at the same time, she does not dispute the judge\u2019s finding that it is in the best interests of the children to terminate her parental rights. We summarize the findings in some detail, as they help to illustrate our discussion of her legal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The trial evidence focused on the severe abuse and neglect suffered by the three children before they were placed in the department\u2019s care. The mother, who had custody of the children,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> moved with them from Arizona to Cape Cod in August, 1995. Shortly afterward, she began living with a male companion. When the companion was evicted from his apartment, the mother and children moved with him into a succession of motel rooms, from which they were also evicted. The mother, her companion, and the three children then lived in his \u201cantique store,\u201d where the living conditions were deplorable, with no heat or running water.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The mother\u2019s companion subjected all three children to repeated and brutal physical abuse, including beating them with a baseball bat, and punching and kicking them in the face. Two examples will suffice. The companion taped Gregory\u2019s arms behind his back, taped his mouth shut, and glued his eyes shut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>with fingernail polish. On another occasion, he placed Gregory in a tub of cold water for more than two hours, then poured ammonia over him, placed him on a stool where he fell asleep, and did nothing to protect him as he fell off the stool and hit his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">There was substantial evidence that the mother neglected her children. She was aware of the scope and duration of the abuse being inflicted by her companion, but neither protected her children nor sought medical treatment when it was necessary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The children wore dirty clothes, and their teeth were in \u201cdreadful condition.\u201d The mother seemed unconcerned that Nancy and Willow missed many days of school. Gregory could not attend kindergarten because she failed to have him immunized. When first placed in foster care, they ate ravenously with their hands and hoarded food.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Each of the children suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder as a result of their prolonged exposure to neglect and emotional and physical abuse. The judge found that the children displayed other symptoms of serious deprivation, and suffer in varying degrees from a variety of psychological disorders including low self-esteem, depression, emotional numbing, and inability to sleep. All three receive therapy on a weekly basis and will need therapy for an extended period.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The judge also found that the mother failed to avail herself of a range of therapeutic programs offered to her by the department, including drug and alcohol abuse treatment programs, parenting skills programs, individual and couple\u2019s therapy, battered women\u2019s treatment programs, and domestic violence programs. After the children were removed from her care, she did not visit them for eight months, and the judge found that she recognized little responsibility for their plight. In February, 1998, the mother ended her relationship with the companion. Shortly afterward she began living with another man, who also has a history of violent behavior, including abuse of children. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>She was living with him at the time of trial, and testified that she would bring the children to live with him if they were returned to her custody. On the basis of this compelling evidence, the judge determined that the children would be at risk of a substantial danger of abuse if they were returned to the mother\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The judge also made careful findings of fact concerning the father. In 1993, the father moved from Arizona to Oklahoma and subsequently was divorced from the children\u2019s mother. He remarried there in 1995. As of 1999, the father was employed full-time and living with his new wife and their daughter in appropriate housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">For years, the father had no contact with his children. He became aware that his children, were in foster care in Massachusetts when his brother informed him that he had by chance met one of the children in a Massachusetts restaurant. The judge found that the father, with little effort, could have learned of his children\u2019s difficulties. The father returned to Massachusetts and appeared in court in October, 1998. He later \u201creintroduced\u201d himself to his children by writing to them and visiting them on two occasions under the department\u2019s supervision. The father was a victim of sexual abuse as a child. The judge found that he had not adequately addressed his history through treatment. He also has a long history of substance abuse and a criminal record, related mostly to drug activity. The judge nevertheless determined that by 1999 the father had \u201cbrought some stability to his life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">The mother challenges on statutory and constitutional grounds the authority of the judge to terminate her parental rights where the judge did not simultaneously terminate the parental rights of the biological father. We consider her statutory challenges first.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>The essence of her argument is that the judge was without authority under either the care and protection statute, G. L. c. 119, or the adoption statute, G. L. c. 210, to terminate only one parent\u2019s rights. There was no plan for an adoption for the two younger children, Willow and Gregory, she argues. Rather, the department\u2019s plan was reunification with their father. In such circumstances, she claims, proceeding with termination violated the legislative policies of the Commonwealth not to sever family ties where placement of a child with a family member is a viable option.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">We address preliminarily the mother\u2019s claim that the department \u201cmisrepresented\u201d that its goal was the adoption of Willow and Gregory, that the real goal for them was reunification with their father, and that the judge was \u201cwell aware\u201d of that goal. The record does not support her claims. The service plans for Willow and Gregory identified adoption as the goal. On the other hand, a department social worker testified that the department\u2019s goal for the father was reunification and that it was \u201cpossible\u201d for the department to continue working with him and to consider placement of Willow and Gregory with him in the future. Questioned by the judge, the social worker clarified the relationship of the different plans: the service plan for the father was in place \u201cin case [the adoption] does not go through.\u201d He further explained that following the father\u2019s \u201crenewed involvement\u201d and \u201csince his petition for full custody, we have to maintain a goal to reunify the family until we\u2019ve proven otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">When the father finally appeared, it was appropriate for the department to explore whether he could assume custody of his children. See 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.02 (1993) (department shall direct its efforts toward reunification of children with their parent). But because it was unclear, at best, whether the father was capable of doing so, the department appropriately continued to move forward with the adoption plans by attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>\u201cconcurrently identify, recruit, process and approve . . . qualified faxnil[ies] for adoption\u201d of the children. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26 (4). G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 (b). The judge was informed of the interstate compact report recommending against placement of the children with their father in Oklahoma. In light of that report, the department was prohibited at that time from placing the children with their father. See St. 1963, c. 452, \u00a7 1, art. III <em>(d) </em>(child shall not be sent to receiving State until it notifies sending State that proposed placement is not contrary to child\u2019s best interests). See also <em>Adoption of Warren, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 620, 624 (1998). The judge was fully warranted in proceeding with the termination proceeding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Turning now to the statutory claims, we conclude that the decree in this case terminating only the mother\u2019s parental rights is not precluded by and is consistent with the core purpose of the care and protection statute, G. L. c. 119, and the adoption statute, G. L. c. 210: the advancement of the best interests of the children. See <em>Adoption of Tammy, </em>416 Mass. 205, 210 (1993), and cases cited. See also G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 1 (purpose of statute is to ensure that children are \u201cprotected against the harmful effects resulting from the absence, inability, inadequacy or destructive behavior of parents\u201d and to assure good substitute parental care in the event of the inability or unfitness of parents \u201cto provide care and protection for their children\u201d). The Legislature has mandated that a judge may not terminate parental rights unless there is a finding that a parent is currently unfit and that the termination of those rights would be in the child\u2019s best interests. G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3. The \u201cfocus of [a termination] proceeding is not whether the parent should be deprived of \u2018custody\u2019 in order to safeguard the child\u2019s well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>being, but rather whether \u2018it would be in the best interests of the child for all legal relations [with the parent] to be ended.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adoption of Helen, </em>429 Mass. 856, 863 (1999), quoting <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>392 Mass. 738, 741 (1984). See <em>Adoption of Carlos, </em>413 Mass. 339, 350 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The judge complied with the statutory mandate in all respects. He found the mother unfit and terminated her parental rights based on overwhelming evidence that it was in the best interests of the children to do so: the mother severely neglected her children, and failed to protect them from unconscionable abuse inflicted on them by her companion. She failed to maintain significant and meaningful contact with them when they were placed in the department\u2019s care, failed to utilize services offered by the department, and failed to accept responsibility for the trauma the children had suffered. The mother has not been able to deal with her long history of domestic violence from various abusive partners. At the time of trial, she had entered into another abusive relationship and the judge found that the children would be at considerable risk from that relationship. The judge pointed to the fact that he sought not to punish the mother but to protect her endangered children. See <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 591-592 (1981). He drew attention to the positive development of the children since they had been removed from the mother\u2019s care, and the profound risk to them if they are returned to her care.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">We do not agree with the mother that the legislative scheme authorizes only an order terminating the parental rights of both parents. General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 26, and G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, have recently been amended to extend a judge\u2019s authority to enter an order dispensing with the need for a parent\u2019s consent not only to a child\u2019s adoption, but to any legal proceeding affecting a child\u2019s custody, guardianship or other disposition. St. 1999, c. 6. St. 1998, c. 14. Prior to April, 1998, an order allowing a petition of the department such as the one at issue here terminated a parent\u2019s right of consent only with respect to the adoption of the child. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26 (4), as amended through St. 1997, c. 43, \u00a7 99. If, during the course of or after a trial to dispense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>with consent to adoption, the department\u2019s plan for a child changed from adoption, the department was required to file a separate petition. See <em>Adoption of Reid, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 338, 343 (1995) (separate petition required where department\u2019s goal changed from adoption to guardianship). As amended in 1998, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26 (4), and G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 <em>(b), </em>now provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-4\">\u201cThe entry of [an order to dispense with the need for consent of any person named in c. 210, \u00a7 2, to the adoption of a child] shall have the effect of terminating the rights of <em>a person </em>named [in the petition] to receive notice of or to consent to <em>any legal proceeding affecting the custody, guardianship, adoption or other disposition </em>of the child named [in the petition]\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">St. 1998, c. 14.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The amended statute thus provides a greater range of permanent placement options \u2014 custody, adoption, or other disposition \u2014 for children, and the department is no longer required to retry a parent\u2019s unfitness in the event a proposed plan for the child changes either during or after trial. G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In 1999, the Legislature further amended G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26 (4), to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">\u201c[A judge] may enter an order to dispense with the need for consent of <em>any person </em>named in [\u00a7 ] 2 of [c.] 210, to the adoption, custody, guardianship or other disposition of the child . . . upon a finding that the child is in need of care and protection pursuant to [\u00a7 26] and that the best interests of the child will be served by such an order\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">St. 1999, c. 6, \u00a7 1. The Legislature has thus provided that a judge may enter an order as to \u201cany person\u201d named in G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2, if the required conditions \u2014 unfitness and best interests \u2014 are met. Nothing in the statutory language suggests that such an order must extend to \u201call persons\u201d whose consent would otherwise be required under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2. We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>with the department that G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26 (4), and G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 <em>(b), </em>authorize the orders entered in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">We agree with the department that the termination of the mother\u2019s rights significantly eases the children\u2019s path to a stable placement. Stability in the life of a child is important, <em>Adoption of Hugo, </em>428 Mass. 219, 228-229 (1998), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Hugo P. </em>v. <em>George P., </em>526 U.S. 1034 (1999), particularly in a case such as this, where the children are exceptionally vulnerable due to a history of extreme neglect and abuse. The judge appropriately recognized that severing all legal relations between the mother and the children, including her right to visit, communicate, or have any contact with them, see <em>Adoption of Helen, </em>429 Mass. 856, 863 (1999), is a critical step in promoting stability in their lives. It is not in their best interests to allow their mother \u201cto interfere with the child[ren], initiate multiple, repetitious litigation, and hinder and delay the eventual adoption of the child[ren] into a fit environment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 862.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Many twists and turns arise in the lives of children who are the subject of these proceedings, proceedings that are often lengthy. See, e.g., <em>Adoption of Hugo, supra. </em>The Legislature surely did not contemplate that whenever there is a change in circumstances and a new option arises, as happened here, the department is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>required to return to square one and relitigate the rights of an unfit parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The mother responds that she will not have the opportunity to interfere with the placement of the children in a stable home because they have already gone to live with their father, thus foreclosing the need for future permanency hearings pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 29B. We disagree. The possibility of permanent placement of the two younger children with their father does not necessarily foreclose the need for such a hearing. The termination of the biological mother\u2019s parental rights leaves open the possibility of adoption of the two younger children by their stepmother, if the children remain permanently with their father. Alternatively, it may become necessary for the department to seek to terminate his parental rights at some future time. Or, as happened with the eldest child, the father may consent to an adoption if the department located a suitable placement for either or both of the children. Under any scenario, their transitions to permanent homes will be expedited if the mother, adjudicated unfit, no longer has the right to participate in the placement process.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The mother\u2019s final statutory argument asserts that the judge\u2019s order violated the Commonwealth\u2019s policy of \u201cprotecting a family\u2019s integrity\u201d before initiating proceedings to terminate parental rights. Pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the department\u2019s regulations,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> she claims that the State may not intervene in a \u201cfamily\u201d to terminate one parent\u2019s rights, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>there remains a possibility that the children may be placed in the custody of the other parent or another family relative. While we recognize that strengthening a family remains an important objective, in the circumstances of this case, the mother, the father, and the children no longer constitute a single \u201cfamily\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 1. After their divorce, the mother and the father had little, if any, contact, and the father had no contact with his children until termination proceedings were initiated. The department could not, and was not obliged, to \u201cstrengthen\u201d a family that no longer existed. By offering numerous services to the mother, and by attempting to reunify her with her children, the department fulfilled its obligation to make \u201cevery effort to strengthen and encourage\u201d her bonds with her children before it sought to sever her legal rights. <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>376 Mass. 252, 266 (1978). Thereafter, the judge properly determined that she was unfit to parent her children, and that it was in the children\u2019s best interests to free them for adoption or other disposition without her involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Once the father was located, the department separately fulfilled its mandate to him by seeking to determine whether he was fit to assume his parental responsibilities, albeit at some future date. The judge concluded that the father was presently unfit to assume responsibility of his children. But he also found, unchallenged by the mother, that there was insufficient evidence at trial to support a finding that it was in the children\u2019s best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>interests to terminate the father\u2019s parental rights. See <em>Adoption of Carlos, </em>413 Mass. 339, 350-351 (1992). His decision to consider the best interests of the children in regard to each parent separately did not contravene any statute and was not at variance with any public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The mother asserts that, where the State\u2019s real goal for the two younger children was reunification with their father, the termination of her parental rights contravened the fundamental right to family integrity and violated her State (art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights) and Federal (Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution) constitutional rights to care for and manage her children without State intervention. The State has no compelling interest in intervening to terminate one parent\u2019s right to consent to adoption, she claims, where the second biological parent is currently fit or \u201csoon to be fit\u201d and the State\u2019s goal is to reunify the children with that parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">A parent\u2019s relationship with her children is constitutionally protected, but is not immune from State intervention. See, e.g., <em>Care &amp; Protection of Robert, </em>408 Mass. 52, 60 (1990); <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 617 (1986), and cases cited. The rights of a child to a stable and safe environment \u201cassume an importance at least equal\u201d to a parent\u2019s constitutional interests. <em>Id. </em>Where, as here, there is compelling evidence that the mother has neglected her children and is unfit to raise them, the State in its parens patriae capacity may act in the best interests of the children by severing the parent-child relationship without infringing the parent\u2019s constitutional rights. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Robert, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">We see nothing to support the mother\u2019s contention that the termination of her parental rights was in effect a resolution of a custody determination between the mother and the father.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The focus of the judge\u2019s determination was on the best interests of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the children, and their protection from the neglectful conduct of their mother, particularly in the context of the abusive relationship to which she subjected them. The State\u2019s authority to act in the best interests of children is not curtailed because a judge concludes that a child needs protection from one parent, rather than both.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The mother argues that the judge committed an error of law and deprived her of her State (arts. 10 and 12 of the Declaration of Rights) and Federal (Fourteenth Amendment) due process rights because he made no findings as to whether it was in the best interests of the children to permit Willow and Gregory to move to Oklahoma, permanently separating them geographically from their older sibling Nancy, and from their birth mother. Because the judge approved the adoption plan for Nancy and was \u201cwell aware\u201d that the department\u2019s goal was to reunite Willow and Gregory with their father in Oklahoma, she argues, such specific findings were mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The argument fails for two reasons. First, it is waived: she failed to argue at trial that the separation of the children would not be in their best interests, and it was abundantly clear that the department was recommending separate placements for the children. See <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. 705, 712 (1993). We nevertheless note that the judge\u2019s findings adequately took into account the issue of sibling separation. As a general matter, it may be preferable that siblings be raised together. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Three Minors, </em>392 Mass. 704, 715 (1984), and cases cited. See also G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26 (5). However, the weight to be accorded sibling relations in the application of the best interests standard mandated by G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, \u201cwill vary with the circumstances.\u201d See <em>Adoption of Hugo, </em>428 Mass. 219, 231 (1998), quoting <em>Petition of the New England Home for Little Wanderers to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, 367 </em>Mass. 631, 644 (1975). Here the judge was confronted with the placement of three extremely disturbed children. While an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>explicit finding as to whether Nancy\u2019s separation from her siblings would have been appropriate, the judge\u2019s findings strongly indicate (and the evidence supports) that her foster placement had been and would continue to be in her best interests despite the placement of her younger sister and brother in another home.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">To the extent it was unanticipated by the mother that the consequence of the judge\u2019s order would result in the geographic separation of the children, the judge was not required to make a specific finding as to the effect on Gregory and Willow of a placement in Oklahoma. In light of the introduction in evidence of the interstate compact report and the judge\u2019s conclusion that the father\u2019s unfitness to assume parental responsibility would continue into the indefinite future, the issue whether a permanent, geographically distant, separation from Nancy or their mother would be in Willow\u2019s and Gregory\u2019s best interests was not before him. See note 8, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">We turn finally to the mother\u2019s assertion that the evidence of an adoption plan was insufficient to support the termination order. The department\u2019s goal at trial for all three children was adoption. Where the department files a petition to dispense with a parent\u2019s consent to adoption, it must \u201cconcurrently identify, recruit, process and approve a qualified family for adoption.\u201d G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 <em>(b). </em>See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26 (4). The judge is required to \u201cconsider the plan proposed by the department or other agency initiating the petition\u201d as part of its assessment whether termination of the parent\u2019s rights would be in the children\u2019s best interests. G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 (c). The adoption plan need not be fully developed to support a termination order; it need only provide sufficient information about the prospective adoptive placement \u201cso that the judge may properly evaluate the suitability of the department\u2019s proposal.\u201d <em>Adoption of Vito, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>431 Mass. 550, 568 n.28 (2000), quoting <em>Care and Protection of Three Minors, </em>392 Mass. 704, 714 (1984). See <em>Adoption of Paula, </em>420 Mass. 716, 722-723 n.7 (1995). See also G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 <em>(b) </em>(department authorized to commence termination proceeding \u201cindependent of a petition for adoption\u201d); <em>Care &amp; Protection of Valerie, </em>403 Mass. 317, 319 (1988) (plan not required to identify prospective adoptive parents). In this case, the plans submitted by the department, in combination with the overwhelming evidence presented at trial concerning the mother\u2019s unfitness and the children\u2019s best interests, were \u201csufficiently specific and detailed\u201d to support the termination of the mother\u2019s parental rights. <em>Care &amp; Protection of Three Minors, supra </em>at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">\n<em>Decrees affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b649-10\">On appeal, the mother does not challenge the termination order with respect to her oldest child, Nancy, now thirteen years old. The mother, the father, and the Department of Social Services (department) all agree that Nancy should remain with, and be adopted by, her current foster family. The judge made a finding to that effect. Following the trial, the father voluntarily relinquished his parental rights with respect to Nancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children provides that the department may not send children in its custody to another State until the appropriate public authorities in the receiving State notify the department in writing that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of children. See St. 1963, c. 452, \u00a7 1. An interstate home study conducted pursuant to that provision involves interviews with the potential caretakers, reference checks, criminal record checks, and a physical inspection of the home. The department\u2019s regulations provide that the provisions of the interstate compact apply to the placements of children in State custody with their parents in another State. 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.507 (4) (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\">General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 29B, first par., as appearing in St. 1999, c. 3, \u00a7 12, provides in pertinent part: \u201cExcept as provided herein, within 12 months of the original commitment, grant of custody or transfer of responsibility of a child to the department by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not less frequently than every 12 months thereafter while the child remains in the care of the department, the committing court shall conduct a permanency hearing, in accordance with rules established by the chief justice for administration and management, to determine and periodically review thereafter the permanency plan for the child.

As a general matter, \u201cissues not raised by a losing party in the trial court are not addressed on appeal, absent exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. 705, 712 (1993), citing <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>392 Mass. 696, 697 (1984).
