G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal he claims that the judge improperly denied his motion for a required finding of not guilty, arguing that (1) his language and conduct were not \u201cdisorderly\u201d; (2) as applied, the annoying or accosting provision of \u00a7 53 criminalizes his speech in violation of his rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 77 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution; and (3) as applied, the provision violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights because it punishes only those who accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion and affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">1. <em>Facts. </em>In October, 1997, the defendant, then eighteen years old, produced a number of \u201cmissing person\u201d flyers identifying and describing a young woman he had dated for approximately three weeks. The young woman, a high school student, \u201chad broken up\u201d with the defendant some weeks before. Determined to \u201cget back\u201d at her, the defendant sneaked into her school one night and hung several flyers at various locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The word \u201cMISSING\u201d is printed in large type across the top of the flyer beneath which is the young woman\u2019s name; a large photograph of her fills the right-hand comer of the flyer. Her \u201cRace\u201d is listed as \u201cWhite Slut.\u201d The description of the victim includes the following statements: \u201cWill respond to: \u2018Cum to daddy, Urin;\u2019 Favorite Song: \u2018Put it in the mouth\u2019; Favorite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>drink: protein rich semen; . . . Most recent employer: BJs Wholesale Club; . . . Other distinguishing characteristics: Has a nipple ring; Extremely loose; Has trouble sitting down because of numerous penetrations; Ass itches &amp; bleeds violently; . . . Gets passed around (sometimes for free) like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d The victim\u2019s guidance counsellor was so concerned that the police were contacted when the flyer was brought to her attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The defendant did not contest the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence that he made or hung the flyers. The victim testified that she was very upset by the language on the flyer, and felt violated by its display at her school. She was also afraid, as the defendant had threatened to hit her at least once during their brief relationship and he had telephoned her in anger about the breakup a few weeks before he posted the flyers. After the incident the victim suffered from nightmares in which the defendant chased her with a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">2. <em>Disorderly acts or language. </em>The defendant argues that neither his acts nor his language was disorderly within the meaning of the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Section 53 can be traced to colonial and provincial acts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diamond, </em>248 Mass. 511, 514-517 (1924). The provision as to accosting or annoying was added to Rev. L. c. 212, \u00a7 46 (1902), when it was rewritten in 1914. St. 1914, c. 743. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lombard, </em>321 Mass. 294, 295 (1947). The <em>Lombard </em>case is the only decision that has construed this provision. In that case the court held that \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cdisorderly\u201d were separate and distinct elements of the crime, both of which had to be pleaded and proved, but the case did not provide an opportunity to define either term. <em>Id. </em>at 296. In <em>Alegata </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 287 (1967), we engrafted the Model Penal Code definition of \u201cdisorderly\u201d onto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the separate \u00a7 53 offense of being an idle and disorderly person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 304. Model Penal Code \u00a7 250.2 (Proposed Official Draft 1962). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 581, 599 (1975), again construing the disorderly person provision, we limited the adopted portion of the Model Penal Code definition to \u00a7 250.2(l)(a) and (c), because \u00a7 250.2(l)(b) suffered from the same constitutional infirmities as similar disorderly conduct statutes held to be facially overbroad in the Supreme Court\u2019s then recent First Amendment decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 593. By virtue of the prefatory language of the definition of \u201cdisorderly\u201d in the Model Penal Code, a prosecution under the disorderly person provision also requires that the conduct have a public element or impact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 596. The resulting definition of \u201cdisorderly\u201d for purposes of the disorderly person provision of \u00a7 53 includes only those individuals who, \u201cwith purpose to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof . . . : (a) engage[] in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior; or . . . (c) created a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which serves no legitimate purpose of the actor.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. 721, 727 n.7 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>369 Mass. 443, 446 &amp; n.2 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, supra, </em>did not present the question, nor did we discuss, whether the word \u201cdisorderly\u201d should have the same meaning in both the disorderly person and the accosting and annoying provisions of \u00a7 53. Where, as here, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>various and sundry crimes under a single statute are as different as they are similar, we look to the same source to construe the same word but tailor the construction to fit the particular crime charged, ever mindful of ordinary usage and legislative purpose. See <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). Cf. <em>Arlington Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Communities &amp; Dev., </em>409 Mass. 354, 359 (1991) (concluding that, while same word may have same meaning, scope of its operation may differ in different parts of statute). ,</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Whereas disorderly conduct under the disorderly person provision must have a public impact, the crime of accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex evinces a legislative intent to criminalize offensive and disorderly conduct or language that has a personal and private, rather than a necessarily public, impact. This reading is supported by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lombard, supra </em>at 295-296, in which we held that a 1943 amendment to the provision striking the phrase \u201cin public places\u201d indicated a clear legislative intent that it apply even to \u201c[an] offence . . . committed . . . within the walls of a private residence.\u201d Cf. G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 14A (\u201cWhoever telephones another person ... for the sole purpose of harassing, annoying or molesting such person or his family . . .\u201d). A wholesale en-grafting of the limiting prefatory language of the Model Penal Code\u2019s definition of \u201cdisorderly\u201d onto the accosting or annoying provision would not square with either the holding in the <em>Lombard </em>decision or the express elements of the crime of accosting or annoying. We therefore hold that, for purposes of this \u00a7 53 offense, \u201cdisorderly\u201d acts or language are those that involve fighting or threatening, violent or tumultuous behavior, or that create a hazardous or physically offensive condition for no legitimate purpose of the actor, whether the resulting harm is suffered in public by the public or in private by an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Applying our definition, we do not perceive any fighting, or violent or tumultuous behavior, in the flyer\u2019s unaltered photograph and sexualized description of the victim, nor in the defendant\u2019s conduct in creating or hanging the flyer at the school during the night. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, supra </em>at 729; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, supra </em>at 597. We also conclude that neither the flyer\u2019s content nor the defendant\u2019s conduct in creating or hanging the flyer could have been found to create a hazardous or physically offensive condition as our courts have construed those terms. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feigenbaum, su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>pra </em>at 475 (blocking tow truck and disregarding police warnings to move \u201ccreated a hazardous condition\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LePore, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 543, 548 (1996) (voyeurism \u201ccreated a physically offensive condition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">This case turns, then, on whether the content of the flyer may be characterized as threatening. Sexually explicit language, when directed at particular individuals in settings in which such communications are inappropriate and likely to cause severe distress, may be inherently threatening. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robicheau, </em>421 Mass. 176, 183 (1995) (offensive speech in context of violating protective order under G. L. c. 209A \u201cplaced the victim in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious physical harm [and therefore] is equivalent to the crime of assault\u201d). A sexually explicit poem written by a male prisoner and handed to a female staff member was held to be a threat where the inmate had, prior to the incident, indicated in clear language and behavior that he found her attractive and wanted to see her once he was paroled. <em>Gomes </em>v. Fair, 738 F.2d 517, 524, 526-527 (1st Cir. 1984) (\u201csexual proposition need not ripen into a physical assault before prison officials can take steps\u201d). We recognize the heightened deference granted to prison administrators on matters of prison security and do not suggest that the standards for evaluating sexually charged language in such a case be extended beyond the prison walls. However, we are persuaded that that court\u2019s conclusions regarding the reasonableness of acknowledging and responding to threats inherent in certain sexually explicit communications are consistent with decisions by other courts confronted with similar materials in nonprison contexts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>385 Mass. 521, 525, 526 (1982) (threat to circulate photograph of semi-clad young woman and expose information about her sexual activities constituted \u201cmalicious threat\u201d to injure young woman\u2019s person under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Moreover, language properly may be understood and treated as a threat even in the absence of an explicit statement of an intention to harm the victim as long as circumstances support the victim\u2019s fearful or apprehensive response. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fulmer, </em>108 F.3d 1486, 1492 (1st Cir. 1997); <em>Gomes </em>v. <em>Fair, supra; Planned Parenthood of the Columbia/Willamette, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Coalition of Life Activists, </em>23 F. Supp. 2d 1182, 1194 (D. Or. 1998) (whether \u201cstatement [is] innocent or threatening must be determined from the context in which it was made\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Justice Marshall wrote that it is the intent to threaten rather than the intent to carry out the threat that is dispositive. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>422 U.S. 35, 46-47 (1975) (Marshall, J., concurring). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kelner, </em>534 F.2d 1020, 1025 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 429 U.S. 1022 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We are persuaded that sexually explicit and aggressive language directed at and received<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by an identified victim may be threatening, notwithstanding the lack of evidence that the threat will be immediately followed by actual violence or the use of physical force. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Milo M., ante </em>149 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ditsch, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 1005, 1005 (1985) (absence of immediate or personal ability to carry out threat does not preclude conviction under G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2, of having made \u201cthreats of bodily harm\u201d where defendant was behind bars when he mailed threat to victim). Here, the sexually charged language appeared in a poster identifying the victim as \u201cmissing.\u201d Objectively, a reasonable person could, as the victim and her guidance counsellor did, legitimately fear that the flyer was a veiled threat that the named victim would indeed become a \u201cmissing person\u201d or that some sexually violent harm would befall her, particularly where the defendant had threatened to hit her during their brief relationship, and telephoned her to express his anger about their breakup. In addition, the fact that the defendant sneaked into her school at night in order to post the flyers could have greatly contributed to the victim\u2019s fear by eroding her reasonable expectation of safety at school. The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the defendant\u2019s language was threatening and therefore disorderly under the accosting or annoying provision of \u00a7 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">3. <em>First Amendment. </em>The defendant next argues that our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, supra, </em>compels the conclusion that his language cannot be the basis of a conviction under the accosting or annoying provision of \u00a7 53 without violating the First Amendment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The defendant in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, supra </em>at 599, challenged the disorderly person provision of \u00a7 53 as unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, and in that context we construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the provision to reach only conduct that involved \u201cno lawful exercise of a First Amendment right.\u201d In our view at that time, Model Penal Code \u00a7 250.2(l)(b), which permitted charges to be brought against any individual for the use of offensive and abusive language, was \u201csusceptible of application to protected expression\u201d and, therefore, facially overbroad. <em>Id. </em>at 592, citing <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 523 (1972). As noted above, we therefore limited the Model Penal Code definition of disorderly, engrafted onto the disorderly person provision by <em>Alegata </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 287 (1967), to subsections (a) and (c) which, inter alia, include \u201cfighting or threatening.\u201d There was, however, no allegation in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, supra, </em>that the defendant had made any threats. Therefore, notwithstanding dicta to the contrary, we clarify today that threats may serve as the basis of a conviction under the accosting or annoying provision of \u00a7 53. See <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 572, 573 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The regulation of threatening speech has been held not to violate the First Amendment where the speech harasses or is a \u201ctrue threat.\u201d Such speech is unprotected: its purpose is to cause injury rather than to add to, or to comment on, the public discourse. Courts have, for the most part, been able readily to distinguish between those categories of language involving threats and harassment that may be subject to sanctions and those that may not. See, e.g., <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>388 Mass. 443, 450 (1983) (government could prosecute individual whose repeated calls and complaints to town officials at their homes constituted actionable harassment because it \u201cinfnnge[d] on the legitimate rights of other citizens\u201d); <em>Planned Parenthood of the Columbia/Willamette, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Coalition of Life Activists, supra </em>at 1188 (notwithstanding political dimension of expressing views on abortion, veiled threats against abortion providers not entitled to First Amendment protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The term \u201ctrue threat\u201d has been adopted to help distinguish between words that literally threaten but have an expressive purpose such as political hyperbole, and words that are intended to place the target of the threat in fear, whether the threat is veiled or explicit. Compare <em>Watts </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 705, 706, 708 (1969) (per curiam) (statement at political rally that, if inducted into Army and made to carry rifle, \u201cthe first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.,\u201d was, given its conditional nature and context in which it was made, political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>hyperbole and, therefore, not \u201ctrue threat\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871 [a]), with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fulmer, </em>108 F.3d 1486, 1490, 1492 (1st Cir. 1997) (voicemail message to Federal agent that \u201c[t]he silver bullets are coming. . . . Enjoy the intriguing unraveling of what I said to you\u201d was, given defendant\u2019s history of threats against the agent, reasonably understood as a \u201ctrue threat\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875[c]). The defendant\u2019s language had no expressive purpose but was, instead, intended to \u201cget back\u201d at the victim by placing her in fear that she might suffer some sexual harm or wind up among the \u201cmissing.\u201d Because his language was a true threat, it could, consistent with the First Amendment, support a conviction under the accosting and annoying provision of \u00a7 53. See <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 46-47 (Marshall, J., concurring). Our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, supra, </em>does not hold otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">4. <em>Equal protection. </em>The defendant next argues that the statute as applied violates the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution and art. 1 of the Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, the \u201cequal rights amendment.\u201d He claims that the statute is underinclusive because it does not punish offensive and disorderly acts or language that accost or annoy persons of the same sex as the perpetrator. The statute does not apply unless the perpetrator crosses the gender line to reach his or her victim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The Commonwealth, in turn, argues that the defendant\u2019s argument is actually a facial challenge to the statute that should have been made in a pretrial motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 13 (c), 378 Mass. 871 (1979), rather than in his motion for a required finding of not guilty. But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davie, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 27 n.6 (1998). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>An \u201cas applied\u201d challenge on the basis of equal protection or the equal rights amendment is a challenge to the unequal enforcement of an otherwise valid statute against a protected class of persons. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 17-22 (1977). Because the statute, by its terms, can be enforced only across gender lines, the defendant\u2019s challenge is necessarily to the validity of the statute itself. It is, therefore, a facial challenge that should have been made in a pretrial motion to dismiss. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 13 (c). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jasmin, </em>396 Mass. 653, 655 (1986) (\u201cIt may be that, pursuant to rule 13[c], an argument based on the facial invalidity of a criminal statute should be presented by a pretrial motion\u201d); <em>Lydon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 356, 367, cert, denied, 449 U.S. 1065 (1980) (valid double jeopardy claim \u201cshould be dealt with before . . . trial\u201d). The issue has not been preserved for full appellate review, but we consider it under the standard of a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>407 Mass. 92, 94-95 (1990) (failure to raise as applied challenge to statute\u2019s constitutionality in motion for required finding of not guilty will be reviewed under substantial risk of miscarriage of justice standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">If a statute is unconstitutional because of underinclusion, a court may either declare the entire statute void, or extend its coverage to those formerly excluded. See <em>Califano </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>443 U.S. 76, 89 (1979); <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>United States, </em>398 U.S. 333, 361 (1970) (Harlan, 1, concurring). As to the second alternative, \u201cwhere a statutory provision is unconstitutional, if it is in its nature separable from the other parts of the statute, so that they may well stand independently of it, and if there is no such connection between the valid and the invalid parts that the Legislature would not be expected to enact the valid part without the other, the statute will be held good, except in that part which is in conflict with the Constitution.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Petranich, </em>183 Mass. 217, 220 (1903). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>390 U.S. 570, 585 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Had the defendant succeeded in a facial attack, a point we need not decide, the provision that he claims offends the equal protection clause and the Massachusetts equal rights amendment could have been struck without sacrificing the integrity and purpose of the statute. See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Eleventh (\u201cThe provisions of any statute shall be deemed severable . . .\u201d). The surviving portion of the accost or annoy provision of \u00a7 53 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>would permit criminal convictions of \u201cpersons who with offensive and disorderly acts or language accost or annoy persons,\u201d and thus would preserve the legislative intent to punish both men and women for offenses committed against either men or women. Because the surviving statute would have reached the conduct proved here, the defendant would not have benefited from such a ruling. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s conviction may be affirmed without offending due process. He had \u201cfair warning at the time of his conduct that such conduct was . . . criminal\u201d under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. <em>People </em>v. <em>Liberta, </em>64 N.Y.2d 152, 173 (1984), cert, denied, 471 U.S. 1020 (1985). See, e.g., <em>Ex parte Tullos, </em>541 S.W.2d 167, 170 (Tex. Grim. App. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-9\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 53, states: \u201cCommon night walkers, common street walkers, both male and female, common railers and brawlers, <em>persons who with offensive and disorderly acts or language accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex, </em>lewd, wanton and lascivious persons in speech or behavior, idle and disorderly persons, disturbers of the peace, keepers of noisy and disorderly houses, and persons guilty of indecent exposure may be punished by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not more than six months, or by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b243-7\">We note at the outset that G.
