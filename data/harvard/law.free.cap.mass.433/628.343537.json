The division of medical assistance (division) denied the application on the ground that Guemero held sufficient, available resources as a beneficiary of the principal of a self-settled trust. Guemero filed a complaint in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, challenging the division\u2019s inclusion of the trust principal as a basis for denying her benefits. Relying on an amendment to the Medicaid statute enacted by Congress in 1993, a Superior Court judge reversed the division\u2019s decision. We granted the division\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court but on grounds different than those on which the trial judge relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>1. <em>Background. </em>On June 18, 1987, Jeannette Guerriero (Guerriero) established the Guerriero Family Trust (trust), an irrevocable, inter vivos trust, naming Guerriero and her living issue as beneficiaries. Article IV of the trust provides the trustee with the discretion to pay income or principal of the trust to \u201cthe SETTLOR,\u201d Guerriero, or her then living issue as the trustee \u201cdeems necessary or advisable.\u201d Article XX of the trust provides that \u201cthe SETTLOR does not reserve any right to alter, amend, revoke or terminate this Trust in whole or in part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">On February 4, 1991, Guerriero signed a notarized document entitled \u201cWaiver of Jeannette L. Guerriero,\u201d in which she declared that she did \u201cirrevocably and unequivocably [szc] waive, renounce and refuse to accept any and all right, title or interest which [she] may have now or in the future in the principal of the \u2018Guerriero Family Trust.\u2019 \u201d Approximately seven years later, on May 15, 1998, Guerriero submitted an application for Medicaid benefits to the division. In evaluating Guerriero\u2019s application, the division counted the assets in the trust, which the division valued at $87,118. Because of the program limit of $2,000 for \u201ccountable assets,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the division determined that Guerriero was not eligible for Medicaid and denied Guerriero\u2019s application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Guerriero appealed to the division\u2019s board of hearings (board), which upheld the division\u2019s decision. Guerriero then filed the present action seeking review of the division\u2019s decision. Citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(d)(3)(B)(ii), as enacted in 1993, the Superior Court judge overturned the division decision, concluding that the division should have excluded the principal of the trust because Guerriero\u2019s waiver deprived the trustee of any discretion to pay trust principal to Guerriero.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">2. <em>Medicaid qualifying trusts. </em>As explained in the related case of <em>Lebow </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, ante </em>171, 172 (2001), Congress enacted 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(k)(l) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>deal with the emergence of Medicaid qualifying trusts (MQTs). Enacted in 1986, this section originally provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\">\u201cIn the case of a medicaid qualifying trust . . . the amounts from the trust deemed available to a grantor, for purposes of [determining Medicaid eligibility], is the maximum amount of payments that may be permitted under the terms of the trust to be distributed to the grantor, assuming the full exercise of discretion by the trustee or trustees for the distribution of the maximum amount to the grantor. For purposes of the previous sentence, the term \u2018grantor\u2019 means the individual referred to in paragraph (2).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(k)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">When this section was enacted, \u00a7 1396p(c)(l) of the Medicaid statute already provided a thirty-month look-back period for discovering transfers of assets for less than fair market value made in order to render the transferor eligible for Medicaid benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time Congress inserted \u00a7 1396a(k)(l) governing MQT\u2019s, the look-back period contained in \u00a7 1396p(c)(l) had been part of the Medicaid statute for approximately four years. Pub. L. 97-248, Title I, \u00a7 132(b), 96 Stat. 370 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">In 1993, Congress amended the Medicaid statute, repealing the entire provision of \u00a7 1396a(k) and replacing it with \u00a7 1396p(d). <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>423 Mass. 399, 405-406 &amp; n.13 (1996). With specific regard to irrevocable trusts, \u00a7 1396p(d)(3)(B) now excludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>\u201cany portion of the trust from which, or any income on the corpus from which, no payment could under any circumstances be made to the individual.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396p(d)(3)(B)(ii) (West Supp. 2000). The 1993 legislation also amended the look-back period in \u00a7 1396p(c), by lengthening the look-back period to thirty-six months and creating a longer, trust-specific look-back period of sixty months. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396p(c)(B)(i) (West Supp. 2000). The 1993 amendments apply only to trusts created after the effective date of the statute. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, supra </em>at 406, citing Pub. L. 103-66, \u00a7 13611(e)(2)(C), 107 Stat. 627 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Relying on the amended portions of the statute, specifically \u00a7 1396p(d)(3)(B)(ii), the Superior Court judge ruled that the assets of the trust could not be counted in determining Medicaid eligibility because after the \u201cirrevocable waiver\u201d was executed by Guerriero, \u201cno payment could under any circumstances be made to the individual.\u201d The judge\u2019s reliance on this section was in error because the amended statutory section applies only prospectively, and the trust was established in June, 1987, almost six years prior to the amendment\u2019s enactment. Thus, the trust is subject to review under the earlier 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(k) (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">3. <em>Counting Assets Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(k). </em>As we explained in <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, supra </em>at 413:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">\u201c[An MQT] is any trust established by a person (or that person\u2019s spouse) under which that person may receive any payments. This general definition is qualified only by the requirement that the trustees must be permitted to exercise some discretion \u2014 that is, the conditions for distribution may not be completely fixed for all circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">If the trust qualifies as an MQT, we proceed under the statute to determine how much money is deemed available:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">\u201cThat amount is the greatest amount that the trustees in any set of circumstances might have discretion to pay out to the beneficiary. Thus, if there is a peppercorn of discretion, then whatever is the most the beneficiary might under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>any state of affairs receive in the full exercise of that discretion is the amount that is counted as available for Medicaid eligibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\"><em>Id. </em>Accordingly, in order to decide if the principal of the trust is \u201cavailable\u201d to Guerriero, we must determine whether the trustee maintained discretion to distribute principal to Guerriero under the terms of the trust after the execution of the \u201cirrevocable waiver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In a written trust, the nature and extent of a trustee\u2019s discretion as to any issue is defined by (1) the terms of the trust instrument and (2) in the absence of any provision in the terms of the trust, by the rules governing the duties and powers of the trustee. Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 164 (1959).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the trustee violates any duty to a beneficiary, the trustee will be liable for \u201cbreach of trust.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 201.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the question is whether the \u201cirrevocable waiver\u201d completely deprived the trustee of any discretion to distribute trust principal<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to Guerriero, evaluating the trustee\u2019s discretion in light of his duties imposed by the written trust instrument and his relationship to the parties of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Under trust principles, the beneficiary of a trust holds the right to transfer his interest absent a restraint on alienation. Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 132 (1959).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See A.W. Scott &amp; W.F. Fratcher, Trusts \u00a7 132 (4th ed. 1987). The trustee has a duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in the administration of the trust. Restatement (Second) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 174. See <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Flory, </em>294 Mass. 138, 142 (1936). \u201cIf the beneficiary transfers his interest and the trustee makes a payment or conveyance to the transferor-beneficiary when the trustee has notice of the transfer, the trustee is liable to the transferee.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 226 comment c, at 524-525. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 201 comment d, at 444 (cross referencing \u201cbreach of trust\u201d with \u201cliability of the trustee for payments . . . made to persons other than the beneficiary\u201d); <em>Security Bank of N.Y. </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>220 Mass. 84, 89 (1915). Cf. Restatement (Second) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 155 (2) (same rule for discretionary trusts).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">When Guerriero signed her \u201cirrevocable waiver,\u201d she effectively transferred her interest back to the trust for the benefit of the remaining beneficiaries. Once the trustee of the trust had knowledge of Guerriero\u2019s \u201cirrevocable waiver,\u201d the trustee was deprived of any legal discretion to pay trust principal to Guerriero. Restatement (Second) of Trusts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 210 comment d &amp; 226 comment c. See <em>Security Bank of N.Y. </em>v. <em>Callahan, supra </em>at 89.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, once the trustee had knowledge of the \u201cirrevocable waiver,\u201d under the terms of the trust instrument there were no remaining circumstances in which the trustee retained discretion to pay out principal to Guerriero because (1) the trust is irrevocable, (2) Guerriero waived any right to amend or alter the trust, and (3) the trust instrument does not give the trustee any power to modify the terms of the trust.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Although the amendments are not directly applicable because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>of the time period, they confirm our resolution of the matter. Any doubts about whether a MQT beneficiary could deprive a trustee of discretion to pay (and thereby dispose of) trust interests by means other than modification of the trust instrument <em>itself </em>were resolved by the enactment of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396p(d)(3)(B). This section excludes \u201cany portion of the trust from which, or any income on the corpus from which, no payment could under any circumstances be made to the individual.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396p(d)(3)(B)(ii) (West Supp. 2000). If the trust had been created after the enactment of the 1993 amendments, the \u201cirrevocable waiver\u201d undoubtably would have resulted in excluding the trust assets as the Superior Court concluded. <em>Id. </em>The fact that there was no provision in this statute prior to 1993 addressing such a disposal of trust assets does not mean that such a transfer was not a legitimate means of disposing of trust assets prior to that time.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The division contends that we should ignore Guerriero\u2019s \u201cirrevocable waiver\u201d because the trust instrument does not authorize Guerriero \u201cto relinquish her interest in the trust assets.\u201d This contention, however, ignores Gueniero\u2019s dual role as settlor and as beneficiary. Although Guerriero expressly waived her right as settlor to \u201calter, amend, revoke or terminate this Trust,\u201d as a <em>beneficiary </em>Guerriero had the right to transfer her interest absent a limitation in the trust instrument.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Guerriero\u2019s waiver of rights as a settlor did not waive her right to transfer her interest as a beneficiary. Accordingly, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>that Guerriero had the capacity to make a voluntary transfer of her equitable interest in the principal by irrevocably waiving that interest in favor of the remaining beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The division contends that Guerriero\u2019s \u201cirrevocable waiver\u201d should be disregarded because the waiver is a mere limitation on trustee discretion analogous to the limitations we reviewed in the <em>Cohen </em>case where we considered trust instruments with written provisions purporting to <em>limit </em>the trustee\u2019s discretion to make payments to an amount less than would disqualify the beneficiary for Medicaid benefits. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, supra </em>at 407. Although we concluded in <em>Cohen </em>the limitations on discretion should be disregarded, we noted that \u201c[i]t is true that a trust might be written to deprive the trustee of any discretion (for instance allowing the payment only of income) and that such a limitation would be respected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418. The present situation conforms to that observation because Guerriero\u2019s execution of the \u201cirrevocable waiver\u201d did not merely \u201climit\u201d the trustee\u2019s discretion, rather it deprived the tmstee of <em>any </em>legal discretion to pay Guerriero any part of the trust principal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Countable assets are \u201call assets that must be included in the determination of [Medicaid] eligibility.\u201d 130 Code Mass.
