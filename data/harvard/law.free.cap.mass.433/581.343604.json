L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, seeking to reform the Donald D. Walker Revocable Trust. They alleged that, due to a mistake, the trust as presently written fails to accomplish the settlor\u2019s goals. Because of the Federal tax implications discussed below, and because it is uncertain whether the Internal Revenue Service would abide by a decision on a matter of State law, such as this, other than a decision from the State\u2019s highest court, see <em>Loeser </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>412 Mass. 361, 362 (1992), a single justice reported the case to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">The plaintiffs are the trustees of the trust. The defendants are the presently identifiable beneficiaries of the trust and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (commissioner). As commonly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>happens when the commissioner is named as a defendant and served with process in a case such as this, he has chosen not to participate. <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>379 Mass. 506, 509 n.5 (1980). All of the other parties have stipulated to the relevant facts, and each of the defendants other than the commissioner has assented to the relief sought. A guardian ad litem has been appointed to represent the interests of any unborn or unascertained individuals; the guardian ad litem also has joined in the stipulation of facts and assented to the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Before proceeding to the merits, we pause briefly to observe that it is not only permissible, but also in keeping with this court\u2019s long-standing practice, for us to decide cases such as this despite the fact that they lack some of the usual adversary characteristics. This court has decided many of these \u201cuncontested\u201d cases, which call for interpretation or reformation of trust instruments under Massachusetts law, because the parties have represented that a decision from this court will facilitate their dealings with the Internal Revenue Service.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do so because we are mindful of the fact that the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal courts are not bound by decisions of lower State courts. See <em>Simches </em>v. <em>Simches, </em>423 Mass. 683, 686 n.8 (1996); <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Sandler, supra </em>at 509; <em>Persky </em>v. <em>Hutner, </em>369 Mass. 7, 8 (1975).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">We have decided cases like this not only when parties have been actively engaged in disputes with the Internal Revenue Service, but also, on occasion, when parties have sought deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>sions that would enable them to plan their estates correctly and to prepare effectively for future tax consequences. See <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>425 Mass. 770 (1997); <em>Simches </em>v. <em>Simches, </em>supra; <em>Shawmut Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>422 Mass. 706, 709-710 (1996), citing <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>361 Mass. 230, 233-234 (1972). However, we have declined to decide cases in inappropriate circumstances, such as where no question of State law and only a question of Federal law is presented. See <em>Kirchick </em>v. <em>Guerry, </em>429 Mass. 215 (1999). Because we are satisfied that the present case is appropriate for our consideration, we now proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>Donald D. Walker (Donald), settlor of the Donald D. Walker Revocable Trust, dated April 27, 1988, died on January 31, 1989. He was survived by his spouse, E. Virginia Walker (Virginia), and two children, Marcia B. Walker and Penelope B. Walker. The trust instrument identifies Donald and Virginia as the initial cotrustees, and they served in that capacity until Donald\u2019s death, at which time Virginia became the sole trustee. In accordance with the terms of the trust, Virginia subsequently appointed Rockland Trust Company to serve as cotrustee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trust was revocable during Donald\u2019s lifetime and became irrevocable on his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The trust instrument called for distribution of the trust property, on Donald\u2019s death, to one or more of three trusts: a general marital trust, a special marital trust, and a nonmarital deduction trust. Article III, paragraph A, which creates the general marital trust, Article HI, paragraph B, which creates the special marital trust, and Article IV, which sets forth various administrative provisions for the two marital trusts, expressly indicate that those trusts were intended and designed to provide Donald\u2019s estate with the maximum marital deductions permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>by law for purposes of Massachusetts and Federal estate taxes,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that they should be interpreted and administered accordingly. Under the terms of both marital trusts, Virginia is to receive net income generated from any property in those trusts during her lifetime. Under Article HI, paragraph C, entitled \u201cPayments of Principal from Marital Trusts,\u201d the trustees are also authorized to distribute to Virginia, during her lifetime, all or any portion of the principal of those trusts as they deem in their discretion to be advisable, and Virginia, as beneficiary, also has the power to demand all or any portion of the principal of the general marital trust during her lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In Article HI, paragraph A, Virginia is granted the power to appoint, in her own will, the principal of the general marital trust, as well as any income that has accrued but remains undistributed at the time of her death. Her power of appointment expressly includes the power to appoint general marital trust principal to her own estate. In Article HI, paragraph B, she is granted the power to appoint, in her will, special marital trust principal to one or more of Donald\u2019s issue and their spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Under the express terms of Article HI, paragraphs A and B, the general marital trust and the special marital trust were to be funded only to the extent necessary to eliminate (or minimize as far as possible) the Federal and Massachusetts estate taxes on Donald\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because of the size of Donald\u2019s estate, however, no estate taxes would have been due when he died, so no property from the Donald D. Walker Revocable Trust was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>distributed to either of the marital trusts. Those trusts went unfunded. Only the nonmarital deduction trust was funded. It received all of the trust property.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Under Article III, paragraph D, which creates the nonmarital deduction trust, Virginia is to receive, during her lifetime, the net income generated from the principal of that trust. On her death, the principal is to be paid to Donald\u2019s then living issue. Unlike the language in the marital trusts, the language creating the nonmarital deduction trust gives Virginia no right, as beneficiary, to appoint principal through her will. However, Article HI, paragraph F, entitled \u201cDiscretionary Power to Pay Principal,\u201d which applies to the nonmarital deduction trust, gives Virginia, in her capacity as trustee, unbridled discretion to pay principal from the nonmarital deduction trust to herself as beneficiary. As explained below, it is this language that the parties contend was mistakenly included in the trust document. Specifically, Article HI, paragraph F states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201cIn addition to the payments of income hereinabove provided, the Trustee is (or Trustees are) authorized at any time or from time to time to make or apply distributions or payments of principal of the trust property to or for the benefit of the Grantor\u2019s said spouse, E. Virginia Walker, in such portions or amounts, including the entire trust property, as the Trustee or Trustees may deem advisable. In making the discretionary payments or distributions of principal under this paragraph F, it is the Grantor\u2019s desire that the Trustee or Trustees exercise the power to make such payments or distributions in a liberal manner, and so may, but need not, take into account other resources available to said beneficiary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The inclusion of this provision giving Virginia, as trustee, the authority to make discretionary payments of principal to herself, as beneficiary, constitutes a general power of appointment within the meaning of I.R.C. \u00a7 2041 (b) (1) (1986). As a result, the property subject to the power, in other words all property in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>nonmarital deduction trust, will be includible in Virginia\u2019s gross estate at the time of her death, regardless whether she exercises the power. I.R.C. \u00a7 2041 (a) (2) (1986). The parties claim that this result is contrary to Donald\u2019s intent to have the nonmarital deduction trust property pass free of estate taxes in both his estate and Virginia\u2019s estate. To support their claim that Donald so intended, they rely on the structure and language of the trust instrument and on an affidavit from the attorney who drafted the instrument. That attorney, now retired, states in his affidavit as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">\u201c5. I do not recall specific discussions with Mr. Walker as to whether he intended the assets in the Non-marital Deduction Trust to pass free of estate taxes following Mrs. Walker\u2019s death. However, my practice was to draft Non-marital Deduction Trusts so that the assets of these trusts would pass free of estate taxes upon the deaths of both the donor and the donor\u2019s spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">\u201c6. My memory as to Mr. Walker\u2019s intentions has been aided by a review of the Walker Trust and correspondence from me to Mrs. Virginia Walker following Mr. Walker\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\u201c7. With the aid of these documents, it is my memory that Mr. Walker intended the assets in the Non-marital Deduction Trust to pass free of estate taxes upon Mrs. Walker\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">\u201c8. I believe that the relief which the plaintiffs request in the Complaint, including limiting Mrs. Walker\u2019s discretion as Trustee over the principal of the Non-marital Deduction Trust by an ascertainable standard, will conform the Walker Trust to Mr. Walker\u2019s intent, by removing the assets of the Non-marital Deduction Trust from Mrs. Walker\u2019s gross estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The parties ask that we permit the trust to be reformed in three respects: (1) by inserting a so-called ascertainable standard in Article III, paragraph F, which would limit the scope of Virginia\u2019s power as trustee under that paragraph in a way that would cause her not to have a general power of appointment; (2) by inserting in Article V, which governs the succession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>trustees, a provision requiring that there be a corporate cotrustee serving at all times; and (3) by inserting a new paragraph in Article V reciting Donald\u2019s intention (a) that no principal or income of any trust be included in the estate of any trustee, (b) that no trustee have the power to act in any fashion that would subject his or her estate to estate taxes, and (c) that in the event a trustee\u2019s estate would be so affected, his or her power to act may be exercised only by a cotrustee who will not be so affected. The parties maintain that these changes will ensure, as Donald intended, that the property in the nonmarital deduction trust not be included in Virginia\u2019s gross estate for estate tax purposes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>It is well settled that, as a matter of Massachusetts law, a trust instrument may be reformed to conform to the settlor\u2019s intent. <em>DiCarlo </em>v. <em>Mazzarella, </em>430 Mass. 248, 250 (1999). <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>425 Mass. 770, 772 (1997). <em>Simches </em>v. <em>Simches, </em>423 Mass. 683, 686-687 (1996). Thus \u201c[w]e may require the trust to be reformed on clear and decisive proof that the instrument fails to embody the settlor\u2019s intent because of scrivener\u2019s error.\u201d <em>DiCarlo </em>v. <em>Mazzarella, supra. </em>See <em>Shawmut Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>422 Mass. 706, 714 (1996). \u201cWe have allowed the reformation of trust instruments which produced tax results that were clearly inconsistent with the settlor\u2019s tax objectives.\u201d <em>BankBoston </em>v. <em>Marlow, </em>428 Mass. 283, 285 (1998). See <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, supra, </em>and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">\u201cTo ascertain the settlor\u2019s intent, we look to the trust instrument as a whole and the circumstances known to the settlor on execution.\u201d <em>DiCarlo </em>v. <em>Mazzarella, supra </em>at 250, quoting <em>Pond </em>v. <em>Pond, </em>424 Mass. 894, 897 (1997). In addition, we have indicated our willingness to accept extrinsic evidence, such as an attorney\u2019s affidavit, that demonstrates that there has been a mistake. \u201cIndeed, the crucial evidence of intent and mistake may well be available from the lawyer who drafted (or mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>drafted) the instrument rather than from the settlor.\u201d <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, supra </em>at 772. See <em>Loeser </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>412 Mass. 361, 366 n.7 (1992); <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>379 Mass. 506, 511 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The evidence in this case more than adequately demonstrates that Donald, as settlor of the Donald D. Walker Revocable Trust, intended to eliminate, or to minimize to the fullest extent possible, any adverse estate tax consequences not only to his own estate, but also to Virginia\u2019s estate. He did this by availing himself of the maximum marital deductions permitted by Massachusetts and Federal law in the general and special marital trusts, by funding those trusts only to the extent needed to take advantage of those deductions, and by giving Virginia no power as beneficiary of the nonmarital deduction trust to appoint principal of that trust. The absence of a power (as beneficiary) to appoint nonmarital deduction trust property plainly was intended to keep the property from being included in her gross estate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, we have in this record the drafting attorney\u2019s affidavit confirming both the settlor\u2019s and his intentions to construct the nonmarital deduction trust such that the trust property would not be included in Virginia\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">To remedy the unintended result, the parties seek to reform Article III, paragraph F by inserting a so-called ascertainable standard governing trustee distributions of principal to Virginia, and by deleting the problematic language concerning liberal discretionary distributions. Inclusion of an ascertainable standard will effectively negate a general power of appointment, I.R.C. \u00a7 2041 (b) (1) (A), remove the nonmarital deduction trust property from Virginia\u2019s estate, and thereby conform the instrument to Donald\u2019s intent. The standard sought to be imposed tracks the language of I.R.C. \u00a7 2041 (b) (1) (A).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For the reasons stated herein, we shall allow this proposed reformation.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>The plaintiffs represent that this reformation of Article III, paragraph F will ensure that, \u201cregardless of the identity of the trustee, or of application of fiduciary standards to the trustee\u2019s conduct in office, Mrs. Walker will not possess a general power of appointment and the assets of the Non-marital Deduction Trust would not be included in her gross taxable estate.\u201d Nevertheless, they also ask that we reform the trust instrument by inserting two other provisions that they claim will \u201cfurther\u201d Donald\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> They make no argument that these additional provisions are necessary to effectuate Donald\u2019s intent. We therefore decline to address these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We remand this case to the county court for entry of a judgment reforming Article HI, paragraph F of the Donald D. Walker Revocable Trust in conformance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Recent examples include <em>DiCarlo </em>v. <em>Mazzarella, </em>430 Mass. 248 (1999); <em>Fleet Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Fleet Bank, N.A., </em>429 Mass. 1003 (1999); <em>BankBoston </em>v. <em>Marlow, </em>428 Mass. 283 (1998); <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>425 Mass. 770 (1997); <em>Pond </em>v. <em>Pond, </em>424 Mass. 894 (1997); and <em>Simches </em>v. <em>Simches, </em>423 Mass. 683 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">For a thorough explanation of the court\u2019s approach, see <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Gring, 374 </em>Mass. 109, 113-115 (1977), and <em>Babson </em>v. <em>Babson, </em>374 Mass. 96, 101-103 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b594-9\">We are confident that litigants and attorneys who bring cases such as this before us do not do so lightly.
