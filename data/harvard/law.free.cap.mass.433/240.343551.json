Ladd, filed the present action claiming that his former employer, Scudder Kemper Investments, Inc. (Scudder), failed to pay him the full value of his Scudder stock in accordance with the terms of his severance agreement. Scudder moved to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration of Ladd\u2019s claims. Scudder\u2019s motion was denied, whereupon Scudder took a proper interlocutory appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 18 (a) (1). We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm the order denying Scudder\u2019s motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-15\"><em>Background. </em>Ladd was employed by Scudder beginning in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>1968. In connection with his employment at Scudder, Ladd registered with the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). Scudder itself is not a member of the NASD. Ladd\u2019s registration was effected through Scudder Fund Distributors (SED), a broker-dealer subsidiary of Scudder that holds membership in the NASD, and that serves, in part, as a vehicle for Scudder employees to register with the NASD.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to register with the NASD, Ladd was required to sign a uniform application for security industry registration or transfer (form U-4). On his form U-4, Ladd identified both Scudder and SFD as his employers. The form U-4 contained the following arbitration provision: \u201cI agree to arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy that may arise between me and my firm, or a customer, or any other person, that is required to be arbitrated under the rules, constitutions, or by-laws of [the NASD].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">In January, 1997, Scudder notified Ladd that it wished to terminate his employment on mutually agreeable terms. Over the years of his employment, Ladd had purchased a beneficial interest in Scudder stock, and, as of 1997, there were 61,231.94 shares held in an account for Ladd\u2019s benefit. One of the items the parties negotiated in Ladd\u2019s severance package was the terms on which Scudder would buy back Ladd\u2019s shares. At the time of those severance negotiations, the parties were aware that Scudder was also negotiating to sell a controlling interest in the firm to Zurich Insurance Company (Zurich). Accordingly, the price set for the repurchase of Ladd\u2019s stock included a \u201clook back\u201d provision in the event that Scudder stock was sold to a third party within twelve months following Ladd\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">After the parties completed their severance negotiations, Ladd\u2019s employment with Scudder was terminated effective June 30, 1997. On August 25, 1997, Ladd received payment for his Scudder shares, based on their July 1, 1997, net book value.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Meanwhile, on June 26, 1997, Scudder had entered into its agreement with Zurich whereby Zurich committed to purchase seventy per cent of the outstanding Scudder stock at a price of $240 per share. The purchase by Zurich closed on December 31, 1997. Scudder then made an additional payment to Ladd on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>account of his shares, based on Scudder\u2019s interpretation of the \u201clook back\u201d provision in Ladd\u2019s severance agreement. Ladd disagreed with Scudder\u2019s interpretation, and contended that he was entitled to twice that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">On June 12, 1998, Ladd filed the present action against Scudder seeking to recover the full amount he claims he is owed as a result of the Zurich sale. Relying on the arbitration clause in Ladd\u2019s form U-4, as filed with his NASD registration, Scudder moved to stay the proceedings and to compel Ladd to submit the dispute to arbitration. The motion was denied, and the present appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The arbitration clause in Ladd\u2019s form U-4 mandates arbitration for all disputes \u201crequired to be arbitrated under the rules, constitutions, or by-laws of [the NASD].\u201d NASD Rule 10201(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">\u201cAny dispute, claim, or controversy eligible for submission . . . between or among members and/or associated persons, and/or certain others, arising in connection with the business of such member(s) or in connection with the activities of such associated person(s), or arising out of the employment or termination of employment of such associated person(s) with such member, shall be arbitrated under this Code, at the instance of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">\u201c(1) a member against another member;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">\u201c(2) a member against a person associated with a member or a person associated with a member against a member; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-10\">\u201c(3) a person associated with a member against a person associated with a member.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">Scudder contends that the dispute with Ladd arises out of the termination of his employment with SFD, a member of the NASD, and that both it and Ladd are \u201cperson[s] associated with a member\u201d such that Scudder may insist on arbitration pursuant to NASD Rule 10201(a)(3). We conclude that Scudder is not \u201ca person associated with a member\u201d and that Scudder is therefore not a party that can compel arbitration under subsection (3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>As of June, 1998, when Ladd\u2019s suit was filed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> art. I(ee) of the NASD bylaws defined a person associated with a member as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\">\u201c(1) a natural person registered under the Rules of the Association; or (2) a sole proprietor, partner, officer, director, or branch manager of a member, or a natural person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or a natural person engaged in the investment banking or securities business who is directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by a member, whether or not any such person is registered or exempt from registration with the NASD under these By-Laws or the Rules of the Association.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">It is undisputed that Ladd himself comes within this definition, as he is \u201ca natural person registered\u201d with the NASD. Scudder contends that it is also a \u201cperson associated with a member\u201d because it is the sole shareholder of SFD, a relationship that Scudder equates with \u201csole proprietor\u201d of a member.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The term \u201csole proprietor\u201d refers to a single individual who owns a business, not to a sole shareholder of a corporation or to the corporate parent of a wholly owned subsidiary. \u201cA sole proprietorship is a business form in which an individual \u2014 rather than, for example, a partnership or corporation \u2014 owns the business.\u201d <em>In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., </em>45 F.3d 569, 573 (1st Cir. 1995). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201csole proprietorship\u201d as \u201c[a] form of business in which one person owns all the assets of the business in contrast to a partnership, trust or corporation,\u201d with the further explanation that \u201c[t]he sole proprietor is solely liable for all debts of the business.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1392 (6th ed. 1990). See Barron\u2019s Law Dictionary 478 (4th ed. 1996) (\u201csole proprietorship\u201d defined as \u201ca business or financial venture carried on by a single person and which is not a trust or corporation\u201d); Mellinkoff\u2019s Dictionary of American Legal Usage 606 (1992) (\u201csole proprietorship\u201d defined as \u201ca business owned by an individual, as distinguished from ownership by a corporation, a partnership, or any form of group ownership\u201d). A corporation, by definition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>is not a form of \u201csole proprietorship.\u201d If the NASD had meant to include sole shareholders or corporate parents of wholly owned subsidiaries within the definition of \u201cperson associated with a member,\u201d it presumably would have chosen accurate corporate terminology to describe those corporate relationships that would qualify. It would not have resorted to a term that, in its dictionary definition and ordinary legal usage, expressly excludes the corporate form.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">With the sole exception of \u201cpartner,\u201d which could refer either to an individual or to a corporate partner, the types of persons identified in the definition of \u201cperson associated with a member\u201d \u2014 \u201csole proprietor,\u201d \u201cofficer,\u201d \u201cdirector,\u201d \u201cbranch manager\u201d \u2014 are all natural persons. The list then includes any \u201cnatural person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions\u201d and finally concludes with any \u201cnatural person engaged in the investment banking or securities business who is directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by a member.\u201d Thus, a common thread running through virtually the entire definition is a reference (either express or implied) to natural persons. \u201cThat several items in a fist share an attribute counsels in favor of interpreting the other items as possessing that attribute as well.\u201d <em>Beecham </em>v. <em>United States, </em>511 U.S. 368, 371 (1994). Reading this definition as a whole, many courts have concluded that the NASD definition of \u201cperson associated with a member\u201d is limited to natural persons. See <em>Paul Revere Variable Annuity Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kirschhofer, </em>226 F.3d 15, 20-21 (1st Cir. 2000); <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Benefits Communications Corp., </em>175 F.3d 155, 162 (D.C. Cir. 1999); <em>Tays </em>v. <em>Covenant Life Ins. Co., </em>964 F.2d 501, 503 (5th Cir. 1992) (per curiam); <em>Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. </em>v. <em>Prebon Sec. (USA) Inc., </em>731 A.2d 823, 828 (Del. Ch. 1999). See also <em>Burns </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>202 F.3d 616, 620 (2d Cir. 2000) (definition of \u201cperson associated with a member\u201d excludes corporate entities).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Scudder relies on <em>McMahan Sec. Co. L.P. </em>v. <em>Forum Capital Mkts. L.P., </em>35 F.3d 82, 87 (2d Cir. 1994), in which the court concluded that a corporate partner could qualify as an \u201cassociated person of a member.\u201d The <em>McMahan </em>case is contrary to the growing weight of authority on this issue and is, in any event, readily distinguishable. To begin with, the <em>McMahan </em>court dealt with a corporation that was a partner of a member, and, unlike the term \u201csole proprietor\u201d that is at issue here, the term \u201cpartner\u201d can, in its ordinary usage, refer to either a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>natural person or a corporate partner. Thus, when the court rejected an interpretation that would limit the definition to natural persons, it did so \u201cwhere the entity in question is a partner of a member.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Moreover, the <em>McMahan </em>analysis relied heavily on a version of the NASD bylaws that has since been modified. At that time, the definition of \u201cassociated person of a member\u201d began with the term <em>\u201cevery </em>sole proprietor, partner, officer, director or branch manager of any member\u201d (emphasis added). NASD Bylaws, art. I, par. 1101(m) (April, 1992). <em>McMahan Sec. Co. L.P. </em>v. <em>Forum Capital Mkts. L.P., supra, </em>at 86. Where the definition included \u201cevery\u201d partner, and where a partner could take a corporate form, the court concluded that a corporate partner would be included within the plain language of that definition, notwithstanding the fact that every other reference in the definition could only refer to natural persons. <em>Id. </em>at 87. However, by way of a recent amendment, the definition has now deleted the word \u201cevery\u201d and begins with <em>\u201ca </em>sole proprietor, partner, officer\u201d (emphasis added). 62 Fed. Reg. 62,385, 62,388-62,389 (1997). The <em>McMahan </em>analysis also relied on the failure to include the word \u201cother\u201d when the definition shifted to an express reference to natural persons: \u201cIf the term \u2018partner\u2019 was confined to natural persons, the subsequent phrase \u2018or any natural person occupying a similar status\u2019 would be redundant. Moreover, if the NASD intended that \u2018partners\u2019 be so confined, it could have easily used the phrase \u2018any other natural person\u2019 to make its meaning clear.\u201d <em>McMahan Sec. Co. L.P. </em>v. <em>Forum Capital Mkts. L.P., supra. </em>An amendment making that precise change went into effect on December 1, 1999, so that the definition now reads \u201ca sole proprietor, partner, officer, director, or branch manager of a member, or <em>other </em>natural person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions\u201d (emphasis added). 64 Fed. Reg. 57,678 (1999). In describing this change in the definition, the NASD explained that the insertion of the word \u201cother\u201d was \u201cto clarify that the subsection describes only natural persons.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Scudder relies, in the alternative, on that portion of NASD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Rule 10201(a) that provides for arbitration of disputes \u201cbetween or among members and/or associated persons, and/or certain others.\u201d Scudder contends that it qualifies as a \u201ccertain other\u201d such that arbitration of this dispute is still mandatory. Although the rule contemplates that \u201ccertain others\u201d may be parties to an arbitration, it limits the persons who have the power to compel arbitration to a \u201cmember\u201d or a \u201cperson associated with a member.\u201d There is no reference to \u201ccertain others\u201d on the list of persons who may insist on arbitration, nor is the term \u201ccertain others\u201d even defined in the rule. The reference to \u201ccertain others\u201d as potential parties was intended to allow for joinder in the arbitration if there were nonmembers involved in a dispute between members and persons associated with members.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Burns </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., supra </em>at 621-622. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. </em>v. <em>Prebon Sec. (USA) Inc., supra </em>at 826-827. It does not give those \u201ccertain others\u201d the ability to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Scudder finally invokes both Federal and Massachusetts policy that favors arbitration. See <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 582-583 (1960) (arbitration should be ordered \u201cunless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute\u201d); <em>Local Union No. 1710, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>430 Mass. 417, 420-421 (1999). Our recognition of the benefits of arbitration do not allow us to compel Ladd to arbitrate in the absence of any binding arbitration clause that would cover his dispute with Scudder. \u201c[Ajrbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u201d <em>Local Union No. 1710, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>Chicopee, supra, </em>quoting <em>AT&amp;T Techs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Communications Workers, </em>475 U.S. 643, 648 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion to compel arbitration affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Since 1991, the subsidiary performing this function has been Scudder Investor Services, Inc., the successor to Scudder Fund Distributors (SFD).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-12\">Because of this conclusion, we need not decide whether a dispute over the price at which Scudder agreed to buy back Ladd\u2019s stock is a dispute \u201carising out of\u201d the termination of Ladd\u2019s employment with SFD.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">A registrant must comply with the NASD arbitration rules in effect at the time of suit. See <em>Paul Revere Variable Annuity Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kirschhofer, </em>226 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2000); <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Benefits Communications Corp., </em>175 F.3d 155, 158 (D.C. Cir. 1999); <em>Seus </em>v. <em>John Nuveen &amp; Co., </em>146 F.3d 175, 187 (3d Cir. 1998), cert, denied, 525 U.S. 1139 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Although this particular amendment postdates the filing of Ladd\u2019s complaint, it does serve to clarify whatever ambiguity existed in the earlier version of the definition. Where numerous courts had limited even the earlier version to natural persons, a subsequent NASD clarification that makes the limitation explicit gives us a further reason for following the majority view.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Thus, for example, if Ladd had included SFD as a party to the action, SFD (a member of the NASD) could have compelled arbitration under rule 10201(a) and Scudder could arguably have joined in that arbitration as a \u201ccertain other.\u201d However, Ladd has not made any claims against SFD. We do not need to decide whether Scudder would qualify as a \u201ccertain other\u201d who could join in an arbitration when there is no party to the action who can compel Ladd to arbitrate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
