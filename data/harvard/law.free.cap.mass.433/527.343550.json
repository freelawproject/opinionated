L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, and indecent assault and battery on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>a person fourteen years or over, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H. Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant contends that the trial judge erred in (1) admitting expert opinion testimony given by a social worker about the loss and recovery of a traumatic memory through dissociation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the opinion testimony, in significant respects, concerned scientific and medical matters beyond the scope of the witness\u2019s competence; and (2) failing to conduct a preliminary hearing under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, 419 </em>Mass. 15 (1994), to determine the reliability of the Commonwealth\u2019s proffered expert opinion testimony on the subject of dissociative memory loss. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We agree with the defendant\u2019s first point and conclude that the admission of portions of the objectionable expert testimony caused prejudice that necessitates reversal of both convictions. We refer the second issue (the need to conduct a <em>Lanigan </em>hearing) to be addressed at retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The Commonwealth presented evidence of the following. On the evening of November 29, 1991, the complainant, then fourteen years old and a freshman in high school,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> went on a church youth group outing with approximately twenty other youths, as well as a few adult chaperones, including a priest. The group boarded a school bus in front of a church located on the Melrose-Wakefield line, and departed for a hayride at a farm in Tewksbury. The defendant, an employee of the bus company transporting the group, was the bus driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">At the farm, the complainant, other youths, adult chaperones, and the defendant boarded a horse-drawn wagon covered with hay, which took them through some farmland and woods to a bonfire in a clearing surrounded by trees and rocks. A path through the woods led from the clearing to some portable toilet facilities. It was dark outside, and the bonfire lit up only the immediately surrounding area.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>After fifteen or twenty minutes beside the bonfire, the complainant set out to use the toilet facilities. As he approached the facilities, he heard a voice from further down the path call out, \u201cHey, kid. Come here.\u201d He walked in the direction of the voice, and a man, whom he later identified as the defendant, grabbed his left hand, pulled it behind his back, and shoved him to the ground. The complainant could not see who it was who raped him, but noticed that his assailant was \u201cplump\u201d and had dark hair. The complainant returned to the bonfire, and, on his arrival, did not remember the rape and thought he had simply gone to the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">About fifteen minutes later, the group returned to the wagon. During the ride back to the bus, the defendant started a \u201chay fight\u201d in which everyone participated. As the complainant was throwing hay, the defendant grasped the complainant\u2019s penis, over his clothing, seven or eight times.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The group rode back in the bus to Melrose. The complainant\u2019s father picked him up and drove him home. The following day, the complainant told his mother that the defendant had touched his \u201cprivate area\u201d on the hayride. The complainant did not tell his mother, nor anyone else, about the rape because he had no memory of it. His parents decided against pressing charges on the indecent touchings.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Almost two and one-half years later, toward the end of his junior year of high school, the complainant began to recall \u201cbits and pieces\u201d of the rape. By the beginning of his senior year, he remembered the rape in full, and had no doubt that it was the defendant who raped him. After his first year of college, the complainant reported the incident to law enforcement personnel. A Tewksbury police officer met with the defendant, who acknowledged having driven a group of young teenagers to a hayride in Tewksbury and acknowledged going on the hayride, but denied having participated in the \u201chay fight\u201d and denied having touched any of the youths on that trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The defendant did not testify at trial, nor did he call any witnesses to testify on his behalf. His defense was based on cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses to contend that he did not rape or molest the complainant, and that the complainant\u2019s version of events and claims were not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>1. Before trial, the Commonwealth notified the defendant\u2019s trial counsel that it intended to call an expert witness \u201cto discuss the [complainant\u2019s] memory of the alleged assault, how a child\u2019s memory works, and why some areas of the incident were readily apparent [and] disclosed immediately and others were \u2018blocked out\u2019 for several years.\u201d Counsel filed a motion to exclude the testimony. The motion specifically objected to the anticipated testimony of the witness on \u201cblocked out\u201d memory on the ground that the witness\u2019s opinion was \u201cbased upon extraneous facts not within the area of her professional competence as well as upon hearsay statements.\u201d The judge took no action on the matter before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">On the third day of trial, immediately before the Commonwealth called the witness,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendant\u2019s trial counsel promptly renewed his objection to her testimony. The judge directed the Commonwealth to first establish, in the presence of the jury, the witness\u2019s qualifications as an expert, and then permitted cross-examination in that limited area.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The witness testified during the voir dire that she has had approximately eighteen years\u2019 experience as a psychotherapist. She is a licensed independent certified social worker<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with a bachelor\u2019s degree in social services and a master\u2019s degree in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>social work. She testified that she had been trained as a specialist in sexual abuse and had worked as an outpatient clinician in the adolescent department of the Greater Manchester Mental Health Center in Manchester, New Hampshire; had worked at North Shore Children\u2019s Hospital in Salem, Massachusetts, in a variety of capacities, including conducting interviews and evaluations of, and providing treatment to, sexually abused children, as well as supervising the hospital\u2019s \u201csexual information and trauma team\u201d; had been the director of an outpatient clinic in Lowell that provided evaluations of and treatment to sexually abused children; and had previously testified as an expert witness in the Superior Court. Since 1989, the witness has been in private practice, continuing her \u201cspecialty in sexual abuse and trauma to children as well as treating adult survivors.\u201d Over the years, the witness had studied in \u201cthe area of memory [of sexual abuse]\u201d with a variety of researchers, including Dr. Bessel van der Kolk at the Human Resource Institute, Dr. Judy Herman at Cambridge Hospital, and others, and has attended seminars and workshops in this field.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She also subscribes to a number of journals and magazines concerning sexual abuse of children. Based on the witness\u2019s voir dire testimony, the judge found her qualified \u201cto express opinions in the field of child abuse.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ajmp\">Thereafter, the witness, who had not met with the complainant, and had not reviewed the particulars of the case, testified that victims of various traumas, including sexual abuse, experience many of the same symptoms, such as dissociative memory loss,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> derealization,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> nightmares, and \u201cpoor sleep.\u201d She explained that dissociative memory loss may lead to the delayed disclosure of a traumatic event. She stated that children who have been abused typically do not disclose such abuse im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>mediately, but rather disclose the abuse \u201cmonths to years after the actual experience happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The witness also explained that the eventual disclosure of a memory may vary from the disclosure of a partially recovered memory to the disclosure of a complete recall of an experience. Alternatively, an individual may completely repress a memory and only learn of a traumatic event from someone else. The witness stated that various factors influence when events, subject to dissociative memory loss, are remembered or recovered, including how one stores memory of trauma, how threatened an individual is in making a disclosure,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the response to the individual as a result of that disclosure, an individual\u2019s psychological makeup, and the type of treatment used to retrieve the memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">As to traumatic memory, the witness testified how individuals remember traumatic events. She stated that traumatic memory is \u201cstored in different parts of the brain [compared to everyday memories] which we\u2019re able to understand now through what we call PET scans. It\u2019s also retrieved differently than our everyday memory is retrieved. So that different cues, such as a nightmare or a smell or something that we hear, may trigger a memory that would . . . remind us of something to do with that traumatic memory and so little bits of information begin to come out.\u201d A PET scan, she explained, is \u201ca scan of the brain [whereby dye is injected] into various parts of the brain [and one] can actually see by the color [that comes] up how different memories are being stored in the brain, the different parts of our brain that we are actually storing memory in.\u201d She further explained that, \u201c[w]hen one is experiencing trauma ... we might feel [dissociation] more in a physical sense where we\u2019re literally taking ourselves out of ourselves. And the brain is working in such a way that it\u2019s separating the memory so that we\u2019re not experiencing it as happening to ourselves.\u201d The witness testified that there are \u201cvarious theories\u201d concerning trauma memory, and that the subject is \u201cfilled with a lot of controversy\u201d and \u201cnot completely understood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>A trial judge has wide discretion to qualify an expert witness and to decide whether the witness\u2019s testimony should be admitted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>406 Mass. 843, 852 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 628 (1989). \u201c \u2018The crucial issue,\u2019 in determining whether a witness is qualified to give an expert opinion, \u2018is whether the witness has sufficient \u201ceducation, training, experience and familiarity\u201d with the subject matter of the testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>423 Mass. 180, 183 (1996), quoting <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Amherst, </em>422 Mass. 359, 361-362 (1996). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, supra </em>(judge should consider \u201cwhether the witness has sufficient skill, knowledge, and experience in the area of his training\u201d). Testimony \u201con <em>matters within the witness\u2019s field of expertise </em>is admissible\u201d when the testimony concerns matters beyond the common knowledge of the jurors and will aid the jurors in reaching a decision (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, supra </em>at 628, quoting <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 105 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, supra. </em>Consequently, a judge\u2019s discretion can be abused when an expert witness is permitted to testify to matters beyond an area of expertise or competence. See <em>Timmons </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>412 Mass. 646, 649 (1992). The admission of expert testimony will be reversed only where it constitutes an abuse of discretion or other error of law. <em>See Adoption of Hugo, </em>428 Mass. 219, 232 (1998), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Hugo P. </em>v. <em>George P., </em>526 U.S. 1034 (1999), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The defendant argues that the judge erred in permitting the witness to offer an expert opinion on dissociative memory loss and recovered memory because she was not qualified to do so.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To the extent that the witness testified that victims of trauma, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>particular, sexually abused children, experience dissociative memory loss that may lead to the delayed recovery and disclosure of a traumatic memory, we disagree. \u201c[CJourts have uniformly allowed expert testimony on the typical symptoms of sexually abused children because the information is beyond the common knowledge of jurors and of assistance in assessing a victim witness\u2019s testimony and credibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, supra </em>at 182-183, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>417 Mass. 536, 540 (1994). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>418 Mass. 130, 134 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, supra </em>at 629-630. One of these symptoms includes \u201cthe common phenomenon of delayed disclosure in cases of child sexual abuse.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 458, 468 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>(1996). A critical issue in this case was the credibility of the complainant\u2019s claim that he immediately forgot about the rape, but recovered the memory of it years later. Thus, the subject matter was appropriate for expert testimony. In view of the witness\u2019s extensive training, education, and experience in interviewing, evaluating, and treating sexually abused children, the judge acted within his discretion to qualify the witness as an expert in child abuse, and to admit her testimony concerning dissociation and recovered memory; what these conditions or symptoms are; and the fact that victims of trauma may experience them. The fact that the witness was a certified social worker, and not a medical doctor or psychologist, does not alter this conclusion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>supra; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Fleet Refrigeration &amp; Air Conditioning Co., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 971, 972 (1990), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">However, we agree with the defendant that the witness should not have been permitted to testify about <em>how </em>a trauma victim stores and retrieves, or dissociates, a traumatic memory because the witness\u2019s testimony on these issues involved pronouncements concerning the physical functioning of the brain, a scientific and medical matter on which the Commonwealth failed to establish that the witness was qualified to testify. The judge\u2019s qualification of the witness in the field of child abuse in no way extended to a qualification in the area of the neurological or medical functioning of the brain, and the witness\u2019s testimony in the latter area obviously went beyond discussing the typical symptoms of sexually abused children.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Timmons </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., supra </em>at 649-650 (noting fact that witness is qualified as an expert in one area does not qualify him to give expert opinion in other area). The witness was not a medical doctor or a psychiatrist, and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>license to practice social work did not authorize her to provide professional services of a medical nature. See G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 130 (those authorized to perform social work may provide services such as \u201cpsychosocial evaluation, counseling, psychotherapy of a nonmedical nature, referral to community resources, and the development and provision of educational programs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Further, the witness\u2019s \u201cstudies\u201d with allegedly noted researchers in the area of memory,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and attendance at various seminars and workshops, did not serve as a sufficient basis on which to qualify her to testify to the science of how traumatic memory works. The witness did not even explain what aspects of memory she studied with the researchers or at the seminars and workshops she attended.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s contention, this is not a situation involving testimony on a question of discrete knowledge. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, supra </em>at 852-853 (chemist trained in chemical analysis and experienced in forensic chemistry could testify that substance was vomit although not specifically trained in the chemical analysis of residual stomach contents).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Although the defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not object during the witness\u2019s direct examination to those portions of the witness\u2019s testimony that we have concluded were improperly admitted, counsel had made it clear to the judge, both in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>pretrial motion, and in his statements to the judge immediately before the witness testified at trial, that he objected to the witness\u2019s testimony relative to \u201chow a child\u2019s memory works and why some areas were readily apparent and disclosed immediately and others were \u2018blocked out\u2019 for several years\u201d on the ground that she was not competent to testify on such matters. Counsel\u2019s claim of error concerning the admission of such testimony was preserved and the Commonwealth does not argue to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The complainant\u2019s credibility was pivotal to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. The witness\u2019s improperly admitted testimony served to bolster the complainant\u2019s credibility by providing a medically scientific explanation for his purported memory loss and its later recovery; and the prosecutor, during his closing argument, stressed the importance of the witness\u2019s testimony to credit the complainant\u2019s assertion that he immediately forgot about the rape, but years later recovered a complete memory of it. Because the improper testimony went to the only seriously contested issue at the trial, we cannot say that the judge\u2019s error in admitting the improper testimony \u201cdid not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 950, 951 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>419 Mass. 366 (1995). See also Griffith, Repressed Memories: The Effects of Expert Testimony on Mock Jurors\u2019 Decision Making, 16 Am. J. Forensic Psychol. 5, 8 (1998) (noting that, where there is \u201clittle or no corroborating evidence in child sexual abuse case, juries are often left to weigh the credibility of the victim and the accused based largely on the expert testimonies\u201d). Thus, the admission of the improper testimony was prejudicial. Further, because both the rape and indecent assault and battery offenses hinged, in large part, on the complainant\u2019s credibility, the convictions cannot be separated and both must be reversed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dranka, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 38, 43 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">2. We need not reach the defendant\u2019s additional argument that the judge erred in failing to conduct a prehminary hearing to determine the reliability of the Commonwealth\u2019s proffered expert opinion testimony on the subject of dissociative memory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>loss and recovered memory pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 25-27 (1994). Depending on the type of expert opinion testimony the Commonwealth attempts to proffer at retrial, this issue may arise again. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion, a review of literature on the subject of dissociative memory establishes that the debate concerning the reliability or validity of recovered memory does not solely revolve around the use of memory recovery techniques in therapy. See, e.g., Lindsay, The Controversy Regarding Recovered Memories of Childhood Sexual Abuse, 12 J. Interpersonal Violence 631, 642 (1997) (debate exists over scientific processes used to recollect childhood traumas); McKonkey, Memory, Repression, and Abuse: Recovered Memory and Confident Reporting of the Personal Past, 16 Am. Psychiatric Press. Rev. Psychiatry 11-55, 11-55, 11-59, 11-71 (1997) (discussing how \u201cbiological, cognitive, and social influences that shape memory are intertwined in the debate about recovered memory\u201d); Schacter, The Recovered Memories Debate: A Cognitive Neuroscience Perspective, Recovered Memories and False Memories 63, 79, 88 (M.A. Conway ed. 1997) (stating \u201cthere is no direct evidence that specific techniques used in therapy are the sole or primary cause of . . . false recollections\u201d and discussing other aspects that merit consideration). Consequently, it may be appropriate for the trial judge to conduct a <em>Lanigan </em>hearing before retrial if the Commonwealth seeks to introduce expert testimony on the neurological aspects of dissociative memory loss, for the purposes of showing the reliability of recovered memory. This is distinguished from memory problems associated with dissociative memory loss, and related mental disorders, where a <em>Lanigan </em>hearing would not be necessary, such as those referred to in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or those disorders where qualified expert testimony has been accepted as rehable in the past in Massachusetts appellate cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">3.

Some [researchers] have argued that qualitatively different processes are involved in memory for traumatic versus nontraumatic events and that clinical mechanisms (e.g., cognitive avoidance or dissociation) are necessary to explain nonremembering of childhood trauma, whereas others have argued that general mechanisms of memory and forgetting (e.g., poor encoding, decay, interference, state- and context-dependency) are sufficient.\u201d Lindsay, The Controversy Regarding Recovered Memories of Childhood Sexual Abuse, 12 J.

In addition, it should be noted that differences in the ways researchers and critics have used certain key terms have contributed to the debate: \u201c[F]or some . . . \u2018recovered memories\u2019 are understood necessarily to entail the existence of a special \u2018massive repression\u2019 mechanism by which memories of childhood sexual abuse are more or less instantly suppressed from awareness. For [others], the term \u2018recovered memories\u2019 does not necessarily entail any such special repression mechanism, and some prefer the related notions of dissociation or motivated forgetting as explanatory concepts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635. See Paris, A Critical Review of Recovered Memories in Psychotherapy: Part I\u2014 Trauma and Memory, 41 Can. J.
