The order was entered after the judge determined posttrial a motion in fimine that he had taken under advisement before trial. Pursuant to the motion in fimine, the judge struck the testimony of a police officer who had arrested the defendant before the officer completed the training requirements set forth in G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 96B. On appeal, the Commonwealth argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>that (1) the officer was exempt from the requirements of the statute at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest, (2) the defendant lacks standing to challenge the officer\u2019s authority, and (3) if the defendant has standing, the de facto officer doctrine applies. We vacate the judge\u2019s order and reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict because the officer\u2019s authority may not be attacked collaterally in a criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">On August 24, 1997, Officer Michael Willhite of the Athol police department was on routine patrol, in uniform, and driving a marked police cruiser. He stopped the defendant\u2019s vehicle for failure to dim the headlights, a civil motor vehicle infraction. 540 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.12 (1993). During the stop the officer smelled alcohol on the defendant\u2019s breath, and noticed his bloodshot eyes and slurred speech. The officer asked the defendant to perform field sobriety tests. At the conclusion of these tests, the officer arrested the defendant for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">At the time of the arrest, the officer had not completed the training required by G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 96B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Earlier, on December 9, 1996, the chief of police of Athol, the officer\u2019s appointing authority, had made a request pursuant to 550 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.02(8)(a) (1993) that the officer be exempted from the requirement of \u00a7 96B. He obtained a ninety-day exemption, the maximum allowed at that time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">On September 15, 1998, eight days before trial, defense counsel moved in limine to exclude the officer\u2019s testimony on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the ground that the officer was without authority to arrest the defendant because he failed to meet the requirements of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 96B. The trial judge took the motion under advisement, then proceeded with the trial and permitted the officer to testify. Defense counsel did not object to the officer\u2019s taking the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">The jury of six returned a guilty verdict on September 24. After the judge dismissed the jury, defense counsel reminded the judge of the motion in limine and requested that the judge address the motion and set aside the verdict. The judge, noting that he had agreed earlier to resolve the issue before imposing any disposition, stated that, \u201cbased on the motion, and . . . the way the officer testified, I think that [defense counsel] certainly raised a prima facie case that there was no authority to arrest [the defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">On January 8, 1999, after a hearing, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion in limine, struck the arresting officer\u2019s testimony, and ordered that a required finding of not guilty be entered. On January 13, 1999, the Commonwealth filed a notice of appeal \u201cpursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (2),\u201d as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). On January 19, 1999, the Commonwealth filed in the county court an application for leave to file an interlocutory appeal. A single justice of this court denied that application. There is no appeal from that decision. See <em>Cowell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>432 Mass. 1028 (2000). We transferred the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">1. <em>Procedural issues. </em>The defendant argues that the only avenue of relief available to the Commonwealth is under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. Such relief is only available where all other avenues of relief are foreclosed. See <em>Costarelli </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the City of Boston, 361 </em>Mass. 35, 41 (1975), quoting G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (\u201cthe statutory power of \u2018general superintendence of all courts of inferior jurisdiction to correct and prevent errors and abuses therein if no other remedy is expressly provided\u2019 should be used sparingly, and should rarely be used in a case where some other practical remedy is available\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">We must first review the nature of the trial judge\u2019s postconviction order, as it necessarily determines the procedural posture of the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal. The purpose of a motion in limine is \u201cto prevent irrelevant, inadmissible or prejudicial matters from being admitted in evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>pez, </em>383 Mass. 497, 500 n.2 (1981). While these motions are typically filed prior to trial, we have previously held that they may be filed and heard during the course of a trial as unforeseen exigencies often arise. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>406 Mass. 540, 550, cert, denied, 498 U.S. 832 (1990). Regardless of when filed, we have frequently expressed our preference for early rulings on motions in limine. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>383 Mass. 73, 81 (1981). This case, however, presents the unusual scenario where the motion was filed timely, the challenged witness testified, and the judge then granted the motion after the jury had returned a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The judge acknowledged that the motion in limine was filed before trial, but despite the fact that the witness testified, the judge stated that the motion was not decided as of the time the jury returned their verdict. He determined that it could be treated as either a \u201crenewed\u201d pretrial motion and therefore properly before the court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim P. 13 (a) (5), 378 Mass. 871 (1979), or a postconviction motion and therefore subject to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (a), (b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979). We disagree. The only proper basis on which the judge could have granted the requested relief posttrial was through application of rule 30 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Rule 13 (a) (5) states that, \u201c[ujpon a showing that substantial justice so requires, the judge or special magistrate may permit a pretrial motion which has been heard and denied to be renewed.\u201d Because the challenged witness testified, the motion in limine was, in substance, denied. It could not be renewed after trial because there is no mechanism to seek reconsideration after trial of a decision under rule 13 (a) (5). The only means of revisiting after trial a matter raised in a motion in limine is through a motion for postconviction relief under rule 30, or on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Rule 30 (a) cannot support the judge\u2019s action because, by its express language, it is limited to providing relief for \u201cconfinement or restraint . . . imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d It is undisputed that the defendant was never sentenced. Absent a sentence that is somehow defective, rule 30 (a) has no application. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>429 Mass. 1022, 1023 (1999) (rule 30 [a] \u201cwas not intended to provide an avenue for plenary appellate review. Instead, it was designed to enable defendants to challenge the legality or the technical basis of a sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Rule 30 (b) provides authority for a judge, on motion, to grant a \u201cnew trial at any time if it appears that justice may not have been done.\u201d The judge\u2019s treatment of the defendant\u2019s motion most closely approximated that of a motion filed under rule 30 (b). In effect, the judge determined that justice had not been done because the officer should not have been allowed to testify. He implicitly granted the defendant a new trial on that basis, then dismissed the charge because the Commonwealth could not meet its burden of proof without the officer\u2019s testimony. The Commonwealth has a right of appeal, pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (8), as appearing in 420 Mass. 1502 (1995), from an order granting postconviction relief under rule 30 (b). See <em>Latimore </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>417 Mass. 805, 808 (1994) (\u201cRule 30 is the source of the Commonwealth\u2019s right to appeal from rulings on postconviction motions, a right the Commonwealth did not enjoy prior to the rule\u2019s adoption in 1979\u201d). Additionally, we have construed a motion under rule 30 (b) as a \u201cmotion for appropriate relief under the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure\u201d and therefore the Commonwealth has a right to appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>415 Mass. 112, 114 (1993). Because the Commonwealth has an available means of appeal, review pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is not available.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The single justice correctly denied the Commonwealth\u2019s application for leave to take an interlocutory appeal pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (c), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). That rule provides that \u201c[a]ny motion the determination of which may be appealed pursuant to this rule shall be decided by the judge before the defendant is placed in jeopardy under established rules of law.\u201d See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. P. 15, Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 182 (Lexis 1997) (\u201cIn order to preserve the Commonwealth\u2019s right to appeal, the rule requires that the judge\u2019s ruling on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>motion be made before the defendant is placed in jeopardy\u201d). Here, the judge did not decide the motion until after the jury had returned its guilty verdict. Because jeopardy attached when the jury was sworn, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Super, </em>431 Mass. 492, 496 (2000), rule 15 (c) provided no basis to challenge the judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The defendant contends that the Commonwealth did not file a proper notice of appeal because it was captioned under rule 15 (a) (2). The defendant\u2019s argument elevates form over substance. It is clear that the Commonwealth, uncertain how to proceed based on the unusual timing and inappropriate nomenclature of the judge\u2019s order, filed its notice of appeal pursuant to rule 15 (a) (2) out of an abundance of caution. In its application for an interlocutory appeal, the Commonwealth asserted that the appeal should be considered pursuant to rule 30, but explained that it was submitting its application for an interlocutory appeal on the basis of the original posture of the defendant\u2019s motion (i.e., a motion in limine to exclude evidence). The Commonwealth\u2019s notice of appeal was filed timely, and the defendant has not shown any prejudice from the reference to mle 15 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s appeal is properly before us under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (8), and G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E. Resort to our superintendence powers under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">2. <em>Collateral attack. </em>The Commonwealth argues that the defendant lacks standing to challenge the authority of an officer who had not met the training requirement of \u00a7 96B. It is clear that the import of the defendant\u2019s motion in limine was an attack on the officer\u2019s title to office. That issue may not be raised in the defendant\u2019s criminal proceeding, for reasons that we shall explain. The issue of standing to challenge the officer\u2019s title to office, then, has no relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Officer Willhite had been appointed to the position of full time police officer in the town of Athol and was acting at least with de facto authority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A de facto officer is \u201cone whose title is not good in law, but who is in fact in the unobstructed possession of an office and discharging its duties in full view of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>public, in such manner and under such circumstances as not to present the appearance of being an intruder or usurper\u201d (citation omitted). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>268 U.S. 394, 397 (1925). We have recognized the exercise of de facto authority by a variety of governmental officials. See, e.g., <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>283 Mass. 618 (1933) (water commissioner); <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>204 Mass 540, 549 (1910) (tax assessor); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Easton, </em>146 Mass. 43 (1888) (railroad commissioner); <em>Sheehan\u2019s Case, </em>122 Mass. 145, 146 (1877) (judge); <em>Petersilea </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>119 Mass. 465 (1876) (constable); <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Bebee, 9 </em>Mass. 231 (1812) (sheriff). \u201cSo far as the validity of their action is concerned there is no difference between an officer de facto and an officer de jure.\u201d <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>Briggs, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wotton, </em>201 Mass. 81, 84 (1909).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">A public officer\u2019s right and title to office may not be attacked collaterally, but only in a direct action instituted to determine the validity of his claim to office. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>374 Mass. 37, 75 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiStasio, </em>297 Mass. 347, 351, cert, denied, 302 U.S. 683 and 302 U.S. 759 (1937). There are two reasons for this rule. The first is \u201cto ensure that public officials have a full opportunity to defend against a challenge in a proceeding where the merits of a particular public matter are not also at issue.\u201d <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., supra </em>at 75. The second is to protect the public\u2019s reliance on an officer\u2019s authority and to ensure the orderly administration of government. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Sheehan\u2019s Case, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>An officer who fails to complete the requisite training satisfactorily is subject to \u201cremoval by the appointing authority.\u201d G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 96B. The Attorney General also may seek removal pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 9. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>128 Mass. 308 (1880) (chief of police removed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawkes, </em>123 Mass. 525 (1878) (removal of judge mentioned in <em>Sheehan\u2019s Case, supra). </em>There is no authority for a defendant to institute such a proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">There are circumstances where a defendant properly may challenge the authority of a police officer to act. One such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>instance is the authority of an officer to make a warrantless arrest outside his jurisdiction absent fresh and continued pursuit for a crime committed in the officer\u2019s presence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grise, </em>398 Mass. 247, 249 (1986). H\u00e9re, the defendant does not challenge the range of the officer\u2019s authority to arrest, but the officer\u2019s authority to arrest in any circumstances because he was not properly a police officer. Such an attack may not be made secondarily in a criminal proceeding. See <em>Brierly </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>299 Mass. 292, 294-295 (1938); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiStasio, supra. </em>We hold that the defendant may not collaterally attack in his criminal prosecution the authority of his arresting officer on the basis of that officer\u2019s failure to complete the training requirements of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 96B.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Our holding does not leave a defendant without remedy to challenge an officer\u2019s failure to complete the required training. The defendant may impeach the officer at trial with his failure to complete the training, as occurred here. While the officer\u2019s lack of training to perform a field sobriety test may not render his testimony inadmissible, it clearly bears on the weight of his testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>356 Mass. 358, 361 (1969) (denying motion to strike officer\u2019s testimony after evidence of his lack of knowledge and skill in administering breathalyzer tests was demonstrated on cross-examination).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Where an individual is harmed by inappropriate, in\u00e1dequate or negligent training of police officers, the appropriate remedy lies in a direct suit against either the supervising authority or the municipality under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, see, e.g., <em>Dobos </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>404 Mass. 634, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Kehoe </em>v. <em>Dobos, </em>493 U.S. 850 (1989), or pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1994). See <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378 (1989) (determining that inadequacy of training may serve as basis of \u00a7 1983 liability where failure to train amounts to \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to constitutional rights of person with whom police may come into contact).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">We vacate the judge\u2019s order. The jury\u2019s verdict is reinstated, and the case is remanded to the District Court for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\">GeneraI Laws c. 41, \u00a7 96B, provides in relevant part: \u201cEvery person who receives an appointment to a position on a full-time basis in which he will exercise police powers in the police department of any city or town, shall, prior to exercising police powers, be assigned to and satisfactorily complete a prescribed course of study approved by the department of criminal justice training. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">\u201cFailure of an appointed person to comply with the provisions of this section prior to his exercising police powers, shall result in the appointed person\u2019s removal by the appointing authority, provided said person has not been exempted therefrom by said department as herein provided.

Regs. \u00a7 22 was amended to provide a maximum exemption period of 270 days, but it is undisputed that the chief of police never requested an additional exemption, and that on the date of the arrest, the officer was working as a full-time police officer beyond the expiration of his ninety-day exemption period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The judge ordered entry of a required finding of not guilty. Although the order draws on the language of Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 896 (1979), relief under that rule can only be granted where the defendant has renewed a motion for a required finding made during the trial. The defendant did move for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, but the motion was not renewed at the close of all the evidence. Had we viewed the motion as a renewed motion for a required finding of not guilty, and treated the judge\u2019s order as made under rule 25 (b) (2), that order would have been appealable pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (c) (1), as appearing in 389 Mass. 1107 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The Attorney General, in response to an inquiry from the Massachusetts Criminal Justice Training Council, has opined that an officer who has not yet completed his training should nevertheless be afforded \u201cpermanent\u201d employee status.
