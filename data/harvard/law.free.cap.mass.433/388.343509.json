(Malden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Mills), orders purchasing materials from Bayer. In a written decision, a judge in the Superior Court concluded that the provision was not enforceable. An order entered denying Bayer\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and to stay further litigation against it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The background of the case is as follows. Malden Mills manufactures internationally-known apparel fabrics and other textiles. On December 11, 1995, an explosion and fire destroyed several Malden Mills\u2019s buildings at its manufacturing facility. Subsequently, Malden Mills and its property insurers, the plaintiffs Commerce and Industry Insurance Company and Federal Insurance Company, commenced suit in the Superior Court against numerous defendants, including Bayer. In their complaint, the plaintiffs allege, insofar as relevant here, that the cause of the fire was the ignition, by static electrical discharge, of nylon tow (also known as bulk nylon fiber), which was sold by Bayer (but manufactured by a French business entity) to Malden Mills and used by Malden Mills to manufacture \u201cflocked fabric,\u201d a fabric used primarily for upholstery application.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Malden Mills initiated purchases of nylon tow from Bayer either by sending its standard form purchase order to Bayer, or by placing a telephone order to Bayer, followed by a standard form purchase order. Each of Malden Mills\u2019s purchase orders contained, on the reverse side, as one of its \u201cterms and conditions,\u201d an arbitration provision stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">\u201cAny controversy arising out of or relating to this contract shall be settled by arbitration in the City of New York or Boston as [Malden Mills] shall determine in accordance with the Rules then obtaining of the American Arbitration Association or the General Arbitration Council of the Textile Industry, as [Malden Mills] shall determine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Another \u201cterm and condition\u201d appearing in paragraph one on the reverse side of each purchase order provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">\u201cThis purchase order represents the entire agreement between both parties, not withstanding any Seller\u2019s order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>form, whether sent before or after the sending of this purchase order, and this document cannot be modified except in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the buyer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In response, Bayer transmitted Malden Mills\u2019s purchase orders to the manufacturer with instructions, in most instances, that the nylon tow was to be shipped directly to Malden Mills. Thereafter, Bayer prepared and sent Malden Mills an invoice. Each of the Bayer invoices contained the following language on its face, located at the bottom of the form in capital letters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\u201cTERMS AND CONDITIONS: NOTWITHSTANDING ANY CONTRARY OR INCONSISTENT CONDITIONS THAT MAY BE EMBODIED IN YOUR PURCHASE ORDER, YOUR ORDER IS ACCEPTED SUBJECT TO THE PRICES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE MUTUALLY EXECUTED CONTRACT BETWEEN US, OR, IF NO SUCH CONTRACT EXISTS, YOUR ORDER IS ACCEPTED SUBJECT TO OUR REGULAR SCHEDULED PRICE AND TERMS IN EFFECT AT TIME OF SHIPMENT AND SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS PRINTED ON THE REVERSE SIDE HEREOF.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The following \u201ccondition\u201d appears in paragraph fourteen on the reverse side of each invoice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">\u201cThis document is not an Expression of Acceptance or a Confirmation document as contemplated in Section 2-207 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The acceptance of any order entered by [Malden Mills] is expressly conditioned on [Malden Mills\u2019s] assent to any additional or conflicting terms contained herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Malden Mills usually remitted payment to Bayer within thirty days of receiving an invoice.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Based on the arbitration provision in Malden Mills\u2019s purchase orders, Bayer demanded that Malden Mills arbitrate its claims against Bayer. After Malden Mills refused, Bayer moved to compel arbitration and to stay the litigation against it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge denied Bayer\u2019s motion, concluding, under \u00a7 2-207 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>G. L. c. 106 (\u00a7 2-207) (set forth below),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Massachusetts enactment of the Uniform Commercial Code, that the parties\u2019 conduct, as opposed to their writings, established a contract. As to whether the arbitration provision was an enforceable term of the parties\u2019 contract, the judge concluded that subsection (3) of \u00a7 2-207 governed, and, pursuant thereto, the arbitration provision was not enforceable because the parties had not agreed in their writings to arbitrate. Finally, the judge rejected Bayer\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs should be equitably estopped from refusing to proceed under the arbitration provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">1. This case presents a dispute arising from what has been styled a typical \u201cbattle of the forms\u201d sale, in which a buyer and a seller each attempt to consummate a commercial transaction through the exchange of self-serving preprinted forms that clash, and contradict each other, on both material and minor terms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>See 1 JJ. White &amp; R.S. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 1-3, at 6-7 (4th ed. 1995) (White &amp; Summers). Here, Malden Mills\u2019s form, a purchase order, contains an arbitration provision, and Bayer\u2019s form, a seller\u2019s invoice, is silent on how the parties will resolve any disputes. Oddly enough, the buyer, Malden Mills, the party proposing the arbitration provision, and its insurers, now seek to avoid an arbitral forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Section 2-207 was enacted with the expectation of creating an orderly mechanism to resolve commercial disputes resulting from a \u201cbattle of the forms.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The section has been characterized as \u201can amphibious tank that was originally designed to fight in the swamps, but was sent to fight in the desert.\u201d White &amp; Summers, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 1-3, at 8.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 2-207 sets forth rules and principles concerning contract formation and the procedures for determining the terms of a contract. <em>Id. </em>at 9. As to contract formation, under \u00a7 2-207, there are essentially three ways by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>which a contract may be formed. <em>Id. </em>at 19-20. See also <em>JOM, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adell Plastics, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir. 1999) <em>(JOM). </em>\u201cFirst, if the parties exchange forms with divergent terms, yet the seller\u2019s invoice does not state that its acceptance is made \u2018expressly conditional\u2019 on the buyer\u2019s assent to any additional or different terms in the invoice, a contract is formed [under subsection (1) of \u00a7 2-207].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53. \u201cSecond, if the seller does make its acceptance \u2018expressly conditional\u2019 on the buyer\u2019s assent to any additional or divergent terms in the seller\u2019s invoice, the invoice is merely a counteroffer, and a contract is formed [under subsection (1) of \u00a7 2-207] only when the buyer expresses its affirmative acceptance of the seller\u2019s counteroffer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third, \u201cwhere for any reason the exchange of forms does not result in contract formation (e.g., the buyer \u2018expressly limits acceptance to the terms of [its offer]\u2019 under \u00a7 2-207(2)(a), or the buyer does not accept the seller\u2019s counteroffer under the second clause of \u00a7 2-207[l]), a contract nonetheless is formed [under subsection (3) of \u00a7 2-207] if their subsequent conduct \u2014 for instance, the seller ships and the buyer accepts the goods \u2014 demonstrates that the parties believed that a binding agreement had been formed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Bayer correctly concedes that its contract with Malden Mills resulted from the parties\u2019 conduct, and, thus, was formed pursuant to subsection (3) of \u00a7 2-207. A contract never came into being under subsection (1) of \u00a7 2-207 because (1) paragraph fourteen on the reverse side of Bayer\u2019s invoices expressly conditioned acceptance on Malden Mills\u2019s assent to \u201cadditional or different\u201d terms,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (2) Malden Mills never expressed \u201caffirmative acceptance\u201d of any of Bayer\u2019s invoices. See <em>id. </em>at 53. In addition, the exchange of forms between Malden Mills and Bayer did not result in a contract because Malden Mills, by means of language in paragraph one of its purchase orders, expressly limited Bayer\u2019s acceptance to the terms of Malden Mills\u2019s offers. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-207 (2) <em>(a); JOM, supra </em>at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Although Bayer acknowledges that its contract with Malden Mills was formed under subsection (3) of \u00a7 2-207, it nonetheless argues, relying on language in both <em>JOM, supra </em>at 55, and official comment 6 to \u00a7 2-207 of the Code, 1 U.L.A. 378 (Master ed. 1989), that the terms of the contract are determined through an application of the principles in subsection (2) of \u00a7 2-207. Under this analysis, Bayer asserts that the arbitration provision became part of the parties\u2019 contract because it was not a \u201cmaterial alteration,\u201d and to include the provision would cause no \u201csurprise or hardship\u201d to the plaintiffs. This analysis is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Bayer ignores the significance of the method of contract formation in determining the terms of a contract. See White &amp; Summers, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 1-3, at 19-20 (discussing three routes of contract formation under \u00a7 2-207, and noting \u201cthe terms of any resulting contracts will vary, depending on which route to contract formation a court adopts\u201d). Where a contract is formed by the parties\u2019 conduct (as opposed to writings), as is the case here, the terms of the contract are determined exclusively by subsection (3) of \u00a7 2-207. 2 R.A. Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2-207:14, at 568; \u00a7 2-207:28, at 574-575; \u00a7 2-207:47, at 584; \u00a7 2-207:146, at 640 (3d ed. rev. 1997) (Anderson). Official comment 7, which Bayer overlooks, expressly directs as much. See 1 U.L.A. \u00a7 2-207 official comment 7, at 378 (Master ed. 1989) (\u201cIn many cases, as where goods are shipped, accepted and paid for before any dispute arises, there is no question whether a contract has been made. In such cases, where the writings of the parties do not establish a contract, it is not necessary to determine which act or document constituted the offer and which the acceptance. . . . The only question is what terms are included in the contract, and subsection [3] furnishes the governing rule\u201d). Under subsection (3) of \u00a7 2-207, \u201cthe terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this chapter.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-207 (3). In this respect, one commentator has aptly referred to subsection (3) of \u00a7 2-207 as the \u201cfall-back\u201d rule. See 1 T.M. Quinn, Uniform Commercial Code Commentary and Law Digest par. 2-207[A][14], at 2-134 (2d ed. 1991). Under this rule, the Code accepts \u201ccommon terms but rejects all the rest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2-135. While this approach \u201cserves to leave many matters uncovered,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>terms may be filled by \u201crecourse to usages of trade or course of dealing under [\u00a7] 1-205 or, perhaps, the gap filling provisions of [\u00a7\u00a7] 2-300s.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See also Anderson, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2-207:78, at 602 (\u201c \u2018supplementary terms\u2019 authorized by UCC \u00a7 2-207[3] include those that may be established by a course of dealing, course of performance, and usage of the trade\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Contrary to Bayer\u2019s contentions, subsection (2) of \u00a7 2-207 is not applicable for several reasons. First, subsection (2) instructs on how to ascertain the terms of a contract when the contract is formed either by the parties\u2019 writings or by a party\u2019s written confirmation of an oral contract, situations not present here (the parties\u2019 contract was formed by their conduct). See 1 U.L.A. \u00a7 2-207 official comments 1 and 2, <em>supra </em>at 377. See also Anderson, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2-207:28, at 574-575; \u00a7 2-207:30, at 576; \u00a7 2-207:160, at 647. Second, the rules set forth in subsection (2), concerning how the terms of a contract between merchants are determined, apply only when the acceptance or written confirmation contains \u201cadditional or different terms,\u201d a situation also not present here (Bayer\u2019s invoice is silent concerning how to resolve disputes). See 1 U.L.A. \u00a7 2-207 official comment 3, <em>supra </em>at 377. See also Anderson, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2-207:160, at 647-648. In addition, official comment 6, read in its entirety,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> does not support Bayer\u2019s argument because the comment expressly applies to a situation where there are \u201cconflicting\u201d terms. <em>Id. </em>There are no provisions in Bayer\u2019s invoices that \u201cconflict\u201d with Malden Mills\u2019s arbitration provision because the invoices do not contain any provision stating how the parties intend to resolve their disputes. See White &amp; Summers, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 1-3, at 15 (official comment 6 not applicable when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>term appears in first form, but not in second; there are no terms that \u201cconflict\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Bayer argues that this case is governed by the language in <em>JOM, supra </em>at 54, stating that \u201c[t]he terms of [the parties\u2019 contract formed by the parties\u2019 conduct] would then be determined under the \u2018default\u2019 test in \u00a7 2-207(3), <em>which implicitly incorporates the criteria prescribed, in \u00a7 2-207(2)\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). We disagree. As discussed above, the criteria in subsection (2) determine what \u201cadditional or different terms\u201d will or will not be part of a contract that is formed by the exchange of writings. Where the writings do not form a contract, subsection (3) states its own criteria \u2014 \u201cthose terms on which the writings agree\u201d plus any terms that would be provided by other Code sections. One cannot turn to subsection (2) as another Code section that would supply a term when, by its express provisions, subsection (2) simply does not apply to the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Thus, the judge correctly concluded, under subsection (3) of \u00a7 2-207, that the arbitration provision in Malden Mills\u2019s purchase orders did not become a term of the parties\u2019 contract. The arbitration provision was not common to both Malden Mills\u2019s purchase orders and Bayer\u2019s invoices. Bayer properly does not argue that any of the gap-filling provisions of G. L. c. 106, apply. Because Bayer concedes that it never previously arbitrated a dispute with Malden Mills, we reject Bayer\u2019s claim that the parties\u2019 course of dealing requires us to enforce the arbitration provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Bayer also cites <em>Pervel Indus., Inc. v.TM Wallcovering, Inc., </em>871 F.2d 7 (2d Cir. 1989), in arguing that industry custom and usage favors enforcing Malden Mills\u2019s arbitration provision. That case, however, is not helpful to Bayer. The court upheld the existence of an enforceable arbitration agreement because the manufacturer had \u201ca well established custom of sending purchase order confirmations containing an arbitration clause,\u201d and the buyer, who had \u201cmade numerous purchases over a period of time,\u201d received \u201cin each instance a standard confirmation form which it either signed and returned or retained without objection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. Although Bayer never objected to the arbitration provision in Malden Mills\u2019s purchase orders, as we have previously explained, no agreement to arbitrate ever arose due, in part, to the expressly conditional language appearing in paragraph fourteen of Bayer\u2019s invoices, and to the lack of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>arbitration provision in its invoices. It is significant also that Bayer did not provide the judge with any evidence of industry custom and usage. We decline to conclude that industry custom and usage favors enforcing Malden Mills\u2019s arbitration provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The strong presumption of arbitrability, and the Federal and State policies favoring arbitration, see <em>Bureau of Special Investigations </em>v. <em>Coalition of Pub. </em>Safety, 430 Mass. 601, 603 (2000); <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Pomerantz, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 627, 630 (1994); <em>Loche </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 300 (1988), cannot reasonably be applied here. No adequate satisfaction exists of the Federal Arbitration Act\u2019s<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> requirements of the existence of a \u201cwritten [arbitration] provision in . . . a contract,\u201d or \u201can agreement [to arbitrate] in writing,\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1994), nor of the Massachusetts Uniform Arbitration Act\u2019s similar requirements of a \u201cwritten [arbitration] agreement\u201d or \u201ca[n] [arbitration] provision in a written contract,\u201d G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 1. The parties\u2019 forms never established a written contract; Malden Mills\u2019s arbitration provision did not integrate into the contract by reason of the parties\u2019 conduct; and they did not otherwise agree to arbitrate. See <em>Quirk </em>v. <em>Data Terminal Sys., Inc., </em>379 Mass. 762, 768 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">2. The judge correctly rejected Bayer\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs should be equitably estopped from refusing arbitration. Bayer has not shown that the plaintiffs intended to be bound to the arbitration provision in the absence of a final written contract with Bayer. Cf. <em>Hughes Masonry Co. </em>v. <em>Greater Clark County Sch. Bldg. Corp., 659 </em>F.2d 836, 839 (7th Cir. 1981) (finding it inequitable \u201cto permit [the plaintiff] to both claim that [the defendant] is liable to [it] for its failure to perform the contractual duties described in the . . . agreement and at the same time deny that [the defendant] is a party to that agreement in order to avoid arbitration of claims clearly within the ambit of the arbitration clause\u201d). Bayer has not established any inequity in having to proceed to trial rather than to arbitration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>See <em>Cleaveland </em>v. <em>Malden Sav. Bank, </em>291 Mass. 295, 297 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">3. Bayer may be right that the drafters of the Massachusetts version of the Code did not intend that \u00a7 2-207 should provide \u201can avenue for a party to strike the terms of its own purchase documents.\u201d Bayer, however, cannot ignore the fact that the use of its own boilerplate invoices contributed to the result that Bayer now finds problematic. The order denying the motion to compel arbitration and to stay litigation is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-10\">An order denying a motion to compel arbitration is immediately appeal-able under G.

Section 2-207 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u201c(1) A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">\u201c(2) The additional or different terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract.

Subsection (2) of \u00a7 2-207 of the Uniform Commercial Code, 1 U.L.A. 376-377 (Master ed. 1989), applies only to \u201cadditional terms,\u201d whereas subsection (2) of G.

Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2-207, at 550-551; \u00a7 2-207:2, at 559 (3d ed. rev. 1997) (Anderson). Apart from this variation, the sections are identical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Section 2-207 was intended to restrict application of the common-law \u201cmirror image\u201d rule to defeat the formation of a contract for the sale of goods.

Another treatise on the Uniform Commercial Code has been more direct in criticizing \u00a7 2-207. \u201cFew provisions of the Code (or indeed of any statute) have gained the notoriety of \u00a7 2-207. Scores of cases have explored its every nuance; dozens of law review articles have analyzed its minutiae. A virtual cottage industry has been created to suggest amendments, and agreement is nearly universal that it is at best a \u2018murky bit of prose.\u2019 Its workmanship is further honored by Grant Gilmore\u2019s characterization of the provision as \u2018a miserable, bungled, patched-up job ... to which various hands . . . contributed at various points, each acting independently of the others (like the blind men and the elephant).\u2019 No similar provision exists elsewhere in the Code . . . .\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 1 T.D.

The American Law Institute, and the permanent editorial board of the Uniform Commercial Code, have proposed a complete revision of \u00a7 2-207 to state new, more simplified, principles to settle contract terms, not just terms as to which there has been a \u201cbattle of the forms.\u201d See Discussion Draft, Uniform Commercial Code [New] Revised Article 2. Sales at 31-34 (April 14, 2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Bayer\u2019s invoices contain terms \u201cadditional\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d from those in Malden Mills\u2019s purchase orders. For example, Bayer\u2019s invoices disclaim certain warranties (implied warranties) for which Malden Mills\u2019s purchase orders provide. In addition, Bayer\u2019s invoices exclude liability for consequential damages for which Malden Mills\u2019 purchase orders provide. It cannot be said that these terms are immaterial. See Anderson, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2-207:79, \u00a7 2-207:88 (Code is not concerned with presence of additional term unless it is material; limitation of warranties provision and clause excluding liability for consequential damages are material new terms).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Official comment 6 to \u00a7 2-207, 1 U.L.A. 378 (Master ed. 1989), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adn\">\u201c6. If no answer is received within a reasonable time after additional terms are proposed, it is both fair and commercially sound to assume that their inclusion has been assented to. Where clauses on confirming forms sent by both parties conflict each party must be assumed to object to a clause of the other conflicting with one on the confirmation sent by himself. As a result the requirement that there be notice of objection which is found in subsection (2) is satisfied and the conflicting terms do not become a part of the contract. The contract then consists of the terms originally expressly agreed to, terms on which the confirmations agree, and terms supplied by this Act, including subsection (2). The written confirmation is also subject to Section 2-201. Under that section a failure to respond permits enforcement of a prior oral agreement; under this section a failure to respond permits additional terms to become part of the agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The plaintiffs do not dispute Bayer\u2019s contention that the Federal Arbitration Act is invoked because the transactions involved interstate commerce. See 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (declaring enforceable \u201cwritten provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b409-8\">While arbitration would normally be viewed as a more efficient method of dispute resolution, it has not been shown to be so here in view of the number of defendants and claims involved in the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
