The plaintiff, 116 Commonwealth Condominium Trust (trust), filed a complaint against its insurer, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna), alleging that Aetna breached its obligations under the trust\u2019s insurance policy by failing to reimburse the trust for legal fees and costs incurred in defending a Land Court action that had been brought against the trust\u2019s board of trustees. The trust also claimed that Aetna\u2019s conduct in denying coverage violated G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D. A Superior Court judge granted Aetna\u2019s motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>judgment. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the undisputed facts before the Superior Court. The trust\u2019s D&amp;O policy indorsement, entitled \u201cDirectors and Officers Liability Owners Association Claims Made Form,\u201d provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">\u201cA.

Gleicher\u2019s complaint alleged that the trustees wrongfully prohibited him from obtaining access to an adjoining unit and certain common areas in order to connect a gas fine to his unit. He sought relief in the form of a preliminary and permanent injunction that would allow him access to the adjoining unit and common areas. Gleicher\u2019s complaint included a request for costs and attorney\u2019s fees, but it did not request monetary damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Six days after receiving service of Gleicher\u2019s complaint, the trust forwarded the complaint to Aetna, informed Aetna of its retention of a law firm, and requested coverage under the D&amp;O policy. Shortly thereafter, a judge in the Land Court issued a preliminary injunction, ordering the trustees to allow Gleicher reasonable access to the units and common areas for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>of installing his gas line. Subsequently, Aetna advised the trust to take whatever steps it deemed appropriate and necessary to protect its interests while Aetna investigated the trust\u2019s request for coverage. The trust forwarded its legal bills incurred in the Land Court action to Aetna. Aetna eventually denied coverage and the trust responded with a c. 93A demand letter, to which Aetna responded. The trust then filed the present lawsuit in the Superior Court. The Superior Court granted Aetna\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the D&amp;O policy did not cover expenses incurred in the Land Court action for equitable relief and that, based on this lack of coverage, Aetna had not violated G. L. c. 93A or c. 176D.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">2. <em>Duty to defend. </em>\u201cInterpretation of an insurance policy is no different from interpretation of any other contract. \u201d <em>Citation Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>426 Mass. 379, 381 (1998). In the absence of an ambiguity, we will \u201cconstrue the words of the policy in their usual and ordinary sense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Hakim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers\u2019 Insolvency Fund, </em>424 Mass. 275, 280 (1997). The trust\u2019s insurance policy states, in pertinent part, that Aetna \u201cwill not be called to assume charge of the . . . defense of any claim or \u2018suit\u2019 . . . instituted against [the trust] or any \u2018insured.\u2019 \u201d The language is clear and unambiguous: Aetna does not have a duty to defend the trust or its trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">3. <em>Duty to indemnify. </em>The policy\u2019s \u201cInsuring Agreement\u201d states \u201c[Aetna] will reimburse you for \u2018loss\u2019 . . . .\u201d \u201cLoss\u201d is defined as \u201cadjudicated damages, settlements and \u2018defense expenses.\u2019 \u201d \u201cDefense [ejxpenses\u201d are defined as \u201creasonable and necessary legal fees and expenses incurred in defense of claims or \u2018suits,\u2019 and a \u201c[s]uit\u201d is defined as \u201ca civil proceeding in which damages to which this insurance applies are alleged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The trust contends that the policy\u2019s coverage for loss incurred by suits for \u201cdamages\u201d is ambiguous and therefore should include the equity action bought by Gleicher. We see no such ambiguity in the word \u201cdamages.\u201d This Commonwealth defines damages as \u201cthe word which expresses in dollars and cents the injury sustained by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Turcotte </em>v. <em>DeWitt, </em>333 Mass. 389, 392 (1955). See <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Waltham Indus. Lab. Corp., </em>722 F. Supp. 814, 828 (D. Mass. 1988) (noting definition of damages), aflfd in part and rev\u2019d in part, 883 F.2d 1092 (1st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Cir. 1989). This definition comports with that of other jurisdictions. See, e.g., <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Hanna, </em>224 F.2d 499, 503 (5th Cir. 1955) (\u201cdamages\u201d defined as \u201cpecuniary compensation or indemnity\u201d); <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>Cranford Ins. Co., </em>168 Cal. App. 3d 930, 935 (1985) (\u201c \u2018Damages\u2019 describes a payment made to compensate a party for injuries suffered\u201d); <em>Ladd Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>73 Ill. App. 3d 43, 46-47 (1979) (nuisance action, as equitable remedy, does not constitute action for money damage to property); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Farm Bur. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>172 Mich. App. 24, 29 (1988) (\u201cdamages\u201d cannot encompass strictly injunctive action).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our cases are clear that \u201cdamages\u201d is the word that expresses in doHars and cents the plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Even if the term \u201cdamages\u201d were ambiguous, any ambiguity in the \u201cInsuring Agreement\u201d section is dispeUed by the \u201cExclusions\u201d section that directly foHows: \u201cThis insurance does not apply to any claim ... for anything other than money damages.\u201d Reading this policy language, the trust could not reasonably expect that the policy would cover an action for injunctive relief that did not seek money damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>407 Mass. 689, 700 (1990), citing <em>Home Indem. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Merchants Distribs., Inc., </em>396 Mass. 103, 107 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The trust seeks support from our decision in <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., supra, </em>which concluded, in a different context (the environmental protection area), that \u201cdamages\u201d are the expenses incurred for the cleanup of existing conditions, whereas expenses incurred in complying with an injunction against future activities are not deemed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>\u201cdamages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 698. The <em>Haz.en </em>case is consistent with our decision today.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">4. <em>Claims under G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D. </em>The trust sought damages under G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D alleging that Aetna unfairly delayed its decision to deny coverage and refused \u201cto provide a defense . . . indemnity ... or reimbursement of defense costs ... in bad faith and not based on any reasonable interpretation of the [p]olicy.\u201d In light of the summary judgment and our affirming that judgment, these claims fail because Aetna\u2019s interpretation of the D&amp;O policy was not only reasonable, but correct. See <em>Gulezian </em>v. <em>Lincoln Ins. Co., 399 </em>Mass. 606, 613 (1987).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Gleichner\u2019s complaint prayed for a judgment:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">\u201c1.

Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1993) similarly defines the term as \u201cthe estimated reparation in money for detriment or injury sustained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\">We note also that a complaint for purely equitable relief that includes counts seeking costs or attorney\u2019s fees is not a complaint seeking money damages. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Farm Bur. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>172 Mich. App. 24, 29 (1988). <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 921 </em>S.W.2d 90, 94 (Mo. Ct. App. 1996). A request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs is merely incidental to the substantive claim for equitable relief. If we were to conclude otherwise, any claim for equitable relief could be converted into an action for \u201cdamages\u201d by the inclusion of standard \u201cboilerplate\u201d requests for attorney\u2019s fees in cases when there is no legal basis for an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Even assuming the policy covered the Land Court action, the trust\u2019s claims would fail because the trust could not have suffered injury from an alleged delay in coverage decision or payment when payments had not yet become due under the policy.
