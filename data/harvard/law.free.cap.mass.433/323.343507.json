We assume that all of the facts in his detailed affidavit are true, <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Quincy Food Serv. Employees Ass\u2019n &amp; Hosp., Library &amp; Pub. Employees Union, </em>407 Mass. 601, 603 (1990), drawing from them all inferences favorable to him. <em>O\u2019Gorman </em>v. <em>Rubinaccio &amp; Sons, </em>408 Mass. 758, 759 (1990).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">First Albany Corporation (First Albany) is a broker-dealer in the securities business. With headquarters in Albany, New York, it has a branch office in Boston. From April, 1988, through August, 1989, Edward Accomando was employed by First Albany as its registered representative authorized to effect securities transactions for its customers. Patsos alleged that from June, 1988, through approximately August, 1989, Accomando improperly withdrew more than $1.6 million from Patsos\u2019s First Albany accounts, without his knowledge or approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The circumstances of Patsos\u2019s dealings with Accomando are these. In 1987, Patsos, who previously had not invested in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>securities market, was introduced to Accomando. Accomando represented to him that, if followed, his investment advice could make Patsos \u201ca great deal of money.\u201d While it is not clear when Accomando first began advising Patsos, at some point Patsos bought approximately $8 million of Central Cooperative Bank stock on Accomando\u2019s advice, approximately one-half of which was purchased on a margin account.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Sometime between the purchase of the Central Cooperative Bank stock and early January, 1988, Accomando twice advised Patsos that he was at risk of losing his entire investment if he did not pay down his margin account. Accomando also told Patsos that he could arrange a \u201cprivate\u201d or \u201cnegotiated\u201d sale of the stock that would permit Patsos to pay down the account without affecting the market price of the stock. In late December, 1987, or early January, 1988, Accomando executed a $1 million transaction to that effect on behalf of Patsos.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Around that time Accomando informed Patsos that he intended to switch brokerage firms and become an employee of First Albany. His new affiliation, he told Patsos, would allow Patsos to invest a larger percentage of his account on margin, thereby providing greater protection for his investments and relieving Patsos of periodic margin calls when the market value of the Central Cooperative Bank stock dropped below a certain price.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Patsos established five brokerage accounts with First Albany after it employed Accomando.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During 1988 and 1989, while employed by First Albany, Accomando continued to advise Patsos concerning which stocks to purchase, how many shares to buy, and when to make the purchases. Patsos trusted Accomando completely, and First Albany has not challenged Patsos\u2019s statement that Accomando exerted \u201ccomplete control\u201d over his accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Patsos states, and we must accept as true, that he lacked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>experience and expertise needed to buy and sell stocks and that he relied entirely on Accomando\u2019s advice, knowledge, and experience. First Albany has also not challenged that Patsos informed Accomando that he was an unsophisticated investor, and that Accomando encouraged Patsos to trust him. While they spoke frequently regarding the accounts, Accomando often did not tell Patsos about executed transactions until after they had been completed, if at all. Patsos authorized a second private sale of his Central Cooperative Bank stock worth $1.75 million in March or April, 1989, after Accomando again persuaded him that he was at risk of losing his investment if he did not pay down his margin account. Although Accomando was by then employed by First Albany, Patsos received no documentation that the sale had taken place; he relied on Accomando\u2019s assurance that it had been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">After Patsos became a customer, First Albany sent him monthly statements advising him of the status of each of his accounts. The content of those statements inform First Albany\u2019s defense. Each First Albany statement covered a particular period and referenced the account number and the name of the \u201cinvestment executive,\u201d Edward Accomando. Of relevance to this case is account activity described in some of the monthly statements as \u201cissued by Boston\u201d: thirty-one transactions executed between June 14, 1988, and July 31, 1989, are described this way. For each such entry, the word \u201ccheck\u201d or \u201cCKS\u201d appears in a column headed \u201cprice or entry,\u201d with a dollar amount entered in the corresponding \u201cdebit\u201d column. The dollar amount of each \u201ccheck\u201d varied, ranging from $1,000 to $1.06 million. Patsos states that he did not understand the meaning of the term \u201cissued by Boston,\u201d and never received copies of the checks to which the statements apparently referred. When he told Accomando that he did not know how to decipher the statements, Accomando responded by telling him \u201cnot to worry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In late December, 1994, or early January, 1995, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and attorneys from the United States Department of Justice New England bank fraud task force, investigating Accomando\u2019s business dealings, interviewed Patsos about checks drawn on his First Albany accounts payable to a gambling casino, a professional sports team, and others. It was then that Patsos learned for the first time that Accomando had converted significant funds for his own personal use. Patsos was also told that, as a result of the investigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Accomando\u2019s broker\u2019s license had been revoked. Patsos was shown documents authorizing the transfer of the funds from his accounts, but according to Patsos the signatures on the documents were forged.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">On January 24, 1995, counsel for Patsos wrote to First Albany, asserting that funds belonging to Patsos and his nominees had been wrongfully withdrawn from accounts handled by Accomando and converted to the personal use of First Albany\u2019s employees. The letter identified and challenged thirty-three checks, totaling $1,672,230.70, charged to the five accounts. Counsel made demand for copies of all of Patsos\u2019s records, including copies of all checks drawn against his accounts. By letter dated February 6, 1995, First Albany rejected all of the claims, informing Patsos that it would vigorously defend any action against it. First Albany also refused to deliver the account records and copies of the disputed checks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">According to Patsos, his FBI interview took place in either late December, 1994, or early January, 1995. We agree with the Appeals Court that the inferences favorable to Patsos, which we also draw, are that it was highly likely that First Albany was aware of the alleged embezzlement by February 6, 1995, and, if so, the defendant\u2019s February 6 letter could be viewed by a jury as an act of concealment. <em>Patsos </em>v. <em>First Albany Corp., supra </em>at 269. As the Appeals Court also noted, Patsos filed his complaint on November 28, 1995, approximately ten or eleven months after the FBI interviewed him. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless on December 18, 1995, First Albany filed an answer denying outright \u201cthat there was a conversion of [Patsos\u2019s] funds by Accomando.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In short, the pleadings and affidavits present material questions of fact concerning the allegations of wrongdoing by First Albany or Accomando that would preclude entry of summary judgment. But the challenged checks were drawn from June, 1988, through August, 1989, more than six years prior to the commencement of this action on November 28, 1995. First Albany asserts that all of Patsos\u2019s claims \u2014 for conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, lack of good faith, negligent supervision, and violation of G. L. c. 93A \u2014 are therefore barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>h</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">To defeat First Albany\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Patsos seeks to avail himself of the discovery rule. The rule, which operates to toll a limitations period until a prospective plaintiff learns or should have learned that he has been injured, may arise in three circumstances: where a misrepresentation concerns a fact that was \u201cinherently unknowable\u201d to the injured party, where a wrongdoer breached some duty of disclosure, or where a wrongdoer concealed the existence of a cause of action through some affirmative act done with the intent to deceive. <em>Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>425 Mass. 615, 631-632 (1997). On appeal, Patsos relies on the first two theories.* <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> First, Patsos contends that he could not have discovered Accomando\u2019s conversion of his funds before his FBI encounter because the transactions were \u201cinherently unknowable.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, he argues that a jury reasonably could conclude that First Albany breached its fiduciary duty to reveal to him facts that, if disclosed, would have made him aware of the alleged embezzlement. This failure, he claims, constituted fraudulent concealment and thereby triggered the tolling protection of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 12,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> until he was informed by the FBI in late 1994 or early 1995 that his funds had been misappropriated.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">We may summarily dispose of his first argument. We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>with the motion judge<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that there was nothing \u201cinherently unknowable\u201d about the information supplied by First Albany in its monthly statements. The discovery rule provides that a cause of action for the redress of an \u201cinherently unknowable\u201d wrong does not accrue until the plaintiff knew, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known, of the factual basis for a cause of action. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>423 Mass. 467, 473 n.7 (1996); <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Bell Tel. Labs., Inc., </em>388 Mass. 171, 175 (1983); <em>Maggio </em>v. <em>Gerard Freezer &amp; Ice Co., </em>824 F.2d 123, 130 (1st Cir. 1987). The First Albany statements that Patsos received in 1988 and 1989 indicated that a number of checks \u201cissued by Boston\u201d were categorized as \u201cdebits\u201d from his accounts. If Patsos did not understand the statements, as he claims, in the exercise of reasonable diligence he could have demanded an explanation from Accomando and sought further explanations from First Albany if Accomando\u2019s dismissals were not satisfactory to him. Cf. <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Bell Tel. Labs., Inc., supra </em>at 175, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The Appeals Court correctly recognized, however, that his second claim has merit. Where compliance with a statute of limitations is at issue, \u201cfactual disputes concerning when a plaintiff knew or should have known of his cause(s) of action are to be resolved by the jury.\u201d <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, </em>409 Mass. 239, 247 (1991). To avail himself of the protection of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 12, therefore Patsos must set forth facts from which a jury reasonably could find that a fiduciary relationship existed between himself and First Albany, and that First Albany breached its fiduciary duty to disclose to him adequate information that would have apprised him that his funds had been converted. <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 519 (1997) (\u201c[wjhere a fiduciary relationship exists, the failure adequately to disclose the facts that would give rise to knowledge of a cause of action constitutes fraudulent conduct and is equivalent to fraudulent concealment for purposes of applying [G. L. c. 260,] \u00a7 12\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> First Albany asserts that as a matter of law there was no fiduciary relationship between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>parties, and that even if there were, First Albany met its fiduciary duty to Patsos by sending him monthly account statements that disclosed all material information.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">We consider first whether a jury reasonably could find that the relationship between First Albany and Patsos was fiduciary in nature. Relying on <em>Vogelaar </em>v. <em>H.L. Robbins &amp; Co., </em>348 Mass. 787 (1965), the motion judge concluded that under Massachusetts law there was no fiduciary relationship between Accomando or First Albany and Patsos.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Her ruling is consistent with the decisions of several Federal courts that interpreted <em>Vogelaar </em>to hold that, under Massachusetts law, a \u201csimple\u201d broker-customer relationship is not fiduciary in nature, even if a broker has encouraged the trust of an unsophisticated customer. See, e.g., <em>Lefkowitz </em>v. <em>Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., </em>804 F.2d 154, 155 (1st Cir. 1986) (allegations of customer\u2019s minimal knowledge of investments and reliance on account executive who also was close personal friend insufficient to warrant finding of fiduciary relationship because \u201ca simple stockbroker-customer relationship does not constitute a fiduciary relationship in Massachusetts\u201d); <em>Cannistracci </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number><em>Inc., </em>796 F. Supp. 619, 622 (D. Mass. 1992) (same); <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Okurowski, 717 </em>F. Supp. 10, 11 (D. Mass. 1989) (same). For reasons we shall describe, however, we agree with the Appeals Court that, based on Patsos\u2019s affidavit and all favorable inferences drawn from it, a jury would be justified in finding that a \u201cfull relation of principal and broker\u201d between Accomando and Patsos came into existence, and with it a general fiduciary relationship between First Albany and Patsos. <em>Patsos </em>v. <em>First Albany Corp., supra </em>at 271, quoting <em>Berenson </em>v. <em>Nirenstein, </em>326 Mass. 285, 289 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">As the Appeals Court noted, prior to the <em>Berenson </em>decision, whether a broker-customer relationship was a fiduciary relationship or a business relationship \u201chad a varied history in Massachusetts.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Patsos </em>v. <em>First Albany Corp., supra </em>at 270-271. There, we recognized a distinction between a \u201cmere engagement to buy in behalf of another without more,\u201d and an arrangement where the conduct of the parties established \u201cthe full relation of principal and broker,\u201d thus giving rise to fiduciary obligations. <em>Berenson </em>v. <em>Nirenstein, supra </em>at 289. We held that a fiduciary relationship came into existence where a stockbroker had approached an investor, offered to serve as his agent in a purchase of shares in a company, and represented that he was in a unique position to negotiate the purchase. <em>Id. </em>This was in accord with our earlier decision in <em>Birch </em>v. <em>Arnold &amp; Sears, Inc., </em>288 Mass. 125, 129, 136 (1934), in which we held that, where a customer was \u201cdensely ignorant of matters relating to the making of investments\u201d and entrusted her life savings to a broker who knew she was an inexperienced investor and induced her reliance, a broker-customer relationship was \u201cone of trust and confidence\u201d as opposed to one \u201cwhich ordinarily exist[s] between a broker and his customer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Read together, <em>Vogelaar, Berenson, </em>and <em>Birch </em>recognize that in Massachusetts a relationship between a stockbroker and a customer may be either a fiduciary or an ordinary business relationship, depending on whether the customer provides sufficient evidence to prove \u201ca full relation of principal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>broker.\u201d Because there remain ambiguities as to circumstances that may give rise to a \u201cfull relation of principal and broker\u201d and its concomitant fiduciary obligations, we suggest considerations relevant to that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Courts in other States have not been of single mind whether fiduciary duties inhere in every relationship between a stockbroker and his customer. Some have suggested that the resolution of that question turns on whether the broker and customer deal at arm\u2019s length. See, e.g., <em>Banca Cremi, S.A. </em>v. <em>Alex Brown &amp; Sons, </em>132 F.3d 1017, 1038 (4th Cir. 1997) (under Texas law, a stockbroker can be a fiduciary to a customer where \u201cthe relationship between [the] broker and its customer is that of principal and agent,\u201d but not where the parties \u201cconducted their business at arm\u2019s length in a principal-to-principal relationship\u201d); <em>Dinsmore </em>v. <em>Piper Jaffray, Inc., </em>593 N.W.2d 46-47 (S.D. 1999) (\u201cWhile a fiduciary relationship does exist between [stock]brokers and their [customers], fiduciary duties are not owed when the parties are dealing at arm\u2019s length . . . [and] . . . arise only when one undertakes to act primarily for another\u2019s benefit\u201d). Other courts have suggested that a broker always owes his customer some fiduciary obligations. See, e.g., <em>Romano </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, </em>834 F.2d 523, 530 (5th Cir. 1987), cert, denied, 487 U.S. 1205 (1988) (under Federal securities law, \u201ca broker does owe his client a fiduciary duty\u201d); <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>Boris, </em>742 A.2d 845, 849 (Del. 1999) (because the relationship between a customer and stockbroker is that of principal and agent, the broker, as agent, has a fiduciary duty to carry out the customer\u2019s instructions promptly and accurately).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">There is general agreement, however, that the scope of a stockbroker\u2019s fiduciary duties in a particular case is a factual issue that turns on the manner in which investment decisions have been reached and transactions executed for the account. See, e.g., <em>Romano </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, supra </em>at 530 (\u201cthe nature of the fiduciary duty owed will vary, depending on the relationship between the broker and the investor\u201d); <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Bache Halsey Stuart Shields, Inc., </em>790 F.2d 817, 824 (10th Cir. 1986) (broker generally owes fiduciary duties to customer because broker is customer\u2019s agent, but scope of duties turns on nature of broker\u2019s responsibilities because agent is only fiduciary within scope of agency); <em>Paine, Webber, Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>718 P.2d 508, 516-517 (Colo. 1986) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>(fiduciary nature of a stockbroker-customer relationship is a factual issue that turns on a number of factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">In determining the scope of the broker\u2019s fiduciary obligations, courts typically look to the degree of discretion a customer entrusts to his broker. Where the account is \u201cnon-discretionary,\u201d meaning that the customer makes the investment decisions and the stockbroker merely receives and executes a customer\u2019s orders, the relationship generally does not give rise to general fiduciary duties. See, e.g., <em>Independent Order of Foresters </em>v. <em>Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, Inc., </em>157 F.3d 933, 940- 941 (2d Cir. 1998) (\u201cUnder New York law, as generally, there is no general fiduciary duty inherent in an ordinary broker-customer relationship. ... [A general fiduciary] duty can arise only where the customer has delegated discretionary trading authority to the broker\u201d). See also <em>Carr </em>v. <em>CIGNA Secs., Inc., </em>95 F.3d 544, 547 (7th Cir. 1996); <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>Dittmer, </em>776 F.2d 785, 788 (8th Cir. 1985). For nondiscretionary accounts, each transaction is viewed singly, the broker is bound to act in the customer\u2019s interest when transacting business for the account, but all duties to the customer cease \u201cwhen the transaction is closed.\u201d <em>Leib </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>461 F. Supp. 951, 952-953 (E.D. Mich. 1978), affd, 647 F.2d 165 (6th Cir. 1981).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Bache Halsey Stuart Shields, Inc., supra </em>at 824 (in nondiscretionary accounts broker owes only a narrow duty not to make unauthorized trades).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Conversely, where the account is \u201cdiscretionary,\u201d meaning that the customer entrusts the broker to select and execute most if not all of the transactions without necessarily obtaining prior approval for each transaction, the broker assumes broad fiduciary obligations that extend beyond individual transactions. See, e.g., <em>Carr </em>v. <em>CIGNA Secs., Inc., supra </em>at 547 (\u201cThe general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>rule ... is that a broker is not the fiduciary of his customer unless the customer entrusts him with discretion to select the customer\u2019s investments\u201d); <em>Leib </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., supra </em>at 953.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But see <em>Romano </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, supra </em>at 530 (there is no \u201cbright-line\u201d distinction between the fiduciary duty owed customers in discretionary as opposed to nondiscretionary accounts). Trading by the broker without the customer\u2019s prior approval suggests that an account is discretionary,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> while frequent communications between the parties about the prudence of various transactions may support a finding that a customer has retained control of his account. <em>Leib </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., supra </em>at 954. If a broker has acted as an investment advisor, and particularly if the customer has almost invariably followed the broker\u2019s advice, the fact finder may consider this as evidence that the relationship is discretionary. <em>Leboce, S.A. </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>709 F.2d 605, 607-608 (9th Cir. 1983). Courts have looked to both the documentation of the customer\u2019s account, as well as to the execution of particular account transactions, to determine whether the customer has entrusted a broker to manage his investments for his benefit. <em>Paine, Webber, Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams, supra </em>at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Other factors may also support a finding that a stockbroker has assumed general fiduciary obligations to a customer. A customer\u2019s lack of investment acumen may be an important consideration, where other factors are present. See, e.g., <em>Broomfield </em>v. <em>Kosow, </em>349 Mass. 749, 755 (1965); <em>Birch </em>v. <em>Arnold &amp; Sears, Inc., </em>288 Mass. 125, 129, 136 (1934); <em>Romano </em>v. <em>Merrill </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, supra </em>at 530, citing <em>Clayton Brokerage Co. </em>v. <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n, </em>794 F.2d 573, 582 (11th Cir. 1986) (trier of fact must consider \u201cthe degree of trust placed in the broker and the intelligence and personality of the customer\u201d); <em>Leib </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., supra </em>at 953, 954 (where customer is particularly young, old, or naive with regard to financial matters, courts are \u201clikely\u201d to find that broker assumed control over account). An inexperienced or naive investor is likely to repose special trust in his stockbroker because he lacks the sophistication to question or criticize the broker\u2019s advice or judgment. <em>Paine, Webber, Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams, supra </em>at 517. This may be particularly true where the broker holds himself out as an expert in a field in which the customer is unsophisticated. See, e.g., <em>Burdett </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>957 F.2d 1375 (7th Cir. 1992); <em>Paine, Webber, Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams, supra </em>at 517, citing <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boeck, 121 </em>Wis. 2d 127, 145-146 (1985) (Abrahamson, J., concurring) (\u201c[B]y gaining the trust of a relatively uninformed customer and purporting to advise that person and to act on that person\u2019s behalf, a broker accepts greater responsibility to that customer\u201d). Social or personal ties between a stockbroker and customer may also be a consideration because the relationship may be based on a special level of trust and confidence. <em>Leib </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., supra </em>at 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">We have considered these and similar facts relevant to determining the scope of duty that extends to a customer. <em>Broomfield </em>v. <em>Kosow, supra </em>at 755 (\u201creview such factors as the relation of the parties prior to the incidents complained of,\u201d as well as \u201cthe readiness of the plaintiff to follow the defendant\u2019s guidance in complicated transactions wherein the defendant has specialized knowledge\u201d). But we have also held that a business relationship between a broker and customer does not become a general fiduciary relationship merely because an uninformed customer reposes trust in a broker who is aware of the customer\u2019s lack of sophistication. See <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Merchants Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>309 Mass. 354, 360-361 (1941) (bank that conducted hundreds of securities transactions for elderly widow uninformed in financial matters could not reasonably have been considered to have acted as fiduciary because customer\u2019s mere trust or reliance not enough to establish a fiduciary relationship). Cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>Broomfield </em>v. <em>Kosow, supra </em>at 755 (catalyst in transformation of business relationship into fiduciary relationship is defendant\u2019s knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s reliance upon him). In this respect, as others, our law is consistent with other States. See, e.g., <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Bache Halsey Stuart Shields, Inc., supra </em>at 824 (\u201cA fiduciary duty . . . cannot be defined by asking the jury to determine simply whether the principal reposed \u2018trust and confidence\u2019 in the agent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">In setting out these factors, we recognize that the factual inquiry in each case must be guided by two potentially competing considerations: the need to protect customers who relinquish control of their brokerage accounts, and the need to ensure that securities brokers \u2014 particularly those who merely execute purchase and sell orders for customers \u2014 not become insurers of their customers\u2019 investments. Assigning general fiduciary duties only to those stockbrokers who have the ability to, and in fact do, make most if not all of the investment decisions for their customers properly provides appropriate protection only for those customers who are particularly vulnerable to a broker\u2019s wrongful activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">If Patsos had merely alleged \u201cin very general terms\u201d that he trusted Accomando, that Accomando was aware of his inexperience, and that he had transferred funds for Accomando to invest on his behalf, that would be insufficient to establish that Patsos and Accomando had entered into a general fiduciary relationship. See <em>Vogelaar </em>v. <em>H.L. Robbins &amp; Co., </em>348 Mass. 787, 787-788 (1965). But here, as the Appeals Court correctly noted, Patsos \u201cset out with precision\u201d in his affidavit uncontested statements that, if true, would permit a jury reasonably to find that Accomando\u2019s relationship with Patsos was not a business relationship but a \u201cfull relation of principal and broker\u201d giving rise to general fiduciary obligations. <em>Patsos </em>v. <em>First Albany Corp., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 266, 273 (1999). Those include that (1) Patsos lacked sophistication and experience as a securities investor; (2) a reasonable inference can be drawn that Accomando had significant investment experience and specialized knowledge about private securities transactions; (3) Accomando was aware of Patsos\u2019s inexperience as an investor, and encouraged Patsos to rely on his investment expertise by promising financial benefits, favorable margin treatment, and private stock sales; (4) Accomando was in \u201ccomplete control\u201d of the Patsos accounts; (5) Accomando told Patsos that he was conducting transactions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>solely for his benefit; (6) Accomando selected and executed transactions in the accounts without the prior knowledge of or authorization from Patsos; (7) Accomando and First Albany did not provide Patsos written confirmation of stock transactions worth $1.75 million in March or April, 1989; and (8) when questioned, Accomando assured Patsos that he need not worry about his inability to understand the monthly statements or the terms of the customer agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">We also agree with the Appeals Court that, if a jury find that Accomando assumed broad fiduciary obligations to Patsos, as they may, First Albany may be held liable for Accomando\u2019s wrongful conversion of Patsos\u2019s funds under established principles of agency law. See <em>Patsos </em>v. <em>First Albany Corp., supra </em>at 272, citing Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 261 comment a (1958) (liability of principal results if \u201cthe agent\u2019s position facilitates ... the fraud, in that from the point of view of the third person the transaction seems regular on its face and the agent appears to be acting in the ordinary course of the business confided to him\u201d). See also Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 261 (1958) (\u201cA principal who puts a servant or other agent in a position which enables the agent, while apparently acting within his authority, to commit a fraud upon third persons is subject to liability to such third persons for the fraud\u201d); <em>id. </em>at comment a (liability of principal results even where the principal is entirely innocent, has received no benefit from the transaction, and where the agent has acted solely for his own purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We next consider First Albany\u2019s contention that, even if it owed a general fiduciary duty to Patsos, it met any duty of disclosure because its monthly statements correctly informed Patsos that checks for specified amounts were issued on specified dates, and debited to his accounts. We agree with the Appeals Court that a jury justifiably may find that the monthly statements bearing the description \u201cissued by Boston\u201d constituted a failure to disclose adequately facts that would give rise to Patsos\u2019s knowledge of Accomando\u2019s embezzlement. <em>Patsos </em>v. <em>First Albany Corp., supra </em>at 272. While First Albany insists that the monthly statements are sufficiently clear on their face to disclose all necessary facts to its customer, where (i) First Albany\u2019s headquarters are in Albany, New York, (ii) stock purchases would in the ordinary course of business be paid from the customer\u2019s account, and (iii) Accomando told Patsos \u201cnot to worry\u201d when he said that he did not understand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>monthly statements, it is impossible to reach that conclusion as a matter of law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The tolling provisions of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 12, would be available to Patsos were a jury to conclude that the monthly statements did not satisfy First Albany\u2019s duty of disclosure. <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 519 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We turn finally to First Albany\u2019s argument that summary judgment is proper because Patsos did not raise timely objections to the monthly statements as required by the terms of its \u201ccustomer\u2019s agreement\u201d with him,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> thereby waiving his right to object to them years later. We subscribe to the conclusion of the Appeals Court that, \u201c[i]f we assume, as we must, that the plaintiff\u2019s funds on deposit with the defendant were secretly converted to the personal use of Accomando and that the plaintiff had no knowledge of the embezzlement until the FBI interview early in 1995, then the plaintiff\u2019s failure to object within ten days of each of the defendant\u2019s statements in 1988 and 1989 was the direct result of the defendant\u2019s alleged fraudulent concealment of the embezzlement, and the ten-day notice provision would not bar the plaintiff\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Patsos </em>v. <em>First Albany, Inc., supra </em>at 273.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We add to this two further observations. First, when he signed First Albany\u2019s customer\u2019s agreement in April, 1988, Patsos was told by Accomando that he need not read or understand it, and that the document contained \u201cmere formalities.\u201d Second, at an unspecified later date, Patsos did what the customer agreement required \u2014 he questioned Accomando about the transactions and the terms of the monthly statements \u2014 and he was told \u201cnot to worry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Because of our conclusions, we need not reach the merits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Patsos\u2019s argument that the customer agreement was an unenforceable contract of adhesion. The judgment for First Albany is vacated. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b336-8\">As the Appeals Court correctly noted, portions of Patsos\u2019s affidavit made on information and belief might have been excludable had First Albany Corporation (First Albany) filed a motion to strike in the trial court.
