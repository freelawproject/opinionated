Represented by new counsel, he has appealed from the judgments of conviction and from the order denying his motion for a new trial. His principal argument on appeal is that his trial counsel furnished him with constitutionally inadequate representation by (1) failing to present expert medical testimony that the defendant\u2019s intoxication on the night of the killing would have rendered him incapable of forming the specific intent or engaging in the deliberate premeditation necessary to commit murder in the first degree; (2) allowing the prosecution to exploit, in an unfair manner, the absence of evidence on the defendant\u2019s claimed memory loss on the night of the murder; and (3) .giving a closing argument that undermined the defendant\u2019s intoxication defense and was ineffective in other respects. The defendant also argues that portions of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument were so improper that he was denied his right to a fair trial. We conclude that there is no basis to order a new trial. We also conclude that the defendant is not entitled to relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Based on the evidence in the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the jury could have found the following facts. In the early morning hours of October 2, 1987, after an evening of drinking with his sister and friends at various bars and apartments, the defendant joined his sister, and her male companion, for a ride home. The defendant\u2019s sister first drove to the apartment of her companion. When the defendant\u2019s sister and her companion began kissing in the apartment, the defendant departed and started walking home. On his way, at an intersection near his apartment, the defendant met three friends, Kevin Costa, Steven Costa, and Michael Costa. The men were standing around Steven\u2019s automobile. The victim, Edward Cereto, was lying on the ground nearby. The victim was known to the defendant, who had recently cleaned out a storage area under the porch of his apartment building at the request of his landlord, so that the victim, previously homeless, could five there. One of the four men put the victim into the trunk of the automobile. The men then drove to the defendant\u2019s apartment, where he obtained his shotgun and several shotgun shells. The men drove to Freetown State Forest, where one of the men forcibly removed the victim from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the trunk of the automobile. At least one of the men started hitting the victim. Someone told the defendant to shoot the victim, so the defendant retrieved his shotgun from the automobile and shot the victim. The defendant then handed the shotgun to one of the other men. The other men took turns shooting the victim. The men then attempted to leave the forest, but first got lost, and ended up driving past the victim before finding a way out. After dropping off Michael and Kevin at their residence, the defendant and Steven returned to the defendant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The victim, whose body was discovered later that morning, died of multiple shotgun wounds, three to his head (which were fired at close range), two to his chest, and one to his groin. The victim also suffered bums covering part of his chest and extending to his neck, and bums on his right leg. A book of matches was recovered near the victim\u2019s body by the police. Two days after the victim\u2019s body was found, the defendant was questioned by police. Among other information, the defendant told them that he did not own any kind of weapon. He then hid the shotgun underneath a wood pile in a yard near his apartment. Later that day, the defendant informed police that he did own a weapon, and took police to the wood pile where they seized the shotgun. That evening, the defendant confessed to the killing in some detail, and gave a written statement to the police concerning his involvement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Steven and Kevin Costa were convicted in separate trials of murder in the first degree, and we affirmed these convictions, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>414 Mass. 618 (1993), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>407 Mass. 216 (1990), respectively. Michael Costa pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, supra </em>at 624 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">1. We first take up the defendant\u2019s claims that his trial counsel furnished him with constitutionally ineffective representation. Because the defendant has been convicted of murder, we examine these claims to determine whether there exists a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, as required under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, which is more favorable to a defendant than is the general constitutional standard for determining ineffective assistance of counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coonan, </em>428 Mass. 823, 826-827 (1999). We therefore consider \u201cwhether there was an error in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the trial (by defense counsel, the prosecutor, or the judge) and, if there was, whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">(a) The defendant\u2019s principal defense at trial was intoxication. This defense was presented by two witnesses and by the defendant. One witness, the defendant\u2019s sister, testified that she spent most of the evening of October 1, 1987, at a bar drinking with the defendant, who drank \u201cat least seven or eight beers and a few shots of [bourbon].\u201d She also stated that the defendant, at one point during the evening, informed her that he was going into the bathroom to \u201cdo some\u201d cocaine, and that, later in the evening, the defendant swallowed a \u201cgreen pill\u201d and smoked marijuana. She described her brother as \u201cvery drunk\u201d when he left her that night. Another witness, a friend of the defendant\u2019s sister, testified that, when she last spoke with the defendant at about 1:45 a.m. on the morning of the killing, he was swaying from side to side, and appeared to be \u201creally drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The defendant, who was twenty-one years old at the time of trial, testified that he began drinking at the age of eleven or twelve years. By the time he was fourteen years old, he became drunk whenever he drank. He stated that, as a result of two arrests for driving while under the influence of alcohol, he once spent two weeks in a hospital undergoing treatment for alcohol abuse. On his release, however, the defendant testified that he continued to experience problems with alcohol. The defendant\u2019s description of his activities during the evening prior to the killing included a significant level of alcohol consumption.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also testified that he ingested two \u201clines\u201d of cocaine that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The defendant testified that he had no recollection of certain details that night, such as who put the victim in the trunk of the automobile, and could not recall going into his apartment to retrieve his shotgun. Although the defendant testified that he remembered firing his shotgun at the victim, he could not recall anyone else shooting the victim, and he had no memory of get<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>ting back to his apartment. The defendant stated that later that morning, he woke up in his bed and \u201cwasn\u2019t sure what had happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In his amended motion for a new trial, filed ten years after the trial, the defendant asserted that his only viable defense at trial was based on his intoxication, which he claimed negated specific intent and premeditation and his ability to share the intent of the other participants in the crimes. The trial judge conducted an evidentiary hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">At the hearing, Dr. Harold Rosenblatt, a physician specializing in internal medicine and addiction medicine, testified on behalf of the defendant. After reviewing the trial transcript and the defendant\u2019s alcoholic history (as related by the defendant), as well as meeting twice with the defendant, and conducting interviews with family members and a friend, Dr. Rosenblatt concluded that it would have been impossible for the defendant to form a specific intent or to premeditate with the amount of alcohol and drugs that he had in his bloodstream at the time of the killing. Dr. Rosenblatt based this conclusion on his determination that, for at least seven years, the defendant had been drinking extremely heavily, to the point where he regularly experienced blackouts, and \u201cso by definition he\u2019s really an end stage alcoholic.\u201d Dr. Rosenblatt\u2019s testimony essentially was that the amount of alcohol and drugs that the defendant had consumed during the night before the killing would have affected his brain function and made it \u201cextremely difficult for him to concentrate or focus, even for some perceptible period of time.\u201d Dr. Rosenblatt testified that it is common for severe alcoholics to sustain blackouts, and he opined that the defendant\u2019s selective memory loss concerning events leading up to the killing, and his history of similar lapses of memory, indicated that his heavy drinking had impaired his brain function.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The defendant\u2019s trial counsel also testified at the motion hearing. He stated that, although he had considered the use of an expert to support the defendant\u2019s intoxication defense, he decided against doing so, because of his concerns over potentially damaging cross-examination of such an expert. He indicated that he feared that the prosecutor would confront an expert with admissions made by the defendant to the police, and with testimony of other witnesses regarding the defendant\u2019s statements in the hours before the killing that would cast doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>on the expert\u2019s opinion that the defendant was incapable of specific intent or the ability to premeditate, and make the expert \u201clook like a hired gun.\u201d The defendant\u2019s trial counsel further explained that his trial strategy was for the defendant, whom he considered to be a likeable and believable individual, to \u201ctell his story as best he could and explain to the jury the effect that the alcohol had on him on that particular evening.\u201d He testified to discussing this strategy with the defendant, but had not discussed with him whether to consult an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The judge ruled that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to use a medical expert witness did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Acknowledging that the use of expert testimony might have bolstered the defendant\u2019s claim of memory loss, the judge concluded that \u201c[hjindsight evaluation that the assistance of an expert might have enhanced the defendant\u2019s credibility does not translate\u201d a tactical decision by trial counsel into ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The defendant argues that medical expert testimony was necessary to educate the jury about the physical impact of chronic alcohol abuse on the human brain, particularly because the defendant testified to drinking such a large quantity of alcohol before he met the Costas. The defendant asserts that the success of his defense depended on the jury\u2019s understanding that an alcoholic can consume an immense quantity of alcohol and still perform fairly automatic physical functions, yet, at the same time, be unable to \u201cthink clearly, to plan or to sequence.\u201d In addition, according to the defendant, a medical expert was needed to explain to the jury that memory failures are typical of chronic alcoholics, and that the defendant\u2019s assertion of memory gaps from that night was entirely consistent with his history of regular blackouts. Without such testimony, the defendant argues, his statement at trial that he could remember just \u201cbits and pieces\u201d from the night of the murder could be ridiculed by the prosecutor in cross-examination and closing argument. The defendant concludes that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to present an expert in support of his intoxication defense rose to the level of constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel and was likely to have unfairly influenced the jury\u2019s verdicts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u201cAn attorney\u2019s tactical decision amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel only if it was manifestly unreasonable when made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coonan, </em>428 Mass. 823, 827 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, 427 </em>Mass. 816, 822 (1998). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>The defendant\u2019s trial counsel testified that, although he considered the use of a medical expert to support the intoxication defense, he decided against it based on his knowledge that any such expert would be subjected to potentially damaging cross-examination. The evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s behavior, as admitted by him to police, in many respects undercut the defendant\u2019s claim that he was so intoxicated that he was incapable of forming a specific intent to kill or to premeditate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, in formulating his strategy, counsel was aware of the possibility that Michael Costa might testify for the Commonwealth, and counsel considered statements attributed to the defendant that were contained in police reports pertaining to the three codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The defendant\u2019s trial counsel determined that the defendant\u2019s best chance to win the jury\u2019s sympathy (undoubtedly to seek a lesser degree of guilt than murder in the first degree) was to forgo a medical expert entirely, and to rely instead on the defendant\u2019s innate ability to present his story in an honest and straightforward manner. Counsel had experience in the trial of criminal and murder cases in the Superior Court, he had used experts in the past, and he had found them, according to his testimony, at times \u201chelpful,\u201d and, at other times, subject to \u201ccross-examination [that] . . . do[es] . . . damage\u201d and that tends to undo their \u201cparticular[] help ... on direct examination.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He advanced his assertion of the defendant\u2019s intoxication defense by introducing testimony from the defendant, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>two other witnesses, regarding the defendant\u2019s state of intoxication. Counsel then argued the issue forcefully to the jury. He also requested a jury instruction that evidence of voluntary intoxication can negate the knowledge and intent elements of the crimes, and this instruction was properly given. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 394 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>394 Mass. 584, 593-594 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">It is true, as the defendant points out, that evidence that a defendant\u2019s mind may have been impaired at the time of the crime by intoxication \u201calmost always includes expert testimony\u201d that relates to the issues of intent and the ability to premeditate. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>413 Mass. 686, 690-691 (1992), and cases cited. As our cases illustrate, however, the fact that such expert evidence is often presented does not make a decision by a defendant\u2019s trial counsel not to provide such evidence a per se case of ineffective representation.* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The critical inquiry is whether counsel\u2019s choice was an informed and reasonable decision, a consideration to be assessed in light of his over-all representation of the defendant at the trial. If so, the decision was not error, and, therefore, by definition, not a matter \u201clikely to have unfairly influenced the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>417 Mass. 704, 715 (1994). Based on the considerations set forth above, the decision by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel was, as found by the trial judge who was familiar with the trial, a reasonable tactical choice. It cannot be said that the defendant was afforded representation so lacking in skill and planning that it would be repugnant to constitutional values to allow his murder conviction to stand.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">(b) At trial, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel attempted to elicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>testimony from the defendant on prior episodes of blackouts when he had been drinking. The judge sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection to this testimony. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not make an offer of proof concerning the defendant\u2019s proposed testimony, nor did he call witnesses, as promised in his opening statement, to corroborate the defendant\u2019s claim that he previously had experienced blackouts. The defendant now makes three distinct assertions on the matter. He first argues that the judge erred in excluding the evidence. The defendant then argues that the failure of his trial counsel to make an offer of proof summarizing the defendant\u2019s anticipated testimony constituted ineffective assistance that allowed the prosecutor, in cross-examination of the defendant and in closing argument, to exploit unfairly the defendant\u2019s testimony about his memory loss on the night of the murder. Last, the defendant argues that his trial counsel should have called witnesses to corroborate the defendant\u2019s claim of having previously experienced blackouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The judge should have admitted the testimony. The defendant was entitled to show, consistent with his claim that he was a chronic alcoholic, that he had suffered blackouts in the past after drinking excessively. This testimony would have supported, in some respect, his assertion that he could not remember many of the details pertaining to the killing. Trial counsel for the defendant also should have preserved the point by making an appropriate offer of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">We conclude, however, that the errors do not constitute a basis to order a new trial. The jury heard considerable testimony about the defendant\u2019s serious, and longstanding, drinking problem. They had before them the defendant\u2019s testimony about his lack of memory at the time of the murder, and they undoubtedly could infer (from the defendant\u2019s testimony and their common experience) that he may have suffered blackouts in the past. We do not consider the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant as to his loss of memory on the night of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>murder, and what was said about that evidence by the prosecutor in his closing, as inappropriate or unfair. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beauchamp, </em>424 Mass. 682, 691 (1997) (prosecutor may impugn defendant\u2019s credibility and argue that his story is fabricated); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamrini, </em>392 Mass. 427, 431 (1984) (prosecutor may, during closing argument, suggest to jury what conclusions jury should draw from evidence, including that defendant had fabricated defense). The matter was put in issue by the defendant\u2019s admission to the police, the cross-examination by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel of the State trooper who interviewed the defendant, and the defendant\u2019s own testimony. There is nothing in this aspect of the trial that would lead us to conclude that evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s alleged prior blackouts would have made a difference in the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">2. We reject the defendant\u2019s present contentions that the closing argument made by his trial counsel was \u201ca paradigm for an ineffective closing argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">(a) The statement by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel in his summation that \u201c[w]e aren\u2019t going to attempt to prove that [the defendant] was so intoxicated that night that he could not form [the] requisite intent to premeditate murder\u201d may have been, as noted by the judge, something said \u201cthrough inadvertence\u201d or something \u201ctranscribed incorrectly.\u201d The statement did not undermine the defendant\u2019s intoxication defense. Throughout his closing argument, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel repeatedly stressed to the jury that the key issue was that the defendant, because of his intoxication, could not form specific intent or premeditate. Defense counsel also advised the jury as to the judge\u2019s instructions on the effect of a finding of intoxication on the defendant\u2019s ability to possess the mens rea elements of murder. The jury\u2019s questions during deliberations about the issue of intoxication show that they understood the nature of the defense, and that they were not confused by the statement of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">(b) The defendant also criticizes remarks by his trial counsel, in closing argument, concerning whether the victim had been killed before he was placed into the trunk of the automobile. The defendant claims this argument was \u201cpitiful\u201d because it ignored the undisputed testimony of the medical examiner that the victim died of multiple gunshot wounds. The remarks, however, had support in the evidence. There was no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>that the victim moved, groaned, or spoke from the time the defendant met the Costas, or thereafter, and the medical examiner testified that a gunshot blast to the head could mask a previously inflicted skull fracture. By these remarks, defense counsel permissibly, and subtly, suggested to the jury that the defendant\u2019s shooting of the victim may not have been murder because the victim was already dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">(c) Last, there is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that a remark by his trial counsel, \u201cAnd I would suggest to you, again, you have to decide when [the defendant] got involved. No question at some point he did, and he\u2019s not saying that he didn\u2019t,\u201d amounted to a concession that the defendant had participated in a joint venture murder. When read in context, the remark served only to caution the jurors that they had to decide when the defendant became involved in the venture. This interpretation is consistent with the evidence and defense counsel\u2019s argument that the defendant had not been involved in the victim\u2019s kidnapping, and may not have been involved in his murder, because the victim may have been dead before being placed into the trunk of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">(d) The defendant\u2019s challenges to remarks by his trial counsel concerning \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d evidence are lacking in merit. These remarks were made in an attempt to downplay the defendant\u2019s initial lies to the police and were consistent with consciousness of guilt instructions suggested in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 585-586 &amp; n.6 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">In sum, the closing argument given by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel adequately presented the defense of intoxication in the face of a strong prosecution case.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">3. The defendant argues that numerous comments made by the prosecutor in his closing argument were improper, and effectively denied him a fair trial. The remarks now criticized were not the subject of an objection. We therefore examine whether anything said by the prosecutor was improper and, if so, whether the impropriety created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Luce, </em>399 Mass. 479, 483 (1987), and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>398 Mass. 806, 812 (1986). In making this analysis, it is important to note that this case was tried in 1988. The prosecutor had the benefit of the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514 (1987), in which we set forth the obligations of prosecutors with respect to proper and fair closing argument. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>prosecutor did not have the benefit of the many cases decided by this court, and the Appeals Court, since 1988, in which the general principles discussed in the <em>Kozec </em>decision have been applied to specific arguments made by prosecutors that were claimed to be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We need not address each of the criticized remarks. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s argument, for the most part, was based on the evidence and fair inferences from the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, supra </em>at 516. As was said about the complaints of the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks in the opinion upholding the convictions of the codefendant Steven A. Costa, \u201c[t]he passages [complained of] amount to little more than enthusiastic rhetoric, strong advocacy, and excusable hyperbole.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>414 Mass. 618, 629 (1993). On one or two occasions the prosecutor may have gone over the line with an improper appeal to the jury\u2019s sympathy. The judge\u2019s instructions clearly informed the jury that the closing arguments of counsel are not evidence,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and because the jury are to be given a measure of sophistication in sorting out excessive claims made in closing argument, we conclude that any missteps made by the prosecutor did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, supra </em>at 517; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamrini, </em>392 Mass. 427, 432 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">4.

Although this cross-examination did not track potential trial cross-examination, it did weaken Dr. Rosenblatt\u2019s opinions, and cause the defendant\u2019s trial counsel to testify that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>the cross-examination represented the type of problem he sought to avoid at the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b204-9\">For cases where trial counsel\u2019s decision, in a capital case, not to introduce expert testimony was found not to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cormier, </em>427 Mass. 446, 450-451 (1998) (failure to present expert on effects of intoxication); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>426 Mass. 725, 730-731 (1998) (failure to introduce expert on mental impairment); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bousquet, </em>407 Mass. 854, 863-864 (1990) (failure to call expert on effects of hashish).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\">The two cases on which the defendant relies, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>432 Mass. 704 (2000), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>413 Mass. 686 (1992), are distinguishable. Our recent decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, supra, </em>is not on point. See <em>id. </em>at 718-719 (in light of absence of any credible explanation, defense counsel\u2019s failure to call potentially key eyewitness [not an expert], although there existed possibility of aggressive cross-examination, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>\u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d). We held in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, supra </em>at 689-691, that the opinion of an expert witness, that a defendant\u2019s mind may have been impaired at the time of a crime due to intoxication, should not have been excluded by the trial judge. Although we recognized that a jury might not necessarily know, apart from the excluded testimony, what effect a high blood alcohol level might have had on the defendant\u2019s mental processes, we did not hold that such expert testimony is required, or that defense counsel\u2019s failure to introduce such expert testimony would rise to the level of constitutionally ineffective representation. See <em>id. </em>at 691.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The judge advised the jury as follows: \u201cWe will. . . enter into the closing arguments by counsel in the case. Closing arguments do not constitute evidence in the case. You\u2019ve heard the evidence in the case through the testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits that have been entered, and you will have those available with you in the jury deliberation room.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\u201cThis will be the last opportunity that both counsel will have to address the jury. We say closing arguments do not constitute evidence because [they are] the statements of lawyers. And they are advocates and it is their job and their duty to argue to you as jurors the effect of the evidence in the light most favorable to their respective positions. And you are cautioned now, before closing arguments begin, that if through inadvertence, and counsel, either one, enters into a reference to any fact that you do not recall having come into evidence through the testimony of the witnesses, or to be examined or viewed by exhibit, you would be bound to disregard that fact. For it will be the memory of the twelve jurors who go into that jury deliberation room that controls and not the memory of the attorneys, nor indeed the memory of the judge, for you indeed are the sole triers of the facts in the case. But I said this is the last opportunity that they have to sum up and argue the effect of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
