(plaintiff), appeals from the dismissal of its complaint and the entry of judgment for the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>of Boston (defendant). The plaintiff had challenged a decision of the mayor\u2019s office of consumer affairs and licensing for the city of Boston (licensing board) to suspend the plaintiff\u2019s entertainment license for one day. On appeal, the plaintiff argues (1) the trial judge applied the wrong standard of review for a decision to suspend an entertainment license pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A; and (2) the licensing board acted beyond its authority by sanctioning the plaintiff for an incident unrelated to the licensed activity. We transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The plaintiff owns and operates a restaurant and bar in downtown Boston. The licensing board is an authority established pursuant to G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 4, consisting of members appointed by the mayor of Boston subject to confirmation by the city council. The licensing board granted the plaintiff an entertainment license pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A, that entitled it to offer the following entertainment: vocal music and instrumental music not to exceed five instruments; one cassette or compact disc player; four televisions; two wide-screen televisions; one radio; and one jukebox.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">On August 20, 1998, two patrons were physically assaulted by members of the plaintiff\u2019s staff. One patron claimed that two employees had, without justification, shouted and cursed at him, insulted a member of his party, knocked beer bottles out of his hand, and then pushed him outside the establishment. The plaintiff\u2019s employees also inflicted bruises on and ripped the shirt of another patron while forcibly removing him from the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">On November 18, 1998, the licensing board held a hearing to determine whether the plaintiff\u2019s entertainment license should be suspended or revoked as a result of the alleged assaults. The plaintiff did not refute the allegations or demonstrate any justification for its employees\u2019 conduct. The licensing board suspended the plaintiff\u2019s entertainment license for one day, to be served on April 22, 1999. The licensing board\u2019s decision stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">\u201cAlthough it appears that the patrons were not seriously hurt, this is nevertheless a serious VIOLATION of Licens<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>ing Standards regarding public safety. Licensees are expected to conduct their operation so as to protect members of the public inside their establishment from disruptive conduct. The patrons were not so protected on this occasion\u201d (emphasis original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The licensing board also found that the plaintiff had not addressed the incident adequately with its employees, and that the plaintiff had not taken steps to prevent any future recurrence of such a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The plaintiff sought review of the licensing board\u2019s decision by filing an action in the Superior Court seeking relief in the nature of certiorari, pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. The parties filed cross motions for judgment on the pleadings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge applied the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test, and concluded, inter alia, that the defendant acted within the scope of \u00a7 183A.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>Because G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183 A, contains no provision for judicial review of a decision of the licensing board, and because it is not a State \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (2), see <em>Saxon Coffee Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Licensing Bd., </em>380 Mass. 919, 922-924 (1980) (concluding that licensing board is not State agency), judicial review is only available by civil action for relief in the nature of certiorari, pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. See <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Comm\u2019n for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 876-877 (1983). The standard of review for an action in the nature of certiorari depends on \u201cthe nature of the action sought to be reviewed.\u201d <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>374 Mass. 37, 49 (1977). We have not had occasion to review a decision suspending an entertainment license. The plaintiff argues that the trial judge erred in applying the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that she should have applied a heightened standard of review requiring the defendant to assume the burden of proving that its actions were justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The judge relied on decisions in which we held that the substantial evidence test should be applied to license revocation cases. See <em>Konstantopoulos </em>v. <em>Whately, </em>384 Mass. 123, 137 (1981) (entertainment license under \u00a7 183A); <em>Saxon Coffee Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Licensing Bd., supra </em>(common victualler\u2019s license under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 9). The plaintiff contends that, because we noted in <em>Konstantopoulos </em>v. <em>Whately, supra </em>at 134 n.8, that the original version of \u00a7 183A* <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> lacked objective standards limiting a licensing authority\u2019s discretion when making decisions, but nonetheless concluded that the substantial evidence test applied to judicial review of such decisions, a \u201cheightened\u201d standard of review requiring the defendant to prove that its actions were justified should now apply because the current version of \u00a7 183A contains such criteria.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *&amp;The plaintiff misconstrues our reasoning in <em>Konstantopoulos </em>v. <em>Whately, supra. </em>In that case, we focused on the \u201cnature of the claim\u201d on appeal rather than the statutory language itself. In both <em>Saxon Coffee Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Licensing Bd., supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>924, and <em>Konstantopoulos </em>v. <em>Whately, supra </em>at 137, we determined that the substantial evidence test should apply to license revocation proceedings under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 183A, respectively, because of the strong similarity between the \u201cnature of the claim\u201d in such cases and the revocation of an alcoholic beverage license in proceedings before the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, a State agency subject to the State Administrative Procedure Act, and to which the substantial evidence test applies. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) <em>(e).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">We see no appreciable difference between the \u201cnature of the claim\u201d in license revocation proceedings under \u00a7 183A, <em>Konstantopoulos </em>v. <em>Whately, supra, </em>and the \u201cnature of the claim\u201d in license suspension proceedings under \u00a7 183A. Both sanctions emerge from the same adjudicatory proceeding in which the licensee is afforded the same due process protections. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A, eighth par. More importantly, the licensing authorities are required to apply the same narrow and objective criteria in making either decision. The difference between the two sanctions is merely a matter of degree. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The plaintiff next argues that, because the First Amendment to the United States Constitution is implicated, a heightened standard of review should apply. The plaintiff has not specified how the First Amendment has been implicated other than to say that entertainment is protected by the First Amendment. We have noted that, where First Amendment rights are involved, the standard of review might be higher, and may require the licensing authority to carry the burden of proving the validity of its action. See <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Comm\u2019n for Brockton, supra </em>at 878 n.9, citing <em>1001 Plays, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>387 Mass. 879, 883 n. 4 (1983). See also <em>Fantasy Book, Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, 652 </em>F.2d 1115, 1125 (1st Cir. 1981). Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s suggestion, such concerns are not present here. First, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the sanction imposed was directed at communicative, rather than noncommunicative, activity. See <em>id. </em>at 1122. Second, rights protected by the First Amendment may be regulated by a licensing scheme provided the scheme contains \u201cnarrow, objective, and definite standards.\u201d <em>Shuttlesworth </em>v. <em>Birmingham, </em>394 U.S. 147, 151 (1969). The plaintiff has not shown how any of its First Amendment rights have been infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>3. <em>Scope of authority. </em>The plaintiff also argues that the licensing board exceeded the scope of its authority, which the plaintiff contends is limited to oversight of those precise activities enumerated in the license. In the plaintiff\u2019s view, the licensing board can impose a sanction only where a specific licensed activity directly caused an adverse effect on public health, safety, or order (e.g., if sound were amplified to unsafe levels, or if a licensed activity caused the establishment to exceed its capacity).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The construction the plaintiff gives \u00a7 183A is too restrictive. The purposes underlying \u00a7 183A are not limited to regulation of only the instrumentalities of entertainment. We observed in <em>Konstantopoulos </em>v. <em>Whately, supra </em>at 134, that \u201cthe purpose of \u00a7 183A is the preservation of public order at public entertainments.\u201d Thus, it is the effect of the license on the public that animates the statute. See <em>Jaffarian </em>v. <em>Building Comm\u2019r of Somerville, </em>275 Mass. 267, 271 (1931) (\u201cThe right to require licenses is based on the conception that places of public amusements may require supervision by public authorities to the end that they may not degenerate and become obnoxious to the public welfare\u201d). Section 183A, fourth par., expresses a legislative intent to regulate \u201cthe conduct of the premises in general,\u201d not just during the particular entertainment activities for which the license was issued. This construction is supported by the language in both the seventh and eighth paragraphs of \u00a7 183A, which provide that a license may be denied, modified, suspended, or revoked, if \u201cthe license, <em>taken alone </em>or in combination with other licensed activities on the premises\u201d would adversely affect public health, safety, or order (emphasis added). It is contrary to the interests of public health, safety, and order to conduct entertainment at an establishment that permits its staff to assault patrons. The fact that the assaults here occurred at a time when no entertainment was being presented does not change the fact that there were no adequate management procedures in place to prevent such conduct from occurring during entertainment. Patrons, therefore, were exposed to conditions constituting an adverse effect on the public health, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>safety, or order within the meaning of \u00a7 183A, seventh and eighth pars.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Finally, \u00a7 183A, ninth par., provides authority to \u201cmodify, suspend or revoke a license ... for any violation of [the licensing authorities\u2019] rules and regulations <em>or </em>for <em>any violation of </em>law\u201d (emphasis added). Here, the licensing board found, based on credible and uncontroverted evidence, that the plaintiff\u2019s employees assaulted two patrons without cause. Such conduct is a violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, and provides an adequate and independent basis for the license suspension. The plaintiff contends that, because the \u201cviolation of law\u201d provision appears in a paragraph discussing the licensing board\u2019s authority to place conditions on the issuance of a license, the licensing board can suspend a license for a violation of law only where other conditions have been placed on the license. The clear language of \u00a7 183A, ninth par., suggests otherwise: it is not meant to limit the licensing board\u2019s authority, but to expand it.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The licensing board did not exceed its authority in suspending the plaintiff\u2019s entertainment license.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Superior Court modified standing order 1-96 provides that petitions for judicial review of administrative proceedings under G.

P. 12 (c)[, 365 Mass. 754 (1974)].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\">This test requires that the reviewing court \u201cuphold the decision of the licensing authority as long as the findings by the authority are supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>1001 Plays, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>Mayor of Boston, </em>387 Mass. 879, 885 (1983). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d means such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\">General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 183A, as amended through St. 1936, c. 71, \u00a7 1, was declared unconstitutionally overbroad and vague because it failed to provide narrow and objective criteria for making licensing decisions. See <em>Venuti </em>v. <em>Riordan, </em>521 F. Supp. 1027, 1030-1031 (D. Mass. 1981). The statute was subsequently rewritten. See St. 1981, c. 694, \u00a7 1, which added, inter alia, the \u201cpublic health, safety or order\u201d standard found in the eighth paragraph of the current version to meet the objections of the Federal court. See also <em>G.J.T., Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Licensing Bd., </em>397 Mass. 285, 293-294 (1986). While no court has ever ruled on the constitutionality of the current version of \u00a7 183 A, some opinions have suggested that the 1981 version has cured the constitutional defects of its predecessor. See <em>G.J.T., Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Licensing Bd., supra; Highland Tap of Boston, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 242 n.3 (1988). The plaintiff has not raised the issue of the statute\u2019s constitutionality in its appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The plaintiff premises its argument on the theory that, where there is a broad grant of discretionary authority given to a licensing authority, a reviewing court examines whether there was an abuse of discretion, measured by the arbitrary and capricious test, or other error of law. See <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Comm\u2019h for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 877-878 (1983). See also D.A. Randall &amp; D.E. Franklin, Municipal Law and Practice \u00a7 1979 (4th ed. 1993 &amp; Supp. 2000). On the other hand, where the authority is limited by narrow and objective criteria, judicial review usually entails an assessment of the strength of the evidence supporting the action. See <em>Yerardi\u2019s Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Randolph, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 300 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s argument that the licensing board failed to comply with the procedural requirement of \u00a7 183A and make a written finding that a particular licensed activity \u201cadversely affected the public health, safety or order\u201d similarly fails. As discussed, the licensing board is not limited to imposing sanctions for violations stemming from activities expressly included in the license.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
