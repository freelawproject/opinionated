All of the plaintiff\u2019s claims stem from his termination as an officer of Net-Centric and the company\u2019s attempt to repurchase from him certain shares of his stock pursuant to a stock restriction agreement (stock agreement). The plaintiff also seeks a declaration that NetCentric has no right to repurchase the stock for the stated price of $0.001 a share. The defendants asserted a counterclaim for specific enforcement of the purchase option provision of the stock agreement. A Superior Court judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on all the plaintiff\u2019s claims, and granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their counterclaim. The plaintiff appealed from the grant of summary judgment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the undisputed material facts. See <em>Annese Elec. Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>431 Mass. 763, 764 (2000). In 1994, the plaintiff, O\u2019Sullivan, and his brother, Donal O\u2019Sullivan (Donal) (collectively, the founders), discussed form<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ing a business entity to develop a medium for delivering facsimile transmissions across the world by way of the internet. The founders agreed to a stock ownership arrangement whereby O\u2019Sullivan would receive approximately 4.5 million shares, the plaintiff 2.9 million shares, and Donal 1.5 million shares. In need of financing, they obtained capital investment from Matrix Partners (Matrix) and Northbridge Venture Partners, L.P. (Northbridge). They incorporated NetCentric<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the following year under Delaware law and established offices in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">O\u2019Sullivan was named the chief executive officer and a director. At some point, he became the chairman of the board as well. The plaintiff served initially as the company\u2019s president, and later as its vice-president of sales and marketing, and as a director. Matrix and Northbridge received preferred stock and each appointed a director: Tim Barrows on behalf of Matrix, and Edward Anderson on behalf of Northbridge. Robert Goldman and Robert Ryan were named as outside directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The plaintiff executed a stock agreement and an employee noncompetition, nondisclosure, and developments agreement (noncompetition agreement). His stock agreement, executed May 16, 1995, provided that he would purchase 2,944,842 shares of stock in NetCentric at $0,001 a share. Forty per cent of the shares (1,177,938) would vest on May 1, 1996, and an additional five per cent (147,242) would vest each succeeding quarter, until all the shares were vested. According to the agreement, if the plaintiff ceased to be employed by NetCentric \u201cfor any reason . . . with or without cause,\u201d the company had the right to buy back his unvested shares at the original purchase price. All the plaintiff\u2019s unvested shares would vest immediately, pursuant to an acceleration clause, should NetCentric merge with, or be acquired by, another company.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Both the plaintiff\u2019s stock agreement and his noncompetition agreement contained clauses providing that the agreements did not give the plaintiff any right to be retained as an employee of NetCentric and that each agreement represented the entire agreement between the parties and superseded all prior agreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>and understandings relating to the same subject matter. In addition, the agreements contained a choice of law provision, providing that they \u201cshall be construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In June, 1996, Donal\u2019s employment was terminated, and the company exercised its right pursuant to Donal\u2019s stock agreement to buy back his unvested shares. In September, 1996, the plaintiff\u2019s employment was terminated. At that time, forty-five per cent of the plaintiff\u2019s shares (1,325,180) had vested; the remaining fifty-five per cent (1,619,662) had not vested. A month later, NetCentric notified the plaintiff in writing that it was exercising its right pursuant to the stock agreement to buy back the plaintiff\u2019s unvested shares. The plaintiff has refused to tender the shares to the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">During and after the time that Donal and the plaintiff were fired, NetCentric was in the process of hiring additional staff. New employees often were offered stock options in the company, issued from the employee stock option pool (pool), as part of their compensation packages. Some employee-shareholders expressed concern that this practice of authorizing new shares from the corporate treasury for issuance to new hires would dilute the value of their shares. Existing shares would not be diluted, however, if NetCentric acquired outstanding shares and offered those to new employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">After Donal was fired, the number of shares in the pool was increased by the same number that NetCentric had repurchased from him. Within one month after the plaintiff\u2019s employment was terminated, NetCentric hired a president and two vice-presidents, one of whom replaced the plaintiff as vice-president of sales. All three new employees were granted stock options, totaling 1,812,500 shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and, where' viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974); <em>O\u2019Sullivan </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>431 Mass. 201, 203 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">3. <em>Breach of fiduciary duty. </em>Initially, we must resolve a choice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>of law question. As a minority shareholder in a close corporation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the plaintiff maintains that the defendants owed him a duty of good faith and loyalty and that they breached this duty by terminating his employment in order to repurchase his unvested shares. This claim is based on Massachusetts law, which provides that shareholders in a close corporation owe each other the duty of \u201cutmost good faith and loyalty.\u201d <em>Wilkes </em>v. <em>Springside Nursing Home, Inc., </em>370 Mass. 842, 848-849 (1976) (majority shareholders breached fiduciary duty by taking adverse employment actions against minority shareholder in order to pressure him into selling his shares at less than fair value); <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 578, 593 (1975) (failure to offer to purchase minority shareholder\u2019s shares at same price as offered to another shareholder was breach of fiduciary duty).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The defendants claim, however, that Massachusetts law is of no avail to the plaintiff, as Massachusetts law is inapplicable to his fiduciary duty claim; NetCentric is a Delaware corporation, Delaware law applies, and Delaware law does not impose the . heightened fiduciary duty of utmost good faith and loyalty on shareholders in a close corporation. See <em>Riblet Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Nagy, </em>683 A.2d 37, 39 (Del. 1996) (noting that Delaware has not adopted duty of utmost good faith and loyalty established in <em>Wilkes </em>v. <em>Springside Nursing Home, Inc., supra); Nixon </em>v. <em>Blackwell, </em>626 A.2d 1366, 1380-1381 (Del. 1993) (declining \u201cto fashion a special judicially-created rule for minority investors\u201d). Instead, under Delaware law, minority shareholders can protect themselves by contract (i.e., negotiate for protection in stock agreements or employment contracts) before investing in the corporation. Additionally, founding shareholders can elect to incorporate the company as a statutory close corporation under Delaware law, which provides special relief to shareholders of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>such corporations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">To avoid the imposition of \u201cconflicting demands,\u201d \u201conly one State should have the authority to regulate a corporation\u2019s internal affairs \u2014 matters peculiar to the relationships among or between the corporation and its current officers, directors, and shareholders.\u201d <em>Atherton </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>519 U.S. 213, 224 (1997), quoting <em>Edgar </em>v. <em>MITE Corp., </em>457 U.S. 624, 645 (1982). Traditionally, we have applied the law of the State of incorporation in matters relating to the internal affairs of a corporation (including both closely and widely held corporations), such as the fiduciary duty owed to shareholders. See <em>Wasserman </em>v. <em>National Gypsum Co., </em>335 Mass. 240, 242 (1957); <em>Beacon Wool Corp. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>331 Mass. 274, 279 (1954); <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>International Pavement Co., </em>227 Mass. 206, 212-213 (1917). The plaintiff claims that we abandoned this \u201cone-factor test\u201d in <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 511 (1997), in favor of a \u201cfunctional approach\u201d that applies the law of the State with the most \u201csignificant relati\u00f3nship\u201d to the particular issue. In the <em>Demoulas </em>case, we recognized a recent trend in our cases applying the functional approach to resolving choice of law questions. See <em>id., </em>and cases cited. See also <em>Nile </em>v. <em>Nile, </em>432 Mass. 390, 401 (2000) (breach of contract); <em>Kahn </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co, </em>429 Mass. 572, 572-573 (1999) (statutes of limitations); <em>Cosme </em>v. <em>Whitin Mach. Works, Inc., All </em>Mass. 643, 646 (1994) (statutes of repose); <em>Bushkin Assocs. </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>393 Mass. 622, 631 (1985) (Statutes of Frauds).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">We followed this functional approach in the <em>Demoulas </em>case because the company involved was formed originally in Delaware but later merged into a Massachusetts corporation. We applied Massachusetts law to conduct that occurred both when the company was a Delaware corporation and later when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>it was a Massachusetts corporation because, in the \u201cparticular circumstances\u201d of that case, we concluded that this State had a more significant relationship to the issues presented. See <em>id. </em>at 511. We determined that \u201c[ajpplying two different sets of State laws to the activities of a corporation whose existence was, for all practical purposes, continuous throughout the period, would be a cumbersome and unnecessarily formalistic exercise.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The <em>Demoulas </em>case was an exceptional one, as it concerned a company that had changed its State of incorporation as well as conduct that spanned both periods; thus, we conducted a functional analysis to determine which State had the more significant contacts. Nothing in our decision, however, suggested that we were overruling our long-standing policy of applying the law of the State of incorporation to internal corporate affairs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>(explicitly stating that we need not address whether we should continue to follow the State of incorporation principle). Today, we adhere to and reaffirm our policy that the State of incorporation dictates the choice of law regarding the internal affairs of a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Our decision accords with that of a majority of the jurisdictions that have addressed this issue. See, e.g., <em>Atherton </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., supra </em>at 224 (\u201cStates normally look to the State of a business\u2019 incorporation for the law that provides the relevant corporate governance general standard of care\u201d); R.W. Southgate &amp; D.W. Glazer, Massachusetts Corporation Law and Practice \u00a7 16.5[d], at 541-542 n.102 (Supp. 1998, 1999), and cases cited. Similarly, our policy is consistent with the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 302 (1971), which provides that the rights and liabilities of a corporation are generally determined by the law of the State of incorporation. See Model Business Corporation Act \u00a7 15.05(c) official com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>ment (1998) (\u201cSection 15.05[c] preserves the judicially developed doctrine that internal corporate affairs are governed by the state of incorporation even when the corporation\u2019s business and assets are located primarily in other states\u201d). This rule furthers the interests of \u201ccertainty, predictability and uniformity of result, ease in the application of the law to be applied and, at least on occasion, protection of the justified expectations of the parties.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 302 comment g, at 311. All three founders, including the plaintiff, deliberately chose to incorporate in Delaware. By so doing, they \u201c determine [d] the body of law that [would] govern the internal affairs of the corporation and the conduct of their directors. . . . The corporation and its shareholders rightfully expect that the laws under which they have chosen to do business will be applied.\u201d <em>Hart </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>129 A.D. 2d 179, 184-185 (N.Y. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The unusual circumstances involved in the <em>Demoulas </em>case are not present in the case before us. We apply the general rule that the law of the State of incorporation governs claims concerning the internal affairs of a corporation, including the treatment of alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. As NetCentric is, and always has been, a Delaware corporation, Delaware law applies to the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because Delaware law does not impose a heightened fiduciary duty on shareholders in a close corporation, see <em>Riblet Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Nagy, supra </em>at 39; <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Blackwell, supra </em>at 1380-1381, the standard on which the plaintiff bases his cause of action, summary judgment was properly granted to the defendants on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">4. <em>Breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. </em>The plaintiff next claims that the defendants violated the implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>covenant of good faith and fair dealing implicit in all Massachusetts contracts, including contracts for employment at will. See <em>Fortune </em>v. <em>National Cash Register Co., </em>373 Mass. 96, 104-105 (1977). The <em>Fortune </em>case and its progeny provide that an employer is accountable to a discharged employee for unpaid compensation if the employee is terminated in bad faith and the compensation is clearly connected to work already performed. See <em>id. </em>See also <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., </em>385 Mass. 300, 304 (1982); <em>Gram </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>384 Mass. 659, 672 (1981) <em>(Gram </em>7); <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Tenaska, Inc., </em>108 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1997). The plaintiff argues that the defendants terminated his employment in bad faith because they were trying to prevent his remaining shares from vesting; that his unvested shares represent compensation previously earned; and that he was unlawfully deprived of this compensation by the defendants\u2019 attempt to repurchase his unvested shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In support of his contention, the plaintiff relies on the fact that he accepted a salary substantially lower than he had received in recent years because of the equity he received in NetCentric and because he expected he would be retained at least until his stock had fully vested. He also cites the fact that other employees received only stock options, while the founders received shares up front, and that all shares would immediately vest under the acceleration clause in his stock agreement should NetCentric merge with, or be acquired by, another company, a benefit granted only to the founders. The plaintiff claims that the unvested shares could not be considered payment for future services because they could have vested at any time in the event of a NetCentric merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The defendants did not deprive the plaintiff of any income that he reasonably earned or to which he was entitled. His shares vested over time only if he continued to be employed; thus, the unvested shares are not earned compensation for past services, but compensation contingent on his continued employment. The plaintiff\u2019s argument to the contrary is belied by the terms of his stock agreement. Under the agreement, the plaintiff\u2019s shares were to vest each quarter that he remained a NetCentric employee until they had fully vested. Should the plaintiff cease working for NetCentric for any reason, his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>to any unvested shares would terminate immediately, and the company could repurchase the shares at the original purchase price. The longer the plaintiff was employed by NetCentric, the more vested shares he would earn.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">At the time the plaintiff\u2019s employment was terminated, forty-five per cent of his shares had vested. He had not yet earned the remaining fifty-five per cent. These unvested shares were contingent on the plaintiff providing future services for NetCentric, unless NetCentric merged with, or was acquired by, another company. See <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Tanaska, Inc., supra </em>at 8-9 (terms \u201cvested\u201d and \u201cunvested\u201d not automatically controlling, but periodic vesting schedule can define line between past and future services).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The plaintiff seeks support from <em>Cataldo </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 731, 741 (1985), quoting <em>Gram </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>391 Mass. 333, 334 (1984) <em>(Gram II), </em>in which the Appeals Court held that an employee\u2019s unvested interest in real estate development projects \u201cwas sufficiently an \u2018identifiable, future benefit . . . reflective of past services.\u2019 \u201d The court concluded that the employee\u2019s interest in future projects was a \u201ccontinuing inducement\u201d to work for his employer and constituted \u201ccompensation for that continuing work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740 (\u201cActual realization by Cataldo of the value of any share of the developer\u2019s equity was for the future, of course, but ownership of the possibility was intended to be and was part of Cataldo\u2019s day-to-day compensation for work currently being done\u201d). Relying on this language, the plaintiff argues that his unvested shares constitute compensation already earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The <em>Cataldo </em>case, however, is easily distinguishable. When Cataldo was fired, some of the projects in which he had an interest were \u201cthen viable\u201d (i.e., had already begun). It was his unvested interest in these \u201cviable\u201d projects that the Appeals Court determined was reflective of past services: on each project the employee had \u201calready done a significant amount of work\u201d and the project had \u201cgone beyond the stage of a mere hope\u201d to \u201ca reasonable possibility of continuing on to completion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 741. Further, the court did not decide how the buy-back provision in the employee\u2019s contract (employer could repurchase employee\u2019s interest if his employment terminated during a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>project) would affect the employer\u2019s liability under the <em>Fortune </em>doctrine, see <em>id. </em>at 742; rather, the court ruled that the jury reasonably found that the employer had not exercised its repurchase rights. See <em>id. </em>The court suggested that the exercise of these rights might have altered its decision. See <em>id. </em>(buy-back provision is option that could limit employer\u2019s liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">In the present situation, the clause in the plaintiff\u2019s stock agreement, which provides for the immediate vesting of all unvested shares on a NetCentric merger or acquisition, is not proof that the unvested shares represent compensation for past services. The acceleration of the vesting period depends on an event that is unrelated to the plaintiff\u2019s role as an employee of NetCentric. Instead, it is related to the plaintiff\u2019s status as a founder and shareholder. See, e.g., <em>Merola </em>v. <em>Exergen Corp., </em>423 Mass. 461, 465 (1996) (investment in stock was investment in corporation\u2019s equity and \u201cwas not tied to employment in any formal way\u201d). The founders likely negotiated an acceleration clause in order to protect their investments against a change of control within the company. It is unlikely that they would have considered the immediate vesting of unvested shares as payment for the plaintiff\u2019s day-to-day work as the vice-president of sales and marketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Further, NetCentric never merged with, or was acquired by, another company.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The <em>Fortune </em>doctrine does not protect interests contingent on an event that has not occurred. See <em>McCone </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>393 Mass. 231, 234-235 (1984) (no breach of good faith where plaintiffs denied salary increases and corresponding pension benefits due to alleged arbitrary performance evaluations); <em>Gram II, supra </em>at 336 (commissions from future indorsements not owed to employee as \u201c[fjuture policy changes and future premium levels are speculative\u201d). Such speculative interests are neither \u201cclearly identifiable,\u201d <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., supra </em>at 304, nor \u201cclearly related to an employee\u2019s past service,\u201d <em>Gram I, supra </em>at 672. Cf. <em>id. </em>(employee entitled to commissions from policies already sold); <em>Fortune </em>v. <em>National Cash Register Co., supra </em>at 105-106 (employee owed commissions on sales already made). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Because we conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s unvested shares do not represent compensation earned but not yet paid, we need not determine whether his termination occurred in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">5. <em>Intentional interference with contractual relations. </em>The plaintiff alleged in his complaint that the \u201cdefendants\u201d intentionally interfered with his contractual relations by terminating his employment in order to repurchase his unvested shares.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He claimed that he had a contract providing that he would be employed by NetCentric, absent good cause, at least until all his shares had vested. He also claimed that the defendant directors were aware of this contract and voted to fire him. In their motion for summary judgment, the defendants argued that the plaintiff \u201chad no employment contract\u201d and thus his claim failed. The plaintiff responded that even if he did not have such an employment contract the defendants would not be entitled to summary judgment. He cited two cases, <em>Minasian </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>210 Mass. 250 (1911), and <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Dunphy, </em>177 Mass. 485 (1901), where employees at will brought claims for tortious interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The Superior Court judge granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment based on her conclusion that the plaintiff did not have a contract promising him that he would not be fired without cause until his shares had fully vested. The plaintiff has not contested this conclusion, but argues that the judge should have considered whether he could recover for intentional interference with his at-will employment. This issue was raised sufficiently to merit resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In an action for intentional interference with contractual relations, the plaintiff must prove that (1) he had a contract with a third party; (2) the defendant knowingly interfered with that contract; (3) the defendant\u2019s interference, in addition to being intentional, was improper in motive or means; and (4) the plaintiff was harmed by the defendant\u2019s actions. See <em>Swanset Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>423 Mass. 390, 397 (1996); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Shriners Hosp. for Crippled Children, </em>412 Mass. 469, 476 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>(1992). The nature of an at-will employment contract does not, by itself, preclude a finding that a relationship exists with which there can be tortious interference. See, e.g., <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Emmanuel College, </em>425 Mass. 761, 764 (1997); <em>King </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>418 Mass. 576, 587 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>424 Mass. 1 (1996); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Shriners Hosp. for Crippled Children, supra </em>at 476. See also Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766 comment g, at 10-11 (1979) (agreement at will is \u201cvalid and subsisting,\u201d until terminated, and \u201cdefendant may not improperly interfere with it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The plaintiff has produced no facts demonstrating that the defendant directors Anderson (on behalf of Northbridge), Barrows (on behalf of Matrix), Goldman, or Ryan interfered with his at-will contract. The plaintiff admitted that he had no personal knowledge concerning whether the directors participated in the decision to fire him, and he has adduced no admissible evidence, beyond his own unsubstantiated assertion, that these defendants or their respective employers participated or were in any way involved in the decision to terminate his employment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, summary judgment was properly granted for the defendant corporation, Northbridge, Matrix, Anderson, Barrows, Goldman, and Ryan on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">To maintain a cause of action for tortious interference against O\u2019Sullivan, the plaintiff must show that O\u2019Sullivan was not a party to his at-will employment contract and that O\u2019Sullivan improperly interfered with this contract. A party to the contract cannot be held liable for intentional interference. See <em>Appley </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>Locke, </em>396 Mass. 540, 543 (1986); <em>Mailhiot </em>v. <em>Liberty Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 525, 528 (1987). Where the corporation and the individual defendant are indistinguishable, including, without limitation, where the individual is the corporation\u2019s sole stockholder, it would exalt form over substance to hold that the corporation could not be sued successfully in contract, but that the corporation\u2019s alter ego could be sued successfully in tort. Subject to rare public policy exceptions, employment at will can be terminated for any reason or for no reason. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Driscoll, supra </em>at 582; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Shriners Hosp. for Crippled Children, supra </em>at 472. We would do considerable damage to this familiar policy if we permitted a tortious interference claim against an individual decision maker who is indistinguishable from the corporation itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">On the record before us (which is the same as that before the Superior Court judge on the summary judgment motion), a question of material fact exists whether O\u2019Sullivan and NetCentric are in fact indistinguishable. We note that O\u2019Sullivan is a founder of the company, the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, and a large shareholder of the closely held corporation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition, the admissible evidence in the record indicates that O\u2019Sullivan alone made the decision to fire the plaintiff. However, these facts do not permit us to conclude as a matter of law that O\u2019Sullivan controlled the operation of the corporation to the degree that he should be viewed as its alter ego.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Nonetheless, even assuming that O\u2019Sullivan could be distinguished from NetCentric, his bringing about of the termination of the plaintiff\u2019s at-will agreement does not constitute actionable \u201cinterference.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends that he was fired for the purpose of recapturing his unvested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>shares so that these shares could be issued to new employees without diluting the value of outstanding shares. The plaintiff, however, acknowledged in his stock agreement that his employment could be terminated \u201cfor any reason or no reason\u201d and that NetCentric had the right to repurchase his unvested shares in the event that he ceased to be employed by the company. By signing this agreement, the plaintiff accepted that NetCentric had an interest in his unvested shares and that the vesting of those shares was connected to his continued employment relationship with NetCentric. Thus, the plaintiff implicitly agreed that his at-will contract could be interfered with in this manner: he was subject to discharge without cause, and NetCentric could exercise its right to repurchase the plaintiff\u2019s unvested shares. That is what occurred here, and the plaintiff has no grounds to object. We therefore conclude that, in these circumstances, there is no basis for a tortious interference claim against O\u2019Sullivan, and we need not examine O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s motive in firing the plaintiff.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">6. <em>The defendants\u2019 counterclaim. </em>The defendants filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>counterclaim seeking the return of the plaintiff\u2019s unvested shares. Pursuant to the plaintiff\u2019s stock agreement, NetCentric has the right to repurchase these shares if the plaintiff ceases working for the company for any reason and the company exercises its right in writing within sixty days after the plaintiff\u2019s termination. The plaintiff is then required to tender his unvested shares to NetCentric within ten days. It is undisputed that the plaintiff was fired, that fifty-five per cent of his shares were unvested, and that he received a letter from NetCentric exercising its repurchase rights within sixty days of his discharge. The plaintiff has refused to tender his unvested shares to the company. Accordingly, the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on their counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We affirm the Superior Court\u2019s order allowing the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff\u2019s claims and the defendants\u2019 counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-9\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed jointly by the Associated Industries of Massachusetts and the New England Legal Foundation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\">The plaintiff did not appeal from the judgment with respect to his wrongful termination claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b478-11\">We affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiff\u2019s claim of intentional interference with contractual relations but on different grounds from those of the Superior Court judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The company was originally incorporated as Netlnfo Corporation.

The Restatement distinguishes between the law that governs corporate acts with respect to third persons and the law that governs the corporation\u2019s relationship to its shareholders. See Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Law, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 302 comment e, at 309 (\u201cThere is no reason why corporate acts [such as the making of contracts] should not be governed by the local law of different states\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Indeed, counsel for the defendants noted during oral argument that Net-Centric has ceased operations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The plaintiff does not distinguish among the defendants on this claim; however, NetCentric cannot be liable for interference with contractual relations between itself and its employees.

He relies on the deposition testimony of Paul English, a vice-president of NetCentric, who stated that O\u2019Sullivan or Paul MacKay, president of NetCentric, <em>\u201ctold </em>[him] that the board [of directors] was involved . . . voted to terminate\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s employment (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The burden is on the proponent of the evidence to establish' that the statement is admissible. English did not identify whether O\u2019Sullivan or MacKay was the source of his information. Cf. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>State, </em>726 So. 2d 1210, 1213 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998) (statement inadmissible where witness could not identify speaker). Because MacKay is neither a defendant nor an agent of any of the individual directors, the statement is hearsay if he were the speaker. See Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 801 (d) (2); P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 8.8.1, 8.8.6 at 496-497, 507 (7th ed. 1999).

Thus it may be a simple request or persuasion exerting only moral pressure. Or it may be a statement unaccompanied by any specific request but having the same effect as if the request were specifically made. Or it may be a threat by the actor of physical or economic harm to the third person or to persons in whose welfare he is interested. Or it may be the promise of a benefit to the third person if he will refrain from dealing with the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">\u201cOn the other hand, it is not necessary to show that the third party was induced to break the contract.
