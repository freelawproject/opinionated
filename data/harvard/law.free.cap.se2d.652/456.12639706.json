STEVEN AGEE.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Andrew Robert Alston was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter by a jury in the Circuit Court of the City of Charlottesville. In addition to a term of active incarceration, the circuit court also imposed a three-year term of postrelease supervision as required by Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2. On appeal in the Court of Appeals, Alston challenged the term of postrelease supervision, which he contends violates his rights under the Sixth Amendment, his right to due process, and constituted an abuse of sound judicial discretion. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. RELEVANT FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 9, 2004, a jury in the Circuit Court of the City of Charlottesville convicted Alston of voluntary manslaughter in the death of Walker Sisk. The jury recommended a sentence of three years active incarceration. The circuit court set the case for sentencing pending the completion of a pre-sentence investigation report pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-299.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to the sentencing hearing, Alston filed a motion challenging a term of postrelease supervision under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 on several grounds. Alston contended the application of that statute to permit the imposition of a term of postrelease supervision, in addition to the term of active incarceration recommended by the jury, violated the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches. In an additional memorandum filed with the circuit court, Alston argued that postrelease supervision under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 extends a sentence beyond the statutory maximum as determined by the line of cases represented by\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v. New Jersey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), and\n   <em>\n    Blakely v. Washington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    542 U.S. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). He also argued that the judicial construction of the statute contravened both the plain language of the statute and the legislature's intent in enacting it. When Alston argued his motion at the sentencing hearing, he expressly rejected a characterization of his challenge to Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 as one based on due process grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on the briefs and argument, the circuit court found that, as part of the statutory sentencing framework established by the General Assembly, postrelease supervision imposed under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 does not violate the separation of powers, and that neither\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   applied. Alston specifically requested that the circuit court identify any facts that it, as opposed to the jury, had found as a basis for imposing a specific term of postrelease supervision under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2: \"I want to be clear I've asked the Court to focus now on any fact the Court would have to take into consideration or determine . . . .\" The court responded that \"I don't think I need to make any other fact finding\" than the jury's verdict of guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The circuit court then imposed the jury's recommended three-year period of active incarceration, and ordered that Alston also be placed under postrelease supervision pursuant to \u00a7 19.2-295.2(A) for an additional three years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.\n   <em>\n    Alston v.

We awarded Alston this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal in this Court, Alston assigns error to the judgment of the Court of Appeals on four basic grounds. Initially, he contends the Court of Appeals erred because it failed to find that a term of postrelease supervision under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2, as applied\n   in this case, violates Alston's Sixth Amendment rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a corollary matter, Alston contends that Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 is unconstitutional on its face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Separately, Alston contends the imposition of the three-year term of postrelease supervision \"is arbitrary and violates the principals of sound judicial discretion.\" Lastly, Alston assigns error to the failure of the circuit court and Court of Appeals to hold that Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2, as interpreted, contradicts legislative intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Each of Alston's assignments of error raises questions of law. On appeal, we review such issues de novo.\n   <em>\n    Harrell v.

THE SIXTH AMENDMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Alston's primary argument is that the imposition of a term of postrelease supervision under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 constitutes an unconstitutional enhancement of the sentence of active incarceration permitted by the jury's sentence and findings of fact in his case. Alston bases his argument on the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury as explicated by the Supreme Court of the United States in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v. New Jersey\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, primarily\n   <em>\n    Blakely v. Washington\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cunningham v.

On those facts alone, under the federal sentencing guidelines, Booker was subject to a sentence of no more than 262 months incarceration. However, the trial judge found separately from the jury and only by a preponderance of the evidence, that Booker possessed a substantially greater quantity of cocaine than 92.5 grams and was also guilty of obstructing justice. Based on these additional findings, the federal sentencing guidelines required that the trial judge exceed the otherwise applicable maximum sentence of 262 months and sentence Booker to 360 months. In considering Booker's enhanced sentence, the Supreme Court restated its declaration in\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   \"that the `statutory maximum' for\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose\n   <em>\n    solely on the basis of facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Booker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/\">\n    543 U.S. at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because Booker's enhanced sentence was based on facts neither found by the jury nor admitted by him, that sentence violated his Sixth Amendment rights and was reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The jury never heard any evidence of the additional drug quantity, and the judge found it true by a preponderance of the evidence. Thus, just as in\n   <em>\n    Blakely,\n   </em>\n   \"the jury's verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.

In short, he argues that the \"relevant statutory maximum\" for\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   purposes is solely the three years of active incarceration set by the jury. He grounds this argument in his reading of Code \u00a7 19.2-295 as a state law limitation on the statutory maximum, but alternatively asserts that the circuit court also engaged in the type of additional fact-finding\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   prohibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Alston first contends that Code \u00a7 19.2-295, which provides that the term of confinement \"of a person convicted of a criminal offense shall be ascertained by the jury,\" unless the case is tried without a jury, is a Virginia statutory limit that also serves as the\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   relevant statutory maximum when a jury recommends a sentence. Alston thus concludes that the terms of Code \u00a7 19.2-295 prohibit any sentence under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 since the latter code section does not involve a sentence from the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Commonwealth responds that this issue was addressed in\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

The jury's verdict of guilty was the only factual predicate required by Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 before the statutory mandate was triggered that the circuit court \"impose a term of postrelease supervision of not less than six months nor more than three years.\" The jury finding of Alston's guilt was \"all the facts which the law makes essential to the punishment\" under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2. Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   requirement that the sentence imposed be \"solely on the basis of facts reflected in the jury verdict\" was met in this case and Alston's three-year term of postrelease supervision is within the \"relevant statutory maximum\" for that reason. The fact that the circuit court exercised its discretion in selecting the term of postrelease supervision to impose a term of between six months and three years does not alter our conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The choice as to the duration of that term was a matter within the inherent discretion of the court in imposing a sentence, and required no additional fact-finding in an\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   context. A court clearly has that authority under Virginia law when it chooses a point within the permitted statutory range. \"[W]hen a statute prescribes a maximum imprisonment penalty and the sentence does not exceed that maximum, the sentence will not be overturned as being an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Abdo v.

Such a choice within the relevant statutory range raises no\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   Sixth Amendment issue because no additional fact-finding is made by the sentencing judge under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 or required in addition to those facts found or implied by the jury's verdict. This conclusion is securely grounded in the Supreme Court's pronouncement in\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   that \"when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range, the defendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/\">\n    543 U.S. at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    accord Cunningham,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553669\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/270/\">\n    127 S.Ct. at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Lastly, Alston argues that even if the circuit court was within its authority to impose the term of postrelease supervision under\n   <em>\n    Apprendi,\n   </em>\n   the circuit court nonetheless acted to take that sentence out of any constitutional safe harbor by making factual findings independent of the jury, as the basis for its decision to fix a term of postrelease supervision at three years instead of a lesser term. This argument is without merit and has no basis in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Contrary to Alston's contention, the circuit court specifically declined to accept Alston's request to state findings of fact as the basis for the court's choice in the length of the postrelease term. In fact, the circuit court noted that no fact-finding on its part was required: \"Well I don't think I need to make any other fact finding other than to impose. . . . I think my discretion is only limited to how much.\" Any observations by the circuit court in imposing the term of postrelease\n   supervision were remarks of a general nature, which were not findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Accordingly, we find no error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals that the imposition of a term of postrelease supervision under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 did not violate any rights of Alston under the Sixth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   C. PROCEDURAL DEFAULT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Alston argues in another assignment of error that the duration of the term of postrelease supervision imposed by the circuit court was arbitrary, in violation of his due process rights, and an abuse of sound judicial discretion. The Court of Appeals found Alston's due process claim was procedurally defaulted, and Alston also separately assigns that determination as error. The Commonwealth contends Alston's appellate claims of arbitrary action and abuse of discretion by the circuit court were also defaulted because they were never made in the circuit court. We agree with the Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The rules of this Court limit the consideration of the Court of Appeals to those rulings upon which timely objection has been made, with the grounds for such objection, and provide that a \"mere statement that the judgment . . . is contrary to the law . . . is not sufficient to constitute a question to be ruled upon on appeal.\" Rule 5A:18. Our rules similarly limit the consideration of this Court. Rule 5:25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In considering whether or not Alston preserved his due process claim, the Court of Appeals noted the transcript of the circuit court sentencing hearing. At that hearing, Alston's counsel told the circuit court that \"due process [is] not our challenge\" to the application of a postrelease term under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals held that Alston's due process claim on appeal was barred by Rule 5A:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Alston points to no place in the record where his due process claim was preserved so as to contradict the judgment of the Court of Appeals on this issue. Neither does Alston plead good cause for his failure to assert a due process claim or seek application of the ends of justice exception. Thus, the Court of Appeals did not err in holding any due process claim by Alston was waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Commonwealth also asserts that Alston's arbitrary action and abuse of discretion arguments are actually a thinly veiled attempt to raise his defaulted due process claim and that neither of those claims was raised in the circuit court. Again, we agree with the Commonwealth. The record does not reflect that Alston ever argued to the circuit court that imposition of the term of postrelease supervision was either arbitrary or an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, this claim is defaulted under Rule 5:25 and will not be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   D. LEGISLATIVE INTENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, Alston argues that the application of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 by the circuit court and the Court of Appeals contravened the General Assembly's intent in enacting that statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \"While in the construction of statutes the constant endeavor of the courts is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, that intention must be gathered from the words used. . . . Where the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\"\n   <em>\n    Chase v.

Accordingly, the statute clearly required that Alston's term of postrelease supervision be in addition to his term of active incarceration. Alston's argument that \"[t]here is no clear language\n   <em>\n    requiring\n   </em>\n   that the postrelease term be in addition to the full sentence\" is contradicted by the plain language of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2: he begs of us a construction of the statute that the words \"in addition to any other punishment\" cannot bear. Alston's argument on his final assignment of error is thus without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Alston's three-year term of active incarceration is not at issue in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2.\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The Sixth Amendment provides in pertinent part that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury. . . .\" U.S. Const. amend. VI.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3.\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    In Alston's view, a term of postrelease supervision under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 could be imposed, consonant with Code \u00a7 19.2-295, only if an equivalent part of the sentence of active incarceration permitted by the jury recommendation were suspended.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4.\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Alston's statutory language argument under Code \u00a7 19.2-295 is also rebutted by the multitude of actions a trial court is authorized to take by statute in addition to any sentence \"ascertained by the jury.\" These include ordering substance abuse screenings under Code \u00a7 19.2-299.2 of a person convicted of possession of controlled substances; collection of a DNA sample under Code \u00a7 19.2-310.2 of a person convicted of a felony; and ordering restitution to victims under Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1, to name but three. If Alston's theory of the exclusiveness of a jury sentence under Code \u00a7 19.2-295 were correct, all the foregoing could arguably be a legal nullity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5.\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Alston's second assignment of error is that Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 is unconstitutional on its face. To establish facial unconstitutionality, Alston \"must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which [\u00a7 19.2-295.2] would be valid.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v. Salerno,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n     481 U.S. 739\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 745,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n     107 S.Ct. 2095\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105,1148012\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/95/697/\">\n     95 L.Ed.2d 697\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1987). As our resolution of Alston's first assignment of error reflects, we find no constitutional infirmity in the application of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 in this case. Thus, Alston's contention that the section is unconstitutional on its face obviously fails and we need comment no further on this assignment of error.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
