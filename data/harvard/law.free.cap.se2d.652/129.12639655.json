KINSER.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This dispute arose out of the sale of an apartment complex located in Henrico County known as Fox Rest Apartments (Fox Rest), which was the sole asset of a partnership named Fox Rest Associates, L.P. (Partnership). Some of the Partnership's limited partners filed a derivative suit on behalf of the Partnership pursuant to Code \u00a7 50-73.62 and sought monetary damages against George B. Little, individually and as trustee for the general partner of Fox Rest, and George B. Little &amp; Associates, P.C., a Virginia professional corporation (collectively, Defendants).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In their motion for judgment, the Limited Partners asserted, among other things, counts for breach of fiduciary duty and legal malpractice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After a bench trial, the circuit court held that Little breached not only the standard of care applicable to attorneys in his role as the attorney for the Partnership but also his fiduciary duties while performing the tasks and responsibilities of the Partnership's general partner. The circuit court awarded damages to the Partnership against the Defendants, jointly and severally, in the total amount of $3,161,258.32, plus prejudgment interest. The majority of the damages comprised what the circuit court referred to as \"tax damages.\" The circuit court also awarded attorneys' fees and costs to the Limited Partners individually, in addition to the other damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We awarded the Defendants this appeal on five assignments of error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the first assignment of error, the Defendants challenge the award of \"tax damages\" on four separate grounds: (a) the Partnership's general partner did not have the authority or duty to make a tax-free exchange when selling Fox Rest; (b) \"tax damages\" are not damages to the Partnership and thus are not recoverable in a derivative action; (c) the Limited Partners did not establish that Little's conduct proximately caused their damages; and (d) the Limited Partners failed to mitigate their damages. In the four remaining assignments of error, the Defendants contest: (1) the circuit court's award of $400,000 for \"wrongfully retained funds\" from the sale of Fox Rest; (2) the award of $17,951.32 for over-charges in Little's legal bills to the Partnership; (3) the award of punitive damages in the amount of $175,000; and (4) the award of attorneys' fees to the Limited Partners in addition to the other damages awarded rather than an award of attorneys' fees from the \"common fund\" recovered for the Partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We also awarded an appeal on the Limited Partners' two assignments of cross-error. The Limited Partners assert that the circuit court erred either by refusing to award an\n   additional $2,050,000 in damages against the Defendants or by failing to award at least a sum representing \"the difference between the appraised market value [of Fox Rest] and sale price on the date of sale.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons explained hereinafter, we will affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.

Fox Rest.\" The Partnership Agreement directed that the Partnership be dissolved when, among other things, the general partner was removed or substantially all the Partnership's property was sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Little admitted that the Partnership Agreement, which he drafted, allowed him to hire himself \"for whatever [he] wanted to do.\" The circuit court concluded that Little, \"[a]cting for the [g]eneral [p]artner, . . . hired himself to perform virtually every duty of the [g]eneral [p]artner, and billed the Partnership accordingly at his hourly rates.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court further concluded that Little, \"[a]cting under duties he thus delegated to himself from the [g]eneral [p]artner, . . . hired himself and his law firm to provide legal services and advice to\n   <em>\n    himself\n   </em>\n   as the acting [g]eneral [p]artner.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the first half of 2002, Little received two separate offers to purchase Fox Rest, but he declined both offers. Later in the year, however, Little changed his mind. In September 2002, Little received a letter from Edmund\n   S. Ruffin, Jr. (Ruffin), on behalf of \"the Ruffin and Cooke family members that [were] limited partners\" in the Partnership. Ruffin requested that Little consent to the substitution of a new general partner for the Partnership in the place of the Cargill Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Little testified at trial that this letter \"scared [him] to death\" because he believed that, if he did not agree to the proposed course of action, the general partner would be removed, thereby effecting dissolution of the Partnership according to the terms of the Partnership Agreement. Dissolution would trigger a sale of the property \"under the hammer\" which, according to Little, \"puts the seller in a very weak position.\" Believing that the proposed changes would not be beneficial to the Partnership but that a sale of the property would be in the best interests of the Partnership's investors, Little decided to sell Fox Rest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   After making that decision, Little reviewed the Partnership Agreement and concluded that he, acting alone, had the authority to sell Fox Rest. Little, however, believed that he did not have the authority under the terms of the Partnership Agreement to engage in a \"tax-free exchange\" because, in his view, the Partnership \"was a sole project partnership.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In a letter dated October 14, 2002, Ruffin again requested Little to cooperate in the substitution of a new general partner for the Partnership, as Little had not responded to the first correspondence. Little admitted that he did not answer the first letter because he was trying to sell Fox Rest before the general partner, i.e., Little, was removed. Two days later, in correspondence dated October 16, 2002, Little advised the Partnership's investors that, \"[p]ursuant to the powers conferred in the original Partnership Agreement, [he,] as [g]eneral [p]artner[, had] committed to the sale of the entire complex for a gross sales price of $10,250,000.00.\" Little also told the investors that settlement would occur in January 2003 and that they would incur capital gains taxes on the transaction. In response, Ruffin voiced his concern about Little's unilateral decision to sell Fox Rest within weeks after being asked to \"step down as general partner.\" The closing on the sale of Fox Rest took place on January 30, 2003 and the Limited Partners subsequently filed this derivative suit on behalf of the Partnership. After a multi-day bench trial, the circuit court concluded, based on expert testimony, that Little committed numerous acts of legal malpractice and breaches of fiduciary duties. In a letter opinion, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At a minimum, Little breached his duties as a lawyer to reasonably communicate with the Limited Partners, to refrain from self-dealing, and to make adequate disclosure of material facts to the Limited Partners. He also erred in failing to consider or inform the Limited Partners of the possibility of a tax-free exchange of Fox Rest as an alternative to an outright sale, and wrongly sold Fox Rest without properly informing himself of the Property's geographic marketability or time frame for marketing the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The circuit court further concluded that many of the acts of legal malpractice also constituted breaches of Little's fiduciary duties. Continuing, the court found that Little breached his duty of loyalty and acted to further his own interests, instead of the Partnership's, by taking a substantial commission for the sale of Fox Rest, by retaining sale proceeds for the purpose of defending potential litigation, and by contracting to sell Fox Rest \"in a hurried fashion without disclosing the business of the Partnership to the Limited Partners.\" As previously stated, the Defendants do not contest any of these findings on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   With regard to the five categories of damages challenged on appeal, the circuit court made the following holdings:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A. Based on several provisions of the Partnership Agreement, the circuit court\n   concluded that Little had the authority to conduct a tax-free exchange of Fox Rest and that Little's \"failure to consider its availability and advise the Limited Partners accordingly deviated from the standard of care\" as an attorney and breached his fiduciary duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court awarded the sum of $2,294,557 as \"tax damages\" caused by Little's failure to advise about a tax-free exchange. The court based its award on testimony of the Limited Partners' witness who qualified as an expert in accounting matters related to partnerships, tax-free exchanges, and taxation. The expert explained that he arrived at the figure by estimating the total tax consequences incurred by the Partnership's investors as a result of the sale of Fox Rest even though he did not have accurate tax information from all the Partnership's investors. He stated that if a tax-free exchange had been completed, the taxes would not have been owed by the individual investors. However, since that did not occur, the expert opined that the Partnership was damaged \"by taking an asset and reducing its value by the taxes that were paid from the sale.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B. The circuit court awarded the sum of $400,000 to compensate for funds Little \"wrongfully withheld for indemnity purposes.\" When Little forwarded the proceeds of the sale to the investors, he advised them in a letter dated February 4, 2003 that he was withholding approximately $300,000 to $400,000 \"to cover litigation expenses\" if any of the Partnership's investors pursued legal action regarding the sale of Fox Rest. The circuit court concluded that withholding $400,000 \"for a potential lawsuit . . . fell below the standard of care.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   C. The circuit court awarded the sum of $17,951.32 to compensate for the amount Little over-charged on legal bills to the Partnership on various occasions. The over-charging occurred when Little billed the Partnership for an amount greater than the product obtained by multiplying Little's hourly rate by the number of hours of work itemized on a bill. Little stated that he increased his legal fees in some instances because, in his opinion, the legal services rendered to his client were more valuable than the amount reflected by merely multiplying the number of hours expended by his hourly rate. The circuit court concluded that Little's over-charging fell below the standard of care for an attorney because the Limited Partners never saw the bills and thus were not in a position to question any erroneous charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   D. The circuit court awarded the sum of $175,000 in punitive damages. The court concluded that punitive damages were warranted because of Little's \"wrongful billing,\" which, according to the court, constituted \"`misconduct or actual malice, or such recklessness or negligence as to evince a conscious disregard of the rights of another.'\" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Cardinal Holding Co. v. Deal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"896516\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/258/623/#p633\">\n    258 Va. 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 633,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20S.E.2d%20614\">\n    522 S.E.2d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620 (1999)). According to the circuit court, the wrongful billing consisted of Little's overcharging his client, withholding monies for himself that belonged to the Partnership, unilaterally altering his billing procedures without first informing his client, and taking \"`commissions'\" and \"`premiums'\" for work already charged at an hourly rate, thereby \"`double billing'\" his client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   E. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 50-73.65, the circuit court awarded the Limited Partners their reasonable attorneys' fees in the amount of $577,691 and costs in the amount of $152,874.76. The court reasoned that an award of attorneys' fees was \"justified under the `common fund' exception to the American Rule\" due to the Limited Partners' success in the derivative action. According to the circuit court, the award of attorneys' fees and costs was to be \"added on\" to the total amount of damages otherwise awarded. The court further explained that it awarded the attorneys' fees and costs to the Limited Partners individually, but that it awarded all the other damages to the Partnership, not to the Limited Partners, since they brought this\n   case as a derivative suit on behalf of the Partnership.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We will address the Defendants' assignments of error challenging several of the circuit court's damage awards in the order previously set forth. We will then decide the Limited Partners' assignments of cross-error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A. Tax Damages\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the first assignment of error, the Defendants challenge the circuit court's award of \"tax damages\" on four separate grounds. To resolve this assignment of error, however, we need only address the question whether the tax consequences incurred by the Partnership's investors as a result of the sale of Fox Rest were damages to the Partnership that can be recovered in this derivative suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   With regard to this issue, the Defendants first point out that the \"tax damages\" awarded by the circuit court represented the estimated collective income tax liability incurred by the Partnership's investors as a result of the sale of Fox Rest. Thus, the \"tax damages,\" according to the Defendants, were not damages sustained by the Partnership since it, like any partnership, does not pay taxes. Instead, the tax consequences of selling Fox Rest represented damages to all the Partnership's investors, which include the Limited Partners. For that reason, the Defendants argue that the \"tax damages\" cannot be recovered in this derivative suit since the purpose of such a suit is to recover those damages actually suffered by the Partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The provisions of Code \u00a7 50-73.62 permit \"[a] limited partner [to] bring an action in the right of a limited partnership to recover a judgment in its favor to the same extent that a stockholder may bring an action for a derivative suit under the Stock Corporation Act.\" \"A derivative action is an equitable proceeding in which a shareholder asserts, on behalf of the corporation, a claim that belongs to the corporation rather than the shareholder.\"\n   <em>\n    Simmons v.

The claim asserted in the suit belongs to the limited partnership, not to the limited partners, and the limited partnership itself must have sustained injury. Any recovery belongs to the limited partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Limited Partners do not challenge these principles. They, however, argue that the value of the Partnership decreased by virtue of the sale of Fox Rest. In their words, \"the `tax damages' were computed as a surrogate for the loss of the value of the [P]artnership as an investment vehicle.\" To support their argument, the Limited Partners point to the testimony of their own accounting expert as well as that of the Defendants' witness who qualified as an expert in the field of certified public accounting and partnership taxation. The Limited Partners' expert opined that the Partnership was damaged because the value of its asset was reduced \"by the taxes that were paid from the sale.\" Similarly, the Defendants' expert witness answered affirmatively when asked if the value of an investment vehicle declines when its only asset is converted to cash and then part of the cash has to be distributed to pay taxes. According to the Limited Partners, the diminution in value would not have occurred if Little either had not sold Fox Rest or had effected a tax-free exchange. We do not agree with the Limited Partners' position for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Their argument overlooks the legal posture of a limited partnership with regard to income tax liability. The Partnership's investors - not the Partnership - incurred whatever income tax liability resulted from the sale of Fox Rest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.R.C. \u00a7 701 (\"A partnership as such shall not be subject to the income tax imposed by this chapter.

The circuit court therefore erred in its assessment of \"damages to the Partnership . . . relating to any tax consequences attributed to the Partnership.\" There were no tax consequences attributable to the Partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Limited Partners nevertheless argue that the sale of Fox Rest converted the Partnership's sole asset to cash and that the value of the Partnership decreased when that cash had to be distributed to pay the Limited Partners' and other investors' income tax liabilities. The sale of Fox Rest did convert the Partnership's asset to cash, but, at that moment in time, the value of the Partnership's asset was the same as before the sale; it did not diminish in value. The sale just changed the nature of the Partnership's asset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Furthermore, the Limited Partners' assertion that cash had to be distributed to pay the investors' income tax liabilities resulting from the sale of Fox Rest is not supported by the terms of the Partnership Agreement. Any revenues of the Partnership not required to meet its obligations and to conduct future operations were to be distributed to\n   the investors on a quarterly basis. Upon dissolution of the Partnership, its assets were to be distributed in cash or in kind in proportion to each partner's capital account as adjusted according to a formula set forth in the Partnership Agreement.

At trial, Little's testimony established that he withheld only $350,000 and that the balance of $284,000 remains after paying legitimate Partnership expenses. Little also candidly admitted that he improperly used either $20,000 or $21,000 of the $350,000 to pay his own legal expenses and that he should pay back that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Limited Partners presented no evidence to refute Little's calculations as to the amount of money remaining or the legitimacy of the Partnership bills paid out of the withheld funds. Thus, we conclude that the Limited Partners did not carry their burden to prove that they were entitled to an award of $400,000 for funds wrongfully withheld. Contrary to their argument, it was not Little's burden to produce records to confirm his calculations. Also, Little's admission that\n   he should not have withheld the funds does not change our conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Therefore, we will reverse the circuit court's judgment awarding $400,000 for wrongfully withheld funds. Based on the evidence at trial and Little's acknowledgement that he should pay back the amount expended for his legal fees, we will enter judgment against the Defendants, jointly and severally, in favor of the Partnership in the amount of $305,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   C. Over-Charges\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Little claims the circuit court erred by awarding $17,951.32 for over-charges in legal bills to the Partnership \"when such damages were neither pled nor disclosed in any of Plaintiffs' pleadings or discovery responses (including those specifically directed to damages).\" The Limited Partners counter first by claiming that the Defendants waived this issue because they did not object to the admission of their legal bills, which evidenced the $17,951.32 in over-charges. They also argue that the over-charges were prima facie evidence of Little's attorney malpractice and breach of fiduciary duties and that the circuit court could therefore award \"general damages\" for the over-charges. Finally, the Limited Partners claim that, since the Defendants were obviously aware of the over-charges reflected on their legal bills to the Partnership, \"it is reasonable to conclude . . . that [the Defendants] were on notice that the derivative action subsumed these general damages.\" We agree with the Defendants and will reverse the circuit court's award of damages for the over-charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   While the Limited Partners did allege certain overcharges by Little in their motion for judgment, such as the commission Little paid himself for the sale of Fox Rest and the premiums Little charged for the two refinancing loans, they did not allege the specific over-charges at issue. The first mention of these alleged over-charges appears to be in the Limited Partners' proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted to the circuit court several days before trial. In that pleading, the Limited Partners identified specific dates in Little's legal bills where the product derived by multiplying the hourly billing rate by the number of hours worked did not correspond to the total amount charged to the Partnership. Yet, the Limited Partners did not ask for damages to be awarded for these particular over-charges in their proposed award of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Limited Partners did, however, specifically mention the over-charges in opening statement: \"[W]e will be asking for the fee miscalculations, the $17,951 that are simple bad arithmetic errors on legal bills that nobody ever saw, but [Little] pulled the money out of the trust.\" In the Defendants' opening statement, they responded:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Now, Mr. Vick [counsel for the Limited Partners] seemed to raise some issue about collecting on those bills. Well, that's not in this case, and I don't know whether he's now making it a part of this case, but that's not part of this case. Never has been. It's not in their proposed findings of fact [or] conclusions of law, not in anything, so I don't know where he's coming from now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   During the Limited Partners' case-in-chief, a number of Little's legal bills to the Partnership were admitted into evidence without objection. By performing mathematical calculations, it is evident that these bills reflect the over-charges at issue. However, once it became apparent to the Defendants that the Limited Partners were using these bills to claim damages for Little's over-charges, the Defendants objected, stating that the \"fees that he's talked about . . . to Mr. Little . . . are not damages sought in this case.\" Moreover, at the close of the Limited Partners' case-in-chief, the Defendants moved to strike, among other things, the evidence of the overcharges stating: \"[T]hat's not pled, and there really is no evidence on it; not a word about it in their damage interrogatory, nothing in their proposed findings of fact. And we don't think that should remain as part of the case.\" The circuit court overruled the motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Subsequently, when the Limited Partners asked Little during cross-examination about the over-charges, the Defendants objected stating: \"[T]here is no claim made for this. There is nothing in the motion for judgment. There is nothing [in] the complaint. There is nothing in their proposed findings. This is a claim that we are essentially hearing about for the first time now without really any opportunity to prepare for the defense.\" The Defendants further stated: \"[W]e asked a discovery interrogatory - damage interrogatory: Tell us what your damages are. Not a word about this.\" The circuit court overruled the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Based on the Defendants' arguments to the circuit court at various stages of the proceedings, we reject the Limited Partners' suggestion that the Defendants waived any objection to the damage claim for the over-charges. The circuit court clearly had several occasions to rule on the Defendants' objection.\n   <em>\n    See Nusbaum,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=273%20Va.%20385\">\n    273 Va. at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12637897\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/641/494/#p506\">\n    641 S.E.2d at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   With regard to the merits of the Defendants' challenge to this award of damages, the Limited Partners, on brief, do not dispute the Defendants' assertion that the Limited Partners never identified over-charges in the amount of $17,951.32 in response to discovery requests for each component of the Limited Partners' claimed damages. Instead, they attempt to justify their failure to disclose this category of damages until shortly before trial by arguing that the Defendants were on notice that the derivative action \"subsumed these general damages\" since the over-charges appeared on the Defendants' legal bills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Limited Partners' position defeats one of the purposes of discovery, \"to disclose all relevant and material evidence before trial in order that the trial may be an effective method for arriving at the truth and not `a battle of wits between counsel.'\"\n   <em>\n    Guilford Nat'l Bank of Greensboro v.

Cross-Error\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   At trial, the Limited Partners presented expert testimony establishing the fair market value of Fox Rest on the closing date of the sale, January 30, 2003, and on a date shortly before trial, June 30, 2005, to be $11,400,000 and $12,300,000, respectively. The circuit court, however, refused to award additional damages to the Limited Partners based on either of these valuations. Although the circuit court concluded that Little committed legal malpractice and breached his fiduciary duties by entering into a contract to sell Fox Rest only 34 days after deciding to sell the property \"in the face of a challenge to his authority\" and by marketing the property to only two potential buyers, it nevertheless found that \"the damages relating to the hurried aspect of the sale of Fox Rest are too speculative.\" In its letter opinion, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The [c]ourt cannot award damages relating to the value of Fox Rest at the time of the hurried sale because the [c]ourt cannot determine the amount of damages. . . . The [c]ourt finds that the [Limited Partners] had the burden of proving what the property was worth as of the date the contract of sale was entered into. The [Limited Partners] did not meet their burden; therefore, damages pertaining to the value of Fox Rest at the date of sale are too speculative to award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Limited Partners assign cross-error \"to the circuit court's refusal to award an additional $2,050,000 in damages . . . resulting from the sale of Fox Rest . . . given that these damages were non-speculative and were actually incurred by the . . . Partnership.\" Alternatively, if this Court does not grant relief on the first assignment of cross-error, the Limited Partners, in their second assignment of cross-error, assert that \"the circuit court should have at least awarded the difference between the appraised market value and sale price on the date of sale, which defendants argued below is a proper measure of sale-related damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Although the Limited Partners challenge the circuit court's conclusion that their proof of damages was too speculative, their assignments of cross-error do not contest the circuit court's holding that \"the [Limited Partners] had the burden of proving what the\n   property was worth as of the date the contract of sale was entered into.\" Thus, that holding is the law of the case,\n   <em>\n    see Landmark Communications, Inc. v.

The fair market value of Fox Rest on either January 30, 2003 or June 30, 2005 was irrelevant and did not establish any damages on the date of breach.
