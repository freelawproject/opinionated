Both contend that pretrial motions to suppress evidence seized from their residence and introduced at their trial should have been granted because the affidavits supporting the search warrants contained false statements and lacked probable cause. After careful review, we find that there was sufficient corroborating information in the affidavits to support a finding of probable cause and affirm their convictions without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">Dorsey also appeals his sentence. He argues that the government refused to file a motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5K1.1 to punish him for exercising his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, thereby denying him due process of law. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">At sentencing, the district court determined that Dorsey\u2019s advisory Guidelines range was 168 to 210 months. Dorsey then moved the court to compel the government to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion because after his arrest he immediately cooperated with the police. Dorsey\u2019s cooperation led to his drug supplier\u2019s arrest and the seizure of a quarter kilogram of cocaine. About four months after his initial arrest and cooperation, Dorsey was arrested on the instant federal drug charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-15\">Asserting that the government had earlier informed him that he could earn a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure because of his cooperation if he pleaded guilty, Dorsey argued that the government impermissibly refused to file the motion once Dorsey decided to go to trial. The government responded that it never told Dorsey that he had earned a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure but rather told Dorsey that the circumstances surrounding his minimal amount of cooperation would be considered if he cooperated fully and completely. At sentencing, the government stated that Dorsey \u201cchose not to continue with cooperation. He chose to go to trial.\u201d Dorsey responded that irrespective of whether his cooperation was minimal, it was obvious that his cooperation was complete, and the government\u2019s refusal to move for a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure based on his decision to go to trial was an unconstitutional motive. The district court denied Dorsey\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b978-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s authority to depart downward from the guideline range under \u00a7 5K1.1 in the absence of a motion by the government. <em>See United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1498 (11th Cir.1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-18\">Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that \u201c[u]pon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the court may depart from the guidelines.\u201d U.S. Sentenoing Guidelines MANUAL \u00a7 5K1.1. We have stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>the government has \u201c \u2018a power, not a duty, to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1500 (quoting <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992)). Therefore, a district court cannot grant a downward departure for substantial assistance absent a motion by the government. <em>Id. </em>at 1501. However, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cfederal district courts have authority to review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive,\u201d like \u201crace or religion.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840. A defendant who merely claims to have provided substantial assistance or who makes only generalized allegations of an improper motive is not entitled to a remedy or to even an evidentiary hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840. Thus, judicial review is appropriate only \u201cwhen there is an allegation <em>and </em>a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation.\u201d <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1502 (citation and footnote omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">We have not previously decided whether the government\u2019s refusal to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion to punish a defendant for exercising his constitutional right to a jury trial is an unconstitutional motive under <em>Wade. </em>We need not reach that issue here because Dorsey is unable to make the required threshold showing of impropriety. The government offered Dorsey a \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance downward departure in exchange for both Dorsey\u2019s cooperation and guilty plea, and Dorsey has expressly acknowledged that the government\u2019s offer was conditioned on his entry of a guilty plea. Dorsey\u2019s admission demonstrates that the offer was made \u201cin the \u2018give-and-take\u2019 of plea bargaining,\u201d in which Dorsey was \u201cfree to accept or reject the prosecution\u2019s offer.\u201d Thus, no dispute exists that the government made its offer in the context of a plea negotiation, which offer Dorsey rejected when he chose to go to trial. In this context, there was \u201cno such element of punishment or retaliation,\u201d and the government\u2019s later refusal to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion was constitutionally permissible under <em>Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 363, 98 S.Ct. 663, 668, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978) (citation omitted) (discussing the \u201cgive and take\u201d and \u201cmutuality of advantage\u201d of plea bargaining).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">Notwithstanding the context in which the offer was made, the record independently supports an affirmance. First, no claim or evidence exists that Dorsey could have provided any assistance in expectation of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion because he had already provided all of the assistance he would ever provide before facing the federal charges (and before the government raised the possibility of a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure). Next, Dorsey admits that he was aware that the government did not consider Dorsey\u2019s prior assistance sufficient to warrant a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion and would condition any departure motion on Dorsey\u2019s providing future substantial assistance (in addition to pleading guilty). Dorsey\u2019s admission strongly supports the government\u2019s proffer that it legitimately withheld the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion in the absence of substantial assistance from Dorsey. Lastly, a careful review of the record suggests that the district court properly found that Dorsey\u2019s proffer in support of his motion was insufficient to constitute the \u201csubstantial showing\u201d of unconstitutional motivation or actual vindictiveness necessary to the claimed constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Finally, Dorsey argues that his sentence was otherwise unreasonable. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>review a final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, which requires that we review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Dorsey\u2019s guidelines range was 168 to 210 months, and the district court sentenced him to 210 months. We ordinarily expect a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable, and the appellant has the burden of establishing the unreasonableness of the sentence in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Having considered Dorsey\u2019s arguments and the record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Dorsey.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
