(\u201cCentech\u201d) brought suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims seeking declaratory and injunctive relief in connection with the decision by the Department of the Air Force (\u201cAir Force\u201d) to solicit revised proposals for the services contract previously awarded to Centech. The Court of Federal Claims denied Centech\u2019s request. In so doing, it held that the Air Force\u2019s action was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. It arrived at that holding after concluding that Centech\u2019s original proposal for the contract was not acceptable because it did not comply with a statutory requirement for award and a material provision of the solicitation. <em>Centech Group, Inc. v. United States, </em>79 Fed. Cl. 562, 577 (2007). Centech now appeals the court\u2019s decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">The pertinent facts are not in dispute. On February 28, 2005, the Air Force issued a request for proposals (\u201cRFP\u201d) for advisory and assistance services to support the Aerospace Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Activities (\u201cARD-TEAS\u201d) at the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base in California. <em>Id. </em>at 564-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">The ARDTEAS procurement was a small business set aside. <em>Id. </em>at 565. Under the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 631-657f, 657i-657o, a party may not be awarded a contract as a small business concern unless it agrees that, \u201cin the case of a contract for services (except construction), at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 644(o)(1)(A) (2006). The Limitation on Subcontracting (\u201cLOS\u201d) clause, set forth at 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.219-14 (2008), implements the mandate of the Act. The LOS clause requires an offeror to agree that at least 50 percent of its personnel costs under the contract will be based upon work of its own employees. 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.219-14. The clause states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-13\">(b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contraetor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-14\">(1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-15\"><em>Id. </em>The RFP incorporated the LOS clause by reference. <em>Centech, </em>79 Fed.Cl. at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-16\">The Air Force disclosed to prospective offerors for the ARDTEAS contract that it would interpret the LOS clause in accordance with Air Force Policy Memorandum 2004-PK-007 (the \u201cPolicy Memorandum\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 566. Accordingly, prior to issuing the RFP, on August 20, 2004, the Air Force electronically transmitted the Policy Memorandum to prospective offerors. <em>Id. </em>The transmission stated in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-17\">1. FAR Clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec. 1996), which applies to ... small business set-aside contracts, states the small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>business prime contractor must perform specified minimum amounts of work, when the contract has been set aside for [a] small business....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-4\">2. [W]ithin [Air Force Material Command], we interpret the clause at 52.219-14 to mean that the minimum amounts of work can be performed by the collective efforts of either small business members of a formal joint venture or a small business prime contractor together with the first tier small business subeontractor(s), when the circumstances outlined in attachment 1 are present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay7\"><em>Id. </em>at 566-67 (quoting the Policy Memorandum (footnotes omitted)). Attachment 1 to the Policy Memorandum stated that \u201c[p]rime-subcontraetor teams could be a mix of large business and small business subcontractors [so long as] performance of work requirements [was] met by the cooperative efforts of the small prime contractor and the small business members of the subcontractor group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567 n. 7 (quoting Attachment 1). In short, according to the Policy Memorandum, a small business prime contractor could meet the requirements of the LOS clause if at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel was based upon the work of employees of the small business prime contractor alone, or in combination with the work of employees of small business subcontractors with which the prime contractor entered into a cooperative effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Four offerors, including Centech and the incumbent contractor, Tybrin Corporation (\u201cTybrin\u201d), submitted proposals in response to the RFP. <em>Id. </em>Centech proposed to apportion the work between its own employees and those of subcontractors, including a large and a small business. <em>Id. </em>More specifically, relying on the Policy Memorandum in structuring its proposed cost/price model, Centech planned to incur itself 43.2 percent of the total cost of contract personnel using its own employees. The proposal indicated, however, that Centech would combine the efforts of its own employees and small business subcontractor employees so that the resulting combined personnel costs would exceed 50 percent of the personnel costs incurred in performing the contract work. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">After offers were submitted, the Air Force\u2019s Source Selection Evaluation Team (\u201cSSET\u201d) evaluated Centech\u2019s proposal for compliance with the LOS clause. The SSET determined that, based on its proposal, Centech would and could comply with the LOS clause. On April 28, 2006, the Air Force awarded the ARDTEAS contract to Centech. <em>Id. </em>at 568. Centech\u2019s awarded contract incorporated the LOS clause by reference. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">On May 26, 2006, Tybrin protested the award of the contract to the Government Accountability Office (\u201cGAO\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claiming that the Air Force had failed to evaluate submitted proposals in accordance with the RFP\u2019s stated evaluation criteria. <em>Id. </em>Subsequently, on June 29, 2006, Tybrin filed a supplemental protest with GAO, claiming that the Air Force should have disqualified Centech\u2019s proposal for noncompliance with the LOS clause. <em>Id. </em>Responding to Tybrin\u2019s Supplemental Protest, the Air Force conceded that Centech proposed that its own employees would account for only 43.2 percent of the cost of contract performance. <em>Id. </em>The Air Force stated, however, that Centech\u2019s proposal complied with the LOS clause as interpreted by the Policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>Memorandum, because the collective efforts of the personnel from Centech and its small business subcontractors would exceed 50 percent of the cost of contract performance for personnel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">After receiving Tybrin\u2019s supplemental protest, GAO sought the views of the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d). <em>Id. </em>Responding, the SBA took the position that, in accordance with 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 644(o)(1)(A) and its own regulation, <em>see </em>13 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.6(a)(1) (2008), a small business receiving a set-aside contract must agree to meet by itself the requirements of the LOS clause. <em>Centech, </em>79 Fed.Cl. at 568. The SBA\u2019s regulation states that a small business must agree that, \u201c[i]n the case of a contract for services (except construction), the concern will perform at least 50 percent of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel with its own employees.\u201d 13 C.F.R. . \u00a7 125.6(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">On August 4, 2006, the Air Force stayed performance of Centech\u2019s contract while it reconsidered whether Centech met the conditions of the RFP. <em>Centech, </em>79 Fed.Cl. at 569. Accordingly, that same day, GAO dismissed all of Tybrin\u2019s protests as moot. <em>Id. </em>Six days later, the Ah* Force retracted the Policy Memorandum. <em>Id. </em>On August 17, 2006, Centech notified the contracting officer by mail that, while its initial cost proposal was consistent with the Policy Memorandum, it, by itself, had already performed work accounting for more than 51 percent of the personnel costs under the contract to date and would continue to do so, as reflected in updated cost models which it submitted to the Air Force. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">On September 6, 2006, the contracting officer issued a \u201cDetermination of Non-Responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the determination, the contracting officer explained that, based on Centech\u2019s proposal indicating that work of its employees would account for only 43.2 percent of personnel costs under the contract, Centech did not meet the subcontracting limitation requirements set forth in the statute and regulation. <em>Id. </em>For that reason, the contracting officer considered Centech ineligible to receive the ARDTEAS contract. Twelve days later, Centech challenged the contracting officer\u2019s determination. <em>Id. </em>In particular, Centech contended that the contracting officer had erred by refusing to consider the new information it had submitted in the form of updated cost models. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">On September 15, 2006, the Air Force referred the matter of Centech\u2019s \u201cresponsibility\u201d to the SBA under the SBA\u2019s Certificate of Competency (\u201cCOC\u201d) Program. The COC Program is authorized by the Small Business Act. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 637(b)(7)(A) (2006). A COC is a written instrument issued by the SBA to a govei*nment contracting officer. It certifies that a small business concern possesses the responsibility to perform a specific procurement contract. <em>See </em>13 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.5(a)(1) (2008). By regulation, \u201c[w]hen a solicitation requires a small business to adhere to the limitations on subcontracting, a contracting officer\u2019s finding that a small business cannot comply with the limitation shall be treated as an element of responsibility and shall be subject to the COC process.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.601(d) (2008); <em>see also </em>13 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.6(f) (stating that \u201c[cjompliance [with the LOS clause is] considered an element of responsibility and not a component of size eligibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">On September 29, 2006, Centech responded to the SBA\u2019s request for information by providing a chart that showed how it would meet the LOS requirement. <em>Centech, </em>79 Fed.Cl. at 570. Other documents provided to the SBA by Centech included narratives, a compliance matrix, and spreadsheets. <em>Id. </em>Together, these submis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>sions reflected that Centech had changed its previously proposed mix of prime and subcontractor labor costs. <em>Id. </em>at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">By letter dated December 4, 2006, the SBA informed the contracting officer that, notwithstanding what was stated in Centech\u2019s proposal, the SBA had concluded that Centech would comply with the subcontracting limitation during its performance of the contract, and that the SBA had found Centech responsible and had issued a COC to Centech. <em>Id. </em>at 570. On December 21, 2006, the Air Force reinstated the award to Centech based on the SBA\u2019s issuance of the COC. <em>Id. </em>at 571. Shortly thereafter, on December 29, 2006, Tybrin protested to GAO the Air Force\u2019s reinstatement of the award to Centech, claiming that the Ah\u2019 Force should have found Centech\u2019s proposal unacceptable because, in the proposal, Centech did not offer to comply with the LOS clause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">On March 13, 2007, GAO sustained Tybrin\u2019s protest. <em>In re Tybrin Corp., </em>2007 Comp. Gen. (West) \u00b651, at 1, 2007 WL 841268 (Mar. 13, 2007). In its decision, GAO began its analysis by stating that, \u201c[a]s a general matter,\u201d an agency\u2019s judgment as to whether a small business offer- or will be able to comply with a subcontracting limitation presents a question of responsibility for review by the SBA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 5, 2007 WL 841268. GAO noted, however, that it had \u201cconsistently held that where a proposal, on its face, should lead an agency to the conclusion that an offeror has not agreed to comply with the subcontracting limitation, the matter is one of the proposal\u2019s acceptability.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>GAO further noted that it had \u201clong held that a proposal that fails to conform to a material term or condition of the solicitation, including the subcontracting limitation, is unacceptable and may not form the basis for an award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On that basis, GAO concluded that, \u201c[gjiven the Air Force\u2019s determination that Centech\u2019s proposal failed to comply with a material term of the solicitation (the subcontracting limitation) and, accordingly, that the proposal could not form the basis for award under the RFP, the agency should have found Centech\u2019s proposal to be unacceptable, rather than finding Centech nonresponsible and forwarding the matter to the SBA for its consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 2007 WL 4394422.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">GAO acknowledged the SBA\u2019s disagreement with its (GAO\u2019s) view that where a proposal, on its face, should lead the contracting agency to the conclusion that an offeror has not agreed to comply with the subcontracting limitation, the matter is one of the proposal\u2019s acceptability, rather than the offeror\u2019s responsibility. <em>Id. </em>Rejecting the SBA\u2019s position, GAO stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-10\">[T]he issue here does not concern whether a bidder or offeror can or will comply with the subcontracting limitation requirement during performance of the contract (where we recognize that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>the matter is one of responsibility (or, in certain cases, contract administration ...)), but rather, whether the bidder or offeror has specifically taken exception to the subcontracting limitation requirement on the face of its bid or proposal. Given that the determination in this latter, limited circumstance involves the evaluation of a bid or proposal for compliance with a material term of the solicitation, the determination is one of responsiveness or acceptability, rather than responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 6-7, 2007 WL 841268. GAO concluded by recommending \u201cthat the Air Force reopen discussions and request and review revised proposals, evaluate those submissions consistent with the terms of the solicitation, and make a new source selection decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7, 2007 WL 841268.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">On March 23, 2007, the SBA requested reconsideration of GAO\u2019s decision. <em>Centech, </em>79 Fed.Cl. at 572. The SBA took issue with GAO\u2019s statement in <em>In re Tybrin, </em>97-2 Comp. Gen. (West) at 6, 2007 WL 841268, that \u201cthe record establishes that it was clear to the Air Force that Centech\u2019s proposal as submitted and as evaluated provided that 43.2 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel would be expended for Centech employees, and, accordingly, that [Centech] \u2018did not meet the subcontracting limitation requirements set forth in statute and regulation.\u2019 \u201d The SBA contended that it was never clear to the Air Force whether Centeeh\u2019s proposal met or did not meet the limitation, arguing that \u201cit is not uncommon for contracting officers and procuring agencies to misunderstand the limitations on subcontracting requirements and how to calculate the requirement.\u201d The SBA maintained that the referral to the SBA, an expert in the subcontracting limitations, was therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">GAO denied SBA\u2019s request on April 17, 2007. In its denial, GAO stated that it found unpersuasive SBA\u2019s suggestion that the Air Force did not understand the subcontracting limitation. <em>In re Small Bus. Admin. </em>\u2014 Reconsideration, No. B-298364.8 (Comp.Gen. Apr. 17, 2007). GAO read the record as a whole to be replete with statements evidencing the Air Force\u2019s understanding and its recognition that Centech\u2019s proposal did not meet the subcontracting limitation requirements. <em>Id. </em>GAO found that the SBA failed to set out any factual or legal grounds that would warrant reversal or modification of its decision, as required by GAO\u2019s standard for reconsideration. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">In response to GAO\u2019s recommendation, the Air Force issued an amendment to the solicitation requesting revised proposals. <em>Centech, </em>79 Fed.Cl. at 573. All four original offerors, including Centech, submitted revised proposals on July 31, 2007. The revised proposals were under consideration on October 6, 2008, the date of oral argument before us. Oral Arg. at 8:15-8:47, <em>available at </em>http://oralarguments. cafc.uscourts.gov/ (search case no.2008-5031).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">On July 9, 2007, Centech filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking reinstatement of its original award and a declaration that the Air Force\u2019s decision to follow GAO\u2019s recommendation and take corrective action was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. <em>Centech, </em>79 Fed.Cl. at 574-75. Centech asked the court to enjoin the Air Force from expending any funds for the services contemplated by the ARDTEAS procurement except under the contract originally awarded to Centech. <em>Id. </em>at 575. Tybrin intervened in the suit. <em>Id. </em>at 573 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>Centech argued that the Air Force irrationally followed GAO\u2019s recommendation, where GAO mischaracterized the matter of LOS compliance as one of acceptability as opposed to post-award contract administration. <em>Id. </em>at 575. As seen, the Air Force took corrective action based upon GAO\u2019s determination that Centech\u2019s proposal was unacceptable because it failed to meet the requirement of the LOS clause. <em>Id. </em>at 572. According to Centech, compliance with the LOS clause was not required to be evaluated as a condition for award, but instead should have been examined after award, once the Air Force\u2019s actual requirements were defined. <em>Id. </em>at 575. Under Centech\u2019s theory, its representation in its proposal that it would perform only 43.2 percent of the labor itself did not render its proposal unacceptable because its failure to meet that clause was not a failure to meet a mandatory, material requirement of the solicitation, but was a matter of post-award contract administration. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Pursuant to Court of Federal Claims Rule 52.1, Centech and Tybrin and the government filed cross-motions for judgment on the administrative record regarding the Ah\u2019 Force\u2019s decision to follow GAO\u2019s recommendation. The Court of Federal Claims denied Centech declaratory and injunctive relief, holding that the Air Force had been justified in following GAO\u2019s recommendation. <em>Id. </em>at 577. The court first pointed out that 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 644(o) provides that a concern may not be awarded a contract as a small business contractor unless it agrees to perform at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel with' its own personnel. <em>Id. </em>at 575-76. The court stated that \u201cCentech\u2019s proposal, on its face, did not do that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576. The court continued: \u201cAs such, Centech\u2019s proposal violated the mandate of the Small Business Act, which makes the prime contractor\u2019s agreement to perform 50 percent of the labor costs itself a prerequisite to obtaining the award.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">The Court of Federal Claims next stated that GAO had \u201ccorrectly determined that Centech\u2019s proposal was unacceptable because it failed to comply with the LOS clause \u2014 a mandatory, material solicitation requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court noted that \u201cunder the terms of the solicitation, the percentage of labor costs performed by a prime versus subcontractor impacted an offeror\u2019s proposed bottom-line costs,' and costs were to be evaluated based upon the model in the RFP.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned that \u201c[bjecause the mix of prime subcontractor labor here affected the cost evaluation, compliance with the LOS clause had to be evidenced in offerors\u2019 proposals. As such, the LOS clause was implicated in the evaluation and was not simply a matter of post-award contract administration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court remanded to the Air Force, however, the question of whether Centech was entitled to an award of some portion of its bid and proposal preparation costs due to its reliance on the retracted Policy Memorandum. <em>Id. </em>at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1), the Court of Federal Claims has \u201cjurisdiction to render judgment on an action by an interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed procurement.\u201d The statute also provides that the court \u201cshall have jurisdiction to entertain such an action without regard to whether suit is instituted before or after the contract is awarded.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1) (2006). In response to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>a bid protest filed with it, the Court of Federal Claims is empowered to award \u201cany relief that the court considers proper, including declaratory and injunctive relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1491(b)(2). To determine if a permanent injunction is warranted, the court must consider whether (1) the plaintiff has succeeded on the merits, (2) the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if the court withholds injunctive relief, (3) the balance of hardships to the respective parties favors the grant of injunctive relief, and (4) the public interest is served by a grant of injunctive relief. <em>PGBA, LLC v. United States, </em>389 F.3d 1219, 1228-29 (Fed.Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">In the exercise of its bid protest jurisdiction, the court reviews agency action \u201cpursuant to the standards set forth in section 706 of title 5\u201d of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551-59, 701-06. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(4). Section 706 of the APA provides, in relevant part, that a \u201creviewing court shall ... hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be ... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (2006). Under these standards, a reviewing court may set aside a procurement action if \u201c(1) the procurement official\u2019s decision lacked a rational basis; or (2) the procurement procedure involved a violation of regulation or procedure.\u201d <em>Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States, </em>238 F.3d 1324, 1332 (Fed.Cir.2001). A court reviews a challenge brought on the first ground \u201cto determine whether the contracting agency provided a coherent and reasonable explanation of its exercise of discretion, and the disappointed bidder bears a heavy burden of showing that the award decision had no rational basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1332-33 (quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cWhen a challenge is brought on the second ground, the disappointed bidder must show a clear and prejudicial violation of applicable statutes or regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1333 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">We have jurisdiction over an appeal from a final decision of the Court of Federal Claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).

United States, </em>404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed.Cir.2005). This means that we apply the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard of \u00a7 706 anew, conducting the same analysis as the Court of Federal Claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(4); <em>Impresa, </em>238 F.3d at 1332. A party may establish an abuse of discretion \u201cby showing that the court made a clear error of judgment in weighing the relevant factors or exercised its discretion based on an error of law or clearly erroneous fact finding.\u201d <em>PGBA, </em>389 F.3d at 1223 (quotation marks omitted). A clear error of judgment in weighing the relevant factors or a clearly erroneous fact finding is present when a reviewing court is left with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d that a clear error of judgment or a mistake has been committed. <em>Id. </em>at 1223-24 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">As seen, in soliciting revised proposals for the ARDTEAS contract, the Air Force acted in response to GAO\u2019s determination that Centech\u2019s original proposal was not acceptable. To be acceptable, a proposal must represent an offer to provide the exact thing called for in the request for proposals, so that acceptance of the proposal will bind the contractor in accordance with the material terms and conditions of the request for proposals. <em>See E.W. Bliss Co. v. United States, </em>77 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>445, 448 (Fed.Cir.1996) (\u201c[A] proposal that fails to conform to the material terms and conditions of the solicitation should be considered unacceptable and a contract award based on such an unacceptable proposal violates the procurement statutes and regulations.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). A subcontracting limitation, including the LOS clause, is a material RFP term and a condition of a solicitation to which the offeror must agree in its proposal. <em>See Chapman Law Firm v. United States, </em>63 Fed.Cl. 519, 527 (2005), <em>aff'd </em>163 Fed. Appx. 889 (Fed.Cir.2006); <em>see also In re Orincon Corp., </em>97-2 Comp. Gen. (West) \u00b6 26, at 4, 1997 WL 402081 (July 18,1997)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Compliance with the LOS clause is material because the mix of prime-subcontractor labor affects cost evaluation. <em>See </em>48 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.405 (2008) (defining requirements as immaterial when the effect on price, quantity, quality, or delivery is negligible); <em>see also Blount, Inc. v. United States, </em>22 Cl.Ct. 221, 228 (1990) (describing the considerable savings achieved by a contractor who subcontracts work). Thus, a proposal that, on its face, leads \u201can agency to the conclusion that an offeror could not and would not comply with the subcontracting limitation\u201d is technically unacceptable and \u201cmay pot form the basis for an award.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>63 Fed.Cl. at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">On appeal, Centech does not contend that the LOS clause was not a material term of the contract. Rather, it argues that the Court of Federal Claims erred when it concluded that the Air Force acted rationally in following GAO\u2019s recommendation to solicit revised proposals for the ARDTEAS contract. According to Centech, the court erred when it determined that, on its face, Centech\u2019s proposal indicated that Centech did not agree to comply with the LOS clause. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 19. Centech reasons that it agreed to comply with the LOS clause when it submitted its proposal because its proposal was submitted in response to the RFP as supplemented by the later-retracted Policy Memorandum: \u201cCentech proposed to perform less than 50% of the contract labor only because the Air Force invited this when it made [the] Policy Memorandum part of the RFP. This cannot be fairly characterized as a refusal, failure, or inability by Centech to comply with the LOS clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. Centech contends that, under these circumstances, the case did not present an issue of proposal acceptability; rather, it presented an issue of offeror responsibility. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21. This meant, Centech asserts, that GAO and the Air Force \u201cshould have deferred to the SBA, and its exclusive area of jurisdiction under [the Small Business Act,] to render small business responsibility determinations as part of its COC review process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25. Centech notes that, when the SBA did evaluate Centech\u2019s proposal, it found Centech to be responsible. <em>Id. </em>at 30. Centech argues that the Air Force irrationally ignored that responsibility determination and followed GAO\u2019s independent finding of unacceptability. <em>Id. </em>at 30. Accordingly, Centech concludes that the Court of Federal Claims abused its discretion in denying declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">Tybrin and the government respond that the Court of Federal Claims did not err in denying Centech\u2019s request for declaratory and injunctive relief. They contend that the Air Force rationally acted upon the determination of GAO that Centech\u2019s proposal was unacceptable for failure to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>ply with the LOS clause. Tybrin\u2019s Br. at 26; Government\u2019s Br. at 17. They argue that the Air Force was not barred from finding Centech\u2019s proposal unacceptable simply because the SBA determined that Centech was responsible. Tybrin\u2019s Br. at 32, 41; Government\u2019s Br. at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">We have stated that \u201ca procurement agency\u2019s decision to follow [GAO\u2019s] recommendation even though that recommendation differed from the contracting officer\u2019s initial decision was proper unless [GAO\u2019s] decision itself was irrational.\u201d <em>Honeywell, Inc. v. United States, </em>870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed.Cir.1989). In this case, we agree with the Court of Federal Claims that the Air Force acted properly when it followed GAO\u2019s recommendation to solicit revised proposals for the ARDTEAS contract. Centech submitted a proposal that, on its face, showed that Centech was not agreeing to incur by itself \u201c[a]t least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance ... for personnel,\u201d as required by the LOS clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3554(b)(1), GAO is required to recommend that an agency take specific corrective action if an award does not comply with a statute or regulation, including terminating the contract and awarding a contract consistent with the requirements of the statute and regulations. <em>See Honeywell, </em>870 F.2d at 648. In <em>O'rincon, </em>GAO noted that, \u201c[a]s a general matter, an agency\u2019s judgment as to whether a small business offeror will comply with the subcontracting limitation is a matter of responsibility, and the contractor\u2019s actual compliance with the provision is a matter of contract administration.\u201d 97-2 Comp. Gen. (West) at 4, 1997 WL 402081. GAO further stated: \u201cHowever, where a proposal, on its face, should lead an agency to the conclusion that an offeror could not and would not comply with the subcontracting limitation, we have considered this to be a matter of the proposal\u2019s technical acceptability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Since Centech\u2019s proposal did not offer to provide what the RFP requested, it was not responsive to the RFP. It therefore was unacceptable and could not seive as the basis for contract award. Under these circumstances, GAO\u2019s recommendation to solicit revised proposals for the contract plainly was rational. It therefore was proper for the Air Force to follow GAO\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">Our conclusion is not changed by the fact that, in structuring its proposal, Centech apparently relied upon the later-retracted Policy Memorandum. The Air Force Material Command could not, through the Policy Memorandum, alter the requirements of the LOS clause, which was mandated by statute and regulation. <em>See United States v. Amdahl Corp., </em>786 F.2d 387, 392-93 (Fed.Cir.1986) (\u201cAdministrative actions taken in violation of statutory authorization or requirement are of no effect.\u201d); <em>cf. Lyng v. Payne, </em>476 U.S. 926, 937, 106 S.Ct. 2333, 90 L.Ed.2d 921 (1986) (noting that \u201cnot all agency publications are of binding force\u201d and that \u201can agency\u2019s power is no greater than that delegated to it by Congress\u201d). In short, the Policy Memorandum could not oven-ide the LOS clause. We thus reject Centech\u2019s argument that the presence of the Policy Memorandum (prior to its retraction) meant that Centech submitted a proposal which reflected agreement to comply with the LOS clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">We take due notice of the procurement regulation at 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.601(d) and the SBA regulation at 13 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.6(f). The former provides that \u201c[w]hen a solicitation requires a small business to adhere to the limitations on subcontracting, a contracting officer\u2019s finding that a small busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>ness cannot comply with the limitation shall be treated as an element of responsibility and shall be subject to the COC process.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.601(d). The latter provides that \u201c[cjompliance [with the LOS clause is] considered an element of responsibility and not a component of size eligibility.\u201d 13 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.6(f). Centech cites these regulations in making its argument that GAO and the Air Force should have deferred to the SBA\u2019s determination that Centech would comply with the LOS clause. These two regulations do not change the result in this case, however. The reason is that, as GAO stated in its decision, the issue was not whether Centech <em>could </em>comply with the requirements of the LOS clause \u2014 the matter to which \u00a7 19.601(d) is directed. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.601(d) (referring to \u201ca contracting officer's finding that a small business <em>cannot </em>comply with the [subcontracting] limitation\u201d (emphasis added)). Rather, the issue was whether, in its proposal, Centech agreed that it <em>would </em>comply with the requirements of the LOS clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The record fully supports GAO\u2019s determination that, in its proposal, Centech did not agree to comply with the clause. The Air Force acted rationally in following GAO\u2019s recommendation based upon that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the Court of Federal Claims denying Centech\u2019s request for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-6\">.

Responsibility refers to an offeror\u2019s apparent ability and capacity to perform all contract requirements and is determined, not at proposal opening, but at any time prior to award of the contract based on any information received by the agency up to that time. <em>See </em>48 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.105-1 (2008) (providing details as to the information considered in a responsibility determination).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b956-7\">. As explained below, \"acceptability\u201d refers to the matter of whether, in a proposal, an offeror agrees to provide what is called for by the solicitation or request for proposals. \"Acceptability\u201d is thus distinct from \"responsibility,\u201d which relates to the offeror\u2019s <em>ability </em>to perform. As seen above, the Air Force issued a \"Determination of Non-Responsibility,\u201d in which it found Centech ineligible for the ARDTEAS contract. However, the determination, which was based on Centech's proposal to incur itself 43.2 percent of employee costs under the contract, actually was a finding that Centech\u2019s proposal was not acceptable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b960-5\">. While not binding authority on this court, the decisions of the Comptroller General are instructive in the area of bid protests. <em>See CHE Consulting, Inc. v.

We are not prepared to read this statement as being contrary to the settled rule that, in order for a proposal to be acceptable, the proposal must reflect agreement to provide what is required by the request for proposals, especially since the regulation simply refers to \"compliance\u201d with the clause. Moreover, the statement is in a subsection of the SBA regulation that states a small business \u201cmust agree\u201d to comply with the LOS clause. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 125.6(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
