Subsumed in this analysis is a secondary question, whether D.C.\u2019s right to due process was violated by the action of the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">For reasons more fully amplified in Part II, on January 7,1993, the office of the Attorney General filed a verified complaint seeking the issuance of an order to show cause to compel D.C. to submit to two psychiatric examinations by psychiatrists selected by the Attorney General. The court executed the order returnable January 14,1993. D.C. filed an answer contesting the State\u2019s factual allegations and challenging the procedural basis for the State\u2019s application. After a hearing, the trial court ordered that D.C. submit to the requested examinations, which were thereafter conducted on January 17 and 18, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">On January 21, 1993, the court conducted another hearing, reviewed the psychiatric reports, both dated January 18,1993, and concluded that there was probable cause to believe that D.C. was mentally ill and a danger to others. The court, pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:74-7(c) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10e, entered an order temporarily committing D.C. to Bergen Pines County Hospital pending a plenary commitment hearing, which it scheduled for February 8, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>After four days of testimony (February 8, 11, 16 and 17, 1993), the court, on February 19, 1993, concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that D.C. was in need of involuntary commitment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as D.C. suffered from mental illness, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.2r,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that there existed a substantial likelihood that he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>inflict serious injury in the reasonably foreseeable future. D.C. was committed to Bergen Pines County Hospital but shortly thereafter was transferred to the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital in Trenton, where he has remained as a civil committee.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\"In need of involuntary commitment\u201d means that an adult who is mentally ill, whose mental illness causes the person to be dangerous to self or dangerous to others or property and who is unwilling to be admitted to a facility voluntarily for care, and who needs care at a short-term care, psychiatric facility or special psychiatric hospital because other services are not appropriate or available to meet the person\u2019s mental health care needs. <em>[Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>A civil commitment review hearing was conducted before another judge commencing June 3, 1993 and continuing on four additional dates, including June 23, 1993. On July 1, 1993, the review judge continued D.C.\u2019s commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">D.C. initially filed an appeal from the order of commitment entered February 22,1993, and thereafter filed an amended notice of appeal to encompass an appeal from the order executed July 23, 1983, which directed that D.C. remain involuntarily committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">While the appeal was pending, D.C.\u2019s commitment was again reviewed on January 28, 1994, and his commitment was continued by order dated March 14, 1994. D.C. filed a separate appeal.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both appeals were scheduled for disposition on the same calendar. We have elected to decide both appeals in one opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">D.C., now age forty, was bom February 5, 1955. He was first arrested at age seventeen on theft charges and was thereafter adjudicated a juvenile delinquent. He was placed in the Ocean-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>fields Residential Treatment Center but ran away after two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Shortly thereafter, D.C., then an adult, was arrested and charged with breaking and entering and theft. Upon his conviction, he was sentenced as a youthful offender to the Youth Correctional Center at Yardville. He was paroled in June 1973, having served ten months.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">On October 21, 1973, D.C. was charged with three counts of abduction, in violation of N.J.S.A 2A:86-2, and three counts of impairing the morals of a child, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:96-3. On May 24, 1974, he was convicted and sentenced to the Youth Correctional Center for an indeterminate term not to exceed eight years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He was paroled in 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">On December 8, 1978, D.C. was convicted for possession of a switchblade knife. Although he was again sentenced to The Youth Correctional Center at Yardville, his sentence was \u201csuspended.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">On July 12, 1980, D.C. kidnapped and sexually molested a twenty-three year-old woman. Immediately after the criminal episode, he surrendered to the police. In September 1980, D.C. was convicted of aggravated sexual assault, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-2a(6), and kidnapping, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-lb(l).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>He was sentenced to two concurrent terms of imprisonment for a period of twenty years with a ten year period of parole ineligibility to be served at the Adult Diagnostic Treatment Center (Avenel). D.C. was unconditionally released on November 17, 1992, having served his maximum sentence.* ****<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AlT\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">During 1992 at Avenel, D.C. was provided therapy by Kay E. Jackson, Ph.D., a staff clinical psychologist. In an affidavit attached to the verified complaint, Dr. Jackson stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">10. During these meetings, [D.C.] was honest with his parents about his continuing sexual arousal to sadistic fantasies involving rape, torture and mutilation of adult women. His most prevalent fantasy remains that of abducting a victim, taking her to a wooded area, tying her to trees, sexually assaulting her, torturing, and sometimes, ultimately killing her. In short, he continues to be strongly aroused to the fantasy of committing sexual offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">12. At the beginning of November 1992, I contacted Dr. Beril to verify his opinion of [D.G.] vis-a-vis confinement. Dr. Beril offered the opinion that though the likelihood that [D.C.] would recommit was great, he was not at this point in time eligible for involuntary confinement because he was <em>not \u201copenly psychotic.\u201d </em>This opinion was shared by the other two psychiatrists, Drs. Morgenstem and Fernandez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">[ (emphasis added.) ] <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Jackson contacted the West Milford Police on November 16, 1992, and the Bergen County Prosecutor\u2019s Office on November 17, 1992. As a result of those phone calls, the prosecutor\u2019s office, in conjunction with the Wyckoff police department, began round-the-clock surveillance of D.C., from his release from Avenel on November 17, 1992, to his temporary commitment on January 21, 1993, without interruption. D.C. was aware of this surveillance. He was living at the home of his parents. On December 8, 1992, he began weekly outpatient counseling at Avenel\u2019s extension program in Paterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The verified complaint refers to several incidents of unusual behavior.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">16. On November 20,1992, [D.C.] was seen leaving his parents\u2019 home out of the back door and entering a shed located at the rear of the property. While wearing surgical gloves, [D.C.] removed a duffel bag containing the same type of bondage equipment he used on the victim in 1980. These actions were captured on a video tape by the surveillance team.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">19. On November 30,1992, [D.C.] told an investigator from the Bergen County Prosecutor\u2019s Office that he would like to see the victim of his 1980 crime to \u201csee how she was doing.\u201d He also told the investigator that he often thought about his ex-girlfriend and would like to see her again. In addition, he told a member of the surveillance team that he could not guarantee that he would not commit acts similar to the crime for which [sic] was previously incarcerated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>20. On December 1,1992, [D.C.] told a member of the surveillance team that he still loves his ex-girlfriend and was trying to locate her. He admits to obsessing about sadistic fantasies and his desire to repeat his acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">21. Since his release, [D.C.] had been frequenting a local fast food establishment to look for young girls. At that establishment, [D.C.] was involved with two separate incidents with management. On one occasion, he blocked the door to the ladies room and on another he spoke to a couple that he did not know, telling them they had a beautiful young daughter of whom they should be proud. Since December 11, 1992, [D.C.] has been barred from the establishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">22. On January 4, 1993, a surveillance team member was assigned to take a photograph of him as his appearance had recently changed (he had shaved his beard leaving only a moustache). As the surveillance team member was photographing [D.C.], he [D.C.] turned towards the camera and display [sic] the middle finger of his right hand extended upward. He told the surveillance team member that if he \u201ctook any more pictures, he would make things hard for\u201d the surveillance team.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">23. On January 4, 1993, at 8:00 p.m., [D.C.] ran to a ravine carrying a long length of rope coiled around his shoulder and a shorter piece of rope attached to what appeared to be a pulley system; he had a flashlight in his back pocket. The ground at the ravine was muddy and the area was unlit and dark. [D.C.] turned towards the surveillance team members following him and yelled \u201cIf you get any closer, I\u2019ll bury this grappling hook in your head! You should see what it will do to a human brain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">24. Also on January 4, 1993, at 8:00 p.m., [D.C.] walked to the waterfall at the ravine. The temperature was about 40 degrees. [D.C.] removed his overcoat and shirt. While bare-chested he began to tie ropes across the ravine. For about 15 to 20 minutes he threw rocks into the stream. He tied a rope around a rock about three feet in diameter, dragged the rock from one side of the stream to the other and left these ropes strung across the stream. [D.C.] was intermittently on all fours with his hand in the water up to his elbows. At about 10:00 p.m., he left the ravine, leaving behind the ropes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">25. On January 5, 1993, [D.C.] left his home carrying a long yellow nylon rope and walked to a wooded area down the block from his home. He spent four hours in the woods during which time he strung the yellow nylon rope across the stream, attaching it to a pulley already in place on the far side of the stream. Later he punched a stone pillar with his hand and extended the middle finger of his right hand into the air. He told the surveillance team members that he would \u201csmash any f\u2014in\u2019 camera I can get my hand son [sic]\u201d and that he was \u201cthrough being a nice guy.\u201d While walking back to his residence he ran up to a car with three teenage occupants, began to pound on the driver\u2019s side window, and screamed \u201cIf you want f\u2014ing trouble, I\u2019ll give you f\u2014ing trouble.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">During the surveillance, a person on the prosecutor\u2019s staff requested D.C.\u2019s examination for possible involuntary civil commitment by an emergency psychiatric screening unit associated with the Mid-Bergen Mental Health Center, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>27.5. D.C. voluntarily agreed to that examination conducted by Dr. Joel Fetterbush, a staff psychiatrist, on December 11, 1992. Dr. Fetterbush concluded that D.C. was not in need of involuntary civil commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">As noted in Part I, D.C., pursuant to court order, was examined by two private psychiatrists selected by the Attorney General. Dr. Taylor Chamberlain concluded that D.C. was mentally ill and dangerous to others, as he suffered from schizoidal personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Dr. Stanley Kern concluded that D.C. suffered from a personality disorder and \u201cmanifested paranoid ideation regarding authority figures.\u201d Kern did not believe D.C. was imminently dangerous to others but opined that D.C. was an extremely angry individual and potentially dangerous to others. Kern\u2019s report did not explicitly state that D.C. was mentally ill and in need of involuntary commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Over the \u25a0 objection of D.C., the trial court concluded that the written reports of Chamberlain and Kern were equivalent to \u201cclinical certificates\u201d for purposes of <em>R. </em>4:74\u20147(b)(2) and <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4\u201427.10b, and that the Attorney General had the authority to initiate commitment proceedings by the use of its <em>parens patriae </em>authority. Adopting the recommendations of Chamberlain and Kern, the court entered the temporary commitment order pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:74-7(c) and <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.10e.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">At the plenary hearing which commenced February 8,1993, the Attorney General sought permission to present direct testimony. D.C. objected, contending that the direct case was to be presented by Bergen County\u2019s counsel, <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.12, or by the Bergen County Adjuster, <em>ibid. </em>Initially the court agreed, but it permitted the Assistant Attorney General to supply questions to Bergen County counsel while conducting the examination of his expert psychiatrist witness, Dr. Peter Martindale, a staff psychiatrist at Bergen Pines and D.C.\u2019s attending physician of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Martindale examined D.C. on five occasions during the eighteen days preceding the plenary hearing. He concluded that D.C. suffered from a character disorder, i.e., an \u201cantisocial personality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>disorder\u201d with a diagnosis of sexual sadism, but that D.C. was not mentally ill and did not require involuntary commitment. He opined that D.C. was a \u201cpotential danger\u201d but could not opine whether D.C. posed a danger to anyone in the reasonably foreseeable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">On cross-examination, Martindale admitted that criminals, as a class, suffer from antisocial personality disorder more than the general population. He acknowledged that if psychiatrists were to commit involuntarily based on antisocial personality disorders, a tremendous number of those released from penal institutions would be committed. Martindale also agreed that if doctors committed on the basis of character disorders alone, they would be engaged in what amounts to \u201cpreventative detention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">After Martindale testified, the Attorney General made an application to permit the testimony of Drs. Chamberlain and Kern and Jackson, the Avenel psychologist. That application was granted over D.C.\u2019s objection. Despite the court\u2019s earlier ruling, the Attorney General presented the testimony of these witnesses contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Chamberlain\u2019s testimony was consistent with his written report of January 18, 1993. Kern\u2019s testimony indicated that D.C. manifested \u201csexual sadism and underlying personality disorder,\u201d and that sexual sadism met the standard for mental illness under the commitment statute. He opined that D.C. was likely to inflict serious bodily injury or harm upon another within the reasonably foreseeable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">On cross-examination, Kern admitted that a person is generally not found to be committable on the basis of antisocial personality disorder alone. He acknowledged that the Attorney General directed him to review the statutory definition of mental illness to determine if D.C. fit the statutory definition. He admitted that the Attorney General\u2019s request was unusual for commitment hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>D.C. then recalled Martindale for additional cross-examination. Martindale indicated that D.C. could have been discharged on Martindale\u2019s own authority, <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.17<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but \u201cin this case the law is being scrutinized like in no other commitment case that I\u2019ve had anything to do with\u201d and that his release of D.C. would have been extremely awkward, if not impossible. Martindale also indicated that the interpretation of \u201cmental illness\u201d utilized by both Chamberlain and Kern was not the standard normally applied in commitment proceedings by the medical and psychiatric community.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The last witness was Dr. Daniel Paul Greenfield, who testified on behalf of D.C. based upon two separate examinations: the first prior to January 18, 1993, and the second on February 15, 1993. Greenfield concurred that D.C. suffered from sexual sadism which was in remission and an antisocial personality disorder. He 'opined that as D.C. was not engaging in antisocial behavior and was not actively psychotic or symptomatic, there was no basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>involuntary civil commitment. He also opined that D.C.\u2019s antisocial personality was not curable and although D.C. was potentially dangerous, he was not dangerous to others within the \u201creasonably foreseeable future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">As noted, the court concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that D.C. was in need of involuntary commitment, and an order of commitment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In the consolidated appeals, D.C. raises four points of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">\n<em>POINT ONE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\u2019S PARTICIPATION IN THE CIVIL COMMITMENT OF [D.CJ WAS CONTRARY TO N.J.S.A 30:4-27.1 <em>ET SEQ. </em>AND CONSTITUTES PLAIN ERROR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">A.

Texas, </em>441 <em>U.S. </em>418, 426, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1804, 1809, 60 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>323, 331 (1979); <em>O\u2019Connor v.

However, because commitment effects a great restraint on individual liberty, this power of the State is constitutionally bounded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-11\"><em>[In re S.L., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>128, 136-37, 462 A.2d 1252 (1983) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">The safeguards promulgated to ensure that due process is afforded to a prospective civil committee must be scrupulously followed; short cuts in the commitment process are not permitted. <em>Matter of Commitment of Raymond S., </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>428, 432, 623 A.2d 249 (App.Div.1993); <em>See also Fair Oaks Hosp. v.

These are also embodied in <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.10a (proceeding instituted by a short-term care or psychiatric facility or a special psychiatric hospital) and <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4r-27.10b (proceeding instituted by the submission to the court of two clinical certificates, at least one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>which is prepared by a psychiatrist). These methods are also embodied in <em>R. </em>4:74-7. Either type of commitment must consider \u201cthe least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve the purposes of treatment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4\u201427.11d(b)(2). <em>See Matter of Commitment of J.L.J., </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34, 47, 481 A.2d 563 (App.Div.1984), <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>210, 501 A.2d 893 (1985) (recognizing a constitutional right to the least restrictive environment appropriate to the protection of society and the rights of the individual).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The crux of the civil commitment statute is the creation of a system of county-based public mental health screening facilities, defined in <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.2z, charged with the responsibility of providing assessment, emergency and referral services to mentally ill patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The legislative intent to make screening facilities the gateway to the public mental health system is further evidenced by <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.4, which states that \u201cscreening service evaluation is the preferred process for entry into short-term care facilities or psychiatric facilities so that appropriate consideration is given to less restrictive treatment alternatives.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>It is likewise evidenced by <em>N.J.SA </em>30:4-27.5a, which provides that \u201c[a] screening service <em>shall </em>serve as <em>the </em>facility in the public mental health care treatment system wherein a person believed to be in need of commitment to a short-term care, psychiatric facility or special psychiatric hospital undergoes an assessment to determine what mental health services are appropriate for the person and where those services may be most appropriately provided.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">If a mental health outreach screener certifies that there is probable cause to believe a person is in need of involuntary commitment, that person is transported to a full screening service for a complete assessment. If a subsequent examining psychiatrist at the full screening facility also believes the person is in need of involuntary commitment, he or she completes the screening certificate and admits the person to an appropriate psychiatric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>facility for observation and further evaluation, for a period not to exceed seventy-two hours. <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.9c.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The facility may initiate court proceedings if involuntary commitment is warranted by submitting two clinical certificates to the court: (1) the screening certificate which authorized admission of the patient to the facility; and (2) a certificate completed by a psychiatrist at the facility who is on the patient\u2019s treatment team. <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.10a. Commitment is warranted only if \u201cthe person is mentally ill and that mental illness causes the person to be dangerous to self or dangerous to others or property, and appropriate facilities or services are not otherwise available.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.9b. Even law enforcement authorities authorized to participate in the involuntary commitment process must utilize a mental health sereener to determine if an individual will require a complete mental health assessment. <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The only alternative procedure authorized is set forth in <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.10b and <em>R. </em>4:74-7(b)(2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The statute specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">Court proceedings for the involuntary commitment of any person not referred by a screening service may be initiated by the submission to the court of two clinical certificates, at least one of which is prepared by a psychiatrist. The person shall not be involuntarily committed before the court issues a temporary court order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\"><em>INJ.S.A. </em>89:4-27.10bJ</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Both statutorily approved methods require a court to review the two certificates to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the person is in need of involuntary commitment. <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.10d. Only then is a temporary order of commitment authorized. <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.10e.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">We conclude that any deviation from these strict procedures cannot be countenanced. Involuntary civil commitment procedures are designed to protect fundamental liberty interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and to ensure due process of law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.1c. The focus is placement in the least restrictive environment necessary to achieve the statute\u2019s goals: treatment of the mentally ill and protection of the public. Under the statutory scheme the courts, by virtue of their parens <em>patriae </em>jurisdiction, have \u201ca right and duty to protect the public interest and to protect such persons with disabilities who have no rightful protector.\u201d <em>State in the Interest of R.G.W., </em>145 <em>N.J.Super. </em>167, 182, 366 A.2d 1375 (J. &amp; D.R.Ct.1976) (citing <em>Johnson v.

The State is likewise vested with <em>parens patriae </em>power, and its authority to civilly commit citizens is said to be grounded in both \u201cits police power to protect the citizenry and its <em>parens patriae </em>authority to act on behalf of those unable to act in their own best interests.\u201d <em>In re S.L., supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 136, 462 A.2d 1252 (citing <em>Addington v.

New Jersey Power &amp; Light Co., </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>373, 380, 122 A.2d 339 (1956); <em>Wilentz v.

The court\u2019s authority is only triggered by receipt of clinical certificates prepared pursuant to statutory criteria. The Attorney General had the clear opportunity to adhere to the statute, here <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4r-27.10a in conjunction with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.6a, to seek D.C.\u2019s involuntary commitment. The Attorney General failed to follow the correct procedure and cannot utilize <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.10b to accomplish its objective, particularly so, where strict compliance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4r-27.10b was not followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\"><em>R. </em>4:74-7(d) provides that the court may \u201corder testing or examination of the patient by an independent psychiatrist, psychologist or other expert.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, this provision deals with the issue of discovery once an action for civil commitment has <em>already </em>been initiated by either of the two methods permitted by. statute, both of which require submission of two clinical certificates. It does not authorize the court to order testing <em>prior </em>to the time it acquires jurisdiction over the matter by virtue of a properly initiated action.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">We reject the argument of the Attorney General that it was necessary to proceed outside the statutory guidelines due to the exceptional circumstances of this case, cited as the failure of the psychiatrists at Avenel and the Bergen County mental health screener, Fetterbush, to utilize the correct definition of mental illness. The Attorney General contends that the only way to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>ensure that the commitment laws were properly administered in the case of D.C. was to obtain evaluations by psychiatrists who were capable of applying a \u201ccorrect\u201d definition.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We disagree. If the Avenel psychiatrists and the mental health screener employed by the Division of Human Services were using improper commitment criteria, the Attorney General and the Division needed to resolve the matter on a universal rather than case-specific level. The commitment statute provides no right to appeal a determination that an individual is <em>not </em>mentally ill. The Attorney General\u2019s disagreement with the screening psychiatrists\u2019 conclusions did not authorize that office to bypass established and mandated commitment procedures to obtain a \u201csecond opinion\u201d or allow the court to review the conclusions reached by the screening psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Additionally, we note that Fetterbush was not called as a witness at the temporary commitment hearing. The court neither questioned nor concluded that the mental health screener had utilized an improper interpretation of mental illness when he concluded on December 11, 1992, that D.C. was not in need of involuntary commitment. The same is also true of the opinions of Avenel staff psychiatrists Drs. Beril, Morgenstern and Fernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">In this case, D.C. was examined by at least one Avenel psychiatrist, Beril, and perhaps by two others, Morgenstern and Fernandez, before his release. He was also examined by the Mid-Bergen Community Health Center after his release. Those examinations resulted in findings that D.C. was not mentally ill and dangerous to others. D.C. was not a candidate for involuntary commitment on January 9,1992, when the court issued the order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">The legislature expressly prohibited exceptions or deviations from the civil commitment procedures set forth in the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>stating that \u201c[t]he standards and procedures in this act apply to <em>all adults </em>involuntarily committed to a short-term care facility, psychiatric facility or special psychiatric hospital____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.3 (emphasis added).

In accordance with the State\u2019s <em>parens </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>patriae </em>authority, the Attorney General and the court recognized their duty to protect the public interest and have done so while scrupulously protecting D.C.\u2019s due process rights. <em>In re S.L., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>128, 137, 462 A.2d 1252 (1983); <em>State in the Interest of R.G.W., </em>145 <em>N.J.Super. </em>167, 182, 366 A.2d 1375 (J. &amp; D.R.Ct.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">D.C. was afforded due process by a less intrusive means than provided for under the statutory procedure.

However, the Attorney General acted with an abundance of caution for D.C.\u2019s rights, and afforded D.C. notice and a hearing before he was taken into custody. Thereafter, he was afforded two more hearings in which to argue his case. The Attorney General\u2019s failure to follow the method provided under the statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.4, was not fatal.
