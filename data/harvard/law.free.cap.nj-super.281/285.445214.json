She provided the police with a signed statement which included the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-20\">Hearing noise and the breaking of glass while in a second floor bedroom of her home, she went into her daughter\u2019s room and took her daughter to the second floor landing. A stairway light</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>controlled by a switch on the first floor was turned on, and she observed two men on the first floor at the foot of the stairway. One man climbed the stair and under direction of the second man, pulled a gun and held it to the side of her head. The second man, still on the first floor and later identified as defendant Benny Hogan, ordered Daye to \u201cgive up what you got.\u201d After that statement was repeated, Daye indicated that her possessions were in her bedroom. Defendant climbed the stairs, entered her bedroom, and then both men left her home. She discovered that $290 and credit cards were removed from her pocketbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Her statement also included the following rendition of an event which occurred earlier that day before she reported the robbery to the police:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">ANSWER: I was coming out of 8 Erie Street. I got out of my car in front of my house. I noticed one of the guys who robbed me. I went to a man I knew who just got out of prison and the man knew him. So we went up to him and asked him questions about the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">The guy who knew him asked him about the incident. He then started talking. He said why are you looking at me like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">I said because I remember those marks on your face. You were the one who came to my house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">He then said, no, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">I said I remember the car you were in. It was in my backyard. I pulled out a piece of paper with the license plate on it. He then said I ain\u2019t going to deny that this is the car. I loaned it to my cousin. If I knew my cousin was going to stick up you people, I would not have let him use the car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">Additionally, the statement indicated that she was shown a photograph of defendant and asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">QUESTION: Is this the man that was in your house and robbed you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-13\">ANSWER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-14\">Based solely on that statement, the matter was presented to the grand jury. The only State\u2019s witness was Detective Charles Sutaris, who read the entire transcribed statement of his questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>and Daye\u2019s answers, signed by Daye. Based upon that presentation, defendant was indicted for burglary and robbery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">On May 10, 1990, Daye visited the Public Defender\u2019s Office. She provided a public defender with a statement which was tape recorded and included, in part, the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">MR. MASK: Explain why you came to this office today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">MS. DAYE: Because I was under a lot of pressure and a lot of things that were said aren\u2019t true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">MR. MASK: When you say you were under pressure can you explain how and why you named the person Benny Hogan as the suspeet at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">MS. DAYE: Yes, I can. Because everybody was telling me about Benny, saying the type of person he was, what he was capable of doing so it made me scared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">MR. MASK: When you say that you heard from people does that mean to say, does that mean that at the time your home was burglarized and that you were robbed you did not see Benny Hogan in your house at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">MS. DAYE: No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-13\">MR. MASK: You saw I believe you said an automobile, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-14\">MS. DAYE: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-15\">MR. MASK: Where was the automobile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-16\">MS. DAYE: On Union Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-17\">MR. MASK: And it was only after you had conversations with other people did they tell you that it must have been Benny Hogan that you told the police that\u2019s who it was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-18\">MS. DAYE: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-19\">MR. MASK: And when you went to the police station were you given the opportunity to selected [sic] among a group of photographs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-20\">MS. DAYE: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-21\">MR. MASK: What did they do when they asked you to look at a photograph?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-22\">MS. DAYE: They gave me a book and they had the page with Benny\u2019s picture on it with another picture and they said is this Benny Hogan and I said, yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-23\">MR. MASK: And when they said is this Benny Hogan what were they doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-24\">MS. DAYE: They pointed to Benny Hogan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-25\">MR. MASK: They pointed at his photograph?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-26\">MS. DAYE: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-27\">MR. MASK: And you basically, you just agreed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-28\">MS. DAYE: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>MR. MASK: Because in your mind you thought that it was Benny Hogan because people had said that it must have been Benny because they have seen his car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">MS. DAYE: Yes, they did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">MR. MASK: But based on what you recall is it your honest testimony and statement that based on what you saw and the photograph that was not Benny at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">MS. DAYE: No, it wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">MR. MASK: Has anyone forced you or coerced you in making a statement such as this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">MS. DAYE: No, they didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-10\">MR. MASK: Whose idea was it to come and give this statement at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-11\">MS. DAYE: My own.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">Daye also indicated to the public defender that she had informed the prosecutor that she did not wish to proceed with the charges. The prosecutor requested that she appear to sign a statement withdrawing the charges, but she did not as she could not locate the prosecutor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">That same date, Daye signed the following affidavit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-14\">\n<em>AFFIDAVIT</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-15\">I, <em>Elnara Daye </em>residing at <em>18 Oak St. </em>City of <em>Jersey City, NJ, </em>in the County of <em>Hudson </em>State of New Jersey, being 18 years or more of age, having been duly sworn, do hereby state that I elect, voluntarily, without any coercion from any person or fear of reprisal against me, without any intimidation or persuasion by any person, without any inducements, bribes or other gifts having been offered to me, and after a full consideration of all factors to be no longer interested in, concerned with or in any capacity involved in or with the prosecutor of the defendant, <em>Benny Hogan, </em>for the crime of <em>Burglary &amp; Robbery. </em>I have no objection whatsoever now, and I will not now or ever after raise or permit anyone to raise on my behalf an objection to the present dismissal of the above-mentioned criminal charges presently pending against this defendant by the appropriate Judicial Authority. <em>Reason: I realize now that Mr. Hogan is not the person who committed the crimes against </em>me.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">Although the record on appeal is not particularly clear, it appears that defendant\u2019s trial was scheduled to commence in July 1990. Daye apparently met with the prosecutor and advised her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>of the recantation given to the public defender. Daye apparently attributed her recantation to a fear of retribution based on threats and conversations with defendant\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Daye\u2019s testimony at trial explains the basis of her alleged fears. According to Daye, after defendant was arrested on August 31, 1989, Daye was contacted by defendant\u2019s sister and other family members, who urged her to withdraw the charges against defendant. Daye was offered money for the care of her child. Daye also claimed that she had received three notes left in or under her door at her home, purportedly written by defendant\u2019s mother, requesting that she contact defendant\u2019s mother. Daye contacted defendant\u2019s mother, who requested that Daye withdraw the criminal charges. Daye claimed that she was frightened, and she therefore agreed to withdraw the charges. On May 10, 1990, Daye was accompanied by defendant\u2019s mother and sister when she visited the public defender, gave a taped statement recanting her prior accusation, and signed the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">After Daye met with the prosecutor and explained that her recantation was a result of her fear of retribution, the prosecutor sought a postponement of the trial and indicated that she intended to present the matter anew to the grand jury. The court granted the postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">On July 9, 1990, the public defender forwarded Daye\u2019s taped statement and affidavit to the prosecutor and requested that both be presented as exculpatory evidence to the grand jury on August 15,1990. The prosecutor concluded that the taped statement and affidavit were not exculpatory, as both statements had been coerced by threats from defendant\u2019s mother and sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">On August 15, 1990, the matter was again presented to the grand jury. The only State\u2019s witness was Detective Charles Sutaris. The transcript of that presentation reflects that Sutaris did not read Daye\u2019s August 30, 1989 statement to the grand jury. Rather, Sutaris only provided the grand jury with a synopsis. The prosecutor made no reference to the prior January 12, 1990 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>indictment, nor to the recantation statement provided to the public defender. The grand jury returned a five count indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the superseding indictment on the basis of alleged prosecutorial error in failing to present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. That motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Tried to a jury, defendant was convicted of robbery while armed, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-1 (count one); robbery, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-1 (count two); burglary while displaying a deadly weapon, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2 (count three); burglary, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2 (count four); unlawful possession of a handgun, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-5b (count six); and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, contrary to <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:39-4a (count seven). Defendant was acquitted on count five charging aggravated assault, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:12-lb(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">After defendant\u2019s post-trial motions for a judgment n.o.v. or, alternatively, a new trial were denied, defendant was sentenced on count one to a custodial term of fifty years with a sixteen and two-third year period of parole ineligibility and a concurrent term of fifteen years with a five-year period of parole ineligibility on count three. Counts two, four, six and seven were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">On appeal, defendant raises nine points of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">THE TRIAL COURT COMITTED [SIC] REVERSIBLE ERROR IN DENYING THE DEFENDANT\u2019S PRE-TRIAL MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-11\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-12\">THE TRIAL COURT COMITTED [SIC] REVERSIBLE ERROR IN DENYING THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR MISTRIAL AFTER THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S OPENING STATEMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-13\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-14\">THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN FIRST, RESERVING ON, AND THEN DENYING, THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION WITH RESPECT TO THE UNAUTHENTICATED PIECE OF PAPER WHICH THE PROSECUTOR SOUGHT TO PRESENT TO THE JURY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\n<em>POINT IV</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN PERMITTING THE PROSECUTOR TO NEUTRALIZE HIS OWN WITNESS (NOT RAISED BELOW).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">\n<em>POINT V</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN PERMITTING THE PROSECUTOR TO (I) ALLUDE TO THE DEFENDANT\u2019S PRIOR CRIMINAL RECORD (2) ELICIT HEARSAY AND (3) LEAD THE WITNESS. <em>POINT VI</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN FAILING TO ATTEMPT MORE DILIGENTLY TO ELIMINATE THE PREJUDICE BY ADEQUATELY CHARGING THE JURY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">\n<em>POINT VII</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN DENYING THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTIONS FOR A JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, A NEW TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-12\">\n<em>POINT VIII</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-13\">ASSUMING, <em>ARGUENDO, </em>THAT THE INDIVIDUAL ERRORS DO NOT CONSTITUTE REVERSIBLE ERROR, THE ERRORS AGGREGATELY DENIED THE DEFENDANT A FAIR HEARING.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-14\">\n<em>POINT IX</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-15\">THE DEFENDANT RECEIVED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">Preliminarily, we note that in an appeal from an order denying a pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment, we must limit our analysis to the pleadings filed as of the date of the motion and the arguments of counsel presented to the motion judge. <em>Cf. State v. Turcotte, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>285, 299, 571 A.2d 305 (App.Div.1990) (noting appellate court\u2019s limited review, \u201cbased on evidence presented at that time,\u201d of <em>R. </em>3:5-7 motion to suppress); <em>State v. Jordan, </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>73, 76, 278 A.2d 223 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>293, 281 A.2d 806 (1971). We may not consider either the evidence produced at the subsequent trial or the ultimate jury verdict. <em>State v. Murphy, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>20, 28, 538 A.2d 1235 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">We recognize that \u201can indictment should be disturbed only on the \u2018clearest and plainest ground.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Perry, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>128, 168, 590 A.2d 624 (1991) (citing <em>State v. New Jersey Trade Waste Ass\u2019n, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>8, 18-19, 472 A.2d 1050 (1984)). One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>reason to disturb an indictment, now recognized under our Constitution, <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, par. 8, arises from our recognition of a prosecutor\u2019s \u201cobligation to exercise his or her discretion in good faith.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>86, 98, 634 A.2d 576 (App.Div.1993) (citation omitted), <em>certif. denied, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>164, 644 A.2d 612 (1994). That obligation encompasses the \u201cobligation to give the grand jury evidence in the prosecutor\u2019s possession which clearly exculpates a defendant, that is, evidence that directly negates a defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><em>State v. Gaughran, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>283, 615 A.2d 1293 (Law Div.1992), is an excellent example of a prosecutor\u2019s failure to abide by that obligation. In <em>Gaughran, </em>defendant was accused of committing various sexual acts forcibly and against the will of a seventeen year old victim, including anal penetration with his penis and finger and vaginal penetration with his finger. <em>Id. </em>at 285, 615 A.2d 1293. After the crime was reported, the victim received a gynecological exam at a nearby hospital. The Emergency Room notes read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">No external marks on mouth, neck, breasts. Pelvic exam: NEG\u2014no bruises, no lacerations, minimal erythema ext. genitalia, minimal mucoid discharge, CX small, not tender, uterus\u2014small. Adnexae (-) Rectal\u2014tight sphincter\u2014no bruise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">When the matter was thereafter presented to the grand jury, there was no mention of that directly exculpatory medical report. On defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, the trial judge, after thorough review of judicial precedent and treatises, concluded that the prosecutor had violated his obligation to act fairly and impartially. The court dismissed the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 291, 615 A.2d 1293. <em>Gaughran </em>was cited with approval in <em>Smith, supra, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 93-94, 634 A.2d 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">In contrast, in <em>Smith, </em>we affirmed a trial court decision denying a motion to dismiss an indictment on the failure of the prosecutor to present allegedly exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. In <em>Smith, </em>a gas station was robbed at 10:00 p.m. Defendant provided the prosecutor with three witness statements. <em>Id. </em>at 90-91, 634 A.2d 576. One statement accounted for defendant\u2019s where<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>abouts between 7:30 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.; a second statement accounted for defendant\u2019s whereabouts between 6:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.; and the third statement placed defendant in a location other than the site of the armed robbery, but did not specify the time of the sighting. <em>Id. </em>at 91, 634 A.2d 576. In our decision affirming the trial court, we concluded \u201cthe three statements ... simply did not negate guilt. At best they put him at a different location ... some one and one-half hours before the robbery. That evidence would not have led the grand jury to believe an innocent person was being accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97-98, 634 A.2d 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In <em>Smith, </em>in establishing a standard for prosecutorial conduct, we rejected the standard recognized in California that \u201cthe prosecutor should disclose to the grand jury any evidence which will reasonably tend to negate guilt,\u201d as discussed in <em>Johnson v. Superior Court, </em>15 Cal.3d 248, 124 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>32, 34, 539 P.2d 792, 794 (1975). We also rejected the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice \u00a7 3-3.6 (1986), which provides in part, \u201c(b) No prosecutor should knowingly fail to disclose to the grand jury evidence which will tend substantially to negate guilt.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 95, 634 A.2d 576 (citing <em>ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">In reaching our conclusion in <em>Smith, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">We are inclined to agree with the concerns expressed over the somewhat amorphous <em>ABAi Johnson </em>standard of \u201creasonably tending to exculpate.\u201d Rather we think a standard of \u201cclearly exculpatory\u201d or which \u201cdirectly negates guilt\u201d would fairly serve to ensure the grand jury\u2019s proper functioning as a shield as well as a sword, and would, at the same time recognize the substantial discretion accorded a prosecutor. We agree that a more lenient standard could transform the grand jury \u201cfrom an accusatory to an adjudicatory body.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Williams, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>[36] at 51, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>[1735] at 1744, 118 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>[352] at 368. But we think the grand jury cannot function as a shield if the prosecutor does not present evidence that clearly negates the guilt of a defendant. <em>See State v. Gaughran, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 290, 615 A.2d 1293 (objective medical evidence that alleged rape by defendant did not occur). <em>Cf. State v. Perry, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>at 168, 590 A.2d 624.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\"><em>[.Id. </em>at 97.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">We also quoted <em>LaFave &amp; Israel, </em>2 Criminal Procedure \u00a7 15.4(d) (1991).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s disclosure obligation is limited to evidence which, if believed, would establish in itself that Lthe defendant] had not committed the crime\u2014such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>a confession by another to the crime or evidence that \u2018the accused was nowhere near the scene of the crime when it occurred.\u2019 Even then, consideration will be given to the likely reliability of the non-disclosed evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\"><em>[Smith, supra, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 97, 634 A.2d 576 (quoting <em>ibid.).]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">We consider a victim\u2019s recantation of an original accusation to be the type of \u201cevidence, which if believed, would establish in itself that [the defendant] had not committed the crime.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Here, in response to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, the assistant prosecutor assigned to this case argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">And in my statement of facts, procedural history to the Court, I have indicated that the victim of this incident had come to the Prosecutor\u2019s office and spoke to investigator Pentay (phon.) about a week or so after the statement was given and indicated at that time that she was harassed, threatened and/or coerced into giving that statement. She had testified at a parole revocation hearing, the State of New Jersey Parole Board to a Hearing Officer that she was either forced, coerced, threatened and harassed into giving that statement and she gave a statement to an investigator on July 9th, that she was forced, harassed, coerced into giving that statement then. They call it exculpaty [sic] evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Thereafter, the assistant prosecutor concluded her argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKU\">After I review all the evidence and I determine that [Daye\u2019s recantation is] not true, then I have absolutely no obligation to present to the Grand Jury. If it was exculpatory and I believed it and I believe that this defendant did not commit that crime, then I would be the first one to say that I should not present the matter without submitting that to the Grand Jury. But that\u2019s really with all due respect to the Court, that\u2019s my call. That\u2019s the Prosecutor\u2019s discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">The prosecutor contends that her duty to disclose only arises if the statement is exculpatory and if the prosecutor believes it to be truthful. This cannot possibly be the determinative basis for the decision whether to disclose evidence to the grand jury. The standard for prosecutorial conduct may not rest on a prosecutor\u2019s belief. The decision whether to indict is solely entrusted to the grand jury, which must decide \u201cwhether a prima facie case has been made out.\u201d <em>Trap Rock Indus., Inc. v. Kohl, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>471, 487, 284 A.2d 161 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 <em>U.S. </em>1065, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1500, 31 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>796 (1972). This is particularly so where the victim\u2019s accusation is the only evidence of the crime. The State had no evidence of this robbery other than Daye\u2019s version of the event. There were no witnesses, and there was no physical evidence of the crime gathered by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>LaFave &amp; Israel </em>indicate that a narrow standard as to a prosecutor\u2019s duty to present exculpatory evidence serves to avoid \u201c \u2018convert[ing] a grand jury proceeding from an investigative one to a mini-trial on the merits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 96, 634 A.2d 576 (quoting <em>LaFave &amp; Israel, supra, </em>at 318).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The concept of a mini-trial must encompass the circumstance where accusatory evidence is presented by one witness and contradictory exculpatory evidence is presented by another witness. For example, in <em>Smith, </em>the State presented accusatory evidence to the grand jury. Had the prosecutor also presented the statements of defendant\u2019s three witnesses, the grand jury would be called upon to weigh the testimony, and the proceedings would become a \u201cmini-trial.\u201d On the other hand, presentation of the sole witness victim to the grand jury, where testimony is presented under oath and presumably with utmost solemnity, would permit the grand jury to consider the witness\u2019 initial accusation, her recantation, and the reasons for recantation. Such a presentation would not create a mini-trial. It would allow the grand jury to evaluate the evidence to determine if the State has a <em>prima facie </em>case requiring a trial of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">We also note that here, Daye signed a statement accusing defendant in August 1989, when she reported the crime. She signed a recantation affidavit and gave a taped statement to the public defender in May 1990. She did not sign any document or give a taped statement disavowing her recantation at the initial meeting with the prosecutor, as proffered in the prosecutor\u2019s oral argument on the motion to dismiss the indictment. The statement that she allegedly signed in July on meeting with the prosecutor\u2019s investigator was not presented to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The prosecutor certainly has the unbridled discretion to determine which cases will be presented to the grand jury. However, once a decision is made to present a case to the grand jury, it is incumbent on the prosecutor to present clearly exculpatory evidence to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>In <em>Smith, supra, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 95-96, 634 A.2d 576, we cited decisions in several jurisdictions (Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York and New Mexico) which rejected the California/ABA Standard as too broad. Two recent decisions in New York are helpful in resolving the issue posed in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In <em>People v. Ramjit, </em>203 A.D.2d 488, 612 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>600, 602, <em>appeal denied, </em>84 <em>N.Y.2d </em>831, 617 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>151, 641 <em>N.E.2d </em>172 (1994), an indictment dismissed by the trial court was reinstated on appeal. The appellate court concluded that a prosecutor\u2019s failure to present certain defense alibi witnesses to the grand jury was not grounds for dismissing an indictment, as the allegedly exculpatory evidence \u201cneither implicated a complete legal defense nor was of such quality as to create the potential to eliminate a \u2018needless or unfounded prosecution.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That conclusion comports with our decision in <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In <em>People v. Darrisaw, </em>206 A.D.2d 661, 614 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>622 (1994), a defendant was indicted for criminal possession of a controlled dangerous substance. <em>Id. </em>614 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>at 623. Defendant\u2019s companion at the time of arrest signed an affidavit which stated that the drugs were his and not defendant\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>614 N.Y.S.2d at 624. The companion retracted the statement after obtaining counsel. <em>Ibid. </em>The court noted the prosecutor\u2019s obligation to \u201cpresent all evidence that could, if believed, avoid a needless or unfounded prosecution.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>People v. Valles, </em>62 N.Y.2d 36, 476 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>50, 464 <em>N.E.2d </em>418 (1984)). However, the court noted that the grand jury proceeding is \u201cnot intended to be a \u2018mini-trial\u2019, at which competing evidence is weighed and questions of fact resolved; rather, its purpose is simply to determine whether the evidence proffered by the People, if fully credited, would support a conviction.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court found that the companion\u2019s affidavit mqrely presented questions of fact and credibility. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, the affidavit need not have been presented to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Here, defendant was compelled to stand trial based upon an accusatory statement given to police officers which was recanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>under oath but which was thereafter allegedly disavowed. The only witness presented to the grand jury was the police officer who, on the superseding indictment, did not even read the original accusation to the grand jury, but instead presented a synopsis. The grand jury was not presented with the recantation, nor was it presented with the disavowal of the recantation. It was deprived of its right to investigate and its ultimate task of determining whether the State did in fact present a <em>prima facie </em>case. That scenario was solely a result of the assistant prosecutor\u2019s personal belief that the recantation was not credible. We find that such conduct is another example of the prosecutor using the grand jury as its \u201cplaytoy.\u201d <em>State v. Engel, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 359, 592 A.2d 572 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>393, 614 A.2d 616 (1991); <em>Gaughran, supra, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 290, 615 A.2d 1293. We conclude that the court should have dismissed this indictment on defendant\u2019s motion without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In view of our conclusion, we need not discuss defendant\u2019s points of error referable to his trial or his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The judgment of conviction is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-29\"> A copy of the indictment of January 12, 1990 has not been made a part of the record on appeal. We are unable to determine which specific statutory sections were cited in the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-17\"> The underlined portions of the affidavit are handwritten and the balance is typed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
