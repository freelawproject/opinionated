The first two counts were dismissed on summary judgment, and are not involved on this appeal. The complaint was subsequently amended to add six additional counts under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A-.12-7, after which defendants moved pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7(8) to compel plaintiff to sell his interest as a minority shareholder in the corporations for fair market value. The motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">At a bench trial, the trial judge found for plaintiff on counts three, four and seven of the amended complaint. She found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>fair market value of plaintiffs stock in the Mandek Corporation (Mandek) to be $15,987.50 as of the date of the complaint, but reduced that figure by $15,100, the amount of unauthorized expenditures asserted in a counterclaim on which the judge found for defendants. The resulting judgment respecting count seven is not contested on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The judge also entered judgment for plaintiff in the amount of his loans to the corporations, as sought by plaintiff in counts three and four. The debts were determined to be $130,131 owed by Mandek and $35,625 by Complete Business Offices and Services Corporation (CBOS), a related company. Together with prejudgment interest, judgment was entered against Mandek in the total amount of $169,642.76 and against CBOS in the total amount of $46,442.96. Respecting the debt obligation as embodied in the judgment on counts three and four, the judgment also provided that Mandek shall pay plaintiff $2,827.38 together with interest on the unpaid balance \u201ceach month for sixty (60) months with interest each month at the rate set forth in <em>R. </em>4:42-ll(a)(ii) on the unpaid balance until paid in full,\u201d and that CBOS shall pay $774.05 each month plus interest for a similar period, later amended to $182.61 due to a partial satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Defendants argue that the trial court could not order repayment of the loans under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7 because plaintiff did not bring an action under that statute, because it would be inequitable as the termination of plaintiff was based upon his misconduct, and because the loan obligation of the corporations to plaintiff and the individual defendants, who constitute the majority shareholders, was premised upon repayment when the corporations are financially able to make the repayment and satisfy the debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The parties made the following stipulation of facts for trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEa\">1. Mandek Corp. is a New Jersey corporation established by plaintiff Franldin Knecht in 1982 to operate an executive suite office business in Port Lee, New Jersey. Mr. Knecht was initially the sole director and officer of Mandek Corp. and, with his wife, Marjorie, the owner of 100% of the capital stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>2. During 1983, defendants Joseph Murphy and Russell Anderson each paid $150,000.00 to Mandek Corp. and each became the owner of 37)4% of the capital stock. A shareholders agreement (Exhibit J-16 in evid.) was executed by Messrs. Knecht, Anderson and Murphy dated January 4,1983. The monies contributed by Murphy and Anderson were allocated on the financial statements of Mandek Corp. between common stock, $40,000 and long term shareholder debt of $110,000 each.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">3. From January 1983 to June 1989, plaintiff Knecht served as President and Chief Operating Officer of Mandek Corp. pursuant to Exhibit J-16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">4. In February 1986, Messrs. Knecht, Murphy and Anderson formed another New Jersey corporation, Complete Business Offices and Services Corp. to operate a second executive suite office business on Route 17 in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Mr. Murphy and Mr. Anderson each own 37)4% of the capital stock and Mr. Knecht owns 25% of the capital stock of CBOS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">5. From February 1986 until June 1989, plaintiff Franklin Knecht also served as President and Chief Operating Officer of CBOS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">6. Both Mandek Corp. and CBOS are Subehapter S corporations pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">7. The start-up of CBOS was financed by 2 bank loans totalling $240,000 which the 3 stockholders borrowed in their individual names from the National Community Bank. The loan proceeds were paid into CBOS by the 3 stockholders and allocated on the books of CBOS between capital and debt owed to stockholders. Repayment of these loans was made directly to NCB by CBOS each month, and the loan accounts of the 3 stockholders reduced accordingly. CBOS and Chestnut Ridge, Inc., a New Jersey corporation owned by Messrs. Murphy and Anderson which owned real estate in Saddle River, guaranteed repayment of these loans. These NCB loans were fully paid off by CBOS in 1992.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">8. In June, 1989, plaintiff Franklin Knecht was terminated by defendants Murphy and Anderson as President and Chief Operating Officer of both Mandek Corp. and CBOS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">After the bench trial, the judge made findings which are not challenged on this appeal. She concluded that because plaintiff, without any individual defendants\u2019 knowledge or approval, gave himself a salary raise, acquired disability insurance, and placed his wife and one daughter \u201con the books\u201d without their doing any work, defendants \u201cmay have been justified in terminating plaintiff as President of Mandek and CBOS.\u201d The judge found, however, that, after the termination, plaintiff maintained a \u201creasonable\u201d \u201cexpectation of notice\u201d concerning corporate activities and that defendants frustrated that expectation. She, therefore, ordered that the corporate defendants purchase plaintiffs stock. Her determinations on that subject and valuation of equity are not challenged on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>The judge also found that items \u201cheld on the corporate books were to be treated as loans,\u201d and were, in fact, corporate debt, not capital. She held \u201cit would be inappropriate to consider these sums to be equity when they have consistently been treated as loans.\u201d There is no claim by the defendants to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The judge further held that the debt also had to be repaid, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">No notes were ever drafted or executed. Defendant argues they are not repayable until the company turns a profit. Plaintiff testified that he believed defendants would keep infusing money into the business as needed. That was unreasonable of plaintiff. Defendants argue that they do not need to repay plaintiff until the company makes a profit. That is unreasonable of defendants. Plaintiff will no longer be a shareholder of defendant. He should not be expected to be considered as an investor dependent on a profit making over which he has neither control nor input. It is fair and reasonable to require repayment of these loans upon an equitable basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">There is no challenge to the judge\u2019s valuation of the debt. However, as already noted, defendants argue that because plaintiff did not bring this action under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7, the judge could not order the repayment to plaintiff of the long-term debt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">In December 1991, plaintiff successfully moved to file an amended complaint to add six counts seeking relief under the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:12-7. That section permits the court to take certain action where those in control of a corporation with \u201c25 or less shareholders ... have acted oppressively or unfairly toward one or more minority shareholders.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:12-7(l)(c). Upon motion of the corporation or a shareholder \u201cwho is a party to the proceeding,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:12-7(8) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">the court may order the sale of all shares of the corporation\u2019s stock held by any other shareholder who is a party to the proceeding to either the corporation or the moving shareholder or shareholders, whichever is specified in the motion, if the court determines in its discretion that such an order would be fair and equitable to all parties under all the circumstances of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Here, after the amended complaint was filed, defendants successfully moved for an order requiring plaintiff to \u201csell his shares of capital stock in defendants\u2019 Mandek Corp. and Complete Business Offices and Services Corp. to the respective corporations for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>fair value,\u201d pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7(8). Thus, even though the original complaint. may not have sought relief under the statute, once defendants successfully moved to compel plaintiff to sell his shares, there was statutory jurisdiction to order relief pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:12-7(8) in a case commenced under section 12-7(l)(c). Whether plaintiff could have compelled defendants to purchase his stock is irrelevant in this procedural setting. The purchase here was \u201cvoluntary.\u201d <em>See Brenner v. Berkowitz, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>488, 512-13, 634 A.2d 1019 (1993). Defendants sought to have the corporations purchase plaintiffs shares, and plaintiff does not object to the \u201cbuy out.\u201d <em>See Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Defendants also object to their obligation to pay off the debt, as <em>N.J.SA </em>14A:12-7(8) refers only to equity. They are indeed correct in the literal words of the statute. However, we do not believe that the statutory complex limits the equitable relief to a mere purchase of stock. This is particularly true in light of the trial judge\u2019s finding that plaintiffs reasonable expectations as a minority shareholder were frustrated when he was terminated as President, and not given the opportunity to exercise his equity interest in the corporations. <em>Compare Exadaktilos v. Cinnaminson Realty Co., Inc., </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>141, 400 A.2d 554 (Law Div.1979), <em>aff'd </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>559, 414 A.2d 994 (App.Div.1980), certif. denied, 85 <em>N.J. </em>112, 425 A.2d 273 (1980) (20% shareholder did not perform his corporate obligation). A minority shareholder\u2019s debt interest could be frustrated by the majority\u2019s corporate resolutions and actions designed to make it impossible to pay dividends or the debt obligation. Thus, <em>Brenner </em>permits the fashioning of equitable as well as statutory remedies in favor of \u201coppressed\u201d shareholders. <em>See Brenner, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 512-13, 634 A.2d 1019. As Justice Garibaldi noted for the Court, <em>\u201cN.J.SA </em>14A:12-7 was not intended to supersede the inherent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>common law power of the Chancery Division to achieve equity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512, 634 A.2d 1019.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As she further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">Based on the permissive wording of the statute, when a statutory violation occurs [such as to an \u201coppressed\u201d minority shareholder under section 12\u20147(l)(c) ], a court retains its discretion to fashion equitable remedies. Such equitable remedies are valuable because they allow relief to be fashioned directly to redress the statutory violations shown. Equitable remedies</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">\u201care distinguished for their flexibility, their unlimited variety, their adaptability to circumstances, and the natural rules which govern their use. There is in fact no limit to their variety and application; the court of equity has the power of devising its remedy and shaping it so as to fit the changing circumstances of every case and the complex relations of all the parties.\u201d <em>[Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Camp, </em>124 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>403, 411-12, 1 A.2d 425, 429 (E. &amp; A.1938) (quoting John N. Pomeroy, <em>Equity Jurisprudence </em>\u00a7 109 (John N. Pomeroy, Jr., ed., 4th ed. 1918)).]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 514, 634 A.2d 1019.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-8\"><em>See also Walensky v. Jonathan Royce International, Inc., </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 280-81, 624 A.2d 613 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>480, 634 A.2d 527 (1993) (decided before the Supreme Court opinion in Brenner). Hence, the trial judge was correct in concluding that she had the equitable power to order repayment of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Defendants argue, however, that the court\u2019s decision ordering the repayment was inequitable in this case because the minority shareholder was the one who defrauded the corporation, and was responsible for its poor financial condition due to his self-dealing, and because the court\u2019s decision is inconsistent with the equitable requirements of the statute regarding fair treatment for all shareholders. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7(8). Moreover, defendants insist that the proofs show that it was understood from the outset that the debt was only to be repaid when the corporations could financially afford to make the repayments, and that the judge, therefore, improperly \u201crewrote\u201d the shareholders\u2019 agreement by ordering \u201caccelerated repayment\u201d in advance of the corporations\u2019 ability to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>In her opinion, the judge determined that the debt should be repaid within five years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She found that \u201cthe financial statements and posttrial submissions indicate that term to be appropriate.\u201d No reasons are stated for that conclusion, but we need not pass upon defendants\u2019 contentions that the record does not support the five-year pay-out schedule ordered by the judge. We must, in any event, remand for further proceedings. There are other issues concerning the terms of repayment which must also be explored.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In the absence of fraud, a shareholder may assert the same rights any third party would have against the corporation. <em>See </em>12B <em>Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations, </em>\u00a7 5739 (1993). Therefore, if a shareholder lends money to the corporation, the corporation is the shareholder\u2019s debtor to the same extent the corporation would be to a third party lender. However, the debt owed a shareholder cannot be given preference over that owed to a third party. <em>See Belcher v. Webb, </em>176 Wash. 446, 29 P.2d 702, 704 (1934). Moreover, while shareholders \u201cmay use the same methods as other creditors to collect bona fide corporate debts owed to them,\u201d they may do so \u201conly so long as the corporation is solvent.\u201d <em>See Snyder Electric Co. v. Fleming, </em>305 N.W.2d 863, 869 (Minn.1981). When a corporation is \u201cinsolvent or on the verge of insolvency,\u201d no preference can defeat the corporation\u2019s obligations owed to a general creditor. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The trial court must examine the equities of its order regarding the debt repayment. In exercising her equitable jurisdiction, the judge must do equity. She cannot order repayment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>debt to plaintiff if it will jeopardize the rights of other creditors. Nor can she do so at the expense of defendants, particularly in light of her holding that plaintiffs conduct in unilaterally raising his salary and using corporate assets for personal benefit precipitated the dispute. <em>Cf. Snyder Electric, supra, </em>305 <em>N.</em>W.2d at 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Hence, in ordering the repayment of debt, the corporations\u2019 ability to survive must be considered. The corporations cannot be left on the \u201cverge of insolvency\u201d to the detriment of their surviving shareholders and other creditors, and at the risk of jeopardy to repayment of the same debt owed the individual defendants. In essence, the \u201cbuy-out,\u201d including the repayment of debt, \u201cis warranted only when it would be \u2018fair and equitable to <em>all </em>parties.\u2019\u201d <em>See Brenner, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 514, 634 A.2d 1019 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:12-7(8)) (emphasis in original). The payout schedule must be fashioned to consider these factors, and accompanied by specific reasons for the resulting schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The judgment under review is reversed with respect to the payment of debt, and the matter is remanded for a hearing regarding the corporations\u2019 ability to repay plaintiffs loan and the terms of repayment. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b474-10\"> Neither party asserts that commencement of this case as a contract action in the Law Division should make a difference. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Pellini, </em>75 <em>N.J.Super. </em>161, 168, 182 A.2d 566 (App.Div.1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\"> Despite the assertions at argument before us, the judge did not say there was any agreement by the parties on the issue. Rather, she stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">Conferences were held with counsel seeking agreement as to a payment schedule. At that time a 5-year payout was suggested by the Court as reasonable. A further review of the financial statements and post trial submissions indicate that term to be appropriate. Payments are to commence January 1, 1994 and are to continue monthly through December 1, 1999. The totals are to be as of December 31, 1989 with interest at the Court mandated rate to continue on any unpaid balance.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
