Eldridge and others, in a suit brought by them against him. After the judgment and while Friedlander was in custody under the order of arrest, and before he had been charged in execution against the person, he applied by petition to one of the judges of the court of common pleas that he might be exempted from arrest or imprisonment pursuant to article 5, chapter 5, title 1, part 2 of the Revised Statutes. This petition and relief was granted on. October 18, 1872, and Friedlander made the assignment required \u25a0 by that article. Friedlander then sought his discharge from imprisonment upon the execution against the person, upon <em>habeas </em>corpus, before Judge Robihsoh, of the common pleas, who refused to release him on the ground that \u201c the discharge obtained by the relator as an insolvent debtor, under the provisions of art. 5 (2 R. S. 28 to 31) was ineffectual to release him as a debtor already imprisoned on the executions in the civil actions mentioned in the return,\u201d and on the 4th of November, 1872, discharged the writ. Friedlander then made application to Mr. Justice Fa\u00edtcheb, as above stated, who ordered his discharge on the ground that \u201c the discharge of the defendant, under article 5, extends to debts in judgments as those under which he is now imprisoned.\u201d The other' material facts appear in the opinion of the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-5\"><em>G.

The whole of chapter 5, part 2 of Revised Statutes, is continued in force by section 471, Code of Procedure. A demurrer to the traverse having been interposed, it could not be held that it was <em>res adjudicata; </em>the party setting up the bar must make it appear that the decision was upon the merits and upon the same state of facts. <em>Geisler </em>v. <em>Acosta, </em>9 N.

He duly made the assignment and obtained his discharge under that act, and, being imprisoned in actions on some of the contracts made prior to his application, applied to Judge Robinson, on <em>habeas corpus, </em>to obtain his discharge, which was denied. He then, on a new writ, applied to Judge Rancher, who, after hearing, granted the discharge sought now to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The first point raised by the relators\u2019 counsel is that the question was <em>res adjudicata. </em>Any system of law which would keep a prisoner in custody, when the facts show him entitled to his discharge, would be a perversion of justice, and unless there is some reason to believe that the case and questions as presented to Judge Rancher had already been passed on by Judge Robinson, the point taken must fail. In looking at the record, we find that the proceedings before Judge Robinson were set up as a bar here, and that to such return the prisoner put in a traverse, denying, as matter of fact, that the case, as then presented, had been presented to and passed upon by Judge Robinson. To this the sheriff demurred, and on that demurrer Judge Rancher gave judgment. The case hardly presents such a state of facts as brings the relators within the rule laid down in the case of <em>Mercein </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>25 Wend. 64. The rule is there stated as broadly as courts could well go where liberty was concerned, and any extension of the rule would work injustice. As Judge Robinson did not pass upon the ease as presented to Judge Rancher, this point must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The next ground taken by the relators is that the non-imprisonment act, in fact, abolished the article under which the original discharge was sought, because it made provision in respect to debts fraudulently contracted and the mode of discharging them. In this the relator is mistaken. After the non-imprisonment act was passed no discharge under any other provision as to simple contract debts, without fraud, was needed, and the article then on the statute book, and continued as law for forty years, has only debts fraudulently contracted and on which persons can be arrested to act on. Again, that the non-imprisonment act of 1831 provides a mode after arrest of obtaining a discharge gives no evidence that the legislature did not intend to give the debtor a mode at any time before the arrest on final judgment in which he could, on his own motion and on a surrender of all he possessed, obtain such discharge. Article 6 provides for an entirely different proceeding and has no application to the rights claimed by Friedlander.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">When, as in this case, in order to obtain his original discharge, the defendant had to assign all he possessed, and, where it must be taken he did, there does not seem to be any good reason to strain the law to hold him.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The proceedings should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Daniels, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\n<em>Proceedings affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
