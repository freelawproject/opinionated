Upon receipt of the letter and order, plaintiffs sent the forks to the agents, but did not send the grapples and pulleys. Plaintiffs charged the forks to defendants upon their books, and defendants assented to this.

Plaintiffs did not send the grapples or pulleys. The forty-seven forks were charged on plaintiffs\u2019 books to the defendants, at $7 each. Some two or three weeks after forwarding the forks, the defendant Grems was at plaintiffs\u2019 office and was shown the foregoing letters, order and charge on plaintiffs\u2019 books, and was told that the forks had been forwarded consigned to Albert Clements &amp; <em>Co.-, </em>he said it was all right, and he would straighten it up in a few days. The forks have not been paid for by any person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-14\">The action was brought to recover for forty-seven forks. The case does not contain any answer, but as the cause was tried before the court.without a jury, there must have been an answer put in.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-15\">The defendants gave no evidence. The court found most of the facts above stated, and ordered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for the forty-seven forks, at $7 each, and from that judgment defendant appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-16\"><em>E.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaK\">The defendants\u2019 counsel insisted on the trial, and in his points on the appeal, that defendants were sureties merely for the Messrs. Clements, and that as the plaintiffs had not complied with defendants\u2019 letter or the order of the Messrs. Clements, they could not recover for the value of the forks. Such a proposition cannot be maintained. The defendants purchased the forks upon their own responsibility; they were charged for them, and are bound to pay for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The plaintiffs might have treated the Messrs. Clements as the purchasers, and had they done so, there might be a question whether plaintiffs had so complied with the order as to entitle them to recover. But there is no such question in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The plaintiffs were not bound to show that the forks came to the possession of the Messrs. Clements. Their contract was fully performed when they delivered the forks to a carrier to be taken to Bangor, as directed by Clements.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">The judgment is right and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
