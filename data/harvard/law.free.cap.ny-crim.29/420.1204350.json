Granato led the way, the others followed, and were within arm\u2019s reach of defendant when he was at the desk. What Granato said to him Turner did not know; but defendant asked his name and gave him two keys, after Granato had written in the book, handed him by defendant, the names \u201c Frank Brown and wife \u201d and \u201c Tony Smith and wife,\u201d in the presence of all. Then defendant summoned the woman Bougie, who took the keys and at defendant\u2019s direction went upstairs, followed by the party. Turner stayed there a half hour and, coming down, was let out by defendant. Walsh practically confirms Turner\u2019s story, and the presence of the defendant is not in dispute. Turner and Walsh were recalled, and testified that the couples were in adjoining rooms, with a door opening between them, and that the door was opened. The indictment charges that defendant\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">\u201cdid feloniously take, receive, harbor, employ, and use, and cause and procure to be taken, received, harbored, employed, and used, and did aid and abet one Frank Granato to take, receive, harbor, employ, and use, one Nellie Turner, who was then and there a female under the age of 18 years, to wit,, of the age of 15 years, for the purpose of sexual inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>course, with him, the said Frank Granato; he, the said Frank Granato, not being then and there the husband of the said Nellie Turner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The case falls under subdivision 1, section 70 of the Penal Law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 40) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\u201c A person who: 1. Takes, receives, employs, harbors or uses, or causes \u00a9r procures to be taken, received, employed or harbored or used, a female under the age of eighteen years, for the purpose of prostitution, or, not being her husband, for the purpose of sexual intercourse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The question is whether the defendant, by doing what he did, offended the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Section 282 of the Penal Code in 1884 was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">\u201c A person who takes a female under the age of sixteen years for the purpose of prostitution or sexual intercourse,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Under such statute, in People v. Plath, 100 N. Y. 590, 3 N. E. 790, 53 Am. Rep. 236, the defendant was indicted; but it appeared that the woman, to the defendant unknown, had voluntarily come to his concert saloon, and upon his invitation accompanied him to a part of the building where he took indecent liberties with her person. The decision that his act was not a \u201c taking \u201d under the statute. The opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">\u201c There is nothing in the section of the act under which defendant was convicted making the employment of a female under 16 years of age for purposes of prostitution or sexual intercourse a criminal offense, except where it is accompanied with a taking of her person by some active agency for such purpose. The word \u2018 takes \u2019 seems to be used to distinguish the act prohibited, from those where the female is merely received, or permitted and allowed to follow a life of prostitution, without persuasive inducement by the person accused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">This decision was in December, 1885. The act was amended on March 18, 1886 (chapter 31, Laws 1886), so as to make an offender a person who\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-12\">\u2022\u201ctakes, receives, employs, harbors or uses, or causes or procures to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>taken, received, employed, harbored or used, a female under the age of sixteen years, for the purpose of prostitution, or, not being her husband, for the purpose of sexual intercourse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">As I understand, the learned counsel for the appellant proposes: (1)- That under the recent decision in People ex rel. Howey v. Warden, 207 N. Y. 354, 101 N. E. 167, the test of guilt is whether she was taken, received, etc., for the purposes of common prostitution, rather than for a single act of intercourse; (\u00a3) that a person may take, receive, employ, harbor, or use, or cause the same, for the purpose of sexual intercourse with some other than himself. But he modifies this second contention by the statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">\u201c If one were to participate actively in aiding and abetting another in the defilement of such a female, we concede he might be held as an accessory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The argument, then, must be that by receiving the female and man, and providing them with a bedroom, the defendant did not participate actively in aiding and abetting. This is quite contrary to the holding of this court in People ex rel. Bougie v. McLaughlin, 153 App. Div. 908, 137 N. Y. Supp. 1135, where the woman convicted was the very one who was summoned by this defendant, and to whom he handed the keys, with the direction to show the persons to the room. If that was a legal conviction, this defendant is guilty as found. The indictment here charges also that the defendant aided and abetted Granato, and the Penal Law (section 2) provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">\u201c Principal. A person concerned in the commission of a crime, whether he directly commits the act constituting the offense or aids and abets in its commission, and whether present or absent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The essential guilty act under the indictment is receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>and harboring the female for the purpose of sexual intercourse. It is not necessary to guilt that the intercourse result, although the consummation is evidence of the purpose. But in the receiving and harboring the defendant was an active participant. To him was delegated the power to withhold or to furnish the room for the purpose for which the parties had come, nor is his guilt the less that, as a servant to the keeper of the house, he aided Granato. Without his interposition there could not then and there have been \u201c receiving \u201d or \u201c harboring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In this view of the case I do not appreciate the argument that there could be no violation of the statute, because it was not the purpose that the defendant should have intercourse with the female. If his acts aided and abetted, he was guilty. Section 70, however, as I judge, does not mean that the taking, receiving, harboring, is for the purpose of prostitution only. The statute plainly says \u201c for the purpose of prostitution, or * * * for the purpose of sexual intercourse.\u201d Why doubt, when the language in plainest terms manifests the meaning?</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The words \u201c not being her husband,\u201d interpolated as they are, may beget discussion, whether under this section a husband who took, received, or harbored his wife for the purpose of sexual intercourse with another, would be guilty. The section after the word \u201c or,\u201d with proper words supplied from the earlier clause, would read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">\u201c A person who, * * * not being her husband, takes, receives, employs, harbors, or uses, or causes or procures to be taken, received, employed, harbored, or used, a female under the age of eighteen years, for the purpose of sexual intercourse * * * is guilty of abduction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">If, then, he be her husband, can he, so far as this section is concerned, take, receive, etc., her for sexual intercourse with another ? Again, if one not her husband receives, harbors, etc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>her for intercourse with some one not her husband nor himself, does he go free?</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Grammatical construction yields to evidenced intention, and I have no doubt that the Legislature intended by the section to condemn any person, husband or otherwise, who took, received, etc., such a female for sexual intercourse with any person not' her husband. In any case, it did intend to denounce persons generally who abducted such a female for sexual intercourse with any person other than her husband, and if it is not broad enough to cover the husband as an abductor, there is no reason why all participating should, escape, unless it be proven that they did the act for their own lust. The evil to be denounced was not alone abduction by a man for his own indulgence, but by men for any and all illicit intercourse; nor do I suppose that it was in the legislative thought that husbands were taking their wives under 18 years of age for the purpose of sexual intercourse with some other person. If it be said that the practice of men using their wives for hire for prostitution or for sexual intercourse was known, then it. is answered that the Legislature recognized this in the enactment of sections 1090 and 2460 of the Penal Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">NOTE ON ABDUCTION.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">(See v. 16, p.

Powell, 4 N. Y. Crim. 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Upon the trial of an indictment for the abduction of a female under sixteen years of age, alleged to have been committed in 1886, it was held, that evidence was inadmissible of declarations of the defendant made in 1889, and of physicians, as to the physical condition in 1890, of the female alleged to have been abducted. People v. Betzinger, 49 St. Rep. 597, 10 N. Y. Crim. 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Upon the trial of an indictment of a defendant charged with two others, with abducting a female of previous chaste character, under the age of sixteen, to another city for the purpose of prostitution and sexual intercourse, where the complainant testified that the four went together to a hotel, and she left her door open, and the defendant entered her room and had sexual intercourse with her, and that she had never had intercourse with any person before, and it appeared that the defendant registered at the hotel under an assumed name; it was held, that a verdict of guilty would not be set aside, where the defendant admitted his intercourse, but testified that he knocked at her door, which was locked, nnd that she let him in, and that previously he had perpetrated several acts of sexual intercourse with her in his own hotel, and called witnesses who gave evidence to show that she had allowed such intercourse, which evidence, however, was contradicted. (The admissibility of the evidence and sufficiency of the charge was also discussed in the opinion.) People v. Brown, 71 Hun 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Upon a trial for abduction, where the age of the complainant was in issue, it was held, that a record by a former teacher, in her own handwriting, as to complainant\u2019s age, was inadmissible in evidence, where such teacher testified that without looking at the record, she'was unable to remember what the complainant told her as to her age. People v. Brow, 90 Hun 509; 11 N. Y. Crim. 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Upon the trial of an indictment for abduction in marrying a female under eighteen years of age, without the consent of her only living parent, the admission, over objection, of evidence that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>had a wife living at the time of the marriage in question constitutes reversible error. People v. Cerami, 101 App. Div. 366; 19 N. Y. Crim. 78, aff\u2019d 181 N. Y. 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">The testimony of an abducted female in consideration of the evidence was held to be sufficiently supported by other evidence to sustain a conviction for abduction, under section 282 of the Penal Code. People v. Brandt, 14 St. Rep. 419; 110 N. Y. 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">It is not error to allow a physician to express an opinion that the genital organs of the female have been penetrated by force within a week. People v. Stott, 5 N. Y. Crim. 61, affirming 4 N. Y. Crim. 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Upon the trial of an indictment for taking, harboring, and receiving for the purpose of sexual intercourse, a female under the age of sixteen years, where such female was brought by the defendant from another state, it was held, that it was competent for the prosecution to show that the defendant had been intimate with the female in such other state, as characterizing the relations existing between them. People v. Wah Lee Mon, 37 St. Rep. 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">To constitute abduction under section 282, subd. 1, of the Penal Code it need not be shown that the accused used force or practiced fraud or deception. It is sufficient if the female be induced by his request, advice or persuasion, to go from the place where he approached her with solicitation, and accompany him or meet him at some other place indicated by him with the intent there to accomplish her defilement. It is not necessary that she be taken against her will. People v. Seeley, 37 Hun 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">To support a conviction for abduction under section 282 of the Penal Code, the people must show not only a taking by the defendant within the meaning of the statute, but also that such taking was for the purpose of prostitution. People v. Plath, 100 N. Y. 590; s. c. 4 N. Y. Crim. 43, rev\u2019g 36 Hun 454 ; 3 N. Y.

Kauffman v. People, 11 Hun 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">To sustain an indictment for abduction, under the act of March 20, 1S48, it must be shown that the female was chaste in principle up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>the time of the commission of the offense, and that the abduction was for the purpose of indiscriminate prostitution. Carpenter v. People, 8 Barb. 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">An intent is an essential element of crime, it is competent to show conduct on the part of defendant tending to establish motive, which may be done by evidence of conduct previous to the time alleged in the indictment, tending to show that he had intention to make use of complainant for purposes prohibited by the statute. People v. Spriggs, 119 App. Div. 236; 21 N. Y. Crim. 180; appeal dismissed 194 N. Y. 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Corroborative evidence, whether consisting of acts or admissions, must be of such a character as tends to prove to some extent the guilt of the accused by connecting him with the crime charged in the indictment, and upon \u00e1 prosecution for abduction, the testimony of a physician who examined the complainant twelve days- after the date of the alleged offense, to the effect that the complainant had had sexual intercourse, but the time of which he was unable to place as being before or after the time of the act charged, is not corroborative of complainant\u2019s testimony as to the charge of abduction. Nor is the testimony of the complainant that defendant on the Sunday morning upon which the crime was alleged to have been committed, went with complainant and her companion to a store and purchased articles for them, corroborated by the testimony of a saleswoman that on some Sunday morning which she could not place, two girls and a man purchased articles, and that she recognized complainant\u2019s companion as one of the girls. People v. Swazey, 77 App. Div. 185; 17 N. Y.

Panyko, 71 App. Div. 324; 16 N. Y. Crim. 438, aff\u2019d 171 N. Y. 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Upon the trial of an indictment for abduction of a girl under eighteen years of age for the purpose of prostitution, evidence given by a person employed in a disorderly house that she saw the defendant standing in a hallway of the house with other men and the girl abducted is not sufficient to corroborate the testimony of the girl abducted. People v. Miller, 70 App. Div. 592; 16 N. Y. Crim. 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">To sustain a conviction for abduction the evidence of the prosecutrix must be corroborated by evidence tending to. show the material facts necessary to establish the commission of the crime and the identity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the person committing it. People v. Plath, 100 N. Y. 590, 4 N. Y. Crim. 43, rev\u2019g 36 Hun 454, 3 N. Y. Crim. 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Upon the trial of an indictment for abduction, it is error for the court, in charging the jury, to refer to the testimony of a witness in such a way as to inform the jury that in the opinion of the court, the testimony of such witness is false; so, it is error for the court to show that it believes that the testimony as to criminating admission by defendant, was not in a joke, when the witness, who testified to such admission, testified that at the time he believed defendant was joking, and the defendant also testified that he was joking. People v. Brow, 90 Hun 509; 11 N. Y. Crim. 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">On the trial of an indictment for abduction, a ship\u2019s manifest tending to show that the female in question was below the age of copsent was put in evidence. The accuracy of the manifest was contested. <em>Held, </em>that an instruction that in determining the age of the female the jury may consider the manifest, is not reversible error. People v. Wolf, 107 App. Div. 449; 19 N. Y. Crim. 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Upon the trial of an indictment for abduction, under subdivision 1, section 282 Penal Code, at which the only evidence that the complainant was under eighteen years of age, which is an essential element of the crime, is the testimony of the complainant supported by her appearance on the stand, it is error for the court to refuse to charge that, in determining the age of the complainant, the jury might consider the fact that she was not dr\u00e9ssed in her usual manner, and that her hair was done up on the top of her head, and the further fact that the woman whom the complainant testified had the plaintiff\u2019s birth certificate was not requested' to \u25a0 produce it when sworn on behalf of the prosecution.

Procedure only applies where the only sentence imposed is a fine, or a fine and imprisonment in the County Jail. People ex rel. Gately v. Sage, 13 App. Div. 135; 2 N. Y. Crim. 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Assault in the Third Degree \u2014 Generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Assault in the third degree being a misdemeanor, while the other degrees are felonies under the penal code, a conviction of the \u201c misdemeanor of assault and battery \u201d is proper, and equivalent to a conviction for assault in the third degree. People v. Maticke, Dail Reg. Feb. 8th, 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Assault in the third degree being only a misdemeanor, is punishable as provided by section 15 of the Penal Code; a sentence for one year in the State Prison at hard labor is void. People v. Kelly, 97 N. Y. 212, 2 N. Y. Crim. 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Same \u2014 Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Where defendant is accused of assault in having caused the arrest of complainant without cause, where it is shown that the arrest resulted from an interview in which the defendant accused the complainant of seducing her daughter, evidence of such seduction is competent to show the defendant\u2019s motive for making the arrest. People v. Dailey, 73 Hun 16; 9 N. Y. Crim. 110; aff\u2019d 143 N. Y. 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Where the defendant denied the charge, and testified that she never-had a pistol in her pocket or had possession of one in eighteen months, and denied on cross-examination that she had, in various instances named, drawn a pistol and threatened to shoot certain persons named, it was held to be error to permit the prosecution in rebuttal to call such persons and others to testify that defendant had drawn the pistol and made such threats; evidence of assaults and threats at other times than the one in question are inadmissible. People v. Drake, 65 Hun 331; 10 N. Y. Crim. 31; 47 St. Rep. 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Same \u2014 Trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">Where the complainant before a police magistrate charged the defendant with \u201c maliciously and unlawfully beating \u201d the complainant, by \u201c kicking him in the head, body and face without provocation \u201d it was held to be sufficient to support a conviction. The court refused to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>verse such a conviction because the defendant, on applying for an adjournment, paid to the justice a sum of money, for the complainant\u2019s private counsel, and the complainant\u2019s expenses. People v. Parker, 69 Hun 130; 10 N. Y. Crim. 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">A ruling that the indictment sufficiently alleged a higher degree of assault than the defendant was convicted of, held harmless error. People v. Doyle, 11 App. Div. 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Upon a trial for assault in the third degree, a reference to an excluded newspaper article, and an unfounded characterization of defendant\u2019s reputation as vile, are improper on the part of the District Attorney, and where the verdict is inconsistent and against the weight of the evidence they furnish ground for granting a new trial.
