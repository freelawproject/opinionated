The court does not care to hear the district attorney, as the court has no doubt as to the absolute discretion of the trial court to order the prisoners into custody at any time after their appearance for trial; that both sctions 4\u00a122 and <em>553 </em>of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be read together; that they are not inconsistent, and they do not give a person indicted for a misdemeanor an absolute right to remain at large on bail after his trial has commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The writ will therefore be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
