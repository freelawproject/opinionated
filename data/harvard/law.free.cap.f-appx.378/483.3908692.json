Hunter, federal prisoner # 08704-017, appeals the dismissal of his September 8, 2009, motion for summary judgment, contending that the district court erred in dismissing the motion prior to its service on the United States Parole Commission and without addressing the merits. He has also moved for appointment of counsel and to remand his case so that the district court may rule on the merits of his summary judgment motion. Hunter, however, has failed to adequately brief the summary judgment dismissal and, therefore, has waived its review. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">Moreover, the denial of Hunter\u2019s September 8, 2009, summary judgment motion is not the subject of this appeal. The instant appeal number, 09-30884, was assigned to Hunter\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of Hunter\u2019s request for unconditional habeas corpus release. He has, however, failed to brief the denial of this motion and has thus waived its review. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, 985 </em>F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). In light of the preceding, the judgment of the district court is affirmed, and Hunter\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and remand are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">After Hunter filed his appellate brief, he submitted for filing a pleading entitled \u201cAppellant Response to the Court Order Dated February 2, 2009,\u201d addressing the merits of the district court\u2019s ruling on remand that he was not entitled to \u00a7 2241 relief. The propriety of the district court\u2019s judgment denying Hunter relief on the merits is the subject of appeal number 09-31186, which is currently pending before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-15\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL AND REMAND DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
