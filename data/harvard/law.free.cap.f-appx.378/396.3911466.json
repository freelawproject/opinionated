Roberson, Texas prisoner #838289, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). He argues that the district court erred in concluding that his complaint was not timely filed. We review for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Stanley v. Foster, </em>464 F.3d 565, 568 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-26\">The statute of limitations applicable in the instant case is borrowed from that applicable to Texas personal injury claims, which is two years. <em>Id. </em>Any relevant tolling provisions of Texas law also are applicable. <em>Jackson v. Johnson, </em>950 F.2d 263, 265 (5th Cir.1992). However, \u201cthe accrual date of a \u00a7 1983 cause of action is a question of federal law that is <em>not </em>resolved by reference to state law.\u201d <em>Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 388, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007). Under federal law, a claim generally accrues \u201cthe moment the plaintiff becomes aware that he has suffered an injury or has sufficient information to know that he has been injured\u201d and that there is a connection between his injury and the defendant\u2019s actions. <em>Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>237 F.3d 567, 576 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-27\">Roberson\u2019s assertion that his cause of action did not accrue until the December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>2008 dismissal of his \u201cremaining\u201d robbery cause is without factual support. Roberson\u2019s own pleadings indicate that in January 2005, he became aware that he \u201chad better do something\u201d because the defendants had determined to deny him the property. Roberson\u2019s claim thus accrued, at the latest, at that time. <em>See Piotrowski, </em>237 F.3d at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Assuming, arguendo, that the continuing tort doctrine is available in the instant factual and procedural scenario, we reject Roberson\u2019s argument that the defendants\u2019 actions constituted a continuing tort. The seizure of his property was a single act and its continued retention was merely an \u201cill effect\u201d of the original act. Roberson\u2019s reliance on the doctrine of fraudulent concealment fails because even accepting Roberson\u2019s assertion that the defendants have conspired to conceal his ownership rights to the property, they did not conceal the fact of their deprivation of the property-</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Roberson\u2019s argument that dismissal of his complaint under \u00a7 1915 was error because he paid a partial filing fee is without merit. Similarly, his argument that application of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) was inappropriate is without merit because \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) \u201crequires dismissal of frivolous IFP actions even if they are brought by non-prisoner plaintiffs.\u201d We also note that following the enactment of \u00a7 1915(e), a dismissal as frivolous in an IFP proceeding should be deemed a dismissal with prejudice unless the district court specifies that the dismissal is without prejudice. <em>Marts v. Hines, </em>117 F.3d 1504, 1506 (5th Cir.1997) (en banc). Accordingly, the dismissal of Roberson\u2019s complaint with prejudice under \u00a7 1915(e) was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
