Melvin argues that the district court erred by imposing a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d) enhancement because it found that he was serving a previously imposed term of probation at the time of the instant offense. Because Melvin did not object to the calculation of his criminal history category in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Alvarado-Santilano, </em>434 F.3d 794, 795 (5th Cir.2005). Whether a term of probation has expired at the time that a conspiracy began is an issue of fact. <em>United States v. Ingles, </em>445 F.3d 830, 839-40 (5th Cir.2006)(reviewing the issue for clear error). Because the district court could have resolved this issue upon objection at sentencing, we cannot find plain error. <em>See United States v. Chung, </em>261 F.3d 536, 539 (5th Cir.2001). In any event, because the conspiracy commenced in March 2007 and because the probationary period at issue did not end until June 2007, the district court did not err, either plainly or clearly, by imposing the enhancement. <em>See Ingles, </em>445 F.3d at 840. Given that, pursuant to \u00a7 4Al.l(d), Melvin was properly assessed at least two criminal history points, the district court did not err by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>denying Melvin a safety valve adjustment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">This court need not address Melvin\u2019s remaining arguments regarding the alleged miscalculation of his criminal history category or his contention that he deserved an offense level reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Because Melvin\u2019s guidelines range was determined by the 10-year statutory minimum, the alleged errors, even if proven, did not affect his guidelines range and were harmless. <em>See United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 753 (5th Cir.2009). The record demonstrates that the district court properly regarded the guidelines range as the \u201cinitial benchmark\u201d from which it departed. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The court indicated that it understood that the guidelines range was advisory and that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 factors in arriving at the appropriate sentence. Melvin, who did not object to his sentence, fails to show that the district court plainly erred by imposing a procedurally or substantively unreasonable sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
