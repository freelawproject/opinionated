Fernandes thereafter challenged the Commissioner\u2019s decision in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. That court affirmed. Fernandes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>now appeals, arguing that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that he was not disabled on the ground that he could perform work available in the national economy. Specifically, Fer-nandes asserts that the hypothetical question posed by the ALJ to the vocational expert did not comprise all of Fernandes\u2019s alleged impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">We review the ALJ\u2019s factual findings with deference and the ALJ\u2019s legal conclusions with close scrutiny. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). We will not reweigh the evidence, make credibility determinations, or substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ, but instead will review the record to determine if substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cSubstantial evidence is less than a preponderance, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">An individual claiming SSI benefits bears the burden of demonstrating the existence of a disability as defined by the Social Security Act (\u201cAct\u201d). <em>Id. </em>A claimant is considered disabled \u201cif he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">The social security regulations establish a \u201cfive-step sequential evaluation process\u201d to determine whether an SSI claimant is disabled. <em>Crayton v. Callahan, </em>120 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted). The ALJ must evaluate: (1) whether the claimant is engaging in substantial gainful employment; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) whether the severe impairment meets or equals an impairment in the listed impairments; (4) whether the claimant has the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform his past relevant work; and (5) whether, in light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience, there is other work that the claimant can perform. <em>See Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1237-39 (11th Cir.2004); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">If the claimant proves that he cannot perform his past relevant work at step four, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to show, at step five, that there is other work available in the national economy that the claimant can perform. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). If the ALJ finds that the claimant is able to perform other work, the ALJ \u201cmust articulate specific jobs that the claimant is able to perform, and this finding must be supported by substantial evidence, not mere intuition or conjecture.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1227 (11th Cir.2002). One way in which the ALJ may determine whether the claimant is able to perform other work is by posing a hypothetical question to a vocational expert. <em>See id. </em>\u201cIn order for a vocational expert\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question \u201cneed only include the claimant\u2019s impairments,\u201d as opposed to \u201ceach and every symptom\u201d allegedly suffered by the claimant but either not supported by medical records or alleviated by medication. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1270 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">In this case, the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question to the vocational expert was not deficient in that it omitted some of Fer-nandes\u2019s alleged impairments. Notably, Fernandes has failed to show that these alleged impairments had support in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>record such that the ALJ needed to account for them in the hypothetical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\">The judgement of the district court affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
