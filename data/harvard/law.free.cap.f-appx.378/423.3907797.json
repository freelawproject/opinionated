In his \u00a7 2254 application Stokes challenged his conviction of second degree murder and the resulting sentence of life imprisonment. The district court\u2019s timeliness determination was, in part, based upon its conclusion that Stokes\u2019s conviction became final prior to the conclusion of his out-of-time appeal for purposes of the limitation period set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-20\">A COA may be issued only if the applicant \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). When the district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 2254 relief is based on procedural grounds without analysis of the underlying constitutional claims, \u201ca COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-21\">After the district court issued its judgment in this case, the Supreme Court held that \u201cwhere a state court grants a criminal defendant the right to file an out-of-time direct appeal during state collateral review, but before the defendant has first sought federal habeas relief, his judgment is not yet \u2018final\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).\u201d <em>Jimenez v. Quarterman, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 681, 686, 172 L.Ed.2d 475 (2009). Thus, \u201c \u2018the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\u2019 must reflect the conclusion of the out-of-time direct appeal, or the expiration of the time for seeking review of that appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686-87; <em>see also Womack v. Thaler, </em>591 F.3d 757 (5th Cir.2009) (applying <em>Jimenez </em>). Consequently, jurists of reason could debate the propriety of the district court\u2019s procedural ruling. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Jurists of reason could likewise debate whether Stokes\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application \u201cstates a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>We therefore grant a COA, vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Stokes\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application as untimely, and remand the matter to the district court for further proceedings consistent with <em>Jimenez </em>and <em>Womack. See Houser v. Dretke, </em>395 F.3d 560, 562 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 387-88 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">COA GRANTED; JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
