Acquisition Corp. d/b/a Bev Smith Toyota alleging violations of the Truth in Lending Act, the Florida Motion Vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>Retail Sales Finance Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practice Act. The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (R.l-20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">Appellant\u2019s brief acknowledges that this case \u201cis a virtual mirror image of <em>Hunter v. Bev Smith Ford, LLC\u201d </em>a putative class action that was dismissed by the district court and was pending on appeal at the time this appeal was briefed. (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11.) And, Appellant makes no additional arguments to those made in the <em>Hunter </em>appeal as to why the district court erred when it dismissed his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">Since this appeal was briefed, a panel of this court heard oral argument in <em>Hunter </em>and issued an opinion affirming the dismissal of that case. <em>Hunter v. Bev Smith Ford, LLC, </em>353 Fed.Appx. 218 (11th Cir.2009). In this case, as we did in <em>Hunter, </em>we reject Appellant\u2019s arguments and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
