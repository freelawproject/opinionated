Barnes\u2019s IFP motion challenging the certification decision \u201cmust be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Baugh v. </em>Taylor, 117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into whether the appeal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The district court is directed to dismiss a complaint filed by a prisoner if the complaint is frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915A(b)(l), 1915(e)(2)(B). A movant for leave to proceed IFP on appeal must show that he is a pauper appealing in good faith, i.e., that his appeal presents a non-frivolous issue. <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). \u201cFrivolous\u201d is defined as \u201clacking] an arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001). \u201c[A] complaint lacks such a basis if it relies on an indisputably meritless legal theory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The dismissal of a complaint as frivolous is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915A is reviewed de novo. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). Because the district court\u2019s dismissal was based on \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), (ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), review is de novo. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Barnes maintains that, while he was in their custody, the defendants discontinued his prescribed medications and substituted other medications and that the defendants otherwise denied him medical care when he needed it. Proceeding pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, he asserts that the defendants\u2019 actions and omissions violated rights guaranteed him by the Eighth and the Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Prison officials violate the constitutional proscription against cruel and unusual punishment when they exhibit deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs, causing unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). To prevail on a claim of inadequate medical care, a plaintiff \u201cmust allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). \u201cThe legal conclusion of \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 ... must rest on facts clearly evincing \u2018wanton\u2019 actions on the part of the defendants.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Treen, </em>759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985). A prison official acts with deliberate indifference only if he \u201cknows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Reeves v. Collins, </em>27 F.3d 174, 176 (5th Cir.1994) (applying <em>Farmer </em>to medical claims). This requires not only that the official be aware of the facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists but also that he indeed draw the inference. <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 839, 114 S.Ct. 1970. Neither unsuccessful medical treatment, nor negligence, nor medical malpractice is enough to give rise to a \u00a7 1983 cause of action. <em>Stewart v. Murphy, </em>174 F.3d 530, 534 (5th Cir.1999). Further, a prisoner\u2019s disagreement with his medical treatment is ordinarily insufficient to support an action under \u00a7 1983. <em>Banuelos v. McFarland, </em>41 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Barnes\u2019s allegations of deliberate indifference are conclusory and do not suffice to raise a nonfrivolous appellate issue. <em>See Mowbray v. Cameron County, Tex., </em>274 F.3d 269, 278 (5th Cir.2001). Further, Barnes\u2019s allegations that jail officials changed his medications state, at best, a claim of malpractice or of negligence, neither of which is actionable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Stewart, </em>174 F.3d at 534. Moreover, Barnes\u2019s acknowledgment that the defendants provided him with care when he was in medical crises belies his claim that they were indifferent to his medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Barnes has failed to show that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint. <em>See Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 373. Because Barnes\u2019s appeal does not present a nonfrivolous issue, his IFP motion is denied and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See Carson, </em>689 F.2d at 586; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of Barnes\u2019s complaint counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g), and the dismissal of his appeal counts as a second strike. <em>Cf. Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Barnes is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g) he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">MOTION TO PROCEED IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
