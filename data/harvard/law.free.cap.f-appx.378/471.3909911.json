Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines modified the guideline ranges applicable to cocaine base offenses to reduce the disparity between cocaine base and powder cocaine sentences. U.S.S.G. Supp. to App. C, Amend. 706; <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-23\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence only where the defendant\u2019s sentencing range is actually lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Because Reynolds was accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, Amendment 706 did not change his guidelines sentence range. <em>See </em>Amend. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-25\">\u201cA \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the sentencing judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, p.s. Thus, Reynolds was not entitled to have the district court recalculate his base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-26\">Because Reynolds is ineligible for relief, the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Reynolds\u2019s request in his brief for appointment of counsel for presentation of oral argument is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
