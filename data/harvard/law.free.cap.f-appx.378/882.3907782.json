In the plea agreement, the parties agreed to recommend that the district court impose a sentence within the Sentencing Guidelines advisory sentence range and that the \u201ccourt neither depart upward nor depart downward under the Sentencing Guidelines when determining the advisory sentencing guideline range.\u201d At sentencing, the Government, responding to Jordan\u2019s objection to the probation officer\u2019s presentenee report recommendation that the base offense level be enhanced by two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) because she was the organizer and leader of the conspiracy, argued that the enhancement was appropriate. The district court applied the enhancement and sentenced Jordan to a prison term of 37 months. She now appeals the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">On appeal, Jordan argues that the Government breached the plea agreement when it adopted the probation officer\u2019s recommendation that the \u00a7 3B 1.1(c) enhancement be imposed because the plea agreement prohibited the Government from requesting the court to \u201cdepart upward\u201d from the Guidelines sentence range. She asserts that although \u201cdepart upward\u201d is not defined in the plea agreement, the agreement contemplated all departures (including adjustments to the offense level) because it referenced departures \u201cunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d Alternatively, she argues that if we determine that the meaning of the term is ambiguous, we must resolve the ambiguity in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">If the government makes a material promise that induces a defendant to plead guilty, the government must honor that promise. <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 499, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). Whether a plea agreement contains the promise asserted is determined according to the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding of the agreement on entering the guilty plea. <em>United States v. Rewis, </em>969 F.2d 985, 988 (11th Cir.1992). \u201cIf the parties dispute the meaning of the agreement, we interpret the terms of the plea agreement based on objective standards.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>487 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir.2007) <em>(per curiam </em>).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">When interpreting a plea agreement, a \u201chyper-technical reading of the written agreement\u201d and \u201ca rigidly literal approach in the construction of language\u201d should be avoided. <em>United States v. Jefferies, </em>908 F.2d 1520, 1523 (11th Cir.1990). Additionally, the court should read the written agreement \u201cagainst the background of the negotiations\u201d and avoid interpretations that directly contradict on oral understanding between the parties. <em>Id. </em>Final<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>ly, if terras in the plea agreement are ambiguous, those terms must be read against the government. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">However, because plea agreements are like contracts, contract law principles also apply when determining what the parties to the plea agreement intended the terms in the agreement to mean. <em>United States v. Rubbo, </em>396 F.3d 1330, 1334 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, where there is nothing to indicate that the parties indicated language to have a meaning other than its usual and ordinary meaning, the court should apply that meaning. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, in ordinary contract law, \u201ctechnical terms are given their usual legal meaning.\u201d <em>Robin v. Sun Oil Co., </em>548 F.2d 554, 557 (5th Cir.1977); <em>see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 202(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Here, the term \u201cdepart upward\u201d should be given its usual and ordinary meaning in the context of sentencing under the Sentencing Guidelines. Therefore, because the leader and organizer offense-level adjustment the Government argued for does not fall within the definition of a departure, as that term is used in the Sentencing Guidelines context, the Government did not breach the plea agreement. Accordingly, we affirm Jordan\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
