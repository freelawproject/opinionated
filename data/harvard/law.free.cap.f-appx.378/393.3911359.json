Martin was arrested and charged with \u201cremaining after being forbidden\u201d and \u201cinterfering with duties of a police officer.\u201d At trial, all charges against Martin were dismissed. Martin then filed a complaint in state court against Lee, Walker, the Addis and Brusly Police Departments, and others. Martin\u2019s complaint alleged that the officers and police departments were liable for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The case was removed to federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-19\">In preparation for trial, the parties submitted a Uniform Pretrial Order (\u201cPretrial Order\u201d) to the district court. In ruling on several motions in limine regarding the exclusion of certain evidence, the district held that Martin\u2019s \u201cfalse arrest\u201d claims had been abandoned because the only claim contained in the Pretrial Order was for excessive force against Officer Lee. Ten months later, and two months before trial was set to begin, Martin filed a Motion for Leave to Amend the Pretrial Order (\u201cMotion to Amend\u201d) so that she could assert her false arrest claim. The district court denied the Motion to Amend. Martin now appeals, arguing that the district court erred by (1) ruling that her false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>arrest claim was waived and (2) denying her Motion to Amend. Martin does not appeal from the adverse jury verdict on her excessive force claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16 authorizes the district court to control and expedite discovery through pretrial orders. \u201cIt is a well-settled rule that a joint pretrial order signed by both parties supersedes all pleadings and governs the issues and evidence to be presented at trial.\u201d <em>Elvis Presley Enters., Inc. v. Capece, </em>141 F.3d 188, 206 (5th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Branch-Hines v. Hebert, </em>939 F.2d 1311, 1319 (5th Cir.1991)). Claims, issues, and evidence are narrowed by the pretrial order, thereby focusing and expediting the trial. <em>Elvis, </em>141 F.3d at 206 (claims not preserved in a joint pretrial order were waived); <em>Branch-Hines, </em>939 F.2d at 1319 (the pretrial order asserted the plaintiffs full range of damages). If a claim or issue is omitted from the final pretrial order, it may be waived, even if it appeared in the complaint. <em>Elvis, </em>141 F.3d at 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In addition, our court gives the trial court \u201cbroad discretion to preserve the integrity and purpose of the pretrial order.\u201d <em>Geiserman v. MacDonald, </em>893 F.2d 787, 790-791 (5th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Hodges v. United States, </em>597 F.2d 1014, 1018 (5th Cir.1979)). \u201cFor pretrial procedures to continue as viable mechanisms of court efficiency, appellate courts must exercise minimal interference with trial court discretion in matters such as the modification of its orders.\u201d <em>Hodges, </em>597 F.2d at 1017-1018. Thus, unless the trial court\u2019s ruling in the enforcement of a pretrial order was a clear abuse of discretion that would deem the action arbitrary, the ruling will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>Geiserman, </em>893 F.2d at 790; <em>Hodges, </em>597 F.2d at 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Appellant argues that her claim for false arrest was \u201ceminently cognizable\u201d within a two or three sentence factual narrative stating that Martin was cuffed and placed in Office Lee\u2019s patrol car, issued a summons and released, and cleared of all charges at trial. The district court disagreed and held that other than the excessive force claim, \u201cnowhere in the final pretrial order was there any mention of any other claim under any other theory of law.\u201d District courts are encouraged to construe pretrial orders narrowly without fear of reversal. <em>Flannery v. Carroll, </em>676 F.2d 126, 129-130 (5th Cir.1982) (the district court did not abuse its discretion where it narrowly construed the pretrial order to exclude certain claims, despite slight reference to those claims in the order). We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in narrowly construing this Pretrial Order as it did. Thus, the false arrest claim was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Appellant also contends that the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to amend was in error because the exhibits listed in the Pretrial Order showed her intention to bring a false arrest claim against Lee. Appellant argues that both parties\u2019 motions clearly anticipated her bringing a false arrest claim. Rule 16(e) provides that the court may modify a final pretrial order \u201conly to prevent manifest injustice.\u201d Refusal to grant an amendment to a pretrial order is with in the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Trinity Carton Co., Inc. v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>767 F.2d 184, 193 n. 13 (5th Cir.1985). \u201cEven though amendment of the pretrial order may be allowed where no surprise or prejudice to the opposing party results, where, as here, the evidence and the issue were known at the time of the original pretrial conference, amendments may generally be properly refused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That Martin delayed in seeking this relief until shortly before trial also supports the court\u2019s decision. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Martin\u2019s motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
