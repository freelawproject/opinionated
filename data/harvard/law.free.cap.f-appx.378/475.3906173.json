The BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) decision granting the respondent\u2019s motion to pretermit Salazar\u2019s request to adjust his status and determining that Salazar was ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility. The BIA found that Salazar was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255 because he was inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae as a result of his prior conviction for smuggling aliens. The BIA further determined that Salazar was statutorily ineligible for an 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) waiver because he was found inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(6) rather than \u00a7 1182(a)(2) as required for a \u00a7 1182(h) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-21\">When considering a petition for review, this court reviews the BIA\u2019s legal decisions de novo, although this court defers to reasonable interpretations of agency regulations. Hern<em>andez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 519 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-22\">Under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae, any alien who \u201cknowingly has encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the United States in violation of law is inadmissible.\u201d Thus, the IJ\u2019s finding that Salazar was an alien smuggler made him inadmissible and therefore ineligible for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255. <em>See Soriano v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 318, 321 (5th Cir.2007). Salazar argues that he is not inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae based on the BIA\u2019s unpublished decision in <em>In re Popoca, </em>No. A90 751 142, 2006 WL 729766 (BIA Feb. 9, 2006). <em>Popoca </em>is inapplicable here, and, as such, the BIA properly affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-23\">Salazar also appears to argue that he is entitled to a \u00a7 1182(h) waiver because that section violates his constitutional rights. His argument is without merit. That is, Salazar cannot and has not overcome the fact that he is statutorily ineligible for a \u00a7 1182(h) waiver because he was found inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae instead of \u00a7 1182(a)(2), regardless of any alleged constitutional infirmities in \u00a7 1182(h). Accordingly, Salazar\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
