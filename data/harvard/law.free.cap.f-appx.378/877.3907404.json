Because we conclude the district court lacked jurisdiction to reconsider the sentence imposed, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-21\">In 1999, Green was convicted of conspiracy to possess and possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-22\">In 2008, Green filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on a sentencing guideline amendment that retroactively lowered the base offense level applicable to crack offenses. On May 19, 2008, the district court granted the motion, determined the new guidelines range to be 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment, and sentenced Green to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-23\">Thereafter, on June 5, 2008, Green filed a motion for reconsideration in which he objected to the manner in which the court determined the new guidelines range and sentence. On August 26, 2009, the district court denied the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-24\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court had jurisdiction over Green\u2019s motion to reconsider. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194 n. 9 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-25\">The authority of a district court to modify an imprisonment sentence is narrowly limited by statute. Under \u00a7 3582(c), a court may not modify an imprisonment sentence except in these three circumstances: (1) where the Bureau of Prisons has filed a motion and either extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant a reduction or the defendant is at least 70 years old and meets certain other requirements; (2) where another statute or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure (\u201cRule\u201d) 35 expressly permits a sentence modification; or (3) where a defendant has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Commission and certain other re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>quirements are met. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(l)-(2); <em>Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1194-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Our recent decision in <em>Phillips </em>dictates the outcome of Green\u2019s case. Once the court modified Green\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), there was no authority for the court to further modify the sentence except as expressly provided by Rule 35. Rule 35, however, permits the court to correct a sentence only within seven days. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1195-96. And this time frame is jurisdictional. <em>Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1196\u201497.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Here, the district court granted Green\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on May 19, 2008. The court took no action to correct the sentence within seven days. In fact, Green did not file for reconsideration until June 5, 2008, and the district court did not rule on the motion until August 26, 2009. Because more than seven days elapsed, the district court lacked jurisdiction to reconsider Green\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Accordingly, we VACATE and REMAND with instructions for the district court to dismiss the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-8\">. The rules have since been amended to provide that the court may correct a sentence within fourteen days. That amendment did not become effective until December 1, 2009. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Crim. P. 35 (2009). Thus, at the time the district court considered Green's motion, the court was under the seven-day limitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AMMe\">. Although motions for reconsideration are permitted in criminal cases generally, such motions do not apply in proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1199-1200. The proper avenue for Green to challenge the manner in which the district court determined his new guidelines range was to appeal the district court's order granting his \u00a7 3582(c) motion within the time permitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
