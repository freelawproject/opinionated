The Board found that Liu failed to prove that she had a well-founded fear of future persecution. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-19\">We review the decision of the Board to determine whether it is \u201c \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 1310, 1314 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005)). \u201cTo reverse [those] fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). We review the legal conclusions of the Board <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 1287 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-20\">Substantial evidence supports the finding of the Board that Liu will not likely experience persecution upon her return to China. \u201cTo establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, an applicant must \u2018present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that [she] ... will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>singled out for <em>persecution..\" Mohammed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>547 F.3d 1340, 1345 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1287 (11th Cir.2001)). Liu has not satisfied this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">The Board was entitled to find that Liu failed to prove that she would be forcibly sterilized because she gave birth to two children in the United States. Liu testified that she did not know of anyone who had been forcibly sterilized after returning to China with children born in the United States. Although Liu submitted certificates purportedly issued by the Hu Bin Village Committee and the Ting Jiang Town Family Planning Office, which stated that residents would be sterilized upon their return, Liu does not challenge the finding of the Board that these documents were entitled to \u201climited weight\u201d because of their questionable authenticity. The record contains substantial evidence that unregistered children born to a Chinese citizen in a foreign country would not be included in the number of children allowed under family planning laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">The Board also was entitled to find that Liu also failed to prove that she would suffer economic harm that would amount to persecution. The payment of a single fine for violating family planning laws does not constitute persecution. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1203 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cNot all exceptional treatment is persecution,\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000), and there is evidence in this record that social compensation fees are adjusted according to the location and income of a family, the fees can be paid in installments, and the government cannot garnish wages to collect the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">We DENY Liu\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
