California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Scott filed a motion for termination of counsel and for an extension of time to file appellate brief. He subsequently filed a pro se brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">Scott has not shown \u201cthat there is a conflict of interest or other most pressing circumstances or that the interests of justice otherwise require relief of counsel.\u201d Fifth Circuit Plan Under the Criminal Justice Act, \u00a7 5(B); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. 3006A(c). As Scott has not unequivocally requested to proceed pro se, his motion is insufficient to justify relieving appointed counsel and allowing him to proceed pro se. <em>See Brown v. Wainwright, </em>665 F.2d 607, 610 (5th Cir.1982) (en banc). Accordingly, Scott\u2019s motion for termination of counsel is DENIED. Because Scott has now filed a pro se brief, his motion for extension of time to file appellate brief is DENIED as moot. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, we have construed Scott\u2019s pro se brief as a response to his counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion and considered the issues raised therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-17\">Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Scott\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b486-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
