We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-20\">In 2001, Rouse pleaded guilty to three counts of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Although the amount of drugs involved resulted in a base offense level of 26, the district court determined Rouse to be a career offender, which increased his offense level to 34 and resulted in a sentencing range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court sentenced Rouse to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-21\">In 2008, Rouse filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on retroactive amendments to the guidelines that lowered the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses. The court denied the motion, determining that Rouse was ineligible for a reduction because he had been sentenced as a career offender. Rouse now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-22\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156, <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>Rouse\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our precedent. A defendant sentenced as a career offender, whose guideline range was not based on the offense level for crack cocaine, is ineligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327 (holding that when a defendant was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, that defendant\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 for his crack cocaine offense did not play a role in the calculation of the guidelines range and the amendments did not lower the applicable guideline ranges). Moreover, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">We are bound by decisions of prior panels of this court unless and until the holding is overruled by the Supreme Court or by this court sitting <em>en banc. United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir.1993). Therefore, we conclude the district court properly denied Rouse\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-8\">. Rouse cites <em>United States v. Dillon </em>as support for his motion. <em>United States v. Dillon, </em>572 F.3d 146 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. </em>granted,-U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 797, -L.Ed.2d-(2009). It does not appear that the issues presented in <em>Dillon </em>are applicable here. In any event, we remain bound by the decisions of prior panels until overruled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
