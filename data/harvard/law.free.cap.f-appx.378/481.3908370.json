Carrillo-Griego argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that he should have been sentenced below the guidelines range. He contends that his Texas robbery conviction was double counted and argues that his cultural ties to this country and his motive for reentry support a sentence below the guidelines range. Carrillo-Griego cites <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and argues that this court should not accord his sentence a presumption of reasonableness because the illegal reentry guideline is not supported by empirical data.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">In reviewing a sentence, we normally \u201cconsider[ ] the \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). However, Carrillo-Griego did not object in the district court to the reasonableness of his sentence, so our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>559 F.3d 348, 358 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2814, 174 L.Ed.2d 308 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Carrillo-Griego acknowledges that his empirical data argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Carrillo-Griego raises the issue to preserve it for further review. We have also previously rejected Carrillo-Griego\u2019s argument that the double counting of a defendant\u2019s criminal history necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">Carrillo-Griego\u2019s assertions regarding his personal history and characteristics and his motive for reentering the United States are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Carrillo-Griego has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence at the top of the guidelines range was plainly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
