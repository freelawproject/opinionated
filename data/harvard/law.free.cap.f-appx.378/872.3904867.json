Stewart argues that the district court in its order of restitution allegedly delegated its authority to establish restitution payments to the Bureau of Prisons and that the Bureau collected that restitution illegally. Stewart is not entitled to relief. We vacate and remand for the district court to dismiss Stewart\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">After the district court denied Stewart\u2019s petition, we held that an inmate cannot attack collaterally an order of restitution using section 2241. <em>Arnaiz v. Warden, Fed. Satellite Low, </em>594 F.3d 1326 (11th Cir.2010). Arnaiz was convicted of conspiracy to launder money and sentenced to imprisonment and restitution in excess of 24 million dollars. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. Arnaiz later filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to challenge his order of restitution, and the district court dismissed the petition on the ground that Arnaiz failed to satisfy the \u201csavings clause\u201d of the statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, that ordinarily governs collateral attacks of federal convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28. We agreed that a dismissal was appropriate, but for another reason. <em>Id. </em>at 1328. We examined the historical purpose of habeas corpus, and we recognized that its remedy \u201cremains tied to some form of relief from the petitioner\u2019s custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1328-29; <em>see Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 484-85, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1833, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). We held that Arnaiz could not pursue habeas relief because \u201ca successful challenge to the restitution part of his sentence would, in no way, provide relief for the physical confinement supplying the custody necessary for federal habeas jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Arnaiz, </em>594 F.3d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">Based on <em>Amaiz, </em>the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Stewart\u2019s petition. Stewart could not use a petition for a writ of habeas corpus \u201cto challenge just the restitution part of a sentence when the custody supporting our jurisdiction is actual imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330. We VACATE the order that denied Stewart\u2019s petition and REMAND for the district court to dismiss Stewart\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
