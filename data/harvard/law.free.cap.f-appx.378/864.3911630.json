After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AqQ9\">A. Original Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b888-24\">In 1996, a jury convicted Bogle of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>\u00a7 841(a)(1), and use of a firearm in relation to a drug-trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). At the original sentencing, Bogle\u2019s base offense level for the crack cocaine offenses was 36 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). After a two-level increase for obstruction of justice, Bogle\u2019s total offense level was 38. With a criminal history category of II, Bogle\u2019s guidelines range was 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. For the firearm offense, Bogle\u2019s guidelines range was 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court imposed concurrent 294-month sentences on the crack cocaine offenses, at the middle of the guidelines range, and a 60-month consecutive sentence on the firearm offense, for a total sentence of 354 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">B.Section 3582(c)(2) Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">In July 2009, Bogle <em>pro se </em>filed this \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) for most crack cocaine offenses. Bogle\u2019s motion stressed that Amendment 706 lowered by two levels his base offense level for his crack cocaine offenses, resulting in a lower guidelines range. He requested resentencing based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Bogle also argued that, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the district court had discretion to impose a sentence below the amended guidelines range. Bogle pointed to: (1) the remaining disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentencing; and (2) his model behavior during fourteen years of incarceration and post-sentencing rehabilitative conduct, which included completing his GED, participating in self-improvement programs, maintaining a consistent work detail and learning a vocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">C. Probation Office Supplemental Report</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">The district court appointed Bogle counsel, requested a supplemental report from the probation office and ordered the parties to respond to the supplemental report. The probation office\u2019s supplemental report stated that Bogle was eligible for a sentence reduction and that Bogle\u2019s new guidelines range after Amendment 706 was 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. Among other things, the report noted that: (1) Bogle\u2019s original sentence was a mid-range sentence; (2) at the original sentencing, the court considered Bogle\u2019s criminal history category of II, and Bogle\u2019s \u201ccriminal convictions are outlined in paragraphs 25 through 34\u201d of the original pre-sentence investigation report; (3) Bogle was \u201ccurrently confined at Coleman Federal Correctional Institute-Low\u201d; (4) according to prison records, Bogle \u201chas completed his financial responsibility; has completed his GED; has taken a number of courses, and is currently working for Unicor\u201d; and (5) while incarcerated, Bogle \u201chas not had any disciplinary reports.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">The report also addressed \u201cRelease Planning,\u201d stating that: (1) \u201c[i]f the court reduces Mr. Bogle[\u2019s] sentence to 236 months (middle of the range) as to Counts One and Two, his sentence will be reduced by 58 months (4 years, 10 months)\u201d; (2) with the 60-month consecutive sentence for the firearm offense, Bogle would be eligible for release in September 2016; (3) although Bogle had resided in the United States for over twenty years as a legal resident alien, he might be subject to deportation; (4) it was unclear whether Bo-' gle would live with his girlfriend, who was released from prison in March 2008 and resided in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">D. Parties\u2019 Responses</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">Bogle, now represented by counsel, agreed with the report\u2019s calculation of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>amended guidelines range as 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. Bogle asked the district court to \u201cconsider the applicability of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in light of the advisory guidelines\u201d and impose a sentence below that amended guidelines range. He again pointed to: (2) the remaining crack/powder sentencing disparity; and (2) his post-sentencing rehabilitation. With respect to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Bogle \u201cadmitted] that he needed to be punished for his offense, needed to be deterred from future unlawful conduct, and that the public to some extent needed to be protected from his unlawful conduct\u201d; but that \u201cgiven the facts and circumstances of this case, a further reduction in his sentence will be more than sufficient, but not greater than necessary to accomplish all of these goals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The government agreed that Bogle was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction and that his amended guideline range was 210 to 262 months. The government noted that the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in deciding the extent of the reduction, but argued that the district court did not have the discretion to impose a sentence below the new range. The government stated that it did not oppose a reduction \u201cto a total term of 296 months\u2014 236 months on Counts One and Two, plus the 60 month consecutive term for Count Three.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">E. Amended Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The district court found that Bogle was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction and granted Bogle\u2019s motion. In recounting Bogle\u2019s original sentencing, the district court noted that Bogle\u2019s original 294-month sentence \u201cwas at the mid-range of the guidelines.\u201d The district court acknowledged Bogle\u2019s response, which asked that Bogle \u201creceive the reduction the probation office recommended plus a reasonable sentence as enumerated in the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) factors.\u201d The court also pointed out that the government did not oppose a reduction to a total sentence of 296 months, which included a 236 month sentence on the crack cocaine offenses and a 60-month consecutive sentence on the firearm offense. The district court concluded that it was not authorized to impose a sentence below the amended guidelines range and that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">The district court found that Bogle\u2019s amended offense level of 36 and criminal history category of II resulted in an amended guidelines range of 210 to 262 months as to the crack cocaine offenses. The district court further found that \u201ca reduction to 236 months is appropriate as to counts one and two since Bogle was sentenced originally at the middle of the guidelines.\u201d The district court imposed a total 296-month sentence, 236 months as to the crack cocaine offenses and 60 consecutive months as to the firearms offense. Bogle filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s imprisonment term if it is \u201cbased on a sentence range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). If a defendant is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction, the district court engages in a two-step analysis by: (1) \u201crecalculating] the defendant\u2019s guideline sentencing range based upon the relevant amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d while keeping all other guideline determinations unchanged; and (2) \u201cdeciding] whether, in its discretion, to retain the original sentence or re-sentence the defendant under the amended guideline range\u201d after considering the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), public safety consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>ations, the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 927 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">On appeal, Bogle does not dispute that the district court correctly calculated his amended guidelines range of 210 to 262 months. Instead, Bogle argues that the district court erred at the second step. Specifically, Bogle argues that the district court imposed a mid-range sentence solely because Bogle\u2019s original sentence was a mid-range sentence and failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">\u201cIn considering whether to impose an amended sentence, the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but is not required to articulate the applicability of each factor, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court. However, if it is not possible to determine from the record whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we must vacate and remand the case to the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1219 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks, citations and footnote omitted). We have noted, however, that \u201cthe only time this Court has vacated a district court\u2019s order granting a defendant\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduced sentence for a failure to properly consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors occurred when the record contained no evidence that the district court had considered, or the defendant had even raised, the applicability of any of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Here, Bogle has not carried his burden to show that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before selecting the appropriate sentence. The district court\u2019s order referred to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Although the district court did not analyze the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it was not required to do so under our precedent. Further, the district court\u2019s order referred to Bogle\u2019s response to the probation office\u2019s supplemental report, which discussed several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in making his mitigation arguments. The fact that the district court\u2019s order expressly referred to Bogle\u2019s response discussing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is evidence in the record that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors were considered by the district court. <em>See Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 928. Thus, this is not simply a case in which there is no evidence in the record that the defendant raised the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In fact, the pleadings and the arguments in the district court expressly referenced certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors that Bogle was relying on. The fact that the district court chose a sentence in the middle of the guidelines range does not show the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Bogle\u2019s argument that Booker\u2022 permitted the district court to reduce his sentence below the amended guidelines range is foreclosed by our binding precedent, <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014- U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009). Although Bogle contends <em>Melvin </em>was wrongly decided, we are bound by <em>Melvin </em>unless and until it is overruled by this Court sitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number><em>en banc </em>or by the United States Supreme Court. <em>See Douglas, </em>576 F.3d at 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"AnNi\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-15\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). If a sentence reduction is authorized, we review the district court's decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, (3) the need to promote respect for the law and afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with education, vocational training and medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
