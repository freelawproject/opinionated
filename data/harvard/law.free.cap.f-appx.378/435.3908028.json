He contends the district court: plainly erred by relying solely on the pre-sentence investigation report (PSR) to enhance his sentence by 16 levels for a prior federal conviction for a crime of violence, under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii); and erred by treating that prior conviction as a sentencing factor instead of an element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-17\">Carreon did not object in district court to the 16-level enhancement. Therefore, that issue is reviewed only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Reversible plain error exists where a clear or obvious error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>E.g., United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009); <em>see also Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Even then, we have discretion whether to correct such an error and generally will do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Baker, </em>538 F.3d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-23\">\u201c[A] district court [is] not permitted to rely on a PSR\u2019s characterization of a defendant\u2019s prior offense for enhancement purposes\u201d. <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.2005). Here, however, the Government, through an unopposed motion, has supplemented the record on appeal with evidence corroborating the information in the PSR that the district court erroneously relied on \u2014 specifically, the indictment and the judgment of conviction for Carreon\u2019s prior offense. <em>See United States v. Fernandez-Cusco, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>447 F.3d 382, 386 (5th Cir.2006) (allowing unopposed supplementation of record on appeal with, <em>inter alia, </em>charging document and judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">That judgment of conviction shows Car-reon was convicted of taking a motor vehicle by force while possessing a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119. Because these documents support the district court\u2019s applying the 16-level enhancement for the prior conviction, Carreon has not shown he would have received a lower sentence but for the district court\u2019s relying on the PSR. <em>See United States v. Ochoa-Cruz, </em>442 F.3d 865, 867 (5th Cir.2006). Therefore, Carreon has <em>not </em>shown that his substantial rights were affected and, accordingly, has <em>not </em>established reversible plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Carreon also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. <em>See generally Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Carreon acknowledges, this contention is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
