Flores alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-16\">Persons residing outside the United States are directing political candidates known to be executive employees of the federal government or unregistered lobbyists to unlawfully conduct a scientific domestic study by using advanced technology with a direct signal to the sat\u00e9lite [sic] in outer space to calculate a genetic code or procedure to cause me or my immediate relatives severe pain equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanie-ing [sic] serious physical injury such as organ failure, impairment of bodily functions or even death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-17\">\u00ed\u00a1\u00ed % \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-18\">The unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain constitutes cruel and unussual [sic] punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-22\">The district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous because it was \u201cfanciful, fantastic, delusional and therefore baseless.\u201d Flores repeats these fanciful statements in his brief to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-23\">We agree completely with the district court\u2019s characterizations of this case as frivolous and affirm its dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b497-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
