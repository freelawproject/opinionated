Ghali\u2019s challenge was based on the holding in <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008), regarding the definition of the term \u201cproceeds\u201d within the money-laundering statute. Ghali contends that his claim may be considered under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) because <em>Santos </em>is retroactive and establishes that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense and the claim was foreclosed by circuit law at the time of his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">Under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), a \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). To do so, the petitioner must show that (1) his claims are \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and (2) his claims were \u201cforeclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim[s] should have been raised in [his] trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-15\">In September 2008, Ghali filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion, challenging his conviction on the same ground he raised in his \u00a7 2241 petition. Ghali\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is currently pending in the district court. He fails to show that the claim he now raises was foreclosed by circuit law at the time he filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion and thus fails to show that his claim falls within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Ghali\u2019s motion to stay proceedings and to consolidate the appeal with the pending district court case is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
