Matthews filed two petitions in the district court in the Northern District of Texas under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, challenging his life-term of supervised release and certain conditions of supervised release. The district court dismissed the petitions for lack of jurisdiction. Matthews moves this court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. He challenges the district court\u2019s denial of IFP status and certification that his appeals would not be taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. </em>Taylor, 117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). Matthews\u2019s motion for a default judgment is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">A movant for leave to proceed IFP on appeal must show that he is a pauper and that the appeal presents a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). A district court may, by providing written reasons certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith, deny a motion for leave to appeal IFP. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). The appellant may challenge the district court\u2019s certification decision by filing an IFP motion in this court. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">To the extent that Matthews argues that the district court should not have dismissed his petitions sua sponte, federal courts have the obligation to examine sua sponte the basis of their jurisdiction. <em>United States v. De Los Reyes, </em>842 F.2d 755, 757 (5th Cir.1988). To the extent that Matthews suggests that his petitions should have been construed as motions to modify his conditions of release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2), a district court lacks jurisdiction under \u00a7 3583(e)(2) to modify conditions of supervised release on grounds of illegality. <em>United States v. Hatten, </em>167 F.3d 884, 886 (5th Cir.1999) (order of restitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">As the district court observed, Matthews\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petitions challenged the supervised release component of his federal sentence. A \u00a7 2241 petition that \u201cattacks errors that occur at trial or sentencing is properly construed under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 381-82 (5th Cir.2003). Matthews must meet the requirements of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) to raise his claims under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000); \u00a7 2255(e). Matthews bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201cthe remedy by motion [under \u00a7 2255] is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see also Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 452. Relief under \u00a7 2255 is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d for purposes of the savings clause merely because the prisoner has filed a prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion or is unable to meet the requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>for filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Tolliver, </em>211 F.3d at 878. As Matthews has not met the requirements of the savings clause, the district court did not err in concluding that Matthews could not bring his claims under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u201cA section 2241 petition that seeks to challenge the validity of a federal sentence must either be dismissed or construed as a section 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 452. The district court correctly noted that jurisdiction over a \u00a7 2255 motion lies in the district where the movant\u2019s sentence was imposed. <em>See id. </em>at 451 (\u201cA section 2255 motion must be filed in the sentencing court.\u201d); see also <em>Ojo v. INS, </em>106 F.3d 680, 683 (5th Cir.1997). Matthews was sentenced in the Southern District of Florida. Therefore, the district court lacked jurisdiction to construe Matthews\u2019s petitions as arising under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Ojo, </em>106 F.3d at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Matthews has not shown that his appeals present a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is denied, and his appeals are dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">MOTION TO PROCEED IFP DENIED; MOTION FOR A DEFAULT JUDGMENT DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
