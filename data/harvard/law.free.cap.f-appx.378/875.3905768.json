On appeal, Magana argues that the district court erred by sentencing him to the substantively unreasonable sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment for count two because (1) his applicable guideline range was 84 months\u2019 imprisonment; and (2) the district court during his original sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>ing hearing had stated that a within guideline range sentence was reasonable. Specifically, Magana argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) requires an 84-month sentence because this sentence would be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comport with the goals of sentencing. Magana requests that we reverse his sentence and remand to the district court for resentenc-ing.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">We review a final sentence for reasonableness according to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). If we conclude that the district court made no procedural errors, \u201c[we] should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). There is a \u201crange of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009). \u201c[W]e may not apply a presumption of unreasonableness where a sentence is outside of the Guidelines range, and we must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). In holding a particular sentence to be reasonable, we have noted it was appreciably below the statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006). The weight accorded to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is left to the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Under \u00a7 3553(a), the district court must impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the purposes set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">A violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), carries a mandatory minimum seven-year sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). \u201c[T]he guideline sentence [for 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) ] is the minimum term of imprisonment required by the statute.\u201d U.S.S.G \u00a7 2K2.4(b). \u201cEvery conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) carries with it a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment, regardless of what subsection the defendant is sentenced under.\u201d <em>United States v. Pounds, </em>230 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Magana cannot show that his upward variance 120-month sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court considered the applicable factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and imposed a sentence that was supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Specifically, the district court cited the violence of Magana\u2019s charged offenses, that Magana was traveling in a stolen car the day of the offense, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>injury to the victim in one of the charged offenses. Additionally, the court stated that Magana displayed a disrespect for the law, as evidenced by his previous convictions for battery and robbery. Further, the court stated that a sentence of 120 months would protect the public and was in accordance with the sentence given to Magana\u2019s co-defendant. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
