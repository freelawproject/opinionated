Taylor, Texas prisoner # 938697, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action, which challenged a prison disciplinary proceeding in which he lost good-time credits, for failure to state a claim. Taylor argues that the district court erred by holding that his claims are barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). He contends that <em>Heck </em>does not bar challenges to prison disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-14\">We review the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). Under <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, when a state prisoner whose conviction or sentence has not been declared invalid seeks damages in a \u00a7 1983 suit and a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence, the suit must be dismissed. For purposes of <em>Heck, </em>the term \u201cconviction\u201d includes prison disciplinary decisions that result in the loss of good-time credits. <em>Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-17\">Here, Taylor asserted that his constitutional rights had been violated because the disciplinary rule that he was found guilty of violating was unconstitutionally vague and there was no evidence to support the charge. He sought monetary damages and to have the allegedly false disciplinary report expunged from his record. If Taylor\u2019s claims are credited, they necessarily imply that the finding of guilt and the punishment for the violation were invalid. Because he has not shown that the disciplinary decision has been overturned, he cannot maintain a \u00a7 1983 action for damages or the expungement of the disciplinary report from his record. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>Clarke, </em>154 F.3d at 189. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Taylor\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-18\">Taylor\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of Taylor\u2019s complaint. See <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Taylor is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>cautioned that, if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b494-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
