He contends that the district court erred by applying a four-level investment adviser enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(16)(A)(iii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s application of the [sentencing] guidelines to the facts <em>de novo </em>and all factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Faris, </em>583 F.3d 756, 759 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). The sentencing guidelines provide a four-level enhancement if the offense involved \u201ca violation of securities law, and at the time of the offense, the defendant was ... (iii) an investment adviser....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(16)(A)(iii). Ogale contends that the district court erred by applying that enhancement to him. He concedes that his offense violated securities law but argues that he was not an \u201cinvestment adviser.\u201d For purposes of the investment adviser enhancement, the term \u201cinvestment adviser\u201d carries the same meaning as in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 comment, (n. 14(A)). The Investment Advisers Act defines an \u201cinvestment adviser\u201d as \u201cany person who, for compensation, engages in the business of advising others, either directly or through publications or writings, as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities.... \u201d <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-2(a)(ll). Ogale argues that he was not \u201cin the business of advising others\u201d \u201cfor compensation\u201d and thus did not qualify as an investment adviser under the sentencing guidelines. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Ogale contends that he was not \u201cin the business of advising others\u201d because he did not have clients who came to him for investment advice. He argues that he merely sold shares of stock in his hedge fund, Den Haag Capital, LLC, to investors. We find Ogale\u2019s argument to be unpersuasive. According to his presentence investigation report, Ogale told investors that their investment would be used to trade foreign currency futures and options based on an algorithm that he had developed. The exercise of control over what purchases and sales are made with investors\u2019 funds is considered to be investment advice for purposes of the Investment Adviser\u2019s Act and hence the investment adviser enhancement. <em>See United States v. Elliott, </em>62 F.3d 1304, 1310 (11th Cir.1996) (concluding that defendants provided investment advice by controlling which investment vehicles their customers invested in); <em>Abrahamson v. Fleschner, </em>568 F.2d 862, 871 (2d Cir.1977) (stating that \u201cmany investment advisers \u2018advise\u2019 their customers by exercising control over what purchases and sales are made with their clients\u2019 funds\u201d). Although Ogale never actually used investors\u2019 money to trade foreign currencies, his scheme involved \u201cadvising others.\u201d Because he regularly advised others about trading in foreign currency, he was \u201cin the business\u201d of providing investment advice. <em>See Elliott, </em>62 F.3d at 1310 (\u201cA person [is] \u2018in the business\u2019 of providing advice if the person ... on anything other than rare, isolated and nonperiodic instances, provides specific investment advice\u201d) (quoting SEC Release notes for 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-2(a)(ll)).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">Ogale also contends that he was not compensated for providing investment advice. He argues that the only money he received was investors\u2019 misappropriated funds. He asserts that ill-gotten gains are not compensation. We disagree. The re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>ceipt of any economic benefit qualifies as compensation under the Investment Adviser\u2019s Act and thus the investment adviser enhancement. <em>See id. </em>at 1311 (\u201cTh[e] compensation element is satisfied by the receipt of any economic benefit, whether in the form of an advisory fee or some other fee relating to the total services rendered, commissions, or some combination of the foregoing.\u201d) (quoting SEC Release notes for 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b \u2014 2(a)(ll)); <em>see also id. </em>(concluding that defendant received compensation for providing investment advice where defendant commingled investors funds with personal funds). Ogale compensated himself by using investors\u2019 money to pay his personal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Because Ogale qualified as an investment adviser, the district court did not err by applying the four-level investment adviser enhancement. Accordingly, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-8\">. In the 2009 Sentencing Guidelines Manual, the investor adviser enhancement is located in \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(17).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
