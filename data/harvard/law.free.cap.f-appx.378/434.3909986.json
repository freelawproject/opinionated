This court affirmed on direct appeal. <em>United States v. McBrown, </em>No. 96-11491, 1998 WL 413981 (5th Cir. June 22, 1998) (unpublished). Reed has been unsuccessful in seeking relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Reed also filed an unsuccessful motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) due to the crack cocaine amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">Reed filed a motion requesting that he be granted a new sentencing proceeding by writ of error coram nobis. Reed contends that the enhancement information filed by the Government was defective and that the district court thus lacked jurisdiction to impose an enhanced sentence of life imprisonment. The district court found that relief pursuant to a writ of coram nobis was not available because Reed was in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-16\">It is undisputed that Reed was in custody when he sought coram nobis relief and is still in custody. The district court did not err in finding that the writ of coram nobis is not an avenue of relief available to him. <em>See United States v. Dyer, </em>136 F.3d 417, 422 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under dle limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
