Potter, the Postmaster General of the United States Postal Service, and against Roberts\u2019s complaints of retaliation and harassment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-3(a), -16. Liberally construed, Roberts\u2019s brief presents three arguments, and each fails. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-16\">Roberts argues that the district court failed to address the emergency suspension she received in June 2004, but Roberts failed to mention the emergency suspension in her original complaint filed in July 2004 and failed to amend her complaint to include a claim about the suspension, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(1), (2). In May 2008, Roberts filed a proposed discovery order in which she mentioned the suspension under a section titled \u201cOther Amended Complainants,\u201d but Roberts did not sign the order, which might have alerted the district court that she desired to amend her complaint, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(a). Roberts also failed to mention the suspension in her response to the motion for summary judgment filed by the Postmaster. The district court did not err by failing to address Roberts\u2019s suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-17\">Roberts also argues that she presented evidence of a hostile work environment, but we disagree. Roberts failed to prove that she was subject to a \u201c \u2018discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., </em>594 F.3d 798, 808 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 1238, 1245 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc)). Roberts alleged that her supervisor, Charnae Mitchell, reprimanded Roberts and required Roberts to perform tasks not required of other employees, but Roberts\u2019s own accounts establish that Mitchell\u2019s actions were intended to curb Roberts\u2019s allegedly excessive talking in the workplace. Furthermore, Roberts offered no evidence of discriminatory animus and conceded in her opposition to summary judgment that Mitchell \u201chad a personal problem\u201d with Roberts. \u201cTitle VII prohibits discrimination\u201d based on race and sex, but does not serve as a \u201cshield against harsh treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>ment\u201d that is based on \u201c[p]ersonal animosity.\u201d <em>McCollum v. Bolger, </em>794 F.2d 602, 610 (11th Cir.1986). The district court did not err when it entered summary judgment against Roberts\u2019s complaint of a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Roberts also argues that she presented evidence of retaliation, but again we disagree. Although Roberts submitted evidence that she had previously filed complaints about harassment and discrimination by her supervisors, Roberts failed to prove that she \u201csuffered a materially adverse action\u201d in response to her protected activity. <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001). Roberts argued that a supervisor delayed processing her request to return to work for four days, but Roberts attributed the delay to the negligence of a secretary. In the absence of any evidence that the brief delay was retaliatory, the district court did not err when it granted summary judgment in favor of the Postmaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">The summary judgment in favor of the Postmaster is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
