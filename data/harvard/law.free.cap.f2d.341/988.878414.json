Defendant relied upon Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15b establishing a four-year period of limitation after \u201cthe cause of action accrued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-23\">After extensive pretrial discovery, the District Judge who heard this matter on motion for summary judgment found from the record that the cause of action accrued on or before March 1, 1955, and that suit was started April 26, 1960, and amended June 3, 1963; both dates being well beyond the four-year limitation mandated by Sec. 15b. He granted summary judgment for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-24\">We find no facts pled by plaintiff which serve to avoid the policy limitation imposed by Sec. 15b.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-25\">In all material respects this case is a companion case to Garelick v. Goerlich\u2019s, Inc., 323 F.2d 854 (C.A.6, 1963), and, as the District Judge held,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is controlled by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1044-16\">.
