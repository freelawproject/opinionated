Photo-Plastics has not filed a brief or appeared by counsel, submitting only on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-25\">Polaroid markets the Polaroid Land camera and film, which produces a finished photographic print shortly after exposure of the negative. Each roll of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>film includes an applicator described as a \u201cprint coater\u201d used to coat the print after removal from the camera, the purpose being to remove residue and provide a protective layer against exposure to the atmosphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">A specimen submitted with the application, showing the use of applicant\u2019s alleged trademark, includes, under the term \u201cPrint-Toter,\u201d the expression \u201cFor Use With Polaroid Type 30 Series Land Film.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Applicant\u2019s device is described by the board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-6\">\u201cIt appears from an exhibit introduced by opposer that applicant\u2019s product is a small rectangular compartmental box-like apparatus which can be held in the hand. The topside thereof is perforated and has guide rails thereon. There is attached thereto a device to hold op-poser\u2019s print coating product, and on one end of the box-like contraption there is a hinged door leading to three compartments. <em>,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-7\">\u201cThe purchaser of applicant\u2019s device is instructed to hold the device with hinged doors toward him, to insert the print by holding the tab, to slide the print towards him under the guide rails, to then coat the print in accordance with instructions given by Polaroid Corp., to open the hinged door and guide print, with coated side up, into the top drying compartment, to repeat the process with the next coated print using the second drying compartment, and to place the prints when fully dried in the lower storage compartment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">One ground of opposition is that \u201cPRINT-TOTER\u201d is descriptive of a device which \u201ctotes\u201d or carries prints. The board observed that a \u201ctoter\u201d is \u201cone that carries,\u201d but concluded that \u201cPRINT-TOTER\u201d is not descriptive of applicant\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">In its brief here, Polaroid states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOB\">\u201cWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary (Second Edition) defines \u2018tote\u2019 as meaning \u2018to carry\u2019 and \u2018toter\u2019 as \u2018one who or that which totes\u2019. A tote-box is a box for storing, handling and transporting materials and Appellee\u2019s Print-Toter is a box for handling, storing and carrying photographic prints.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">We agree with that reasoning, and note also that the same dictionary defines \u201ccarry\u201d as \u201cto support; to sustain,\u201d terms which appear to be particularly applicable to applicant\u2019s device as described by the board. Accordingly, we think that \u201cPRINT-TOTER\u201d is \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d of the goods within the meaning of Section 2(e) of the Lanham Act, and that the board erred in dismissing the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-15\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-16\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b992-26\">.
