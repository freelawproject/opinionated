The requested charge would not, therefore, be required in this case even if the Supreme Court in Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150, had not held that such a charge-is not required even in what is recognized as strictly a circumstantial evidence case.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-17\">We next deal with the second ground of the appeal. During the trial the two appellants attempted to escape-from the United States Marshal. This-fact was made known to the jury. Appellants do not deny that this evidence was relevant on the issue of guilt. Under-time record, as prepared by the court reporter, the court stated: \u201cIt is made-known to you now that one of them did. escape, and you should consider it\u201d. Attack is made upon the word \u201cshould\u201d. We conclude that in connection with the-court\u2019s general charge, it was not error-for the court to state that the jury should' consider this evidence as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-20\">Finally, the evidence that one of' the appellants had been seen two months. prior to the bank robbery in the detective\u2019s office in West Palm Beach was-relevant to the officer\u2019s identification of' the appellant. Although appellants\u2019 trial counsel moved for a mistrial upon receipt. of this evidence, no motion was made that the court restrict the evidence to the purpose of identification or in any other-manner. It was shown that the appellant. was not charged with any offense in connection with the West Palm Beach incident, and we conclude that whatever prejudice resulted from the testimony must be condoned because the testimony' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>was an exception to the usual rule that evidence of prior improper acts is to be excluded from the jury\u2019s consideration. See Andrews v. United States, (5th Cir.) 309 F.2d 129, and Azcona v. United States, (5th Cir.) 257 F.2d 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The court wishes to express its appreciation to appointed counsel for their assistance in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
