United States, 360 U.S. 930, 79 S.Ct. 1447, 3 L.Ed.2d 543 (1959); Del Bono v. United States, 360 U.S. 938, 79 S.Ct. 1463, 3 L.Ed.2d 1550 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">(4) Marchese and then Del Bono filed motions to annul, vacate and set aside their judgments of conviction under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (Marchese, Clk\u2019s Tr. p. 98; Del Bono, Clk\u2019s Tr. p. 24). Both were denied on December 22, 1960 by the Honorable Thurmond Clarke, the same judge who had tried the appellees earlier. No appeal was taken by either appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">(5) On February 3, 1961, each filed motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s order denying the \u00a7 2255 motions. On March 14 and 15, 1961, each was again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">(6) On June 20, 1961, M\u00e1rchese filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. This was denied by another district court judge, the Honorable Peirson M. Hall. M\u00e1rchese appealed, and this court affirmed that denial. (304 F.2d 154 (1962).)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-16\">(7) M\u00e1rchese then filed a petition in the United States Supreme Court for a writ of <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-17\">(8) Del Bono had meanwhile filed a new motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was denied by Judge Thurmond Clarke on December 27, 1961. No appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-18\">(9) The United States Supreme Court granted Marchese\u2019s petition for <em>certi-orari, </em>and remanded the case to the district court for \u201creconsideration in the light of Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1 [83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-19\"><em>II </em>\u2014 \u201cSanders <em>v. United States.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-20\">We thus are required first to consider what the Supreme Court meant when it \u201cremanded for reconsideration, in light of Sanders v. United States,\u201d supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-21\">Sandei's, when charged with robbing a federally insured bank, declined assistance of counsel, signed a waiver of indictment, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to imprisonment. When he subsequently filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, he charged the indictment was invalid, that he had been denied assistance of counsel, and that he had been coerced into his plea of guilty. This motion <em>was denied without a hearing, </em>upon the ground the allegations were conclusionary (i. e., lacked facts upon which conclusions could be based) \u2014 although the court added that the files and records showed conclusively that petitioner was entitled to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-22\">Sanders later filed a second \u00a7 2255 motion, alleging that at the time of his trial and sentence he had been mentally incompetent as a result of narcotics administered to him while in jail, and alleging specific fact in support of his claim. This second motion was denied without a hearing on the ground that his alleged mental incompetency could have, and should have been raised, at the time of his first motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-23\">On appeal from the district court\u2019s ruling on Sanders\u2019 second 2255 motion, this court affirmed in a <em>per curiam </em>decision. Sanders v. United States, 297 F.2d 735 (1961). We noted that \u00a7 2255 provides that a second or successive motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>for similar relief need not be entertained; that Sanders asked for \u201csimilar relief\u201d (to set aside and vacate the sentence) and that \u00a7 2255 allowed the trial judge to exercise a reasonable discretion in determining whether Sanders in his first motion could and should not have specified his alleged mental incompetency from use of drugs at the time of his sentence. The Supreme Court noted our reasons for so ruling by quoting from our opinion (373 U.S. 6, 83 S.Ct. 1068). It then reversed this court, holding that the second motion should have been heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">As we read the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, our affirmance of the denial was erroneous because, both at common law and by the very nature of the writ of habeas corpus, res adjudicata is inapplicable to such writs, provided no abusive use of the writ can be demonstrated. Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948); Wong Doo v. United States, 265 U.S. 239, 44 S.Ct. 524, 68 L.Ed. 999 (1924). The Supreme Court held that the language \u201csimilar relief\u201d used in \u00a7 2255 \u201ccannot be taken literally\u201d (373 U.S. 13, 83 S.Ct. 1068), but must be read as the material equivalent of \u00a7 2244. This section provides that a judge need not consider a petition for habeas corpus \u201cif it appears that the legality of such detention has been determined * * * on a prior application * -x- * ancj petition presents no new ground not theretofore presented and determined, and the judge or court is satisfied that the ends of justice will not be served by such inquiry.\u201d Thus alleging a previously unraised ground for such a writ ordinarily entitles a petitioner to a hearing on such new allegations. Mr. Justice Brennan, in the second part of his opinion in Sanders, lays down certain rules to govern the hearing of \u00a7 2255 applications :</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">(a) Where the second or successive application is shown, on the application, files and records of the case alone, to be conclusively without' merit, <em>the application should be denied without a hearing.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-8\">\u201cControlling weight may be given to denial of a prior application for federal habeas corpus or \u00a7 2255 relief [note] only if (1) <em>the same ground </em>presented in the subsequent application was determined adversely to the applicant on the prior application, (2) the prior determination was on the merits, and (3) the ends of justice would not be served by reaching the merits of the subsequent application.\u201d (373 U.S. at 15, 83 S.Ct. at 1077.) (Emphasis added by this court.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">(b) The court then defines and gives helpful examples of the meaning of the terms \u201cground,\u201d \u201cadjudication on the merits,\u201d and \u201cthe ends of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">(c) It also points out that if a <em>different </em>ground is raised, \u201c[n]o matter how many prior applications for federal collateral relief a prisoner has made,\u201d it cannot be considered \u201cthe same ground,\u201d as used in (a) above, but that \u201cif a prisoner deliberately withholds [for example] one of two grounds for federal collateral relief,\u201d or abandons his ground, equitable principles require a finding that there exists an abuse of the remedy. Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391 at 438-40, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837, and Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293 at 317, 83 S.Ct. 745, at 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (second case).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-15\">(d) And as a final caution, the Court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-16\">\u201cThe principles governing both justifications for denial of a hearing on a successive application are addressed to the sound discretion of the federal trial judges. Theirs is the major responsibility for the just and sound administration of the federal collateral remedies, and theirs must be the judgment as to whether a second or successive application shall be denied without consideration of the merits. Even as to such an application, the federal judge clearly has the power \u2014 and, if the ends of justice demand, the duty \u2014 to reach the merits.\u201d (373 U.S. at 18-19, 83 S.Ct. at 1079.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIu\">Finally, the Court in Sanders ordered the remand, and a hearing of the motion (p. 20, 83 S.Ct. 1068).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>There obviously exists a considerable difference of opinion between counsel for the parties before us as to what the Supreme Court did or did not hold with respect to this petitioner\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Appellee Marchese\u2019s counsel, in seeking favorable action before Judge Clarke, asserted \u201cthat the Supreme Court would not have granted <em>certiorari </em>if it had not agreed with at least some, if not all, of the grounds raised in the petition for the writ of habeas corpus.\u201d (Marchese v. United States, Clk\u2019s Tr. p. 82.) In appellee Marchese\u2019s brief before us (with new counsel appearing for him), we are urged to believe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-5\">\u201cThe Supreme Court * * * granted certiorari * * * [and] we submit that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision effectively, completely and finally disposes of appellant\u2019s contentions herein.\u201d (M\u00e1rchese, Reply Br. p. 8.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">On the other hand, the appellant United States states in its opening brief (p. 4, n. 6), with respect to the granting of <em>certiorari:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-9\">\u201cThere was nothing in this decision which ordered the district court to grant a hearing to M\u00e1rchese, or which suggested that the Supreme Court felt there was any merit to the petition * * *. In Sanders * * * the court * * * exempted its decision from those cases * * * \u2018where the second or successive application is shown * * * conclusively to be without merit. In such a case * * * the application should be denied without a hearing.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">We cannot completely agree with either position, whether we consider a district court\u2019s examination of the \u201capplication, files and records of the case <em>\u2018only\u2019 </em>a hearing,\u201d or not a hearing, the Supreme Court remanded the case with a purpose in mind, and we read that purpose as telling this court that there must be a determination by the district court 'of the charges made by petitioner Mar-ahese. We doubt, however, if the Supreme Court intended to pass on, or to infer that it intended to pass on, the <em>merits </em>of Marchese\u2019s charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-16\">Both sides ask for too much. We conclude the Supreme Court ordered that the appellees herein were entitled to the same kind of <em>hearing </em>that Sanders was entitled to: at the minimum, a hearing to determine if there had to be a hearing. We do not understand that it passed on the merits of appellees\u2019 positions in any way. Cf.: Habeas Corpus and Post Conviction Review, 33 F.R.D. 363, 478-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-17\"><em>Ill </em>\u2014 The <em>Trial Court\u2019s Ruling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-18\">We next consider the action taken by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-19\">On September 30, 1963, Judge Clarke ordered the appellee Marchese\u2019s ten-year sentence to be \u201cmodified, reduced and corrected to five years,\u201d and that M\u00e1rchese be \u201cimmediately released from custody.\u201d This judgment and the findings of fact and conclusions of law in support thereof appear in the record (Marchese, Clk\u2019s Tr. pp. 172-82). It is from that judgment that this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-20\">On November 12, 1963, Del Bono filed a petition to annul, vacate and set aside and/or modify the judgment of conviction; and on December 18, 1963, Judge Clarke signed a judgment and findings and conclusions ordering relief to Del Bono identical to that granted Marchese. That judgment is likewise the subject of this appeal (Del Bono, Clk\u2019s Tr. pp. 34-43).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-21\"><em>TV </em>\u2014 Jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-22\">Thus, jurisdiction below rests upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241, 2243 and 2255. Jurisdiction here exists by reason of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1294, 2253 and 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-23\">Marchese\u2019s petition was labeled a \u201cPetition for Writ of Habeas Corpus\u201d (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243). Del Bono\u2019s sought relief under <em>both </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2243 and 2255. The last paragraph of \u00a7 2255, in the opinion of petitioner\u2019s counsel (R.T. p. 4, 11. 20-21; p. 9, 11. 5, 6), and of the trial court (M\u00e1rchese, R.T. pp. 52, 77, 78, 80 81, 93, 122, 125; Del Bono, Clk\u2019s Tr. p. 32) and of this court, requires the mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>tion to be considered as one under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">We consider both petitions and the joint appeal as one proceeding, in what we hereafter state.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The petitions acted upon by the trial court were not the same. M\u00e1rchese charged:</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">(1) The judgment of conviction by use of \u201csilver platter\u201d evidence is in violation of the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">(2) Petitioner was denied a fair trial because one Donald Sussman conspired and agreed with federal and state authorities to ensnare the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">(3) The United States Attorney suppressed the truth and failed to disclose the truth concerning this agreement and conspiracy between Sussman and federal and state authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">(4) The use of evidence obtained by the electric recording device known as the Schmidt Transmitter was unlawful and violative of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">(5) The arrest of petitioner without a warrant, the search of his person and apartment, and of the Del Bono automobile all violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">(6) The evidence obtained by the interception of an authorized telephone conversation violated the Federal Communications Act, Section 605, Title 47 U.S.C. and the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"A_j\">Del Bono urged only grounds (3) and (4) above.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-17\"><em>V- </em>\u2014 The <em>Errors Alleged.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-18\">Seven specifications of error are alleged in appellant\u2019s brief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-19\">They may be and are summarized by appellant (Br. p. 24) as follows;</p>\n<p id=\"b843-20\">(1) The court granted a form of relief which it had no authority to grant,, in a case which presented no basis for collateral relief whatsoever; (2) appel-lees did not sustain their burden of proof required to obtain the limited relief which 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 authorizes. We now proceed to examine these alleged grounds of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-21\">When we refer herein to \u201cT.\u201d or \u201cTr.\u201d, we refer to the Clerk\u2019s or Reporter\u2019s transcript on this appeal (Marchese, No. 19172 or Del Bono, No. 19249) ; when we refer to <em>\u201cTrial </em>T.\u201d or <em>\u201cOrig. </em>Tr.\u201d, we refer to the Clerk\u2019s and Reporter\u2019s transcript on the original appeal, No. 16151.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-22\"><em>VI </em>\u2014 Jurisdiction <em>to Grant Relief Ordered.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-23\">We conclude that the district court order exceeded that court\u2019s authority and jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in two respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-24\">A. Section 2255 authorizes the district court to do any one of four things: (1) \u201cvacate and set the judgment aside and * * * discharge the prisoner,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>\u25a0or (2) \u201cresentence him,\u201d or (3) \u201cgrant <em>&amp; </em>new trial,\u201d or (4) \u201ccorrect the sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"> None of the first three courses of action was adopted. It could be maintained that the district court acted under the fourth alternative by correcting appellees\u2019 several sentences. But there was no showing that the original sentence was faulty; therefore, no \u201ccorrection\u201d of the <em>sentence </em>was authorized, absent an illegal <em>conviction. </em>The sentence was ^modified\u201d or \u201creduced\u201d \u2014 and this was done because of alleged trial errors uncovered by the district court. If the court\u2019s position is sound that error in fact occurred, of a kind that would justify granting of a \u00a7 2255 motion, appellees\u2019 sentences should have been entirely vacated and set aside, and the prisoners discharged from the service of any time based on the illegal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">If the court vacates and sets aside the judgment of conviction, then, of course, the prisoner must be discharged, or granted a new trial. If the sentence, as distinguished from the conviction, is illegal, then it may be corrected. But a judge cannot, without vacating the conviction because of a legal defect found therein, change or modify, after Rule 35\u2019s sixty day period has expired, a sentence that is itself proper, legal and lawful as a sentence. Richards v. United States, 94 U.S.App. D.C. 85, 212 F.2d 453, 454 (1954), cert. denied 358 U.S. 886, 79 S.Ct. 126, 3 L.Ed. 2d 114; Affronti v. United States, 145 F.2d 3 (8th Cir. 1944).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">To reduce a sentence under Rule 35 requires action within a sixty day statutory period. This sixty day period had long expired in each of these cases. Further, no attempt was here made to \u2022obtain relief under Rule 35. Rule 36 applies to clerical errors only. This cannot aid appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">What the trial court here sought to accomplish was apparently to exercise the equivalent of executive clemency. This he was not authorized or entitled to do. Egan v. United States, 268 F.2d 820 (8th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\"> Could it be argued that appellees could petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking only a reduction of sentence without attacking their conviction or the illegality of their sentence? We think not. Section 2255 \u201cwas not meant to broaden the scope of attack upon a judgment and sentence permissible under habeas corpus but rather to confine the relief * * * to the court where sentence was imposed.\u201d Crow v. United States, 186 F.2d 704, 706 (9th Cir. 1950). And see: United States v. Murray, 275 U.S. 347, 48 S.Ct. 146, 72 L.Ed. 309 (1928); Richards v. United States, supra.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-13\">\u201cIt should be observed that the Government\u2019s brief suggests that \u2018while the Court had authority * * * to set aside Appellant\u2019s sentence of January 4, 1960, and resentence Appellant, the Court had no authority or power to amend Appellant\u2019s sentence.\u2019 Manifestly in 1962, when the District Court amended Jenkins\u2019 1960 sentence, the time period, providing for the reduction of a sentence through the exercise of discretion, had passed. [Fed.R.Crim.Proc. 35]. And the statute pertaining to remedies on motions attacking sentence [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255] does not provide for an amendment of sentence. Rather, it restates and simplifies the ancient writ of error coram nobis so that an erroneous sentence may be vacated or set aside without resort to habeas corpus.\u201d Jenkins v. United States, 325 F.2d 942, 945-46 (3d Cir. 1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">B. The district court likewise exceeded its authority and jurisdiction in finding \u201cthat by reason of his [defendant and petitioner] good conduct in custody he has earned such good time as would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>render his immediate release appropriate.\u201d (M\u00e1rchese, Tr. p. 182.)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The federal prison system is operated in all its aspects by the Attorney General, part of the executive branch of the government, and not by the judiciary. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4001. Tabor v. Hard-wick, 224 F.2d 526 (5th Cir. 1955); Powell v. Hunter, 172 F.2d 330 (10th Cir. 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">\u201cGood time\u201d is a matter for prison authorities, not the courts, except in those extreme cases where the Bureau of Prisons or the Attorney General acts arbitrarily or fraudulently or abuses its authority. Any such finding must be supported by substantial evidence (Lloyd v. Heritage, 199 F.Supp. 46 (N.D.Ga. 1961)), and none was offered or suggested herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The court is without jurisdiction to entertain a \u201cmotion of this sort\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, for that'section \u25a0\u201cmerely provides a remedy in the nature of writ of error coram nobis for attacking the judgment and sentence under which a prisoner is incarcerated.\u201d Costner v. United States, 180 F.2d 892 (4th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">We thus hold in two respects the relief granted was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\"><em>VII </em>\u2014 The <em>Limits to Relief That May Be Granted in </em>\u00a7 <em>2255 Proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Section 2255 cannot take the place of an original appeal. More properly stated, \u00a7 2255 may not be invoked to relitigate questions which were or should have been raised on a direct appeal from the judgment of conviction. Dodd v. United States, 321 F.2d 240 (9th Cir. 1963); Black v. United States, 269 F.2d 38 (9th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">Here there was no opinion by this court from which we can authoritatively determine what was or was not raised on the appeal from the judgment of conviction (or what should have been raised). However, an examination of the appellant\u2019s brief, filed with this court by experienced defense counsel on the original appeal (No. 16151) indicates two points were originally raised \u2014 (1) the use of \u201cintercepted\u201d evidence forbidden by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605 (Communication Act of 1934); and (2) the insufficiency of the evidence to support the jury verdict, with particular reference to the testimony of Sussman, and the fact that he was a user of narcotics, a paid informer, and had received lenient treatment (two years) when sentenced by Judge Byrne. No. 16151, Op.Br. p. 15, 11. 1-4.) Appel-lee\u2019s brief (for the government) in that earlier appeal states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-13\">\u201cThe major point of appellants\u2019 is that the case is founded upon the testimony of the informant Suss-man, and that as such, he is unreliable. This argument was made to the jury, and rejected by it.\u201d (Br., p. 12)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">Appellants in the earlier appeal then applied for leave to file an additional and supplemental brief, which was allowed by this court. By it, appellants urged as a defense (3) entrapment and (4) the Fifth Amendment \u201cdue process\u201d argument with respect to the concealed radio transmitter, alleging it to have constituted a trespass. (Dissenting opinions \u2014 On Lee v. United States, 344 U.S. 747, 72 S.Ct. 967, 96 L.Ed. 1270 (1952).)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">Thus it might well be argued that ap-pellees are now precluded from again raising under a \u00a7 2255 application all the alleged errors herein specified, because each has been heretofore raised on the appeal in chief, determined adversely to appellees by this court (264 F.2d 892), and denied review by the Supreme Court (360 U.S. 930, 938, 79 S.Ct. 1463, 3 L. Ed.2d 1550).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-17\">On the possibility, however, that the alleged suppression of evidence by the United States Attorney raises an issue <em>not </em>heretofore considered by any appellate court, we consider it necessary to examine that charge. We cannot be certain that the \u201csuppression of evidence\u201d charge was that relied upon by the trial court. We can only assume it may have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-18\">We have read the transcript of the proceedings below on the hearing of appel-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>lees\u2019 motions. Government counsel at the hearing repeatedly asked the court to delineate on which of the six grounds urged the petition for relief was to be granted. This the court repeatedly declined to do.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-4\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t feel that that is necessary. I am modifying the judgment. I feel that is all the court is required to do after the order came down from the Supreme Court.\u201d (M\u00e1rchese, Tr. p. 129.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Despite the court\u2019s reluctance to delineate the specific grounds from his grant of relief, we feel the record clearly indicates that the principal and only real issue presented by the evidence related to whether the Assistant United States Attorney suppressed evidence, or knowingly permitted the witness Sussman to lie on the stand. Appellees relied upon evidence of favors granted to Suss-man as the substance of their allegations of impropriety and this was the issue which appellant government thought it was required to meet. (Marchese, Tr. p. 95.) The hearing proceeded on this assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">We are fortified in this position by the fact the sole specific finding in the Findings of Fact relating to a lack of fair trial is \u201cthe failure\u201d of the Assistant United States Attorney \u201cto disclose to the Court and jury the disposition of the State and Federal cases\u201d against Sussman. (Finding VI; Marchese, Tr. p. 176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">We thus proceed to examine the validity of the district court order by focusing our attention on the alleged improprieties in the conduct of the Assistant United States Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\"><em>VIII </em>\u2014 The <em>Findings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">Turning to the findings here made in the district court, we find:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-10\">\u201cI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-11\">\u201cThat on January. 29th, 1958, one Donald Sussman was arrested by Narcotics Agent Malcolm Richards, under a complaint filed by the United States Attorney, wherein he was charged with a violation of Title 21\" Sec. 174 U.S.C. and taken to the-office of the Bureau of Narcotics in the Federal Building, Los Angeles-for a conference with Richards, Howard Chappell, head of the narcotics, bureau, and other narcotic agents. That an arrangement was made or-some form of promise was given to-him by agent Malcolm Richards, the-narcotics agent in charge of the investigation of petitioner Michele-M\u00e1rchese, that if he would cooperate in bringing about the arrest and', conviction of M\u00e1rchese, he, Malcolm. Richards, would try to obtain some-consideration for Sussman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-13\">\u201cThat although Malcolm Richards, denied any such promise, arrangement or assurance, the Court finds, from the evidence that some such promise, arrangement or assurance-was in fact made or given to Suss-man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-14\">\u201cII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-15\">\u201cThat after said arrangement, made with Sussman, he was taken-before the United States Commissioner and released on his O.

That he received from the narcotics bureau approximately $600.00 for his services that Malcolm Richards also contacted and advised Mr. Horton, Chief probation officer of the Los Angeles. County Superior Court, of such cooperation and also the Federal Probation Officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-16\">\u201cIll</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-17\">\u201cThat as a consequence of Malcolm-.

U.S.C. (sic) and filed an information against him under Sections 4704' and 7239 of Title 26, U.S.C., to-which Sussman pleaded guilty, waiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>ing an indictment and was sentenced to two years by U.

Byrne for two years only with a recommendation that he be sent to the United States prison hospital at Forth Worth, Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-5\">\u201cIV</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-6\">\u201cThat at the time of the trial of M\u00e1rchese, Sussman testified as follows :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-7\">\u201c \u2018Q. As a matter of fact, Mr. Sussman, you actually are using information against these men solely for the purpose of getting a lighter sentence in your ease, isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-8\">\u201c \u2018A. That is correct, one of the reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-9\">\u201c \u2018Q. One of the reasons.

Mr. Richards, you say that you first met Mr. Sussman, I believe on the 29th of January, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-19\">\u201c \u2018A. I first met him, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-20\">\u201c \u2018Q. Was that as a result of an arrest of some kind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-21\">\u201c \u2018A.

On recommendation of the County Probation Officer of the Superior Court of the State of California, For the County of Los Angeles, on April 30th, 1958, probation was revoked as to Mr. Sussman and the Court terminated the same and Sussman sentenced to one year to run concurrently with the Federal sentence then being served at Fort Worth, Texas, as aforesaid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-4\">\u201cMr. Sussman did not disclose the above disposition of his cases to the Court and Jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-5\">\u201cThe Court finds that the Federal Narcotics Officers were aware of this disposition, were aware of Sussman\u2019s testimony and the failure on his part to disclose this disposition to the Court and Jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-6\">\u201cThe Court further finds that the disposition of the State and Federal cases was known to or should have been known to the Assistant United States Attorney prosecuting the case and the failure to disclose to the Court and Jury the disposition of the State and Federal cases denied Michele Marq\u00faese (sic) the fair trial to which he was entitled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-7\">\u201cVII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-8\">\u201cThat Sussman was a narcotics addict; that during the period of the investigation of M\u00e1rchese from January 29th to May 13th, 1959, Sussman was under the influence of narcotics, taking from three to four grams a day and having a shot every 4% to 5 hours, his habit costing him about $75.00 a day; that he had taken narcotics off the top on sales previously made by him but did not take any off the top on the three occasions involved in this M\u00e1rchese case; that he took a shot on each occasion before he went to the M\u00e1r-chese apartment and took shot before meeting with the narcotic agents on other occasions.

It is further ordered that he be ordered immediately discharged from custody.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-14\">We immediately note certain inexactness, uncertainty and some contradictions appearing in the findings of fact, particularly with reference to the one point upon which relief was sought: the proposition that there was a \u201cpromise\u201d made by Agent Richards to \u201cstool pigeon\u201d Sussman to cooperate. We point out the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">1. In Finding I (M\u00e1rchese, T. 173): \u201cThat an arrangement was made <em>or some form of promise </em>was given\u201d; (emphasis added) that although denied, <em>\u201csome such </em>promise, arrangement or assurance was * * * given. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-18\">2.

That it cannot be ascertained from any findings or conclusions made by the trial court as to the <em>materiality </em>of Finding of Fact VI with respect to either paragraph of Conclusion of Law II or of Conclusion of Law III.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-18\">Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 52(a)\u2019 requires findings \u201cin all actions tried upon the facts. They are essential to-aid the appellate court on review.\u201d Irish v. United States, 225 F.2d 3 (9th Cir., 1955); Brooks Bros. v. Brooks Clothing,. (S.D.Cal.1945), 5 F.R.D. 14; Welsh Co. v.

But we also require, and are entitled to the benefit of clear and <em>explicit </em>findings on any factual issue tried without a jury. 6 Moore 52.06(3) (4) (5), 52.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-20\">Those before us are deficient in the respect heretofore pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-21\">For that reason it is impossible for this court to determine the materiality of the following Findings of Fact, which are urged here by petitioner below as error, but upon which no conclusions of law are based primarily:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-22\">VII\u2014 -With respect to Sussman\u2019s narcotic addiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-23\">VIII\u2014 -With respect to the use of the Schmidt radio receiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-24\">IX\u2014 With respect to \u201coverheard telephone conversation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-25\">It could be argued that we must assume that it is for this reason (i. e., their immateriality) that no causal connection is stated or shown between Findings VII, VIII and IX, and any Conclusions of Law. If there is no causal connection such findings should not have been made, and if there was no reliance on such fact findings, explicit reference is likewise required between such findings and any conclusions resting thereon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>:in order to enable this court to compare the conclusions and findings, and the facts found, with the evidence appearing in the record in our search for \u201cproper \u25a0findings\u201d to support the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">We find before us but one explicitly related finding of fact to one conclusion \u25a0of law, i. e., the last paragraph of Finding VI to the first paragraph of Conclusion II.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">We can only conclude the findings are not sufficiently clear to permit us to properly evaluate them, and if for 'no other reason than this, we would be required to reverse the judgment and remand for further findings and conclusions. However, this does not dispose of 'the real issue here involved \u2014 the alleged suppression of evidence by the government. At the risk of unduly prolonging this opinion, we feel this issue must be -discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\"><em>IX </em>\u2014 The <em>Prosecutor\u2019s Suppression or Failure to Disclose the Truth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">This finding goes to the heart of ap\u25a0pellant\u2019s position. Under the peculiar -circumstances of this matter, we feel \u25a0obliged to test this one particular finding of fact and the resulting conclusion -of law, to determine if the facts in the -case are sufficient to support a ruling below that would be within that court\u2019s \u25a0competence and jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">The last paragraph of this vital Finding VI is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-10\">\u201cthat the disposition of the State and Federal cases [against Suss-man] was known to or should have been known to the Assistant United States Attorney prosecuting the case and the failure to disclose to the Court and Jury the disposition of the State and Federal cases denied Michele Marq\u00faese (sic) the fair trial to which he was entitled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">At the time Sussman testified, the change of the charge against him had already been made by the government. The original indictment charging a violation of \u00a7 174, Title 21 U.S.C., had been dismissed, and Sussman was charged with violating \u00a7\u00a7 4704 and 7239 of Title 26, U.S.C. (the lesser \u201ctax\u201d penalties) and sentenced on April 30, 1958. His waiver of indictment, plea of guilty and sentence were matters of public record in the same district court in which he testified against M\u00e1rchese (although before a different judge). It is difficult for us to understand why a matter of public record was required to be brought to the attention of the trial court; but it was \u2014 he commented on it (supra).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">We thus have three questions before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-15\">(1) Was the defendant Sussman <em>in fact </em>promised leniency or favors for testifying against M\u00e1rchese by officers or prosecutors ?</p>\n<p id=\"b851-16\">(2) Did the Assistant United States Attorney know, or should he have known of it?</p>\n<p id=\"b851-17\">(3) If both of these questions are answered affirmatively, was the prosecutor under a duty to disclose such facts to the judge and jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b851-18\">Question (1) is purely one of fact; question (2) partly fact and partly law; and question (3) one of law, the determination of which usually depends upon facts developed at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-19\">We turn to appellees\u2019 (petitioners\u2019) charges below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-20\">\u201c3. During the petitioners\u2019 trial, the United States Attorney abused the privileges of his office by actively participating in the suppression of the truth and failing to disclose the truth concerning the obvious agreement or understanding between Donald Sussman and the Federal and State authorities, contrary to their oath of office and in disregard of petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d (M\u00e1rchese, C.T. 21, et seq.; Del Bono, C.T. 10, et seq.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-21\">We turn to the evidence offered at the hearing in support of Marchese\u2019s third ground and Del Bono\u2019s first ground, suppression of evidence. We cite in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>margin first the appellant\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">We note that appellees charge the statement made in the margin as note 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>\u201comits essential facts.\u201d We therefore place their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with respect to the \u201cleniency\u201d promised.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">We also note the testimony of Bruce Bevan, Esq., the Assistant United States Attorney, using appellees\u2019 version of his. testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AdY0\">We conclude that there was <em>no proof </em>that defendant Sussman was promised \u201cleniency\u201d as such. He <em>was </em>promised by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Richards: (a) that whatever Sussman did to aid the prosecution \u201cwould be brought to the attention\u201d of the United \u2022States Attorney; (b) that Richards, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics agent, told the State probation officer Sussman was \u201caiding\u201d the federal government, and was giving the federal government \u201chelp and cooperation\u201d; that he was \u201chelping,\u201d and Bevan, the Assistant United \u2022States Attorney did prepare the lesser tax counts for Sussman\u2019s plea, and subsequent imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">\u201cThe obvious agreement\u201d charged .against the United States Attorney was thus one resting solely on an inference, apparently made by the trial judge, rather than any direct evidence, for there was none to support it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">We pass for the moment the inherent difficulties in proving an \u201cagreement\u201d when the terms thereof have been found to be unknown; and assume, as the court below did, that there was <em>\u201csome such </em>promise, arrangement or assurance\u201d (Finding I) between Richards and Suss-man, that Richards \u201cwould try to obtain some consideration for Sussman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">This inferred agreement, of course, is not what is charged in Marchese\u2019s third ground and Del Bono\u2019s first \u2014 rather it is that \u201cthe United States Attorney [not Richards] abused the privilege of his office * * * by suppressing and failing to disclose the inferred truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">To best aid appellees\u2019 position, we assume questions one and two raised above are answered in the affirmative, and also assume the trial judge could infer an assurance of leniency to a witness by a Federal Bureau of Narcotics employee, with the inferred \u201ccooperation\u201d and knowledge of an Assistant United States Attorney, in return for Sussman\u2019s cooperation as a witness in the prosecution of M\u00e1rchese and Del Bono.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Was such encouragement to Sussman an act which prevented appellees from having a fair trial? Or deprived either of them of a constitutional right, under the facts of this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Parenthetically we note that the cooperation of one of several joint defendants in the prosecution of others, in the hope of saving his own skin, is as old as law itself. It seems one part of the unpleasant situation that goes with, and is an integral part of crime, seemingly a necessary part of crime\u2019s solution and prosecution and ultimate control, if not prevention. Lisenba v. California, 314 U. S. 219, 62 S.Ct. 280, 86 L.Ed. 166 (1941), rehearing denied 315 U.S. 826, 62 S.Ct. 620, 86 L.Ed. 1222 (1942); United States v. Vita, 209 F.Supp. 172 (E.D. N.Y.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">We turn to the third question under consideration \u2014 the prosecutor\u2019s duty under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">To fairly consider this, we must reconstruct, on the foundation of the evidence produced at the subsequent \u00a7 2255 hearings (notes 3, 4, and 5, supra) what occurred at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Appellee M\u00e1rchese reaches the primary question of \u201csuppression of evidence\u201d on page 37 of his reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">The Assistant United States Attorney, it is said, \u201cnot only was well aware of Sussman\u2019s record, and of the state and federal proceedings, and not only failed to disclose same, but by objection prevented their disclosure.\u201d The latter part of this statement is simply not supported by the record. We cannot agree with appellee Marchese\u2019s counsel that the government\u2019s objection \u201cstopped the defense attorneys * * * from inquiring further into any arrangement, agreement, promise, or assurance.\u201d (Marchese\u2019s Br. p. 37) In truth, Assistant United States Attorney Bevan invited just the opposite \u2022 \u2014 he <em>invited </em>defense counsel to go ahead with their questioning. (Tr. p. 175, 11. 20-21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">We obviously do not question the rule that \u201ca conviction obtained through use of false evidence, known to be such by representatives of the State, must fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d And we concede that rule applies-when the State, though not soliciting false evidence, knowingly allows it to go uncorrected when it appears in evidence. Napue v. Illinois, infra at 269, 79 S.Ct. at 1177, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">But we find no basis, either in the evidence at the first trial, at the hearing below on this matter, nor in the findings-of fact, that would justify a conclusion that a proper \u201ctechnical\u201d objection to-evidence made by the prosecution, sustained by the trial judge, and never again, raised by the defendants\u2019 counsel, prevented disclosure of any fact. In truth, the exact opposite was shown and found (Tr. p. 175). The government objected only to the witness\u2019 conclusion, not to a recital of the facts. The court\u2019s ruling-sustained the sole objection made on but one ground: that the question called for the witness\u2019 conclusion. (Tr. p. 175, 11. 17, 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">There is no question but that Sussman knew he could better himself and perhaps-obtain leniency if he cooperated with the prosecution. He did not hide his hopes. (Orig. Tr. 419, 11. 1-10.) The court found he did not. (Finding IV.) He testified openly with respect to it at the trial. (Original Tr. pp. 419-22; 433-35; 450.) Government counsel advised court, counsel and the jury of it when making his opening statement (Orig. Tr. pp. 33a-43a). Government counsel so argued to the jury at the end of the case (Orig. R.T. 595). Agent. Richards was cross-examined about Suss-man\u2019s release on his own recognizance, and his sentence by Judge Byrne whereby he received two years imprisonment,, a \u201clight sentence.\u201d (Orig. T. 95-99.) The trial court commented, as a fact, on-Sussman\u2019s plea of guilty before Judge-Byrne (Orig. T. 99). Richards denied any promise made to Sussman in his-(Richards\u2019) presence. Both Richards and Assistant United States Attorney Bevan allegedly could not, and did not, promise Sussman anything except that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>he could continue to hope for leniency and consideration by the judge because \u25a0of the fact that he had \u201ccooperated.\u201d But this is a far cry from a \u201cdeal,\u201d from a \u201ccontract,\u201d from a \u201cpromise,\u201d \u2022which appellees <em>infer </em>must have existed. .Such an inference goes beyond what the record discloses, and there is no competent evidence of any concealment by anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Sussman was cross-examined about his hopes and how he was treated (Orig. T. 412, 419-22; 450; 472-73) and his State arrest (Orig. T. 432-35) and the money paid him by the government to act as an informer (Orig. T. 435-36; 447-48).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Finally, original counsel for Del Bono <em>inferentially </em>(Orig. T. 654-55) and original counsel for M\u00e1rchese <em>directly </em>(Orig. T. 670-76) argued to the jury all the facts now urged (save alleged <em>suppression </em>of evidence) in an attempt to impeach Sussman.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">The evidentiary rule involved is expressed in Wigmore, Vol. Ill \u00a7 967 (3d -ed.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-8\">\u201cIt bears against a witness\u2019 credibility that he is <em>an accomplice </em>in the crime charged and testifies <em>for the prosecution, </em>and <em>the pendency of any indictment </em>against the witness indicates indirectly a similar possibility of his currying favor by testifying for the State. So, too, the existence of a <em>promise </em>or just expectation <em>of pardon </em>for his share as accomplice in the crime charged.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">The basis for the rule is the general belief that everyone is interested in bettering himself and in saving himself from punishment, and hence that the testimony of such an accomplice testifying with the hope or existing possibility \u2022or promise of future benefit or leniency should be carefully tested and weighed and considered by the trier of fact. Cf.: United States v. Masino, 275 F.2d 129 (2d Cir. 1960); Meeks v. United States, 163 F.2d 598 (9th Cir. 1947); United States v. Hogan, 232 F.2d 905 (3d Cir. 1956).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-11\">\u201cThe principle that a State may not knowingly use false evidence, including false testimony, to obtain a tainted conviction, implicit in any concept of ordered liberty, does not cease to apply merely because the false testimony goes only to the credibility of the witness. The jury\u2019s estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence, and it is upon such subtle factors as the possible interest of the witness in testifying falsely that a defendant\u2019s life or liberty may depend.\u201d Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 1177, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">\u201cThe determination of the effect of such consideration as a motive for testifying is for the jury.\u201d United States v. Bishop, 188 F.Supp. 804 (E.D.Wis. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">We cannot agree with petitioner that the facts of this case bring it within the rule of Napue v. Illinois, supra, or that Powell v. Wiman, 287 F.2d 275 (5 Cir. 1961), is controlling. In the latter case, Hatt, a prosecution witness, had been previously confined in a mental institution. The prosecutor of this Alabama defendant prevented inquiry on part of the defense as to Hatt\u2019s insanity. As the court said: \u201cThe State doggedly and successfully opposed every effort of the neophyte lawyers to cross examine the witness as to his sanity,\u201d when it had evidence, not available to defendant, of the witness\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-15\">In Napue, supra (a murder trial), Hamer, the principal state\u2019s witness, then serving a 199 year sentence for the same murder, <em>was promised </em>\u201ca recommendation for a reduction of his sentence\u201d already meted out, if he would aid the prosecution of Napue. He then testified, in response to a question by the Assistant United States Attorney, that <em>he had received no promise </em>of any consideration in return for his testimony. Nothing was done to correct the witness\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>false testimony \u2014 known by the prosecution to be false. After trial, the same United States Attorney who had promised Hamer he would recommend a reduction in his sentence filed a petition on Hamer\u2019s behalf, detailing his promise to Hamer, and his subsequent assurances to Hamer \u201cthat every possible effort would be made to conform to the promise previously made to him.\u201d Napue, hearing of this petition, and knowing of Ha-mer\u2019s false testimony at the trial, filed his own petition, and obtained relief. Neither Napue nor Powell v. Wiman, supra, are in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">We now turn to the fundamental question here presented:</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Was there evidence to support the court\u2019s inferred conclusion that the Assistant United States Attorney abused his office by suppressing or failing to disclose \u201cthe truth\u201d so as to deny appel-lees a fair trial, and violate their constitutional safeguards ?</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">As we have seen, \u201cthe truth\u201d allegedly so suppressed or not disclosed was \u201cthe obvious agreement or understanding between Sussman and Federal and State authorities\u201d (Appellees\u2019 Br. p. 16), that he (Sussman) should receive leniency. It was not suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">We find no basis in the record to support any claim that the Assistant United States Attorney suppressed or failed to disclose what Sussman hoped and/or suspected might happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">The petition attempts to prove the promise by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-9\">(1) Agent Richards\u2019 <em>denial </em>it existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-10\">(2) Sussman\u2019s admitted <em>hope or expectation </em>that he would \u201cprobably\u201d get a lighter sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-11\">(3) The Assistant United States Attorney\u2019s well-taken and court-sustained objection to a question which called for a witness\u2019 conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">We hold no one or all of these matters prove an unlawful agreement with or promise to Sussman. And we hold there was no suppression of evidence by the Assistant United States Attorney on the record of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">Having determined that the district court erred in <em>one, </em>exceeding its jurisdiction in granting unauthorized relief; <em>two, </em>making insufficient findings to permit this court to ascertain upon what its conclusions were based; <em>three, </em>in holding the evidence in this case supported a finding that an improper agreement existed between the Assistant United States Attorney and the witness Suss-man (based entirely on inference); <em>four, </em>in finding that the Assistant United States Attorney suppressed evidence (by making a valid objection to the form of a question, sustained by the trial court on that one ground), we hold the findings made are unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-16\">Each judgment is reversed, and appel-lees ordered remanded to custody forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-12\">. \u201cSPECIFICATIONS OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">\u201c1. The District Court was without jurisdiction to modify and reduce appel-lees\u2019 sentence from ten to five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">\u201c2. The District Court was without jurisdiction to order the immediate release of appellees from custody based upon \u2018good time\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">\u201c3. The District Court erred in granting relief upon grounds which were or should have been raised on the direct appeal from appellees\u2019 judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-16\">\u201c4. The District Court erred in its Conclusions of Law that (1) it <em>could </em>treat the petitions either as for relief under Title 28, United States Code, Section 2255 or Section 2243; (2) That the constitutional rights of petitioners to a fair trial were so denied or infringed upon as to amount to a denial of duo process.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-26\">\u201c5. The District Court erred in its Findings of Fact to the extent that they referred [1] to agreements between narcotics agents and the informant, [2] promises of leniency by the narcotic agents to the informant, [3] suppression of evidence on the part of narcotic agents or by the Assistant United States Attorney, or [4] to denial of the constitutional rights of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-27\">\u201c6. The District Court erred in its refusal to strike appellees\u2019 respective petitions from the records of the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-28\">\u201c7. The District Court erred in permitting appellees to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege at the hearings held on their respective petitions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\">. It appears the court below was led into error by the statement unsupported by statute or case law made by appellees\u2019 counsel that the court could \u201corder the prisoner discharged for time served.\u201d (M\u00e1rchese, T. 73-77, 128.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b852-5\">. \u201cAppellee M\u00e1rchese called only one witness, former Federal Bureau of Narcotics Agent Malcolm Richards [M\u00e1rchese, R.T. 9]. Agent Richards specifically denied the existence of any agreement between he (sic) and the informant Suss-man, or that he or any other agent had promised Sussman any leniency should he cooperate with the government in any investigation, or that to his knowledge, Sussman had testified other than truthfully at the trial. [M\u00e1rchese R.T. 13, 24, 36, 37]. The Government called former Assistant United States Attorney Bruce Bevan [M\u00e1rchese R.T. 58] and Appellee Michele M\u00e1rchese. [M\u00e1rchese R.T. 45.] Attorney Bevan similarly denied any knowledge of an \u2018agreement1 between any of the agents and Sussman, or that any agent had promised \u2018leniency\u2019 to Sussman in exchange for his cooperation, or that he had endeavored to suppress evidence at the trial. [M\u00e1rchese, R.T. <em>59-60]. </em>Several questions were propounded to Appellee M\u00e1rchese by Government counsel, relating to the facts of the case, [note] In each instance, upon advice of counsel, appellee refused to answer the questions under claim of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. On each occasion, the court treated the verbal refusal by the appellee as though it were an \u2018objection\u2019 and \u2018sustained\u2019 it without further explanation. Although Government counsel moved to strike the petition based on the effective denial of the Government\u2019s right of cross-examination, and, although there was no statement by appellee or his attorney as to the basis for his apprehensiveness, other than the fact that he had previously been prosecuted for perjury, the Government\u2019s motion was denied. [Marchese, R.T. 44r-48.]</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">\u201cIn the Del Bono case, the situation was quite similar. Moreover, prior to the Del Bono hearing, Government counsel expressed his intention to take the deposition of appellee Del Bono at the Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island,\u2019 California. Appellee\u2019s attorney informed the Court and the Government counsel that, because Del Bono had previously been indicted for perjury, he had advised Del Bono to \u2018 * * * avail himself of his privileges and rights under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and refuse to answer any questions.\u2019 Upon the aeknowl-edgement of the Court that it would amount to a waste of time, trouble and expense for the Government to so depose appellee, Government counsel advised the court that it would not attempt to take his deposition prior to the hearing. [Del Bono, R.T. 14-16.] At the hearing itself, the same evidence offered at the M\u00e1rchese hearing was introduced by ap-pellee and no witnesses were called on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">\u201cAppellant called Appellee Del Bono as a witness. After acknowledging his name and that he had signed the verified petition on page 17 thereof [Del Bono, C.T. 26-27], upon advice of counsel, appellee proceeded to refuse to answer some 17 questions propounded by the Government. [note]</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">\u201cCounsel for appellants moved to strike the petition and argued the following in support thereof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-12\">\u201c\u2018Mr. Schulman: I move to strike the petition, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-13\">\u201c \u2018Tour Honor, this Petition is filed with this court; it is the moving document upon which these proceedings are based. If the witness chooses to bring a petition into this court, then he should bo willing to stand cross-examination on that petition or the petition should have no validity before the court. As a unique document, subject to no cross-examination, the witness being subject to no cross-examination, then the proceeding should conclude right now and that pleading should be stricken.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-14\">\u201cThe court denied appellant\u2019s motion to strike the petition, and sustained ap-pellee\u2019s \u2018objections\u2019 as to each question. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">\u201cThe only basis suggested by appellee\u2019s attorney as to why it was believed appel-lee should claim the Fifth Amendment was that the petition had been * * * \u2018sworn to in prison before one of the prison officials, and it is here, and I do not believe under the circumstances they are entitled to cross-examine on it\u2019, and a subsequent reference to the fact that appellee Del Bono had previously been prosecuted and convicted for perjury. The Court inquired no further into the matter, [Del Bono, R.T. 28-29, 34r-36] and did not order the witness to answer any of the questions.
