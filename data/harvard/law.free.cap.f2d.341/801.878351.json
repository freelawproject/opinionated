The Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, through action of the Appeals Council, adopted the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">The District Judge who heard claimant\u2019s petition for review of this adverse decision found no substantial evidence to support the Trial Examiner\u2019s finding. He thereupon reversed and remanded the case, directing that claimant be granted both a period of disability and disability insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Unfortunately, the brief memorandum and order entered does not advise us on what grounds he reached either conclusion. See Celebrezze v. Zimmerman, 339 F.2d 496 (C.A.5, 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Disability insurance benefits are payments made to an individual who is insured under the Social Security Act when he becomes disabled within the meaning of the Act. A period of disability is, however, simply the freezing of an insured individual\u2019s benefit status so that his retirement benefit rights are preserved, even though he does not do any more work in an employment covered by Social Security. Generally the requirements for both disability benefits and disability freeze are the same. But this is not true where, as here, an individual has achieved an insured status for disability purposes under railroad employment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">This record clearly shows that Lee Roy Banks has held only two regular jobs in his lifetime \u2014 one with the L &amp; N Railroad for 15 years and one with the L &amp; H Coal Company for four and one-half years. Claimant\u2019s railroad employment was not subject to Social Security coverage. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(a) (9) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As to claimant\u2019s nonrailroad employment (which was covered by Social Security) coverage for twenty quarters is required for payment of disability insurance benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(i) (3) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">It is conceded that without borrowing railroad service claimant has only 17 of the 20 quarters needed for Social Security disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">It appears clear that the statute does not provide for such \u201cborrowing\u201d for purposes of disability insurance benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(a) (9). A specific provision for borrowing from railroad service is provided for establishment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>a period of disability, but it is limited to this purpose only.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-4\">\u201cFor the purpose of meeting disability insured status requirements for the establishment of a period of disability only, quarters of coverage may be granted for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-5\">\u201c(a) Compensation for service after 1936 covered by the Railroad Retirement Act (See Subpart 0 of this part) [\u201cInterrelationship of Old-Age Survivors and Disability Insurance Program with the Railroad Retirement Program,\u201d 20 C.F.R. 404.1401-404.1410] even though such compensation may not be used for other purposes of Title II of the Social Security Act because the individual has 120 or more months of such service.\u201d 20 C.F.R. 404.120, 42 U.S.C.A. App. (1963 Supp.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The claim herein to disability benefits is therefore barred, and the District Judge\u2019s judgment as to that as part of the case is hereby reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Provision has been made, however (as just noted), for \u201cborrowing\u201d railroad service for purposes of the establishment of a period of disability only. As we have noted, this provision has the practical effect of freezing a claimant\u2019s benefit status as of the date of his disability for purposes of ultimate payment of Social Security retirement benefits. But here also a claimant for such a freeze must establish disability within the meaning of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416 (i) (1) (A) and \u00a7 423(c) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">As to the District Judge\u2019s finding that there is no substantial evidence to support the Trial Examiner\u2019s conclusion that this claimant is not disabled and is capable of substantial gainful employment, we review a difficult record and one we find inadequate in one respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">It is undisputed that this 39-year old claimant\u2019s physical health is good. But it is also undisputed that he has a 65 I.Q. and that his adjustment to possible employment is seriously affected by an anxiety neurosis. Both factors make it difficult for him to follow direction and render him accident prone.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">No one who reviews this entire file can help being impressed with the obvious fact that claimant\u2019s mental and psychological problems are real, substantial and undisputed. They are not new but have been a part of claimant\u2019s history from infancy; and the testimony contained in this record strongly suggests that claimant never has been employable in any normal sense of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">Nonetheless, as we have previously noted, the employment records relied upon by claimant to establish Social Security coverage clearly show that he did work for a period of nearly 20 years at two separate jobs. Clearly, absent a marked change thereafter in claimant\u2019s physical or mental capabilities, such an employment record would in itself constitute \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of capacity to do substantial work and would require affirmance of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding. King v. Celebrezze, 341 F.2d 108 (C.A.6, 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">As we read claimant\u2019s brief, it apparently is his contention that claimant has never been able to work successfully in his life, except in highly protected employment where there was great family support or influence. The reliance in this regard is on the fact that claimant\u2019s railroad work was that of a section hand on a gang of which his father was foreman, and on the fact that his work at the mine was attended by difficulties which led to his discharge. Although the District Judge\u2019s memorandum does not so advise us, he must have adopted this view of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">Our own review of this record convinces us that it is completely inadequate for a fair finding of fact on this issue. No witness testified who had ever supervised claimant\u2019s work or who had ever worked with him. Specific evidence from such sources \u2014 directly bearing on claimant\u2019s assertions of disability \u2014 obviously is available and should be adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Reversed and remanded for entry of an order denying disability insurance benefits and for the talcing of further testimony upon the claim for a period of disability in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-15\">.
