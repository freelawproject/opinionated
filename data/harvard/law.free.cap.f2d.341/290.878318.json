In order for the taxpayers to prevail in their contention that these proceeds were excludable from gross income under the provisions of \u00a7 104(a) (3) read in conjunction with \u00a7 105(e), it would be necessary for us to reach the following conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-21\">(a) that the Special Fund here involved qualified as an accident and health insurance plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-22\">(b) that the payments received were for personal injuries or sickness; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-23\">(c) that the payments were not attributable to contributions by the employer of the taxpayers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>We find it unnecessary to decide (a) and (b) above, because we are of the opinion that the employer of these taxpayers, at least as that word is used in \u00a7 104(a) (3), was the City of Baltimore, which concededly appropriated the funds for the salaries of all the members of the Baltimore police force on active duty and contributed to the Special Fund most of the money from which payments were made to former members of the Baltimore City Police Department. This being true, and it also appearing that the taxpayers did not satisfy the apportionment obligation placed upon them by \u00a7 1.72-15(e) of the Treasury Regulations, all the proceeds received by the taxpayers were required to be treated as having been funded by their employer\u2019s contributions. Finally, we agree with the Tax Court that under the circumstances here these proceeds were not ex-cludable from gross income under \u00a7 105 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We think the Commissioner\u2019s action in assessing the deficiencies for the years in question was proper, and the decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
