The court also considered the motion as if made under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">In 1961 defendant and a co-defendant, Horace Rinaldi, both represented by counsel, were convicted of forging and uttering government bonds, conspiracy and aiding and abetting. Upon appeal Carbone\u2019s conviction was affirmed, Ri-naldi\u2019s reversed. United States v. Rinal-di and Carbone, 301 F.2d 576 (2d Cir., 1962). Upon the first trial during the examination of a witness Patricia Cu-sano, counsel for Carbone requested from the Government any statements given by Cusano and was informed that none existed. Upon the second trial of Rinaldi, it appeared that a general report had been made by a Secret Service agent to the United States Attorney regarding the case. The trial court directed that this report be delivered to defense counsel and marked it as a court\u2019s exhibit. Now defendant claims that the Government\u2019s failure to mention this report upon the first trial places the report in the category of newly discovered evidence and that its nonproduction amounted to a suppression of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">The court below concluded that the report was a summary by the investigating agent to the United States Attorney ; that \u201cIt is not an interview report, and no reasonable construction would permit its being viewed as such. Under the heading \u2018Witnesses and Their Testimony\u2019 no mention of the witness Patricia Cusano is found\u201d; and that \u201cit could not be viewed as being within the ambit of Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500.\u201d The court also found that the claim of suppression was without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">An independent examination of the portions of the agent\u2019s report upon which defendant bases his claim satisfies this court that this report does not even remotely come within the purview or in-tendment of section 3500 and that the court below properly denied the motion for a new trial and for relief under 28' U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
