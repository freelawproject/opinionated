Appellant does not deny having done the acts that are alleged as the overt act under the conspiracy. There was ample evidence of the existence of a conspiracy and of appellant\u2019s, identification with the other alleged conspirators to warrant the finding by the-trial court, sitting without a jury, that appellant was guilty beyond a reasonable-doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-24\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
