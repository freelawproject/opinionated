She and her husband instituted suit on January 8, 1964, against the Staples and their insurer to recover damages for her injui\u2019ies. The complaint was filed approximately one year and thirty days, after the running of the one-year Louisiana prescription for damages \u201cresulting from offenses or quasi offenses.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiffs sought to avoid the prescription statute by alleging that an insurance-adjuster representing appellee Fireman\u2019s Fund had, by his actions and words,, made deliberate misrepresentations, detailed in the complaint, which led Mrs. Thompson reasonably to believe that the-insux\u2019ance company fully intended to settle her claim. She asserted that these misrepresentations were the sole cause of her failux'e to obtain legal counsel or otherwise take action during the year prior to the running of the period of prescription. The trial court gx-anted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint for failux\u2019e to state a claim on which relief could be granted, and the-plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-20\"> Since jurisdiction in this cas\u00e9is based solely on diversity of citizenship, we are bound to apply the substantive law of Louisiana. Erie R. R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). We agree with the-trial court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs\u201d allegations do not set forth a claim for avoidance of the px'escription statute under the Louisiana decisions. See Green v. Grain Dealers Mutual Ins. Co., (La. App.1962) 144 So.2d 685; Ayres v. New York Life Ins. Co., 219 La. 945, 54 So.2d 409, 411-412 (1951). The judgment is. therefore affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-21\">. Art. 3536, LSA-Civ.Cocle.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
