Appellant was found guilty of bribing an employee of the General Services Administration [GSA] in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, and of conspiring to commit similar offenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. The co-defendant, the employee of GSA, pleaded guilty prior to trial and was the principal witness for the Government. Appellant, who was represented by retained counsel at trial, appeals <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-26\">Because of the narrow ground requiring reversal we will not set forth the facts involved other than to comment that there was convincing evidence of the payment of money by appellant to the purchasing agent of GSA during the period he was giving information to appellant so that appellant could appear to make legitimate lower bids on certain purchasing contracts. During the Government\u2019s examination of the purchasing agent, Samuel J. DiChellis, the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-27\">\u201cQ. Did this practice about your talking to him about the bids continue throughout the time from the fall of 1960, when it first occurred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>right to the time when you resigned? A. To the time of my resignation in May of 1962.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-4\">\u201cQ. Mr. DiChellis, did you ever provide any type of information to other bidds [sic] on class 81 items ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-5\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-6\">\u201cQ. How about class 93 items?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-7\">A. Yes. Well, it would be the same. 93 would be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-8\">\u201cQ. I will clarify it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-9\">\u201cDid you ever reveal this type of information to other bidders on class 81 and class 93 items? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-10\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-11\">\u201cQ. Did you have occasion to give this information to other bidders on class 81 and class 93 items?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-12\">A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">At the close of the Government\u2019s case, appellant\u2019s attorney requested copies of all prior statements by the witness. The Government produced several statements and gave them to appellant\u2019s attorney. One statement, contained in Government\u2019s Exhibits 38 and 38-A for identification, was submitted to the trial judge, examined by him and ordered sealed after he ruled: \u201cI find 38 up to this point does not deal with this case and will be ordered sealed. 38 and 38-A, pages 3 through 12 will be ordered sealed because it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">An examination of Government\u2019s Exhibits 38 and 38-A for identification reveals that it is an FBI report containing a signed sworn statement of the witness in which he explained in detail his similar unlawful dealings with other bidders. This is a \u201cstatement\u201d within the meaning of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, which requires the production of \u201cany statement * * * of the witness in the possession of the United States which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified.\u201d There could be no doubt that the statement the Government possessed but re-</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">fused to produce related to DiChellis\u2019 direct testimony quoted above. The Government examined DiChellis on the point of other dealings and therefore it should have turned over the statement to defendant\u2019s counsel for purposes of cross-examination. \u201cDue process is afforded defendants under the Jencks statute by the provision that there should be available for cross-examination of government witnesses any documents which contain recitals substantially in the words of the witness.\u201d United States v. McKeever, 271 F.2d 669, 674 (2 Cir.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-16\">1959) . Given that the statement \u201crelates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified,\u201d and that defendant insisted upon having the statement produced, the statute leaves no room for the trial judge, nor for us, to speculate as to how useful this statement will be for purposes of cross-examination or how important such cross-examination will be to defendant\u2019s case, cf. United States v. Borelli, 336 F.2d 376, 391-392 (2 Cir. 1964). The Government relies on general language in two other opinions of this Circuit, United States v. Cardillo, 316 F.2d 606 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 822, 84 S.Ct. 60, 11 L. Ed.2d 55 (1963) and United States v. Birnbaum, 337 F.2d 490 (2 Cir. 1964). On the contrary, both of these cases expressly recognize the principle that prior statements that relate \u201cgenerally to the events and activities testified to\u201d must be produced. 316 F.2d at 615; 337 F. 2d at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-17\">In reversing this conviction we echo the late Judge Clark\u2019s regret: \u201c[I]t is perhaps doubly unfortunate that this must occur because of the reluctance of the prosecutor and the trial court to accept the policy of yielding pre-trial statements of prosecution witnesses to the defense * * United States v. Tomaiolo, 280 F.2d 411, 412 (2 Cir. 1960) . See also United States v. Borelli, supra, 336 F.2d at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-20\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
