We have considered each of these and find that they are without substance. The original warrant was properly signed by the Commissioner. The fact that the copy that was served on the appellant at his home was signed only by a typewritten signature is immaterial. The time which the officers must wait after making their presence known before making a forcible entry- \u2014 \u25a0 here, one minute \u2014 is a circumstance which the trial court must weigh. We find no error in his determination that the execution of the warrant in this case was legal. United States v. West, 2 Cir., 328 F.2d 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-21\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
