The cheek, mailed in a window envelope, was made payable to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aod\">\u201cAllied Chemical Corporation Post Office Box 2382 Dallas, 21, Texas\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">It is undisputed that the check was placed in Post Office Box 2382 and removed from the box, together with other mail, by appellant and taken to his home. There is a dispute as to what disposition was made of the cheek thereafter and by whom. Co-defendant Gay-nor pleaded guilty, and it was his testimony that he and appellant attempted to open a bank account with the check. He had previously given two statements to a postal inspector. In the first he assumed responsibility by saying that he stole the check from the home of appellant. He changed his story some months later in a second statement to implicate appellant, but in no event was there any semblance of evidence to show that appellant intended to steal the check at the time it was removed from his post office box, or at the time he first discovered it as being in his mail. There was no evidence that it was stolen from the mails. It was undisputed that the decision as to the misadventure, such as it was, came after the letter had been removed inadvertently to the home of appellant. Thus it is clear that there was no evidentiary basis whatever to support the charge in the indictment that the check,, that is to say the letter in which the cheek was contained, was stolen from the post office box.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit noted in United States v. Hines, 2 Cir., 1958, 256 F.2d 561, a case involving a similar indictment, that to procure a conviction it is necessary for the prosecution to show that the letter was stolen from the mails, and that the defendant unlawfully possessed it knowing that it was stolen. The evidence was found sufficient there but the case was reversed on other grounds. Here we find the proof deficient. The conviction cannot stand in light of the complete absence of proof that the check was stolen from the mails. This is the basis of the indictment, not some other statute, cf. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1702, and it is to this allegation that the proof must conform. . See generally United States v. Meyers, E.D.Wis., 1906, 142 F. 907. It follows that the judgment appealed from must be reversed, and that judgment should be and it is here rendered for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Reversed and rendered; remanded for the entry of judgment accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-12\">.
