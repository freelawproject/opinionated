We approve and adopt the District Judge\u2019s conclusion and the reasoning on which it is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Here, in addition to the contention argued by petitioner and rejected by the district judge, that he was denied due process of law in the state court because of discriminatory use by state authorities in enforcing the Texas Habitual Offenders Statute,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellant argues that he was deprived of due process in that: under the procedure of the state court in enforcing that section, the jury, to whom was submitted the question of his guilt or innocence, was informed by the indictment that he had been formerly convicted of prior offenses against the laws of the State of Texas; and that the statement in the indictment, under which he was tried as required by the Texas Habitual Offenders Act, supra, that he was a former offender, was prejudicial and illegally deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury by getting before the jury the fact of his former offenses, whereas, he was constitutionally entitled to be tried without having such prejudicial matter put before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-24\">In support of his contention, appellant cites and strongly relies on Lane v. Warden, 320 F.2d 179 (4th Cir. 1963). This court has never so held, and under the controlling Texas statutes and the authorities we are not disposed to adopt or follow the cited opinion. On the contrary, we are of the firm view that that case was not well decided and that the correct view of the law is otherwise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-25\"> In the case of Crocker v. State of Texas, 385 S.W.2d 392 in the Court of Criminal Appeals, the appellant, convicted under the Habitual Offenders Act, made the same contention in the state court that is made here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The view of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the court in that case has been universally affirmed and reaffirmed. It was early held in Smith v. State of Alabama, 124 U.S. 465, 8 S.Ct. 564, 31 L.Ed. 508, and has since been maintained consistently and many times repeated that a state may freely legislate with respect to the rights, duties and liabilities of citizens, subject only to the requirement that their laws must not violate federal constitutional provisions and principle. But this does not mean that the procedure provided by the state can be rejected as unconstitutional merely because a judge or judges find the procedure objectionable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">No error being made to appear, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\">.

Of. the dissent of Mr. Justice Black in Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368 at 407,</p>\n<p id=\"AfH\">84 S.Ct. 1774 at 1797, 12 L.Ed.2d 908:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQH\">\u201cMy wide difference with the Court is in its apparent holding that it has constitutional power to change trial procedures because of its belief that they are not fair. There is no constitutional provision which gives this Court any such lawmaking power. I assume, although the Court\u2019s opinion is not clear on this point, that the basis for its holding is the \u2018due process of law\u2019 clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court appears to follow a judicial philosophy which has relied on that clause to strike down laws and procedures in many fields because of a judicial belief that they are \u2018unfair,\u2019 are contrary to \u2018the concept of ordered liberty,\u2019 \u2018shock the conscience,\u2019 or come within various other vague hut appealing catch phrases. See e.g. Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455, 62 S.Ct. 1252, 86 L.Ed. 1595; Rochin v. [People of] California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183; Palko v. State of Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 58 S.Ct. 149, 82 L.Ed. 288; see also cases collected in Adamson v. [People of State of] California, 332 U.S. 46, 83, n. 12, 67 S. Ct. 1672, 1692, 91 L.Ed. 1903 (dissenting opinion). I have repeatedly objected to-the use of the Due Process Clause to give judges such a wide and unbounded power, whether in cases involving criminal procedure, see, e.g., Betts v. Brady, supra, 316 U.S., at 474, 62 S.Ct., at 1262 (dissenting opinion) ; cf. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed.2d 799, or economic legislation, see Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 83 S. Ct. 1028, 10 L.Ed.2d 93. I believe that \u2018due process of law\u2019 as it applies to trials means, as this Court held in Chambers v. [State of] Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 235-238, 60 S.Ct. 472, 476-477, 84 L.Ed. 716, a trial according to the \u2018law of the land,\u2019 including all constitutional guarantees, both explicit and necessarily implied from explicit language, and all valid laws enacted pursuant to constitutionally granted powers. See also Adamson v. [People of State of] California, supra, 332 U.S., at 68, 67 S.Ct., at 1684 (dissenting opinion).\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
