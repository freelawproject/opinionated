This statement is attacked in petition for rehearing on the ground that there was no current activity towards organization of the employees. What was intended was a reference to the fact that organizational activities had formerly been undertaken and were resumed thereafter. In point of fact this was a collateral matter not essential to our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">The Petition for Rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
