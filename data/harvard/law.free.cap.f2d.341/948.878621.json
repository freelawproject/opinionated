The taxpayer, Mrs. Lora McCarthy,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> owned 1000 shares of the stock of The Andrew Radel \u25a0Oyster Company, a family corporation, which she had acquired through inheritance. In December 1954, she sold her shares to the corporation which paid for them with liquid assets it had accumulated out of earnings and profits over a long period. It was the taxpayer\u2019s use of a claimed loss on this transaction to offset income for the years in question that the District Director disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-19\">The court below found that there was no genuine issue of fact which would rebut the District Director\u2019s determination that the payment made by the corporation for the purchase of her stock was not a distribution in partial liquidation and ruled that the loss deduction was properly, disallowed under \u00a7 267 of the 1954 Code. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-20\">The issues before us have been narrowed somewhat. The government has conceded that the payment received by the taxpayer from the corporation escapes dividend tax treatment as a distribution under \u00a7 302(b)(3) of the 1954 Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The taxpayer has conceded that since her two sisters and her two brothers owned the remaining 4000 outstanding shares of stock, the transaction out of which the claimed loss arose was between related taxpayers as defined in \u00a7 267(b) and that the recognition of any loss is governed by \u00a7 267 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-21\">The foundation of the taxpayer\u2019s dispute with the District Director lies in that portion of \u00a7 267 which provides: \u201c(a) Deductions disallowed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-22\">\u201cNo deduction shall be allowed\u2014 \u201c(1) Losses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-23\">\u201cIn respect of losses from sales or exchanges of property <em>(other than losses in cases of distributions in corporate liquidations), </em>directly or indirectly, between persons specified within any one of the paragraphs of subsection (b).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-24\">It is taxpayer\u2019s contention here, as it was below, that the payment to her by the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-25\">\u201c(b) Redemptions treated as exchanges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"au6-dedup-0\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-27\">\u201c(3) Termination of shareholder\u2019s interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-28\">\u201cSubsection (a) shall apply if the redemption is in complete redemption of all of the stock of the corporation owned by the shareholder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>company constituted a \u201cdistribution [s] in corporate liquidation [s]\u201d within the parenthetical exception in \u00a7 267(a)(1) and, therefore, that the loss was deductible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Briefly stated, her first and principal argument for this expansive view of the exception is that partial liquidations as embodied in the phrase \u201cdistributions in corporate liquidations\u201d in \u00a7 267(a) (1) includes all distributions in redemption of stock which are not essentially equivalent to a dividend. On the premise that the history of what the law has been is necessary to the knowledge of what the law is, she turns to the statutes and regulations to find the meaning of the term \u201cpartial liquidation,\u201d and necessarily so, for when the concept of \u201cpartial liquidation\u201d was first brought to light in the Revenue Act of 1924, \u201cit was not a phrase drawn from the common corporate parlance of the day.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The concept of \u201cpartial liquidation\u201d which she urges upon us is drawn from the context of certain provisions in the 1939 Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">She begins by pointing out that \u00a7 115 (i) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the 1939 Code said a \u201cpartial liquidation\u201d includes \u201ca distribution * * * in complete cancellation or redemption of a part of its stock\u201d by a corporation. Section 115(c) <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provided that distributions in partial liquidations were-to be treated as payment in exchange for the stock. In the same section, \u00a7\u25a0 115(g)(1)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> said that if a distribution-was made \u201cin such manner\u201d as to make the redemption \u201cessentially equivalent to-the distribution of a taxable dividend\u201d it should be treated as such to the extent that it represented a distribution of earnings and profits. This is an abbreviated recital of the prior law from which the appellant\u2019s interesting three-step thesis emerges. That is, that the redemption of stock in question would have been considered a partial liquidation under \u00a7 115 of the 1939 Code. Taxpayer-then assumes that it is the definition of partial and complete liquidation under \u00a7; 115 which would have been used to determine whether a distribution to the taxpayer in exchange for her stock was a \u201cdistribution in liquidation\u201d within the exception of \u00a7 24(b)(1)(B) of the 1939' Code, predecessor to \u00a7 267(a)(1) in the 1954 Code. The final link in the argument is that Congress did not intend to-change this theorized result when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>passed the 1954 Code. While the appellant\u2019s assumption may appear to be plausible,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> since nowhere else in the 1939 Code could one find any other definition of liquidation, there is considerable doubt whether \u00a7 115 (i) was carried over to \u00a7 24, enacted ten years later and without any clear indication in legislative history that a cross-reference was intended. In Commissioner v. Estate of Bedford, 325 U.S. 283, at 291-292, 65 S.Ct. 1157, at 1161, 89 L.Ed. 1611 (1945), the Supreme Court rejected a similar contention, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-5\">\u201cRespondent, however, claims that this distribution more nearly has the eifect of a \u2018partial liquidation\u2019 as defined in \u00a7 115 (i). But the classifications of \u00a7 115, which governs \u2018Distributions of Corporations\u2019 apart from reorganizations, were adopted for another purpose. They do not apply to a situation arising within \u00a7 112. The definition of a \u2018partial liquidation\u2019 in \u00a7 115 (i) is specifically limited to use in \u00a7 115\u201d (n. 5 omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Also, if \u00a7 115 (i) were to be lifted into \u00a7 24 without qualification, that would produce the weird result that a distribution in liquidation essentially equivalent to a dividend, which, by virtue of \u00a7 115 (g) (1), would not qualify as a sale or exchange under \u00a7 115(c), would nevertheless be recognized as a loss under \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">Whether or not \u00a7 115 (i) was concerned with \u00a7 115 alone under the 1939 Code, the 1954 Code unmistakably eviscerated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">\n<em>The 195\u00ed Code</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">The 1954 Code divided the relevant portion of \u00a7 115(c) into two parts: \u00a7 302<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in Subchapter C, Part I, entitled \u201cCorporate Distributions\u201d and \u00a7 346<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> coupled with \u00a7 331<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in Part II, entitled \u201cCorporate Liquidations.\u201d It is generally agreed that this division into separate sections was motivated by Congress\u2019 desire to dispel the confusion created by the unsuccessful attempt of the cases arising under the 1939 Code to develop either general conformity or clarifying principles in the taxation of distributions in redemption of corporate stock.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Mc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>Ginty v. Commissioner, 325 F.2d 820 (2d Cir. 1963). See United States v. Carey, 289 F.2d 531 (8th Cir.1961); Friend v. United States, 226 F.Supp. 814 (D.Mass.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">As stated in McGinty v. Commissioner, supra, 325 F.2d at 821, it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-5\">\u201cin an effort to promote greater certainty in the area, [that] Congress made several changes in the comparable provisions under the 1954 Code. Where, under the 1939 Code, changes in both the shareholder\u2019s relation to the corporation and in the scope of the corporation\u2019s activity were held relevant to the question of dividend equivalence, it is clear that under \u00a7 302 of the 1954 Code only the former are relevant. \u2018Corporate contraction\u2019 is to be considered in determining whether a distribution in redemption of stock is a partial liquidation under \u00a7 346\u201d (n. 3 omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">But in connection with the problem in this case, there is some difficulty in determining what effect these changes were to have on the scope of the exception in \u00a7 267, Subchapter B, Part IX of the 1954 Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">It is true that there is nothing in the congressional reports of 1954 to indicate that in revising the treatment of corporate distributions Congress was at all cognizant of the effect on \u00a7 267. Nor does the text of the law or legislative history express any rationale for the exception either to begin with or when the ch\u00e1nge was made in 1954. Yet, even in the absence of a direct cross-reference between \u00a7 267 and \u00a7 346, there are convincing indications that the \u201ccorporate liquidations\u201d exception of \u00a7 267, at least today, is to be limited to corporate liquidations and partial liquidations as defined in \u00a7 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">Under the 1939 Code, the exception in \u00a7 24(b) (1) (B) was phrased, \u201cexcept in the case of distributions in liquidation.\u201d This same phrase constituted the title of \u00a7 115(c), \u201cDistributions in Liquidations,\u201d which extended the benefit of capital gains treatment to both complete and partial liquidations as then defined in \u00a7 115 (i). But the exception in \u00a7 267 (a) now reads, \u201cother than losses in cases of distributions in corporate liquidations.\u201d This terminology parallels the heading Part II of Subchapter C of the 1954 Code which is entitled \u201cCorporate Liquidations\u201d and it is in Part II that \u00a7 346 is found. However, \u00a7 302 has been placed in Part I of Subchapter C, which is entitled \u201cDistributions by Corporations.\u201d Against the aid afforded by this identity of language, there is not the slightest foundation in the 1954 Code for the appellant\u2019s argument that Congress meant that tax authorities should look elsewhere for a different test of corporate liquidation to be applied to family transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-12\">Under \u00a7 267(b) (2) non-recognition of loss depends upon the existence of a family relationship among the stockholders who control the corporation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section 24(a) (6) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 691, the first ancestor of \u00a7 267, was strictly applied by the courts. In McWilliams v. Commissioner, 331 U.S. 694, at 699, 67 S.Ct. 1477, at 1480, 91 L.Ed. 1750, 170 A.L.R. 341 (1947), the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-13\">\u201cSection 24(b) states an absolute prohibition \u2014 not a presumption\u2014 against the allowance of losses on any sales between the members of certain designated groups. The one common characteristic of these groups is that their members, although distinct legal entities, generally have a near-identity of economic interests. It is a fair inference that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>even legally genuine intra-group transfers were not thought to result, usually, in economically genuine realizations of loss, and accordingly that Congress did not deem them to be appropriate occasions for the allowance of deductions\u201d (n. 12 omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">And at 700, 67 S.Ct. at 1481, the Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A00j\">\u201cconclude [d] that the purpose of \u00a7 24(b) was to put an end to the right of taxpayers to choose, by intra-family transfers and other designated devices, their own time for realizing tax losses on investments which, for most practical purposes, are continued uninterrupted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">Ordinarily, the sale of stock is the same as the sale of any other property. Yet, in the case of a total liquidation, there is no difficulty in determining whether or not a loss has been incurred by all of the members of the family who joined the corporation\u2019s venture. This could account for the exception in \u00a7 267(a). But, where the shares of only one family member are redeemed by a family corporation, \u201can economically genuine realization of loss\u201d to the family is somewhat obscured. As a group, they still hold 100% of the outstanding stock and the corporate enterprise may remain intact. If the exception in \u00a7 267 for losses in distributions in corporate liquidations were to be read to include any distribution not equivalent to a dividend which does not result in a complete liquidation, this would hardly constitute \u201can economically genuine realization of loss.\u201d This test cannot be satisfied by anything less than a discontinuance of a proportionate amount of that business enterprise. This can be determined only by the \u201ccorporate contraction\u201d test. In the absence of a \u201ccontraction,\u201d sales of stock to the corporation should be treated no differently than a sale of stock to any other member of the family. A mere disproportionate redemption or a termination of a shareholder\u2019s interest so as to qualify for capital gains treatment under \u00a7 302 is not sufficient.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">Appellant\u2019s second argument is that even if the \u00a7 267 exception is limited to partial liquidations as defined in \u00a7 346, that definition includes all distributions in redemption which are not essentially equivalent to a dividend. This argument differs from her previous one only in that she makes it with reference to the definition of partial liquidation now found in \u00a7 346 of the 1954 Code instead of to the earlier one in \u00a7 115 (i) of the 1939 Code. We were unable to expand the exception in \u00a7 267 to make room for distributions not essentially equivalent to a dividend without regard to the definition of \u201cpartial liquidation\u201d in \u00a7 346. We are equally unable to hold that a distribution not essentially equivalent to a dividend standing alone is a \u201cpartial liquidation\u201d within that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">It is true that \u00a7\u00a7 302 and 346 both contain the phrase \u201cnot equivalent to a dividend.\u201d But a reading of all the legislative history reveals congressional purpose to effect a <em>separation </em>of the two main tests which had formerly been applied to distributions in redemption of stock.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, the fact that the distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>tion received by her was not essentially equivalent to a dividend under \u00a7 302 because it resulted in a complete termination of her interest has no relevance here. Section 346 is plainly designed to go further in its demands. This is made all too clear by the specification in \u00a7 346(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-4\">\u201cThe fact that, with respect to a shareholder, a distribution qualifies under section 302(a) * * * by reason of section 302(b) shall not be taken into account in determining whether the distribution, with respect to such shareholder, is also a distribution in partial liquidation of the corporation.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Taxpayer then takes another stand to argue that in any event contraction is not an absolutely essential element for a distribution to qualify under \u00a7 346. She relies upon the following portion of the Senate report as support for this contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-7\">\u201cSubsection (a) [of \u00a7 346] is intended to provide a definition of partial liquidation which replaces that contained in section 115 (i) of the 1939 Code. <em>Primarily, </em>this definition involves the concept of \u2018corporate contraction\u2019 as developed under existing law.\u201d (S.R.No.1622, 83d Cong. 2d Sess. 262, 3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News 1954, p. 4899.) (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">Had Congress used the word \u201cincludes\u201d in the \u00a7 346 definition of partial liquidation, we would be faced with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(b) of the 1954 Code: \u201cThe terms \u2018includes\u2019 and \u2018including\u2019 when used in a definition contained in this title shall not be deemed to exclude other things otherwise within the meaning of the term defined.\u201d But reading the Senate report in context, the word \u201cprimarily\u201d is not misleading. It was not used to create a larger category of \u201cpartial liquidations,\u201d but to accent a predominant characteristic common to all which come within the statutory definition. It means that other requirements also have to be met, not a non-exclusivity allowing the use of all of the old pre-1954 tests. The requirements in \u00a7 346(a) (2) are not in the disjunctive. Thus, for a distribution to receive tax treatment as a partial liquidation, three requisites must be met: (1) It must not be essentially equivalent to a dividend; (2) It must be in redemption of part of the stock pursuant to a plan; and (3) It must occur within the taxable year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-13\">However, it is urged that the term \u201cpartial liquidation\u201d may include redemp-tions resulting from activities at the corporate level, or prompted by corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>needs, even though not involving a contraction. See Brodsky, Partial Liquidation: Definition of Partial Liquidation and Rules for Determining Termination \u25a0of a Business, 15 Institute on Federal Taxation 539, 552 (1957). Examples suggested of such corporate needs are a corporation\u2019s desire to improve its credit rating or to make stock available to its \u25a0employees. We find it unnecessary to pass upon this contention, for the only non-contraction purpose put forth by the Taxpayer was a statement by her two brothers that they permitted the redemption to enable them alone to dissolve the \u25a0corporation, <em>if they later so desired. </em>Under no theory could this be considered a corporate purpose. This was nothing other than a shareholder purpose, for it merely satisfied the wish of her brothers to gain control of the corporation to carry out their own ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">The only question remaining is whether there was a \u201ccorporate contraction\u201d pursuant to a \u201cplan\u201d under \u00a7 346. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The case was ripe for such disposition. It was not contended that there was a termination of a separate trade or business which would specifically qualify as a partial liquidation under \u00a7 346(b). Nor do we find any call for making a value judgment as to how much \u201ccorporate contraction\u201d is necessary to constitute a partial liquidation under \u00a7 346(a). In determining that there was no genuine issue of fact as to whether there had been a partial liquidation, the court below properly took into account the concept of \u201ccorporate contraction\u201d as developed under existing law by focusing attention on what took place at the corporate level. Nothing substantial was offered to challenge the District Director\u2019s determination that there was no immediately intended contraction of the corporation\u2019s business of producing, harvesting and selling oysters; a sale of certain oyster lands and facilities four years later, on the death of one of the two managing ' brothers, was properly deemed unrelated by the district judge. The purchase price of $128.50 per share was based on the then value of the <em>quick assets </em>of the firm other than inventory, less liabilities.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Nor were any balance sheets or operating statements presented in opposition to the appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">The transaction in question was clearly not a vertical liquidation which chopped off a part of the productive resources of the enterprise. That portion of corporate capital remained intact. It was a horizontal slice off the top of a nest egg of securities accumulated from past earnings and profits which did not in any degree impair the business activities of the enterprise as they had been carried on before.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">Nor, as held by the court below, did anything exist to indicate a \u201cplan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">.

Even before the enactment of any applicable statute, a loss on a transfer by a taxpayer to his controlled corporation was not recognized for tax purposes. Higgins v.

We are importuned to adopt appellant\u2019s interpretation by her plea that the increase in basis to the extent of the loss, which would normally be available to a purchaser from her on a subsequent resale, to reduce future gain as provided in \u00a7 267(d), is not available to the corporation. See \u00a7 1032. The argument is neither pertinent nor meritorious. Until 1954, Congress saw no need to grant any amelioration whatsoever, and apparently her fellow family members were not willing to take advantage of that which was provided by purchasing her shares ' individually rather than through the corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">. The Senate report states: \u201cSuch portion of section 115(c) of the 1939 Code which provides for capital-gains treatment where the redemption does not terminate a part of the business of the corporation is, under your committee\u2019s bill, treated under section 302, or section 301, as the case may be [rather than under \u00a7 346].\u201d S.R.No. 1622, 3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News 1954, p. 4892.

Another significant indication of this separation is the fact that by \u00a7 302(c) (1) the attribution rules of \u00a7 318 are made applicable to distributions received under \u00a7 302, but by no provision are they made applicable to \u00a7 346. This absence of any rules of attribution applicable to \u00a7 346 is understandable. Congress forcibly stressed the concept of corporate contraction in its definition of partial liquidation; and that concept is complete without any reference whatsoever to the corporation\u2019s shareholders. A change in the position of a shareholder with relation to the corporation or the other shareholders is without significance. And maybe this is what was meant by the use of the term \u201cpartial liquidation\u201d when it was first introduced, i.e., the businessman\u2019s concept of the winding up of a part of a business enterprise, and not merely a reduction in the number of shares outstanding. Cf. Farmers Union Corp. v. Commissioner, 300 F.2d 197 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 861, 83 S.Ct. 117, 9 L.Ed.2d 99 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-16\">The taxpayer has argued that it is anomalous to require the distribution to her to pass the attribution rules in \u00a7 267 as well as those in \u00a7 318. We find no such inconsistency. Our present holding merely recognizes that Congress allowed capital gains treatment as opposed to dividend treatment to be given to certain distributions in a closed-corporation transaction, but required different and indeed more stringent attribution tests to be met to allow the recognition of a loss. Indeed, since all of the other shareholders were brothers and sisters of the appellant, she could not run afoul of <em>any </em>of the \u00a7 318 rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">&gt;. Although in excess of the $100 par, this was substantially less than the fair market value of the shares at the time of the deaths of her father and her mother which was the basis she used to compute the loss. Cf. Twining v. Commissioner, 83 F.2d 954 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 299 U.S. 578, 57 S.Ct. 42, 81 L. Ed. 426 (1936).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">. Furthermore, the taxpayer did not deny that profits from the accumulated securities amounted to more than half a million dollars during the decade between 1950 and 1960. It was the proceeds of the sale of some of these securities that were used to effect the redemption, and while it is urged that they had been held as a contingency fund, the following passage from the Senate report on the Tax Code directly rejects that argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-13\">\u201cIt is intended that a genuine contraction of the business as under present law will result in a partial liquidation. * * * However, a distribution of a reserve for expansion is not a partial liquidation.\u201d (3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News 1954, p. 4899.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
