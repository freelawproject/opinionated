Watson, brought suit against Commercial Credit Corporation and several individuals alleging, in somewhat ambiguous but probably sufficient language, false arrest, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution, originating in a criminal conviction in a state court of Louisiana. The district court concluded that the Louisiana statute of prescription<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was applicable and, the prescriptive period of one year having run, the action was barred. A summary judgment for the defendants, appellees here, was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-28\">Whether the claims asserted were founded on the substantive law of Louisiana or under the Federal law, the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>of prescription of Louisiana fixes the time within which the action must be brought. That period, under the Louisiana law, is one year. The time having run before the suit was commenced, it cannot be maintained. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-17\">. \u201cThe following actions are also prescribed by one year:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-29\">\u201cThat * * * resulting from offenses or quasi offenses.\u201d LSA-Civ.Code Art. 3536.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
