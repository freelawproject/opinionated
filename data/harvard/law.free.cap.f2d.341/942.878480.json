The notice of opposition further alleged that for many years prior to July 13, 1960, appellee\u2019s alleged date of first use, appellant had been \u201cengaged in the manufacture, distribution and sale of lubricants of various types\u201d; that by extensive advertising and sales thereunder its above-named marks had become well and favorably known in trade and thus had become well known as valuable symbols of appellant\u2019s business and goodwill and that the registration of \u201cFLUORO GLIDE\u201d as a trademark for a lubricant would damage it by reason of the fact that purchasers and others would be confused as to the source or origin of the goods involved.</p>\n<p id=\"AUN\">Appellee\u2019s answer, filed December 5, 1962, put in issue material allegations of the notice of opposition and in further answer alleged that the phonetic counterpart of the word \u201cGLIDE\u201d in appellee\u2019s mark was to be found in more than 200 United States trademark registrations, many of which covered goods identical or substantially similar to appellant\u2019s goods; that the word could be found in any standard dictionary; that it was being currently used by others to advertise the same or similar products as those of appellee; that common use of \u201cglyde\u201d or \u201cglide,\u201d either alone or in combination with other words, is concurrent with appellant\u2019s use on similar or identical goods; that no confusion had resulted; that the phrase or word could not be exclusively appropriated by appellant and that \u201csuch concurrent use has so conditioned the purchasing public that they do not associate or identify the phrase * * * \u201d as indicating the source of the goods as those of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-21\">Appellee in answer further alleged the existence of special circumstances, attending sale and distribution of the .goods of the parties, relating to method of soliciting business; purpose and nature of the goods; channels of delivery; methods of distribution and the specific purchases of each, and that such circumstances would militate against confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>On May 27, 1963, taking cognizance of the fact that the time had expired for opposer to take testimony-in-ehief or file further documentary proof in support of its opposition, appellee moved for judgment against opposer dismissing the opposition, submitting the matter on the sole issue of likelihood of confusion \u201cwhere registered marks are alleged by the Opposer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The board granted the motion for dismissal under Rule 2.132(b) on the ground that appellant, \u201chaving submitted no evidence other than its aforesaid registration, has failed to sustain its burden of proof herein.\u201d The board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-5\">\u201cSince opposer has filed no evidence herein other than copies of its registrations, the question of likelihood of confusion in trade turns <em>solely </em>upon a consideration of the marks and goods, <em>as shown in </em>the respective application and registrations.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">From the decision of the board, thus limited, holding that there is no likelihood of purchaser confusion, appellant prosecutes this appeal. The board found and held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-7\">\u201cThe goods of both parties involved lubricants which, if sold under the same or similar marks, might be attributed to a single manufacturer. However, applicant\u2019s mark \u2018FLUORO GLYDE\u2019 [GLIDE] and opposer\u2019s marks \u2018RU GLYDE\u2019 and \u2018SIL-GLYDE\u2019 resemble one another only in that they share suffixes which are phonetically the same. This portion, however, is highly suggestive of a product which serves primarily to cause parts of structure to move smoothly and effortlessly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-8\">\u201cIn view thereof and considering that the respective marks in their entfreties are otherwise different in sound, appearance and in connotation, it is concluded that there is no likelihood of purchaser confusion as to the source of the goods upon which they are applied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">Appellant advances the theory of \u201carguable doubt\u201d as to the existence of likelihood of confusion. Where such doubt is found, the issue should be resolved against the newcomer. On the basis of the record before us, we find no basis to justify the application of this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">Appellant admits that the word \u201cglide\u201d is suggestive in a trademark sense when used in association with a lubricant. The board so found, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">In our opinion the dissimilarities of the competing marks heavily outweigh the similarities, especially in sound and appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-13\">Appellee takes the position that the record herein discloses an \u201caggravated\u201d case of appeal and that therefore this court should exercise its discretion and award \u201ccosts, disbursements and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d to the appellee. In short, appellee\u2019s position is that the appeal is devoid of merit and is, therefore, frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-14\">We do not agree that, on the record before us, the appellant was not justified in prosecuting its appeal. The record presents a clear-cut issue of likelihood of confusion based upon the registered marks. Appellee\u2019s position is not, therefore, well taken and the request for costs and attorney\u2019s fees is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-15\">On the basis of the record here presented, we find no reversible error in the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in granting appellee\u2019s motion and dismissing the opposition. The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"avp-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b999-22\">.
