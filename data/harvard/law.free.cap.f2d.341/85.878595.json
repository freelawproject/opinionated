No person shall be required to register under this section with respect to a firearm which such person acquired by transfer or importation or which such person made, if provisions of this chapter applied to such transfer, importation, or making, as the case may be, and if the provisions which applied thereto were complied with.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">This language indicates to us that only when an individual is in possession of a firearm which has been made, transferred or imported in violation of the Act is he required to register. Statutory provisions which might be violated as to any particular firearm, as referred to in \u00a7 5841, may include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">(1) 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5811, requiring payment of a tax upon the transfer of a firearm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">(2) 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5812(b), relating to exemptions of certain transfers upon the making of specified disclosures and proof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">(3) 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5813, requiring the affixing of stamps to show the payment of the transfer tax imposed by Section 5811;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">(4) 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5814, relating to the requirements for a transfer of a firearm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">(5) 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5821, imposing a tax on and requiring a disclosure of the making of a firearm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">(6) 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5844, relating to the exportation of firearms; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-13\">(7) 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5846, relating to the administration and enforcement of taxes and assessments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">If any of these applicable provisions has not been complied with, any person in possession of such a firearm must register it pursuant to \u00a7 5841. However registration under \u00a7 5841 does not merely constitute a compliance with that act, but may subject the person to prosecution under \u00a7 5851, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-15\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to receive or possess any firearm which has at any time been transferred in violation of sections 5811, 5812(b), 5813, 5814, 5844, or 5846,. or which has at any time been made in violation of section 5821, or to possess any firearm which has not been registered as required by section-. 5841. Whenever on trial for a violation of this section the defendant is, shown to have or to have had possession of such firearm, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to-authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such possession to the satisfaction of the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-16\">It is apparent that registration is required under \u00a7 5841 only where another section of the Act has not been complied with. Registration would be an admission that another section or other sections of the Act had been violated and. might support a conviction by a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-17\">We agree with the contention of petitioner that the registration requirement of \u00a7 5841 violates the privilege against self-incrimination established by the-fifth amendment to the United States, constitution. Hence he was entitled in-his \u00a7 2255 proceeding to have the judgment against him vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>In arriving at this decision we are in agreement with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Russell v. United States, 306 F.2d 402 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The government argues, uneonclusively we believe, that registration under \u00a7 5841 has never been used as a means of in\u2022criminating a registrant. The government further relies on its version of the history of \u00a7 5841 to refute the affirmation that registration necessarily incriminates the registrant. We cannot subscribe to this theory in view of the plain language which Congress has used.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The government further argues that a person in entirely innocent circumstances may come into possession of a firearm not previously made or transferred in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Act and his registration of a firearm so acquired would entail no incrimination. However we do not think that the fact that there might be cases where registration would not result in incrimination by the registrant is any answer to the contention that one who is required to register might thereby incriminate himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">For these reasons we reverse the order from which this appeal was taken and we vacate the judgment of the district court convicting and sentencing petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Order reversed and judgment vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
