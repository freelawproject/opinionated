This loss resulted from the transfer by Dillard of certain securities it owned to the fiduciary of its employees\u2019 profit-sharing plan in partial satisfaction of an obligatory contribution to the plan based upon 1957 operations. The Commissioner disallowed the loss, relying upon \u00a7\u00a7 267(a) (1) and 267(b) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and assessed an income tax deficiency of $1,-735.65 for the taxpayer for 1958. The Tax Court sustained<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Commissioner\u2019s treatment of the loss, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-15\"> The primary contention of the taxpayer is that the language in \u00a7 267 disallowing losses for tax purposes on transfers of property between \u201c[a] grant- or and a fiduciary of any trust\u201d is applicable only to property transfers between an <em>individual </em>grantor and the fiduciary of a <em>taxable </em>trust created by the grantor. In support of this contention, counsel for the taxpayer has directed our attention to the legislative history of \u00a7 267 and its predecessor sections and the administrative regulations interpreting the statutory language with which we are now concerned. These items were also called to the attention of the Tax Court judge, and his opinion indicates that he carefully considered the arguments advanced in behalf of the taxpayer. However, he rejected the interpretation of the statutory language suggested by the taxpayer. While the matter is not entirely free from doubt, we think the Tax Court construction of the words \u201cgrantor and [trust] fiduciary\u201d is logical and reasonable and in keeping with the general purpose for which \u00a7 267 was enacted. Cf. McWilliams v. Commissioner, 331 U.S. 694, 67 S.Ct. 1477, 91 L.Ed. 1750 (1947); Rev.Rul. 61-163, 1961-2 Cum.Bull. 58. Accordingly, the decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-10\">. \u201cSEC. 237.
