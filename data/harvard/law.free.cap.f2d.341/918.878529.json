Judge Ingraham declined to entertain the motion as one for declaratory judgment, but instead considered it properly as one under \u00a7 2255. However regarded, there is no merit to Coronado\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">His argument is that the evidence against him was obtained by entrapment and was therefore inadmissible under Mapp v. Ohio, 1961, 367 U.S. 643,,81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081. This is but another way of presenting the matter of entrapment, which is a separate and complete defense when made out, but which the jury in this case with ample record basis found to be wanting. It was also passed upon by this Court in affirming the conviction. Coronado v. United States, 5 Cir., 1961, 266 F.2d 719, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 851, 80 S.Ct. 112, 4 L.Ed. 2d 90, and in two prior \u00a7 2255 motions. The novelty here is in linking the defense of entrapment with Mapp v. Ohio, and presenting it in the form of an action for declaratory judgment \u2014 apparently to avoid that part of \u00a7 2255 which permits the district judge to refuse successive motions raising the same issue. Here the complaint is the same as that previously litigated and many times decided in proceedings which met the full requirements of Sanders v. United States, 1963, 373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed. 2d 148, and it is still without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AyE\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
