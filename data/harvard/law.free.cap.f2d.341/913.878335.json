The appeal was ordered submitted on briefs without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-19\">In his petition Appellant sought a determination by the District Court of the validity of the sentence which he received in the state court upon his conviction of the offense of murder in the second degree. Appellant does not question the validity of his conviction, only of the sentence. In our judgment, in order to correct an alleged incorrect sentence Appellant\u2019s remedy is in the court in which he was convicted. No constitutional question is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-22\">The District Court lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition for declaratory judgment. Forsythe v.
