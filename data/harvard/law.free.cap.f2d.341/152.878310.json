The single issue before us is that one upon which the board predicated its decision: does \u201cGLENALEX\u201d so resemble marks used and relied upon by opposer as to be likely, when applied to applicant\u2019s goods, to result in confusion, mistake, or deception?</p>\n<p id=\"b209-20\">Appellant seeks to register \u201cGENA-LEX\u201d on the Principal Register on the basis of two registrations of the same mark in Great Britain, No. 775388 of 14 March 1958 and No. 530198 of 14 March 1932. Appellant registered \u201cGENALEX\u201d under the Act of February 20, 1905, Reg. No. 339,881 of October 27, 1936, for numerous goods in Class 21 and has two registrations thereof on the Principal Register under the Lanham Act, one for various goods in Class 36, Reg. No. 689,906, of December 15, 1959, the other for various goods in Class 21, Reg. No. 693,763, of March 1, 1960. The goods for which it now wishes to register the mark are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoG\">Scientific, nautical, surveying, navigating, photographic, cinematographic, optical, weighing, measuring, measuring and recording, indicating, indicating and recording, metering, telemetering, signalling, checking (supervision) apparatus and instruments; timing devices, calculating and computing apparatus and instruments; parts of all the aforesaid goods; and indicator lamps of all kinds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-21\">Its application is serial No. 71,776, filed March 6, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Jenaer Glaswerk Schott &amp; Gen. opposes registration as the owner of the following registered marks for the following goods, as summarized in the opinion of the board: \u201cJENA GLASS\u201d for graduate bottles, beakers, flasks, retorts, all of glass for laboratory use; test glasses, measuring receptacles, and water gauge glasses; \u201cJENAER NORMAL-GLAS\u201d for glass electric lamps; laboratory glassware; and optical glass, glass tubes, glass rods, glass plates, and glass vessels; and \u201cJENAer SUPRAX GLAS\u201d for electric lamps, namely incandescent lamps, gas discharge lamps, and high intensity lamps; laboratory glassware; and glass tubes, glass rods and glass plates. Opposer is the well-known manufacturer of glass wares, formerly located in the city of Jena, in what is now East Germany, but is now located in Mainz, West Germany.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The geographical origin of opposer\u2019s mark is clear. The current and earlier editions of Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary contain the following entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">Je'na glass (y\u00e1'na). A superior glass made at Jena.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Even if many persons would Americanize the pronunciation of \u201cJena\u201d so as to make it sound like the first portion of the word \u201cgeneral,\u201d we do not believe that this would strip it of its meaning or make it appear, to those likely to purchase the various items of technical glassware to which it has been applied by opposer, to be an arbitrary mark, that is to say, a mark without independent meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">On the other hand, \u201cGENALEX\u201d is clearly an arbitrary mark, not a word or known term in the lang-uage and clearly a concoction for trademark purposes, devoid of independent meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The board, after pointing out that op-poser relies almost entii'ely on its \u201cJENA GLASS\u201d mark, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">\u201cAlthough the marks \u2018GENALEX\u2019 and \u2018JENA GLASS\u2019 may not look alike or have similar derivations, they nevertheless do possess a close similarity in sound and such similarity,, standing alone, is sufficient to preclude registration of applicant\u2019s mark for closely related goods.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">The board appears to have felt that, there was no substantial similarity between the marks except the supposed similarity of sound and we are of the-same view. We disagree with the board, however, that there is \u201cclose similarity in sound\u201d of a kind likely to confuse, deceive, or mislead. On the one hand (looking at \u201cJENA GLASS\u201d), we have-a mark made up of a recognizable geographic name, however it is pronounced, and the common word \u201cglass\u201d. It is bound to sound like what it is- \u2014 two recognizable words \u2014 and to have a corresponding impact. On the other hand,, we have a meaningless concoction, \u201cGEN-ALEX.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">Confusing \u201csimilarity\u201d cannot be predicated on auditory response alone; one must consider the impression on the mind where stimuli of the auditory nerve are registered. We think the mind, even in its thoughtless initial reaction to the marks here involved, would readily distinguish the marks so as not to be confused by their concurrent use. Compare our views as expressed in In re General Electric Co., 304 F.2d 688, 49 CCPA 1186, in which we found no likelihood of confusion from the concurrent use of VULCAN and VULKENE on goods sold to technical users, as is the case here, and Republic Steel Corp. v. M. P. H. Manufacturing Corp., 312 F.2d 940, 50 CCPA 986, where we held TRUSS-SKIN and TRUSCON not likely to confuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">While the board may have laid primary emphasis on the comparison of \u201cJENA GLASS\u201d to \u201cGENALEX,\u201d we do not do so but take into account also, as appellee would have us, the varied trademark uses of \u201cJENA\u201d which it has made in different combinations. We are of the opinion that concurrent use of \u201cJENA\u201d and \u201cGENALEX\u201d on goods of the kind here involved, insofar as there may be overlap, semantic or real<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>istic, would not confuse, mislead, or deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Since we see no likelihood of confusion, and this being the only issue, the de-cisi\u00f3n of the board is <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">There is a question of who shall hear the cost of printing in the record some 26 pages of <em>briefs </em>below which appellee asked to have added to the official transcript. The briefs before us contain arguments which attempt to justify payment of printing costs by both parties. Appellee\u2019s main argument is that appellant\u2019s brief was included for admissions contained in it and that appellee\u2019s briefs were necessary to an evaluation of those admissions. We have found none of these alleged admissions of counsel germane to the single simple issue before us and, as is usually the case, we have not found it useful to have access to briefs below. Appellee will bear the cost of printing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
