The decree, entered in settlement of a suit brought by HSM for trademark infringement, dilution and unfair competition, permanently enjoined Alexander\u2019s from using any \u201ccolorable imitation\u201d of their HSM\u2019s or its own \u201crepresentation of a medieval horse and rider in connection with the sale or offering for sale of any clothing products or wearing apparel.\u201d The present proceeding was commenced by HSM almost one year after Alexander\u2019s adopted a revised mark \u2014 allegedly in violation of the decree \u2014 consisting of a centaur, standing upon its rear legs and carrying a sword and shield. Holding that use of the revised mark did not violate the terms of the injunctive decree, the District Court denied the requested relief. We affirm:</p>\n<p id=\"b158-16\">A civil contempt order will not issue unless there is \u201cclear and convincing\u201d proof of violation of a court decree; a bare preponderance of the evidence will not suffice. Stringfellow v. Haines, 309 F.2d 910, 912 (2 Cir. 1962). Moreover, consent decrees \u201care to be read within their four corners, and especially so,\u201d one court aptly remarked, \u201cbecause they represent the agreement of the parties, and not the independent examination of the subject-matter by the court.\u201d American Radium Co. v. Hipp. Didisheim, Inc., 279 F. 601, 603 (S.D.N.Y. 1921), aff\u2019d, 279 F. 1016 (2 Cir. 1922) ; see also Artvale, Inc. v. Rugby Fabrics Corp., 303 F.2d 283 (2 Cir. 1962). Applying these standards, we do not believe the revised centaur mark colorably imitates the original, for we are not persuaded on the record before us that the two convey the same general impression in a manner likely to confuse the consuming public. See Plough, Inc. v. Kreis Laboratories, 314 F.2d 635 (9 Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>1963); Star Bedding Co. v. Englander Co., 239 F.2d 537 (8 Cir. 1957). In the absence of clear and convincing proof of a violation of this consent decree, drafted in such broad terms and encompassing not only suits and coats but all \u201cwearing apparel,\u201d the harsh remedy of civil contempt was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
