Kiekhaefer v. Willys-Overland Motors, Inc., Etc., 236 F.2d 423, 43 CCPA 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">The board apparently regarded Power-matics to be the prior user, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-12\">\u201cIn this connection, the junior party has offered the testimony of the president of its corporation and a considerable amount of documentary exhibits from which it is deemed conclusively to appear that the junior party continuously used the mark \u2018PANELUME\u2019 or the phonetic equivalent thereof \u2018PAN-ELUM\u2019 for insulated aluminum building panels from as early as December 1959 to some indefinite time in November 1960. <em>* </em>* * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">However, it noted that the business of Powermatics had been \u201cdormant\u201d since November 1960 when its physical assets were sold to satisfy a government lien, and further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-16\">\u201cThe junior party\u2019s president has testified that he is presently in the employ of the Panelume Corporation of America, a stranger to this proceeding, which is said to be manufacturing aluminum paneling under the mark \u2018PANELUME\u2019; that he supervises the manufacture of the product; and that he has a verbal agreement \u2018with this gentleman very shortly that I will resume under the name Powermatics, and he will distribute this product for me.\u2019 There is, however, nothing in the instant record to show that the Panelume Corporation of America is using the mark under a license agreement with the junior party, as distinguished from its president, and, so far as can be ascertained herein, the use made of the mark by such third person has been in its own behalf rather than in behalf of the junior party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-17\">The board concluded that \u201cthe senior party\u2019s rights in the mark here involved are superior to those of the junior party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-18\">While Globe agrees with the board\u2019s reason for awarding priority, it urges that we also consider the propriety of the board\u2019s ruling that appellant had continuously used \u201cPANELUME\u201d or \u201cPAN-ELUM\u201d from December 1959 to some time in November 1960. As the winning party below, it is entitled to raise that issue for reasons similar to those set out in Klemperer v. Price, 271 F.2d 743, 47 CCPA 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>From our evaluation of the record we conclude that the board erred in finding that Powermatics has established priority of use.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\"> Powermatics, as junior party, has the burden of proving that it is entitled to the registration it seeks and, as against a registered mark, doubts are to be resolved against it. Brewster-Ideal Chocolate Co. v. Dairy Maid Confectionary Co., 62 F.2d 844, 20 CCPA 848; B. R. Baker Company v. Lebow Brothers, 150 F.2d 580, 32 CCPA 1206. Powermatics must show that, at the time Globe filed, Powermatics was already in a position to register its mark, had it chosen to do so, and that it would have been able to state in its application \u201cthat the mark is in use in commerce,\u201d as required by section 1 of the Trademark Act of 1946. West Disinfecting Co. v. Samuel A. Onorato, 242 F.2d 197, 44 CCPA 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The following testimony of Power-matics\u2019 president on direct examination is pertinent to the issue of priority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">\u201cQ26. And to your recollection, when is the first time that you used this mark? A. To my recollection, it was about the first week in December or possibly the second week in December, 1959.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">\u201cQ27. And would you describe how yeu used this mark? A. Yes. We did various forms of advertising, particularly in The New York Sunday News, where we would have the trade name, the name Panelume [Pan-elum?], I should say, written right across in big letters in the newspaper, and had certain stickers made around that time, where most of the panels that went on [out?] would have stickers on with the name Panelume [Pan-elum?].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ***** \u201cQ40. Did you actually ship goods * * * in response to that ad? A. Yes, we did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-14\">\u201cQ41. Were the goods marked? A. <em>I can\u2019t say, </em>to my recollection, <em>whether they were or not. </em>They were <em>supposed </em>to be, <em>but J didn\u2019t have all the control in the factory, whether they did or not.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-15\">\u201cQ42. Was it the standard practice to mark the goods. A. Yes. They were instructed so to label all the goods. But sometimes they might have missed. I can\u2019t say for sure if they did on every one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-16\">\u201cQ43. Do you, to your recollection, recall the shipping of any panels with the name Panelume [Pan-elum?] in response to this ad? A. To my recollection, I can\u2019t say for sure but if it was in the month of December they [there] had to be panels going out with the name Panelume [Pan-elum?] on them. I just don\u2019t know which ones. * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-18\">\u201cQ48. And when did you first ship goods in interstate commerce with the spelling Panelume ? A. To my recollection, <em>it would probably have been February of 1960 or possibly early March, 1960.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-19\">\u201cQ49. When you changed over from the previous form ? A. Yes. *****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-21\">\u201cQ56. And was it your normal practice to ship panels in response to such orders with the mark Panel-ume on them? A. Yes. It was normal practice to ship anything that went out with our names on it. * * * * * * \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-23\">On cross-examination, the witness testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-24\">\u201cXQ112. Did you also use gummed labels for shipping or any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>thing of that character? A. Gummed labels?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">\u201cXQ113. Yes. A. Well, we would \u2014 if we ship anything, it would have a \u2014 that we would type. We would type a gummed label, a blank gummed label. We would type the person\u2019s name that it came from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">\u201cXQ114. <em>But that did not carry the Panelume trade mark. </em>A. <em>Not to my </em>\u2014 I <em>can\u2019t say for sure if it did or not. I can\u2019t say for sure. </em>* * -x- * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">\u201cXQ156. Have you ever had any labels bearing the Panelume trade mark other than the label like that one, which was furnished to the Patent Office with the application? * * * A. <em>I don\u2019t recall if I did or I didn\u2019t.\u201d </em>[All emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">While oral testimony, if sufficiently probative, is normally satisfactory to establish priority of use in a trademark proceeding, we do not find the testimony and corroborative exhibits in the record before us to discharge Powermatics\u2019 burden in that regard. Thus, the testimony of the witness that Powermatics \u201chad certain stickers made around that time\u201d (December 1959), and that most of the panels that went out \u201cwould have stickers on\u201d with the name \u201cPANELUME\u201d or \u201cPAN-ELUM,\u201d must be considered in light of his later testimony that \u201cI don\u2019t recall if I did or I didn\u2019t\u201d ever have labels bearing the \u201cPANELUME\u201d mark other than the ones furnished the Patent Office with the application. The only corroborative exhibit produced to show the purchase of such labels is an invoice dated June 24, 1960, several months after Globe\u2019s filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">Although the witness testified that it apparently was standard practice to mark the goods, he did not state that he personally observed the mark applied to any of the goods, nor could he recall for sure the shipping of any panels marked with either \u201cPANELUME\u201d or \u201cPAN-ELUM\u201d in response to the newspaper ad. When queried if the goods were marked, he answered \u201cI can\u2019t say, to my recollection, whether they were or not.\u201d The later, more positive statement that the time when goods were first shipped in interstate commerce with the spelling \u201cPANELUME\u201d \u201cwould probably have been February of 1960 or possibly early March, 1960,\u201d fails to establish a date of use as early as February 18, 1960. We note that the witness is testifying only two years after the events in issue transpired. We agree with appellee that the testimony, characterized as it is by inconsistencies, contradictions and uncertainties, leaves considerable doubt whether Powermatics used either \u201cPANEL-UME\u201d or \u201cPAN-ELUM\u201d as a trademark prior to appellee\u2019s filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\"> In addition to the newspaper ad and label invoice, Powermatics introduced other documentary exhibits, among which are an installation contract dated December 18, 1959, and a letter of complaint from a customer dated February 25, 1960, each mentioning the term \u201cPanelum,\u201d and several billing invoices from an advertising agency dated December 1959, and January 1960, but none mentioning the contested trademark. Those exhibits fail to establish that \u201cPAN-ELUM,\u201d \u201cPANELUM\u201d or \u201cPANELUME\u201d were used on the goods before February 18, 1960, it being well settled that mere advertising and documentary use of a notation apart from the goods do not constitute technical trademark use. Sears, Roebuck and Co. v. Old Colony Shoe Co., 82 F.2d 709, 23 CCPA 1039; B. R. Baker Co. v. Lebow Brothers, supra; Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Minnesota Linseed Oil Paint Co., 229 F.2d 448, 43 CCPA 746. Nor do we find those exhibits sufficient to serve as satisfactory corroborative evidence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">On this record, we are far from convinced that Powermatics has discharged its burden of proving priority of use, thus it is unnecessary to consider the question of \u201cdormancy\u201d or abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-13\">.
