Thereafter the trial court entered an order realigning Altex as a plaintiff and dismissing Palmer as a plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-15\">There was no justification for eliminating Palmer, the stockholder, who had commenced the action, merely because the corporation belatedly sought to join in his action. Cf. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Jenkins, 7 F.R.D. 197, S.D.N.Y.1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-16\">There is no merit in appellees\u2019 motion that since Altex has now filed for bankruptcy, the ease should be stayed until the trustee determines whether he wishes to continue the suit in Altex\u2019s behalf. Meyer v. Fleming, 327 U.S. 161, 66 S.Ct. 382, 90 L.Ed. 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-18\">The order of dismissal was error. It is, therefore, reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
