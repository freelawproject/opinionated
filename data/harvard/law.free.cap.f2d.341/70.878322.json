McDonnell, for which he received $150. The statutory mandatory minimum sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment was imposed, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(b). Having failed to persuade the trial judge by his testimony that he had not sold or delivered any drugs whatever to the agent, Winfield now claims for the first time on this appeal that if he did participate in the transaction, it was as a procuring agent rather than a seller, and moreover, that he was entrapped. We believe, however, that on the record before us these defenses are of no avail and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-21\">The experienced trial judge obviously did not credit Winfield\u2019s unequivocal denial of any dealings with the Government agent and so a brief summary of the evidence upon which the conviction rests will suffice. On the evening of May 13, 1963, while standing on 116th Street in Manhattan, an informant in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>troduced Agent McDonnell to the appellant. Without further ado, the informant asked, \u201cCan you do that thing for us ?\u201d Winfield replied that he would first have to make a telephone call and advised the agent and informant to meet him in the Hollywood Bar, across the street, in a few minutes. At the appointed rendezvous, McDonnell asked Win-field \u201cwhat he could get\u201d and was told, \u201canything you want.\u201d The agent said he had $150 and would like \u201cto get\u201d heroin, to which Winfield replied, without hesitation \u201cI can get you three-quarters of an ounce of something good.\u201d McDonnell paid in advance, after Win-field handed him a slip of paper noting his telephone number and address.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Within thirty minutes all the participants met close to Winfield\u2019s residence and waited vainly in a parked automobile for appellant\u2019s \u201cconnection\u201d to arrive. Almost five hours later, McDonnell, the informant and appellant parted company, after Winfield agreed to contact the agent when he received the narcotics. In a telephone conversation the next day with McDonnell, Winfield said \u201chis guy * * * had left him the wrong package\u201d \u2014 cocaine instead of heroin\u2014 which McDonnell agreed, nevertheless, to purchase. He arrived by car at Win-field\u2019s residence shortly thereafter, accompanied by the informant. Winfield entered the car which drove off and as they approached 139th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue he gave the agent a tin-foil package containing cocaine, suggesting that he \u201ctry it and let me know how you like it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Careful scrutiny of the totality of facts in each case is required to determine whether a defendant, charged with violating Section 4705(a), acted as a seller or as a procuring agent. Although deliberative examination of the precedents is helpful, we can hardly expect to be provided with all-purpose, ever-applicable standards, for these cases cannot be pigeonholed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">We learn from United States v. Sawyer, 210 F.2d 169 (3 Cir.1954), that the procuring agent-seller distinction is important because there can be no \u00a7 4705' (a) violation if the evidence establishes that a federal agent asked the defendant to buy drugs for him and the defendant then purchased them from a third person with whom he was not associated in selling. Sawyer\u2019s precise holding was that a conviction must be reversed where a judge, when requested by the defendant to do so, fails to explain to the jury \u201cthe difference in fact and in law between dealing with a purchaser as seller and acting for him as a procuring agent.\u201d See also Kelley v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 122, 275 F. 2d 10 (1960). Of course, this holding does not, without more, require reversal where as here the trial was to a judge alone for, as the court acknowledged, the distinction would be \u201cobvious to a lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">It is apparent, nonetheless, that when Sawyer is adapted to this case the relationship between Winfield and the ultimate seller assumes critical significance. But, in considering the evidence and the inferences to be drawn from it, we must as appellate judges view it in a light most favorable to the Government. United States v. Robbins, 340 F.2d 684 (2 Cir. Jan. 12, 1965); United States v. Tutino, 269 F.2d 488, 490 (2 Cir.1959) ; United States v. Brown, 236 F.2d 403, 405 (2 Cir.1956). With this in mind, we note that here, unlike Adams v. United States, 220 F.2d 297 (5 Cir. 1955), the evidence and the inferences which the trial judge could reasonably draw indicate that Winfield had been previously associated with his connection in selling narcotics. As an illustration, in apologizing for his supplier\u2019s delay, the appellant explained that he had never been late before. And when the agent expressed concern about the money paid in advance, Winfield sought to allay his fears by stating that the sum meant nothing to the connection with whom he had been \u201cdoing business\u201d for \u201cquite some time.\u201d When the total absence of any evidence tending to support the procuring agent theory is contrasted with this proof of prior dealing, we hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>it was reasonable for the trial judge to infer that Winfield was associated with his supplier in selling narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">It is true that the Government in United States v. Valdes, 229 F.2d 145 (2 Cir. 1956), made a stronger showing of previous association and this Court therefore found it unnecessary to express an opinion on the applicability of the Sawyer-Adams principle. In Valdes, the defendant had been in the narcotics traffic for ten years and apparently had his own supply of heroin. Appellant, nevertheless, takes an overly casuistical view of the law in suggesting that the distinguishing line is whether the Government agent said he wanted to \u201cbuy\u201d rather than \u201cget\u201d narcotics.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Equally without merit is the entrapment defense, which in this case is inextricably linked with the procuring agent theory and which falls with the evidence of prior dealings between Win-field and his connection. According to the Supreme Court\u2019s exegesis in Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958), the defendant is required to show that he was induced by the creative activity of Government officers to commit an offense he would otherwise not have attempted. But \u201cthere was here,\u201d as Judge Smith noted in another case, \u201cno more than affording an opportunity to one already disposed and willing to commit the crime.\u201d United States v. Carter, 320 F.2d 1, 3 (2 Cir.1963). Winfield never expressed reluctance to sell narcotics to the Government agent, cf. Sherman, supra; instead, he assured the agent that the quality of the drugs was \u201cgood\u201d and gave his address and telephone number to facilitate delivery. Indeed, he indicated his proclivity, if not anxiety, to continue selling to McDonnell by asking the agent to \u201clet me know how you like\u201d the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The court has been greatly aided by the able efforts of Glen W. Watkins, Esq., appellant\u2019s assigned counsel, and wishes to take this opportunity to express its appreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\">. Henderson v. United States, 261 F.2d 909 (5 Cir. 1959), upon which the appellant relies, is easily distinguishable. There the Government agent \u201csolicited, indeed implored\u201d the defendant\u2019s aid and even told her where to buy the drugs. Both Adams and Henderson may be distinguished on the further ground that they involved situations where Government agents resorted to appeals to friendship and sympathy in persuading the defendants to purchase drugs to satisfy the agents\u2019 supposed personal cravings. Hero, on the other hand, Winfield agreed to furnish McDonnell, a total stranger, with narcotics without hesitation soon after they were introduced. And he delivered the cocaine even though the agent had indicated it was not for personal use but was for \u201csome of my people\u201d who bad been \u201casking for it.\u201d This distinction is relevant because a comparison of tile defendant\u2019s relationships with the buyer and the ultimate seller bears on determining which of the two he was aiding and abetting. Cf. United States v. Moses, 220 F.2d 166, 168 (3 Cir. 1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
