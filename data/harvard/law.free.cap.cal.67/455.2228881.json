In connection with this issue, it was shown by the plaintiff that a hill of sale of certain personal property was given by the father to the son at the time of the alleged conveyance from him to his son, and that a second hill of sale of the same property was given by the son to the father at the time of the deed of conveyance sought to be cancelled, and that these two bills of sale were so intimately connected with the conveyances as to form substantially parts of the same transaction. <em>Held, </em>that statements by the son at the time as to the consideration for the first hill of sale were admissible on behalf of the defendant.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b487-7\">Appeal from an order of the Superior Court of Lassen County refusing a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-8\">The facts are stated in the head-note and opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-9\"><em>Hart &amp; White, C.

A. Smith\u2019s testimony relative to statements made by James H. Harris as to the consideration of the first bill of sale. And objection was also made by him to certain questions on this same subject, propounded by defendant\u2019s counsel to Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">This motion to strike out, as also the objections to the questions, were\" sustained by the court, and excepted to by the defendant, and are assigned as errors in his eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth specifications thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Under the issue above stated, and the evidence as then before the court, a full and fair investigation of the matter was proper, and to that end all of the evidence given by and offered from Smith was pertinent, and the court erred in striking out any part thereof, and in not permitting him to make responsive answers to the questions specified in their entirety. And it should have considered such answers in rendering judgment in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">It was proposed to impeach the witness McKissick by the evidence offered of the witness Mrs. Shinn. That evidence should have been admitted. The foundation for it was sufficiently laid; and the questions asked and proposed to be asked Mrs. Shinn, with the above-mentioned object in view, were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The order of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Searls, C., and Belcher, C. C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">The Court. For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the order is reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
