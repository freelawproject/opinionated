He alleged an unlawful entry upon the same by the defendant, and his own ouster therefrom, claimed restitution of the premises, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>damages for its withholding, and for rents, issues, and profits. The defendant answered denying the allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">And further answering, averred himself to be the owner of the premises and entitled to the possession thereof; alleged a contract by which the plaintiff became his tenant, and claiming thereunder rent for the use and occupation, prayed judgment for the same in the sum of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The plaintiff on the 27th of May, 1880, moved the court to dismiss \u201cthis action without prejudice.\u201d The court refused to dismiss the action. Judgment was afterward rendered in favor of the defendant for the amount claimed. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial was overruled, and from the order made therein and the judgment he appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Respondent claims the appeal should be dismissed, because notice of intention to move for a new trial was not filed in time, under section 659 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">\u2022 Twelve days had elapsed from that on which the decision in ' the case was made, before the filing of that notice.. But nowhere in the record does it appear that any notice of the decision in the case was ever served on the plaintiff or his attorney. And no objection was made in the court below, by the defendant, to the settlement of the statement on said motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The defendant pleading, averring title in himself, and the attornment of the plaintiff as his tenant, and praying for judgment of $1,000, for his use and occupation of the premises, was nowhere therein \u201c denominated a counter-claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">This should have been done to made it effective as such.

C., and Searls, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The Court.
