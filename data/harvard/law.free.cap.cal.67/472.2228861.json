(Freeman on Judgments, \u00a7 606; <em>Michaels </em>v. <em>Post, </em>21 Wall. 398; <em>Shawhan </em>v. <em>Wherritt, 7 </em>How. 643; <em>Pennoyer </em>v. <em>Neff, </em>95 U.

S. 723, the Supreme Court of the United States, Avliile affirming personal service <em>to </em>be necessary in that case, distinctly stated that the principle there contended for did not affect cases \u201c Avhere the object of the action is to reach and dispose of property in the State,\u201d and said \u201c such service,\u201d meaning that by publication, \u201c may ansAver in all proceedings Avhich are substantially <em>in rem.\u201d </em>And this ruling has been folloAved by this court, in <em>Belcher </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>53 Cal. 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">An adjudication of a debtor to be an involuntary insolvent is like a decree of the same nature under the bankrupt Iuav above mentioned, and may properly be considered as <em>in rem </em>as regards the status of such debtor; and publication of the notice required by section 10, Act of 1880, is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">The debtor\u2019s status being thus legally fixed, the right to recover and distribute his property and rights in action, etc., accrues to the assignee, and he may prosecute actions against and have recovery from parties under said act in the same manner as if personal service prior to the order adjudicating his status had been had on the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">There is no error shown by the record, and the judgment and order denying a neAV trial should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">Searls, C., and Belcher, C. C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">The Court. For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
