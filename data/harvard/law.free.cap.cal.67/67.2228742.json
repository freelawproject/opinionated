The plaintiff claimed title under a United States patent issued to it in 1875, in pursuance of the Act of Congress of July 27, 1866, and resolution of June 28,1870. The defendants claimed under a patent from the State of California for swamp and overflowed lands, dated and issued in 1868. The land in controversy was and always had been swamp and overflowed land, within the meaning of the Act of Congress of September 28, 1850.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-11\"><em>A. S. Kittridge, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-12\">The land in controversy, being swamp and overflowed, was exempt from the operation of plaintiff\u2019s patent. The government officials had no authority to convey the same, consequently as to such lands the patent was void and open to collateral attack. <em>(St. Louis S. &amp; R. Co. </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>104 U. S. 636; <em>McLaughlin v. Powell, </em>50 Cal. 64; <em>Carr v. Quigley, </em>57 Cal. 394; <em>McLaughlin v. Heid, </em>63 Cal. 208; <em>Kile v. Tubbs, </em>23 Cal. 441; <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Fassett, </em>51 Cal. 12.) The Act of Congress of September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>28, 1850, was a present grant of all swamp and overflowed land within the States to the State, and thereby conveyed to it the whole beneficial estate in them to the exclusion of the United States. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>26 Cal. 336; <em>Kernan </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>27 Cal. 87; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>29 Cal. 317; <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>58 Cal. 533; <em>Kile </em>v. <em>Tubbs, </em>59 Cal. 191.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-4\"><em>Wright &amp; Cormac, </em>and <em>John A. Wright, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-5\">The patent to plaintiff could not be collaterally impeached by evidence that the land was swamp and overflowed. <em>(French </em>v. <em>Fyan, </em>93 U.

In the case at bar it was admitted by the respective parties that over one half of each governmental subdivision of the land in controversy was and always has been swamp and overflowed land, and thereby rendered unfit for cultivation. The case of <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Held </em>is binding on us, and on the authority of that case we must reverse the judgment and order of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Judgment and order reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">McKinstry, J., concurred in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
