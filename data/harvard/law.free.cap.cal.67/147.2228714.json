(\u00a7 1496, Code Civ. Proc.) This clause is inserted only to enable the claimant to bring his action after the lapse of the tenth day if he so elect, on the occurrence of such neglect or refusal. But the period in which the action is barred does not commence to run in any event until after the actual rejection of the claim by an indorsement to that effect. It does not appear from the complaint that the claim has ever been actually rejected. We therefore think the action was commenced in time though it was brought more than three months after the <em>deemed rejection.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">It follows from these views that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the complaint, and the judgment must be reversed and cause remanded to the Superior Court of Sonoma County with a direction to that court to overrule the demurrer, and for such other proceedings as may be in conformity with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">Sharpstein, J., and Myrick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
