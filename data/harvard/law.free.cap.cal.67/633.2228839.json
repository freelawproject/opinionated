In this we think the court was in error. There is nothing in the language of the act indicating such intention, and that the legislature in enacting it had in mind the justices of the peace elected at the general State election of 1879, of which the plaintiff was one, is shown by section 110, which reads: \u201cThe term of office of justices of the peace shall be two years from the 1st day of January next succeeding their election; <em>provided, </em>that all justices of the peace elected at the general State election of 1879 shall go out of office at the end of one year from the 1st day of January, 1880.\u201d In our opinion, the provisions of the Act of April 1, 1880, applied, from its taking effect, as well to such justices of the peace elected at the general election in 1879 as to those elected subsequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Judgment reversed and cause remanded with directions to the Court below to overrule the demurrer to the complaint,</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
