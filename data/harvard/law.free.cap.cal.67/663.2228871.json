The plea is that plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is barred by sections 315, 316, 318, and 332 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The finding is as broad and specific as the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-19\">The defendant Dameron moved for a nonsuit on the ground fhat there was no evidence that he was in possession of the demanded premises when the suit was brought, or at any time.

It has not been shown to our satisfaction that the Mexican government had no power to make the grant, even if it be conceded that the existence of such power was not determined by the adjudication referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">.Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Ross, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
