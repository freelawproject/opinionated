For lack of time we cannot enter into a full discussion in this judgment of those reasons. As the time for performing the duty is rapidly passing, it is of more immediate importance to know the duty than its reasons. Other cases are before us involving some of the questions here concerned; and in those cases we shall give our views more at length.

Independent of that question there is but little in the objections urged on behalf of respondent; no matter appears to us which renders it impossible for him to comply with the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">We are of opinion that the amendment referred to_was constitutionally adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">Let the writ issue as prayed for,, forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-16\">Morrison, C.
