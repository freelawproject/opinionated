E. Dixon (the administrator), to render his final account of his administration of said estate; but as said plaintiff is informed, believes, and here charges, said-citation could not, and no other can now, be served upon said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>J. E. Dixon, by reason of the fact that he has departed from, this-State,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The citation as appears from the complaint and findings was never served. A citation must be served in the same manner as a summons. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1709.) A summons may be served on one who' has departed from the State by publication. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 412, 413.) The <em>personal </em>notice mentioned in section 1710 is personal notice as distinguished from notice which, in the first instance, and only, is required to be made by a publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">It may be said that the only consequences of a failure of an administrator to account, when cited, are that he may be attached or removed from office. But even if it should be conceded that this were so, we could not assume that the administrator would have failed to appear and render an account, had the citation been served. The present action cannot be maintained, because the power of the Probate Court to secure the appearance of the administrator at a settlement, which would have been conclusive of the rights of these defendants, has not been exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">McKee, J., and Ross, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
