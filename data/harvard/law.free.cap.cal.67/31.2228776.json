There is no evidence that the stolen property or any portion of it was ever in the possession of the defendant, or that he knew where it was kept. The evidence is that none of it has ever been discovered since it was first missed. Therefore the statement of the defendant that he found the door open was not made for the purpose of explaining his possession of the stolen property. The most that can be claimed is, that he made it for the purpose of averting suspicion from himself. That he would naturally desire to do, whether guilty or innocent. It is not claimed that his unlocking the door had any connection with the alleged crime. Nor is it claimed that he had not a right to unlock it, or that he had not been furnished with a key for that purpose. He had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>been a servant in the house for a period of twenty-seven months, and seems to have been very much trusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We think that the bare circumstance of his having made a false statement in regard to a matter in no way connected with the crime of which he is accused, insufficient to justify the verdict, and for that reason his motion for a new trial should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded fora new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Myrick, J., and Thornton, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
