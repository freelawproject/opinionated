The demurrer was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">According to Wharton (1 Grim. Law, \u00a7\u00a7 190.-192), the above statement of facts would not be sufficient according to the common-law rules; it was necessary to have stated the acts constituing the attempt. \u201c But,\u201d says Wharton (\u00a7 191, above), \u201c where the legislature has by statute declared a particular act to be indictable, and provided that it shall be enough to describe such act in the statutory terms\u2014when this is done by direction or implication\u2014it is proper for the courts to hold, as has been done, that an indictment charging that the defendant did attempt to feloniously steal from the house of A. B., or to commit a rape on A. B., is good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The statute of this State (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459) defines the crime of burglary, and section 664 declares that \u201c every person who attempts to commit any crime,\u201d etc., is punishable, but does not declare what acts shall constitute an attempt. It has been frequently held by this court sufficient to state the offense charged in the language of the statute. Applying these rules to the information before us, it is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The order is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Superior Court of San Joaquin County, with directions to overrule the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
