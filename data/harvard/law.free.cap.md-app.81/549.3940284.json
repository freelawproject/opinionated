The pertinent facts are set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">On May 2, 1988, Susan R. Nevas, the appellee, received a notice from Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company (Harleysville), the appellant, that her automobile liability insurance would not be renewed by Harleysville when her policy expired. The reason given for the refusal to renew was \u201ctwo at-fault accidents,\u201d one on September 28, 1985 and one on December 10, 1986. The notice stated, \u201cAny operator who has more than one at-fault accident is ineligible for automobile coverages with Harleysville. Harleys[ville] does not have a surcharge plan for operators with more than one at-fault accident. This is based on our safe driver insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>plan.\u201d Nevas protested this decision and was granted a hearing before the Insurance Commissioner pursuant to \u00a7 240AA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>The hearing was held on June 17, 1988, before Hearing Officer Tyrone Press. At this hearing, Nevas argued that she was not at fault in the December 10, 1986 accident and that the claim brought against her by the driver of the other car involved in the accident, John Guay, should not have been paid. Therefore, she contended that she should have been charged with just one at-fault accident and her insurance policy should be renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Nevas testified at the hearing. Giving her version of the 1986 accident in issue, she stated that she came to an intersection, stopped at a stop sign and looked both ways before proceeding. She said her car was struck in the middle of the intersection by another car coming from her left that was driven by Guay at an excessive rate of speed. Nevas was given a traffic citation for failing to yield the right of way. Guay was cited for operating his vehicle at an unreasonable speed. She further related that she reported the accident to Harleysville who informed her that Guay had filed a claim against her. On May 19, 1987, a Harleysville claims adjustor, Tony Doyle, told Nevas that the police report of the accident had just arrived, that it was in Nevas\u2019s favor, and that because of it Harleysville would not pay Guay\u2019s claim. Nevas further testified that she was also told by another Harleysville claims adjustor, Tim Ianuzzi, that the evidence in the police report of Guay\u2019s excessive speed (a 40 foot skid mark in a 25 mile per hour zone) and his traffic citation for unreasonable speed precluded his recovery. lanuzzi told Nevas that Guay\u2019s claim would be denied. On October 23, 1987, she was notified that Harleysville had paid the claim against her on May 22, 1987, three days after she had been told it would not be paid. Less than three months later she received the notice that her insurance would not be renewed because of two \u201cat-fault accidents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Harleysville called two witnesses at the hearing, Doreta Harz and Harold Link. Harz testified that based on data developed by the California Department of Motor Vehicles and Harleysville\u2019s own internal study, Harleysville is unable to maintain a surcharge to encompass the risk produced by drivers with more than one at-fault accident in a three year period. Link, a claim supervisor of Harleysville, testified that Nevas\u2019s file indicated that she was charged with two at-fault accidents and that \u201cin both cases there was full, adequate and detailed investigation by our claims staff. We feel that, beyond a doubt, the insured was liable for the damage which resulted from these accidents and we use that as our'basis for charging the insured with these two accidents.\u201d When Nevas challenged Harleysville\u2019s decision to pay, Link responded that it is not necessary for an insurance company to justify to the Insurance Commissioner its decision to pay a claim: \u201cThe insurance contract indicates that we will settle or defend as we consider appropriate any claim or suit asking for these damages.\u201d Link also testified that he did not supervise the claim, that he did not bring the entire claim file with him to the hearing and that he did not know for certain who decided to pay the claim, but he thought it was Ianuzzi. When pressed by Nevas for the reason Harleysville decided to pay the claim, he responded \u201ca decision was made based on the evidence available to us that we should pay for the damage arising out of this occurrence. That was the reason.\u201d When pressed further, Link said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\">The evidence relied upon by Mr. Ianuzzi were the submissions by both parties and the clear and uncontested evidence that our policyholder failed to yield the right of way by virtue of pulling from (inaudible) into the path of the vehicle which had the right of way. This is an objective fact, it was not contested. The third party<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> indicated that the insured did not make any attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>stop but came through the stop sign and struck the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">When asked why the claim was paid in light of the evidence of contributory negligence on the part of Guay, Link responded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">there was nothing that we found that convincing to rebut a presumption of liability arising from physical acts of the accident. In this case our insured came from the ... traffic control device, was negligent by virtue of statute and the quantum of evidence that was available to us was not sufficient to rebut that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">According to the police report, Guay was given a traffic citation for unreasonable speed and Nevas was given a traffic citation for failure to yield the right of way. The report indicated that the speed limit was 25 miles per hour and that Guay\u2019s automobile left a 40 foot skid mark and Nevas\u2019s a 10 foot skid mark. The reporting officer did not witness the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">In ruling in favor of Harleysville, the hearing examiner found that Nevas\u2019s driving record properly reflected two at-fault accidents and that Harleysville produced sufficient statistical data to show that they were unable to insure drivers with two at fault accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Nevas appealed this decision, and the Circuit Court for Baltimore City reversed. Judge Heller ruled that the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s decision that Nevas had two at-fault accidents was \u201cnot supported by any facts in the record.\u201d The court noted that in order to affirm the Insurance Commissioner Harleysville had to present</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A02\">facts which indicated how they investigated and the reasons they decided to pay the claim and those facts weren\u2019t there. There was a conclusion and the conclusion was something to the effect \u201cwithout doubt she was at fault because the police record indicates she failed to yield the right of way,\u201d but, of course, the police record also indicated the other driver was driving at excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>speed and the police record also indicated skid marks and also the police officer wasn\u2019t an eyewitness ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">While the court found the statistical data presented by Harleysville to be sufficient, there was \u201can absence in the record of how that standard was applied to this individual claimant.\u201d Specifically, the court found that \u201cthere are no facts on this record for this Court to determine how Harleysville made a determination that the December 10, 1986 accident was at fault or chargeable ...\u201d Because \u201cthere must be some basis in the record [to show] how Harleysville reached its decision,\u201d the court reversed the decision and remanded the case to the Insurance Commissioner for further proceedings. Harleysville and the Insurance Commissioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Appellants make the same argument before this court that they did below: that an insurer is under no obligation to present evidence to the Insurance Commissioner of its at-fault determination. Appellants argue that the right of Harleysville to make a unilateral at-fault determination is reserved in the policy it issued to the insured and is wholly insulated from judicial review. The only burden on Harleysville, appellants submit, is to \u201cdemonstrate that a reasonable relationship exists between its underwriting standards and its economic and business purposes.\u201d On the other hand, Nevas argues that in addition to requiring the insurer to show a reasonable relationship between its underwriting standards and its economic and business purposes, the insurer must also show how these standards are applied to the insured. It is the application of these standards to the insured that Nevas argues is lacking in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Two provisions of the Insurance Code are relevant in determining the burden on an insurer in a hearing before the Insurance Commissioner to protest a proposed cancellation or non-renewal. Both \u00a7 234A and \u00a7 240AA limit an insurer\u2019s power to cancel or non-renew an insurance policy, including automobile liability insurance. Under \u00a7 234A, it is unlawful to cancel, renew or refuse to underwrite a policy \u201cbased in whole or in part on race, color, creed, sex, or for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>any arbitrary, capricious or unfairly discriminatory reason.\u201d <em>Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Casualty Co. v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>302 Md. 248, 253-54, 487 A.2d 271 (1985). While originally enacted to prevent discriminatory underwriting, its amendment by Ch. 752 of the Acts of 1974 broadened the scope of the statute \u201cfar beyond\u201d its original purpose. <em>Id. </em>The statute now contains the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\">No insurer, agent or broker may cancel or refuse to underwrite or renew a particular insurance risk or class of risk except by the application of standards which are reasonably related to the insurer\u2019s economic and business purposes. At any hearing to determine whether there has been a violation of this section, the burden of persuasion shall be upon the insurer to demonstrate that the cancellation, or refusal to underwrite or renew is justified under the standards so demonstrated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Recently, this Court, in <em>Crumlish v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>70 Md.App. 182, 190, 520 A.2d 738 (1987), quoting <em>Lumbermen\u2019s, </em>302 Md. at 254, 487 A.2d 271, and the legislative history contained therein, explained that \u00a7 234A as amended \u201cclearly requires that [the insurer] demonstrate objectively \u2018the probability of a direct and substantial adverse effect upon losses or expenses of the insurer in light of the approved rating plan or plans of the insurer then in effect ...\u2019 \u201d (emphasis omitted). This Court went on in <em>Crumlish, </em>70 Md.App. at 190, 520 A.2d 738, to say that at a minimum, \u00a7 234A requires the insurer to produce facts which answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">1. What is the statistical basis for the supposition that an individual with the particular number of chargeable losses within the prescribed period is more likely to have another chargeable loss within the next period than a person with fewer chargeable losses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">2. How valid is any such statistical evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">3. If there is statistical validity to the supposition, what direct and substantial adverse effect would it have upon the insurer\u2019s losses and expenses in light of its current approved rating plan?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>In addition to the substantive limitation on an insurer\u2019s underwriting decisions imposed by \u00a7 234A, \u00a7 240AA prescribes procedures and procedural limitations on those decisions. <em>Lumbermen\u2019s, </em>302 Md. at 255, 487 A.2d 271. Of particular relevance here is subsection (f) of \u00a7 240AA which provides that: \u201c... At the hearing the insurer has the burden of proving its proposed action to be justified, and, in doing so, may rely only upon the reasons set forth in its notice to the insured.\u201d The meaning of the term \u201cjustified\u201d and of subsection (f) of \u00a7 240AA was at issue in <em>Government Employees Ins. v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>273 Md. 467, 330 A.2d 653 (1975), where the Court of Appeals held that under \u00a7 240AA(f) \u201cthe insurer must establish that its assigned reason is an actual one, that is, genuine; and that the facts on which it is based are true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>273 Md. at 483, 330 A.2d 653. That a genuine reason actually exist, the Court held, is a \u201cnecessary implication of the provision [in \u00a7 234A] that a non-renewal not be \u2018for any arbitrary, capricious or unfairly discriminatory reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">It seems clear then that merely presenting the statistical data required by \u00a7 234A and <em>Crumlish </em>is not sufficient where, as here, the insurer\u2019s reason for not renewing the insured\u2019s policy is that insured was deemed by the insurer to have been at fault in an accident. Section 240AA requires that an insurer explain the basis for its conclusion that the insured was at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Judge Heller\u2019s review was limited to an examination of the record for \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to support the decision of the hearing officer, <em>Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Casualty v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>302 Md. 248, 266, 487 A.2d 271 (1985), i.e. \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This standard of review \u201cis narrow in scope and the decision of the administrative agency carries a presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Doctor\u2019s Hosp. v. Maryland Health Resources, </em>65 Md.App. 656, 667, 501 A.2d 1324 (1986). In applying this test, a reviewing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>should not substitute its judgment for the expertise of the agency from which the appeal is taken. <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 513, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978). Cognizant of this standard, Judge Heller found the evidence lacking. Harleysville produced no witnesses who either were involved in making the decision to pay the claim against Nevas or could explain why the claim was paid. The only relevant evidence produced was the police report, which, as Judge Heller pointed out, was written by an officer who was not an eyewitness to the 1986 accident in issue and indicated that the other driver was traveling at an excessive rate of speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">We agree with Judge Heller. Although the scope of substantial evidence review is narrow, it is incumbent upon reviewing courts to \u201cexamine all inferences and factual conclusions drawn by the agency to make sure that they reasonably follow from facts. We must also examine all facts found by an agency to insure that there was evidence to support them.\u201d <em>Doctor\u2019s Hosp. v. Maryland Health Resources, </em>65 Md.App. 656, 667, 501 A.2d 1324 (1986). Harleysville produced no evidence at the hearing to support the agency\u2019s finding that Harleysville was justified in refusing to renew Nevas\u2019s policy because she was at fault in the 1986 accident. Harleysville has the burden of explaining the basis for its payment of the Guay claim, and only if that basis was genuine can its non-renewal be justified. Moreover, until Harleysville provides evidence to support its assigned reason for the proposed non-renewal of Nevas\u2019s policy, there can be no meaningful judicial review of the agency\u2019s conclusion as to whether that proposed non-renewal was arbitrary or capricious. We affirm the ruling of the circuit court, reversing and remanding the case to the Insurance Commissioner for further proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-11\">.

A written notice of cancellation or nonrenewal shall be sent by certified mail. All other notices of action subject to the provisions of this section shall be sent by certificate of mailing. The notice shall be in triplicate, and shall state in clear and specific terms, on a form approved by the Commissioner:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">(1) The proposed action to be taken, including, if the action is an increase in premium or reduction in coverage, the amount of increase and the type of coverage to which it is applicable, or the type of coverage reduced and the extent of the reduction;</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">(2) The proposed effective date of the action;</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">(3) The insurer\u2019s actual reason or reasons for proposing to take such action.

The Commissioner shall, upon receipt of a protest, notify the insurer of the filing of the protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">(e) Stay of proposed <em>action.\u2014A </em>protest duly filed shall stay the proposed action of the insurer pending a final determination by the Commissioner, and the insurer shall maintain in force the same coverage and premium in effect on the day the notice of proposed change was sent until the final determination is made, provided that any lawful premium due or becoming due prior to the determination is paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">(f) Dismissal of protest; hearing on protest.\u2014Based upon the information contained in the notice, the Commissioner shall determine whether the protest has merit and shall either dismiss the protest or disallow the action of the insurer. The Commissioner shall promptly notify the insurer and the insured in writing of his action. Within 30 days after the date of mailing of the Commissioner\u2019s notice of action, the aggrieved party may request a hearing. The Commissioner shall conduct a hearing within a reasonable time after the request and shall give not less than 10 days written notice of the time and place of the hearing.

If the Commissioner finds the proposed action to be unjustified, he shall disallow the action, and may, in addition, order the insurer to pay reasonable counsel fees incurred by the insured for representation at the hearing as he may deem appropriate.
