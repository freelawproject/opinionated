BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b529-28\">Before the Court is a stipulation for Defendant\u2019s release on bond pending sentencing in this criminal case. The intended purpose of this release is to afford Defendant the opportunity to cooperate with the Government. The Court will deny release on bond because (1) Defendant\u2019s detention in this situation is mandatory, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a)(2), and (2) the Court lacks jurisdiction to determine whether any exceptional reasons, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(c), merit the release of Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-29\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b529-30\">A. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a)(2) Controls</p>\n<p id=\"b529-31\">Defendant\u2019s detention pending sentencing is governed by the mandatory de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>tention provisions of \u00a7 3143(a)(2). This section states:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The judicial officer <em>shall </em>order that a person who has been found guilty of an offense in a case described in subpara-graph (A), (B), or (C) of [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f)(1) ] and is awaiting imposition or execution of sentence <em>be detained unless-</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">(A) (i) the judicial officer finds there is a substantial likelihood that a motion for <em>acquittal </em>or <em>new trial </em>will be granted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">(ii) an attorney for the Government has recommended that <em>no sentence of imprisonment </em>be imposed on the person; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">(B) the judicial officer finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to any other person or the community-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a)(2) (emphasis added). Mandatory detention under \u00a7 3143(a)(2) is required whether a defendant was detained or released pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">In this case, \u00a7 3143(a)(2) controls because Defendant has been found guilty of an offense itemized in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f)(l)(A)-(C). Section 3142(f)(1)(B) covers offenses \u201cfor which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment or death.\u201d Section 3142(f)(1)(C) describes, <em>inter alia, </em>offenses \u201cfor which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed in the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 <em>et seq.).\u201d </em>Here, Defendant was found guilty of (i.e., pleaded guilty to) three counts of the Indictment, including Count One: conspiracy to distribute marijuana, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846. These statutory provisions are a part of the Controlled Substances Act, and, as stated in the Presentence Investigation Report, Count One carries a statutory minimum incarceration period of ten years and a maximum of life. Therefore, Defendant was found guilty of \u201can offense for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment,\u201d \u00a7 3142(f)(1)(B), and Defendant was found guilty of \u201can offense for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed in the Controlled Substances Act,\u201d \u00a7 3142(f)(1)(C). Consequently, \u00a7 3143(a)(2) controls this detention determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">B. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a)(2) Requires Detention</p>\n<p id=\"b530-14\">Section 3143(a)(2) does not give the Court discretion to release a defendant unless one of the two exceptions of \u00a7 3143(a)(2)(A) are met. Then, if one of those two exceptions is satisfied, the additional exception of \u00a7 3143(a)(2)(B) must also be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">In this case, the two exceptions of \u00a7 3143(a)(2)(A) are not satisfied. First, there is not \u201ca substantial likelihood that a motion for acquittal or new trial will be granted\u201d due to Defendant\u2019s guilty plea. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a)(2)(A)\u00ae. Second, the Government has failed and refused to recommend \u201cthat no sentence of imprisonment be imposed\u201d on Defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a)(2)(A)\u00ae).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-16\">Since neither of the exceptions in \u00a7 3143(a)(2)(A) are satisfied, the Court need not even consider the exception in \u00a7 3143(a)(2)(B). Furthermore, since the two exceptions of \u00a7 3143(a)(2)(A) are inapplicable in this case, the Court must detain Defendant under the explicit terms of \u00a7 3143(a)(2) (\u201cThe judicial officer <em>shall </em>order that a person <em>... be detained. </em>\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-17\">C. This Court Lacks Jurisdiction to Apply the \u201cExceptional Reasons\u201d Exception of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-18\">Since \u00a7 3143(a)(2) precludes the parties\u2019 requested relief, the parties seek to appeal the Defendant\u2019s mandatory detention un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>der the \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d exception of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 3145(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">An <em>appeal </em>from a release or detention order, or from a decision denying revocation or amendment of such an order, is governed by the provisions of [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] and [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] The <em>appeal </em>shall be determined promptly. A person subject to detention pursuant to section 3143(a)(2) or (b)(2), and who meets the conditions of release set forth in section 3143(a)(1) or (b)(1), may be ordered released, under appropriate conditions, by the judicial officer, if it is clearly shown that there are <em>exceptional reasons </em>why such person\u2019s detention would not be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The parties contend that this Court has the jurisdiction to act under \u00a7 3145(c). Nonetheless, \u201cfederal courts have an independent obligation to investigate and police the boundaries of their own jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Douglas v. E.G. Baldwin &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>150 F.3d 604, 607 (6th Cir.1998). In fulfilling this obligation, the Court has determined that, contrary to the parties\u2019 contention, this Court lacks jurisdiction to issue \u00a7 3145(c) relief; Congress has mandated that the United States Courts of Appeals are the only courts with the jurisdiction to override a \u00a7 3143(a)(2) mandatory detention and order the release of a defendant because of exceptional reasons, pursuant to \u00a7 3145(c). <em>See United States v. Salome, </em>870 F.Supp. 648, 652-53 (W.D.Pa.1994), <em>aff'd without opinion, </em>96 F.3d 1436 (3d Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Nesser, </em>937 F.Supp. 507, 508-09 (W.D.Pa.1996); <em>United States v. Young, </em>No. 01-50035, Docket Entry 200, at 3-5 (E.D.Mich. Nov. 19, 2002) (Gadola, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">There is no binding precedent on this Court on this jurisdictional issue, and the Court finds the following statutory interpretation and holding of <em>Salome </em>to be highly persuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-12\">\n<em>[T]he court finds that the jurisdiction established by \u00a7 3145(c) is appellate jurisdiction, not original jurisdiction to act independently. Accordingly, as this court issued the defendant\u2019s detention order in the first instance, we have no authority pursuant to \u00a7 3145(c) to determine whether there are \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d that make defendant\u2019s detention inappropriate in this case.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-13\">The court makes this ruling notwithstanding our careful consideration of the many circuit court decisions to the contrary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ... As noted by Judge Billings in <em>United States v. Bloomer, </em>791 F.Supp. 100, 102 n. 1 (D.Vt.1992), <em>these circuit court decisions, \u201chowever well-intentioned, reflect a certain circularity of reasoning.\u201d We agree. Furthermore, these decisions ignore certain fundamental principles of statutory interpretation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-14\">First, the plain language of \u00a7 3145(c) compels the conclusion that it is applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>ble only on appeal. The provision is entitled \u201cAppeal from a release or detention order.\u201d The first sentence of the subsection provides: \u201cAn appeal from a release or detention order, ... is governed by the provisions of [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291].\u201d [Section] 1291 authorizes appeals only from final decisions of the district courts. In light of this language, it is illogical to postulate that a district court should apply \u00a7 3145(c) when initially ruling on a release or detention motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">Second, the overall structure of \u00a7 3145 belies the argument that \u00a7 3145(c) should be applied by a district court. Sections 3145(a) and 3145(b) provide for review of the conditions of a release order, or of a detention order, if the order is entered by a magistrate or \u201ca person other than a judge of a court having original jurisdiction over the offense and other than a Federal appellate court.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3145(a) and (b). Review is provided in the court having original jurisdiction over the offense. Because \u00a7 3145(c) provides that appeal from a release or detention order is governed by \u00a7 1291, which authorizes appeals only from final decisions of the district courts, an order entered by someone other than the district court judge must be reviewed by the district judge before appeal can be taken to the court of appeals. If release or detention is ordered initially by the district court, as in this case, \u00a7 3145(c) provides for direct appeal to the courts of appeals. Wright, Miller <em>&amp; </em>Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3918.2 at 439-40 (2d ed.1991).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">Third, there is little support for the argument that the \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d provision of \u00a7 3145(c) should be read in conjunction with those provisions of \u00a7 3143 that outline the general procedures by which a judicial officer determines whether a defendant should be detained or released pending sentence or appeal. If the Congress had intended to invest district courts with the discretion to determine whether \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d existed, this court believes it would have said so in \u00a7 3143. The fact that Congress inserted the \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d language in \u00a7 3145(c) indicates that they intended this discretion to be limited to the judges of the courts of appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">Finally, some courts have suggested that \u00a7 3145(c) is applicable to the district courts simply because the federal appellate courts are not positioned to make factual findings which may [be] required to determine whether \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d exist. We reject this argument. We find support for this position in <em>United States v. Provenzano, </em>605 F.2d 85 (3d Cir.1979). In <em>Provenza-no, </em>the Third Circuit held that a court of appeals has a nondelegable responsibility to make an independent determination of the merits of a bail application pending the appeal of a conviction. The court grounded its ruling upon Fed. R.App. P. 9(b), which states that motions for release or modification of the conditions of bail \u201cshall be determined promptly on such papers, affidavits, and portions of the record as the parties shall present....\u201d In its ruling, the court noted that since Rule 9(b) \u201cpermits consideration by the court of appeals of evidence that may not have been before the trial judge,\u201d independent review by the court of appeals must have been contemplated by Congress. <em>Provenzano, </em>605 F.2d at 93. In view of <em>Provenzano </em>and the mandate of Fed. R.App. P. 9(b), the courts of appeals have the ability, indeed the responsibility, to make independent findings in proceedings arising under the Bail Reform Act. These authorities clearly negate the inference that \u00a7 3145(c) should be ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>plied by the district courts in the first instance because of some perceived inability of the circuit courts to make factual findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\">\n<em>In light of the plain language of \u00a7 3115(c), the overall structure of \u00a7 3115, and the procedures set forth in Fed. R.App. P. 9(b), this court finds that \u00a7 3115(c) does not apply to a district court when it rules on a release or detention motion in the first instance.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhT\"><em>Salome, </em>870 F.Supp. at 652-53 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Recent amendments to Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure provide even greater support for <em>Salome\u2019s </em>fourth argument, which counters the contention, advanced by others and by the parties in this case, that \u00a7 3145(c) should be applicable to the district courts simply because the federal appellate courts are not equipped to make exceptional reasons determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The new Rule 9(a) governs an appeal of an order regarding the release or detention of a criminal defendant before judgment of conviction (i.e., before sentencing, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d)(1)). Rule 9(a)(1)-(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">(1) The district court must state in writing, or orally on the record, the reasons for an order regarding the release or detention of a defendant in a criminal case. A party appealing from the order must file with the court of appeals a copy of the district court\u2019s order and the court\u2019s statement of reasons as soon as practicable after filing the notice of appeal. An appellant who questions the <em>factual basis </em>for the district court\u2019s order must file a transcript of the release proceedings or an explanation of why a transcript was not obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">(2) After reasonable notice to the appel-lee, the court of appeals must promptly <em>determine the appeal on the basis of the papers, affidavits, and parts of the record that the parties present or the court requires. </em>Unless the court so orders, briefs need not be filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Fed. R.App. P. 9(a)(l)-(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">These instructions strongly indicate that Rule 9(a) contemplates the federal appellate courts making exceptional reasons determinations under \u00a7 3145(c). This conclusion is supported by Rule 9(c), which explicitly directs the appellate courts to look to \u00a7 3145(c) in making decisions regarding release. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 9(c). This conclusion is also supported by the advisory committee notes regarding the recent amendments to Rule 9. These notes state that the \u201cbroad\u201d language presently in Rule 9(a) was specifically added because the appellate courts now hear appeals pursuant to \u00a7 3145(c). <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 9(a) advisory committee\u2019s note (1994 amendments). Thus, the contention that \u00a7 3145(c) should be applicable to the district courts simply because the federal appellate courts are not equipped to make an exceptional reasons determination is incorrect. Under Rule 9, the United States Courts of Appeals are more than sufficiently prepared to make exceptional reasons determinations pursuant to \u00a7 3145(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">Additionally, <em>Nesser, </em>which followed <em>Salome, </em>bolstered <em>Salome\u2019s </em>persuasive statutory interpretation by adding the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-13\">[Bjoth sections 3145(a) and (b) contain references to judicial decisionmakers \u201cother than a Federal appellate court.\u201d Section 3145(c) omits this language. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The natural and justifiable conclusion to draw from this structure is that the \u201cother than a Federal appellate court\u201d language is left out of section 3145(c) because Congress was addressing federal appellate courts in that section, and so did not need to separately distinguish them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><em>Nesser, </em>937 F.Supp. at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In summary, the Court finds <em>Salome\u2019s </em>statutory interpretation of \u00a7 3145(c), as amplified by <em>Nesser </em>and the new version of Rule 9, to be highly persuasive and correct, and the Court holds that it lacks jurisdiction to issue relief under \u00a7 3145(c). <em>See </em>870 F.Supp. at 652-53, 937 F.Supp. at 508-09; Fed. R.App. P. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The Court so holds knowing that the weight of authority is to the contrary. Currently, five federal circuit courts have held, in published opinions, that federal district courts do have jurisdiction to issue \u00a7 3145(c) relief. These five circuit opinions, however, are easily distinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In <em>United States v. Carr, </em>the Fifth Circuit reasoned that, because \u00a7 3145(c) refers to \u00a7\u00a7 3143(a)(2) and (b)(2) and because \u00a7 3143 uses the term \u201cjudicial officer\u201d to refer to the individuals who initially order mandatory detentions, \u00a7 3145(c)\u2019s use of the term \u201cjudicial officer\u201d must also refer to individuals initially ordering such mandatory detentions, i.e., individuals at the district court level. <em>See </em>947 F.2d 1239, 1240 (5th Cir.1991). The Fifth Circuit\u2019s conclusion is incorrect. The purpose of \u00a7 3145(c)\u2019s reference to \u00a7 3143 is not to define who the appropriate judicial officer should be; Congress addressed that issue in \u00a7 3145(c)\u2019s clear introductory sentence stating that the appellate provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 govern \u00a7 3145(c) determinations. Rather, the purpose of the reference to \u00a7 3143 is to define which detainees are eligible for \u00a7 3145(c) relief and to set forth the standard for issuing \u00a7 3145(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Similarly, in <em>United States v. Herrera-Soto, </em>the Seventh Circuit held that \u00a7 3145(c)\u2019s term \u201c \u2018judicial officer\u2019 encompasses both lower courts and courts of appeal.\u201d 961 F.2d 645, 647 (7th Cir.1992). This conclusion, like the Fifth Circuit\u2019s conclusion, fails to account for the clear instructions from Congress in \u00a7 3145(c)\u2019s introductory sentence that the appellate provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 govern \u00a7 3145(c) determinations. Furthermore, as to the other three published circuit opinions on the matter, none included an independent statutory analysis. <em>See United States v. DiSomma, </em>951 F.2d 494, 496 (2d Cir.1991) (following <em>Carr); United States v. Jones, </em>979 F.2d 804, 806 (10th Cir.1992) (following Carr, <em>Herrera-Soto DiSomma); United States v. Mostrom, </em>11 F.3d 93, 95 (8th Cir.1993) (following <em>Carr). </em>Therefore, the Court finds the so-called weight<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of these circuit opinions much lighter than a momentary glance at a string cite to all five would otherwise suggest.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>As for the Sixth Circuit, there is a recent opinion, <em>United States v. Cook, </em>holding that federal district courts do have jurisdiction to issue \u00a7 3145(c) relief. 42 Fed.Appx. 803, 2002 WL 1869446, at *1-2 (6th Cir.2002). Nonetheless, <em>Cook </em>is unpublished, and \u201c[i]t is well-established law in this circuit that unpublished cases are not binding precedent.\u201d <em>Bell v. Johnson, </em>308 F.3d 594, 611 (6th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Salamalekis v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>221 F.3d 828, 833 (6th Cir.2000); <em>Cattin v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>955 F.2d 416, 431 n. 14 (6th Cir.1992)). <em>Cook </em>followed the five published circuit opinions on this issue and, like the Seventh Circuit, found \u00a7 3145(c)\u2019s term \u201cjudicial officer\u201d to include federal district court officers. 42 Fed.Appx. 803, 2002 WL 1869446, at *1-2. Again, with due respect, this conclusion runs against the clear instructions from Congress in \u00a7 3145(c)\u2019s opening sentence that the appellate provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 govern \u00a7 3145(c) determinations. Therefore, as with the other circuit opinions, the Court respectfully finds the non-binding <em>Cook </em>opinion to be unpersuasive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Lastly, the Court turns the parties\u2019 policy arguments. The parties argue that forcing them to appeal the detention to the Sixth Circuit will consume too much time and will reduce the benefits of Defendant\u2019s proposed cooperation. The Court is not unsympathetic to this concern. The Court understands the importance of the proposed cooperation, and, given the parties\u2019 stipulation, the Court is willing to accept that exceptional circumstances are present here. However, such policy concerns do not justify overriding the clear jurisdictional instructions of Congress. Moreover, Rule 9(a)(3) provides a mechanism to help alleviate the concern about time delays on appeal. Rule 9(a)(3) states: \u201cThe court of appeals or <em>one of its judges may order the defendant\u2019s release pending the disposition of the appeal.\u201d </em>Fed. RApp. P. 9(a)(3) (emphasis added). Therefore, while the parties are waiting for a panel of the Sixth Circuit to make an exceptional reasons determination under \u00a7 3145(c), the parties could secure Defendant\u2019s release from a single circuit judge. Such relief under Rule 9(a)(3) will undoubtably mitigate the adverse effects of the delay on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The Government further argues that denying \u00a7 3145(c) relief at the district court level will irreparably disrupt the guilty plea process. That is, by requiring parties to seek \u00a7 3145(c) relief at the appellate court level, the Court is creating an incentive for the Government to avoid securing guilty pleas from defendants who could assist the Government with prospective cooperation. The Government further argues that it is generally better to have detained defendants plead guilty before release because it ensures a conviction, reduces the defendant\u2019s incentive to flee, and increases the defendant\u2019s incentive to cooperate. Again, the Court is not unsympathetic to this policy concern. Nevertheless, such a concern does not justify ignoring a congressional mandate to limit exceptional reasons relief to the federal appellate courts. Furthermore, a partial solution to this predicament is for the Government, when it knows that it may want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>to seek a defendant\u2019s release, to still secure the guilty plea but move for the Court to take the plea under advisement. While the plea is under advisement, the defendant is still presumed innocent; and therefore, the mandatory detention provisions of \u00a7 3143(a)(2) would be inapplicable because the defendant would not be \u201cfound guilty\u201d at that pertinent point in time. It follows that, since \u00a7 3143(a)(2) would be inapplicable, the \u00a7 3145(c) jurisdictional concern would not become an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The parties\u2019 final policy argument is that, because this matter is before the Court upon a stipulation of the parties, and not merely a defendant\u2019s motion, the parties\u2019 mutual agreement should not be frustrated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In support of this argument, the parties note that in <em>Salome </em>and <em>Nesser, </em>unlike the situation here, the Government opposed release. <em>See </em>870 F.Supp. at 650, 937 F.Supp. at 507. Be that as it may, the Court cannot disregard the clear instructions of Congress: \u00a7 3143(a)(2) mandates Defendant\u2019s detention, and \u00a7 3145(c) precludes the Court from issuing exceptional reasons relief. Nowhere in \u00a7 3143(a)(2) is there an exception for situations in which the Government stipulates to a defendant\u2019s release. Amending \u00a7 3143(a)(2) to include such an exception may be in order, as may an amendment to \u00a7 3145(c) to include district court jurisdiction. However, this Court is not the legislature. This Court lacks the authority to amend the United States Code. As Justice Scalia has stated: \u201cFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute, which is not to be expanded by judicial decree.\u201d <em>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994) (Scalia, J., for a unanimous Court) (citing <em>Willy v. Coastal Corp., </em>503 U.S. 131, 136-37, 112 S.Ct. 1076, 117 L.Ed.2d 280 (1992); <em>Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., </em>475 U.S. 534, 541, 106 S.Ct. 1326, 89 L.Ed.2d 501 (1986); <em>Am. Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Finn, </em>341 U.S. 6, 71 S.Ct. 534, 95 L.Ed. 702 (1951)).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The instructions of Congress in this matter are unambiguous, unequivocal, and unmistakable. Contrary to the parties\u2019 suggestion, the Court does not find any \u201cwiggle room\u201d in the plain text and clear meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3143(a)(2) and 3145(c). Consequently, the Court is compelled to deny release on bond because (1) Defendant\u2019s detention in this situation is mandatory, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a)(2), and (2) the Court lacks jurisdiction to determine whether any exceptional reasons, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(c), merit the release of Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">ACCORDINGLY, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that release on bond is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, for the reasons stated above, Defendant shall be DETAINED pending sentencing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, because matters in the case have already been sealed by order of the Court, this Opinion and Order shall also be SEALED.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that an appropriate redacted copy of this Opinion and Order shall be prepared and issued to legal publishers for the purposes of publication. This redacted copy shall replace the present case caption with the words \u201cIN RE: SEALED CASE\u201d. This redacted copy also shall omit the case number.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\">.Note that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(b), which allows this Court to review detention orders imposed by a magistrate judge, does not apply in this case because the magistrate judge's detention order only concerned detention pending trial; since Defendant has already pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing, the magistrate judge's detention order no longer has effect. Alternatively, even if \u00a7 3145(b) was somehow applicable to this situation, the Court would still be bound by \u00a7 3143(a)(2), which, as discussed <em>supra, </em>requires mandatory detention in this situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b531-16\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b531-17\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 (appeal of criminal case by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b531-18\">. <em>See infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\">. <em>See also United States v. Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739, 752, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987) (\"The [Bail Reform] Act\u2019s review provisions, \u00a7 3145(c), provide for immediate appellate review of the detention decision.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\">. Given the weakness of these five circuit opinions, the Court is boggled by the inconsistent treatment of this issue in <em>United States v. Burnett, </em>in which another district court within the Sixth Circuit found <em>Salome </em>and <em>Nesser </em>to be \"logical and persuasive\u201d but opted not to follow <em>Salome </em>and <em>Nesser </em>because of the \"great weight\u201d of published circuit opinions from outside of the Sixth Circuit. 76 F.Supp.2d 846, 847-49 (E.D.Tenn.1999). <em>See also United States v. Devinna, </em>5 F.Supp.2d 872, 873 (E.D.Cal.1998) (finding <em>Salome </em>and <em>Nesser </em>to be \"persuasively reasoned\u201d but following the \"overwhelming weight\u201d of the five circuit opinions); <em>United States v. Cantrell, </em>888 F.Supp. 1055, 1057 (D.Nev.1995) (finding <em>Salome </em>\"quite persuasive\u201d but following the \"weight of authority\u201d). <em>Cf. United States v. Rodriguez, </em>50 F.Supp.2d 717, 719 (N.D.Ohio 1999) (ignoring <em>Salome </em>and <em>Nesser </em>and simply following the crowd).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b535-6\">. The Court notes that <em>Cook </em>stated that \"[although the mention of exceptional circumstances appears at the close of a section otherwise devoted to review and appeal, we <em>are not convinced </em>that it is meant to be an instruction limited to the courts of appeals.\u201d 42 Fed.Appx. 803, 2002 WL 1869446, at *1. The Court urges the Sixth Circuit to reconsider its holding in <em>Cook </em>before issuing a published opinion on this \u00a7 3145(c) issue; the Court hopes that a close review of \u00a7 3145(c), Rule 9, <em>Salome, Nesser, </em>and this Opinion will convince the Sixth Circuit that Congress did limit \u00a7 3145(c) determinations to the courts of appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b536-5\">. The Government makes a related argument that the words \"upon motion of the attorney for the Government\u201d within \u00a7 3142(f)(1) (which provides \u00a7 3143(a)(2)'s offense definitions) some how carves out an special exception for cases in which the Government seeks a defendant\u2019s release in the \u00a7 3143(a)(2) context. The Court disagrees. Section 3143(a)(2) cites to \u00a7 3142(f)(l)(A)-(C) only for definitional purposes. Further, \u00a7 3142 only governs, as the Government concedes, release and detention pending trial. The \u00a7 3143(a)(2) situation is a post-trial, pre-sentencing situation. Thus, beyond \u00a7 3142's definitional purpose, it is irrelevant in \u00a7 3143(a)(2) situations such as this one.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
