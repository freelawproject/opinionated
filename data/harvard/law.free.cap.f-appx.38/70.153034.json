They found, <em>inter alia, </em>a loaded revolver hidden under a pillow and a twelve-gauge shotgun hidden between the mattress and the box spring of Fama\u2019s bed. On March 22, 2000, a grand jury indicted Fama for possession of firearms by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Before trial, defense counsel moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the two searches and to exclude as unduly prejudicial the evidence that the guns were found loaded. The district court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-17\">The trial went forward in April 2000. On its final day, one juror advised the court that she needed to attend a funeral the following day. Over Fama\u2019s objection, the court substituted an alternate juror rather than delay jury deliberations. The jury returned a verdict of guilty. The district court sentenced Fama to the maximum term of fifty-one months\u2019 incarceration, denying his motion for a downward departure based on extenuating family circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-18\">Fama first argues that the search warrant applications did not establish probable cause because the supporting affidavits relied in part on anonymous tips. Probable cause exists \u201cwhere \u2018the facts and circumstances ... [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that\u2019 an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175-76, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949) (quoting <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 162, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925)). To decide whether probable cause exists, a judicial officer must examine the totality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the circumstances. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). Anonymous tips suffice to establish probable cause if they are corroborated by independent police work. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>989 F.2d 69, 72-73 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted surveillance of Fama\u2019s apartment based on anonymous tips. They observed and positively identified, by model and license plate number, two vehicles associated with Fama and with a bank robbery in which Fama was a suspect. They also observed a person of Fama\u2019s build get out of one of these vehicles and into the other. Based on this information, the FBI sought a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">We \u201caccord substantial deference to the finding of an issuing judicial officer that probable cause exists,\u201d <em>Wagner, </em>989 F.2d at 72, asking solely \u201cwhether [he] had a <em>substantial basis </em>for the finding of probable cause,\u201d <em>id. </em>(emphasis added; citations omitted). In this case, the anonymous tips, combined with corroborative police work, provided that substantial basis. <em>See Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 241-44, 103 S.Ct. 2317. Moreover, Fama does not allege that the issuing magistrate abandoned his detached and neutral role. Consequently, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the magistrate lacked a substantial basis for his probable-cause determinations, the evidence nonetheless should not have been suppressed because the agents relied in good faith on facially valid warrants issued by a neutral and detached judicial officer. <em>See United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 926, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Second, Fama disputes the sufficiency of the evidence that he constructively possessed the firearms. We review the evidence supporting a jury verdict in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. D 'Amato, </em>39 F.3d 1249, 1256 (2d Cir.1994). A conviction should not be reversed if <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original). Fama argues that the government \u201cfailed to demonstrate that [he] was the only person with access to [the firearms],\u201d or that \u201c[he] and the firearms were [ever] present in the apartment at the same time.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13-14. But the law does not require the government to disprove \u201cevery reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>844 F.2d 916, 925 (2d Cir.1988) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The government introduced ample evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude that he possessed the firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Third, Fama argues that the district court\u2019s substitution of an alternate juror prior to deliberations deprived him of a fair and impartial jury. We review the court\u2019s decision \u201cto replace a juror at any time before the jury retires\u201d for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Purdy, </em>144 F.3d 241, 247 (2d Cir.1998), which we generally will find only if the decision resulted in \u201cbias or prejudice to the defendant,\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The court\u2019s decision to substitute an alternate in order to avoid delaying the jury deliberations resulted in no prejudice to the defendant, and was well within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Cf. United States v. Millar, </em>79 F.3d 338, 342 (2d Cir.1996) (affirming the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a juror whose father died suddenly during the trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Fourth, Fama challenges the government\u2019s introduction of evidence that the firearms found at Fama\u2019s apartment were loaded and operable. We review the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>trict court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>894 F.2d 565, 569 (2d Cir.1990). Fama argues that the district court erred by admitting this alleged \u201cprior bad acts\u201d evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). While the government provided notice of its intent to present evidence of \u201cuncharged misconduct\u201d out of an \u201cabundance of caution,\u201d Appellees Br. at 21, we agree with the government\u2019s position on appeal: that this evidence should not be reviewed under Rule 404(b) because it was not, in fact, uncharged conduct but was rather \u201cinextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Carboni, </em>204 F.3d 39, 44 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Fama\u2019s objection thus can only be that the district court should have excluded the evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 403, i.e., because the prejudicial effect of alerting the jury to the fact that the weapons were loaded and operable outweighed its probative value for proving that Fama, rather than some other party, constructively possessed the firearms found at Fama\u2019s apartment. We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion by resolving this issue in favor of admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Finally, Fama argues that the court erred by failing to depart downwardly based on his family circumstances. A district court\u2019s decision not to depart on this basis is unappealable provided the court understood its discretion to depart. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>98 F.3d 690, 694 (2d Cir.1996). The record leaves no doubt that the court did.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
