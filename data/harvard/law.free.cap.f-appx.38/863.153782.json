Cochran was sentenced to 144 months imprisonment and Gilliard received a sentence of 100 months imprisonment. Both appeal their sentences. Cochran alleges that the district court clearly erred in finding that he was a leader or organizer in the underlying drug offense, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.1(a) (2000), and erred in finding that the base offense level for his violation of \u00a7 1956(h) was 23 under USSG \u00a7 2S1.1(a)(1). Gilliard maintains that the district court erred in finding that two of his prior convictions were not related cases, USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2), comment, (n. 3), and abused its discretion in refusing to depart based on his rehabilitation from drug addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-18\">Between 1992 and 1999, Cochran distributed approximately 32,940 dilaudid tablets worth about $599,980 to James and Larry (Frankie) Endicott and Henry Taylor in Huntington, West Virginia. The dilaudid was then widely redistributed. Cochran transported the dilaudid from New York to West Virginia with the help of his co-defendants, Troy Gilliard and Monica Slash. Cochran and Gilliard were both charged with conspiracy to distribute dilaudid, three counts of distributing dilaudid, and conspiracy \u201cto launder monetary instruments, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i),\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as set forth in Count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>Five, which charged a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1956(h).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both pled guilty to Count Five.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">First, Cochran maintains that there was no factual support for the district court\u2019s finding that he was a leader in the offense because there was no evidence that he had any contact with the people to whom his customers sold dilaudid. We review the district court\u2019s factual finding for clear error. <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>108 F.3d 512, 518 (4th Cir.1997) (stating standard of review). Most critical of the factors considered by the court is that it was Cochran who obtained a large quantity of dilaudid from his source in New York and arranged for it to be transported to West Virginia and sold there. The court found that Cochran was \u201cthe central figure\u201d in the dilaudid distribution and that the others involved in dilaudid sales who did not deal directly with him were nevertheless connected to him in that they were dependent on the drugs he supplied. Adjustments are determined on the basis of relevant conduct. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.3(a). Reasonably foreseeable conduct of other participants in a jointly undertaken criminal activity may be imputed to the defendant. USSG \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2). Implicit in the court\u2019s finding was that Cochran could reasonably foresee that the dilaudid he sold to his customers would be further distributed. We cannot say that the court clearly erred in finding that he was a leader in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">We next find that the district court properly applied a base offense level of 23. Guideline section 2S1.1(a) provides a base offense level of 23 if the defendant is \u201cconvicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A).\u201d Otherwise, a base offense level of 20 applies under USSG \u00a7 2S1.1(a)(2). The district court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines presents a question of law and is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). Cochran argues that \u00a7 2S1.1(a)(1) did not apply in his case because he was convicted of violating \u00a7 1956(h), not \u00a7 1956(a). However, Count Five, to which he pled guilty, charged him with conspiring to launder money in violation of \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i). The object of the conspiracy was thus to launder money to promote an unlawful activity, which is a violation of \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">Because \u00a7 1956(h) specifies that the penalty for that crime is the same as the penalty for the object of the conspiracy, \u00a7 2S1.1(a)(1) was properly applied and Cochran\u2019s base offense level was correctly set at 23. <em>See United States v. Brace, </em>145 F.3d 247 (5th Cir.1998) (holding that proper base offense level for conspiracy to violate \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A) is 23); <em>United States v. House, </em>110 F.3d 1281, 1287-88 (7th Cir.1997) (same); <em>United States v. Acanda, </em>19 F.3d 616, 619-20 (11th Cir.1994) (same); <em>United States v. Restrepo, </em>936 F.2d 661, 665 (2d Cir.1991) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Gilliard contends that two of his prior sentences arose from related cases, USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2), comment, (n. 3), and should have counted as one sentence in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>criminal history. Gilliard was arrested for grand larceny in February 1993 and for bail jumping in November 1994.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He entered guilty pleas in both cases and, in November 1994, he was given an identical sentence for each offense in the same New York court. When the facts concerning prior convictions and sentences are undisputed, whether they are related cases for criminal history purposes is a legal question reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>50 F.3d 294, 296 (4th Cir.1995). Even when prior cases have been consolidated for sentencing (as Gilliard argued at sentencing that these sentences were), if there is an intervening arrest, such cases must be considered unrelated for criminal history purposes. <em>United States v. Huggins, </em>191 F.3d 532, 539 (4th Cir.1999). Here, there was an intervening arrest. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n. 3) (explaining that intervening arrest occurs when defendant is arrested for the first offense before he commits the second arrest). Thus, the district court did not err in treating Gilli-ard\u2019s prior sentences as unrelated.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Finally, Gilliard seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s refusal to depart based on his apparently successful rehabilitation from crack addiction prior to his arrest for the instant offense. Post-offense rehabilitation may serve as a basis for a downward departure, <em>United States v. Brock, </em>108 F.3d 31, 35 (4th Cir.1997), and the record discloses that the district court was aware of its authority to depart on this ground. Nonetheless, the district court determined that a departure was not warranted. Its decision is not reviewable. <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 31 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">We therefore affirm the sentences. We dismiss that portion of Gilliard\u2019s appeal which contests the district court\u2019s decision not to depart. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-12\">.
