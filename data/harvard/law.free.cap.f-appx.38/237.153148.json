Lawson, United States District Judge, Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b266-6\">BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Juan Gomez pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). He appeals the imposition of a three-level enhancement for being a manager or supervisor under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.1, claiming that he was merely a worker. Finding no merit to his claim, we will affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">In December of 1994 Gomez became involved in a large-scale cocaine conspiracy that imported cocaine from Colombia to buyers throughout the United States. Though Gomez\u2019s role in the conspiracy varied, his involvement was considerable. He personally oversaw the delivery of large loads of cocaine that had been driven to New York City from Miami; on at least one occasion he transported hundreds of kilograms of cocaine; he leased a warehouse to open a business that would operate as a front for the conspiracy\u2019s drug sales; and, on a number of occasions, he collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from cocaine sales. Federal investigators eventually caught Gomez and some of his fellow conspirators, and in September of 1997 he pleaded guilty to the charge of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">At Gomez\u2019s sentencing the district court concluded that he was a \u201cmanager or supervisor\u201d and applied a three-level upward adjustment to his sentence, under USSG \u00a7 3B1.1(b). It is this upward adjustment that Gomez now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">Though ordinarily we review for clear error a district court\u2019s finding that a defendant\u2019s role in a drug offense warrants an enhancement under USSG \u00a7 3B1.1, in this case we review for plain error because Gomez failed to object to the sentencing enhancement. <em>United States v. </em>Koeber-<em>lein, </em>161 F.3d 946, 949 (6th Cir.1998). To establish plain error, Gomez must show 1) that the district court\u2019s upward adjustment was an error; 2) that the error was plain, i.e., obvious or clear; 3) that the error affected Gomez\u2019s substantial rights; and 4) that this adverse impact seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">USSG \u00a7 3B1.1(b) requires a three-level upward adjustment \u201c[i]f the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or a leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants[.]\u201d The Application Note to this section explains further that \u201c[t]o qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-16\">Gomez argues that he was only a worker, and that the facts in the presentence report the district judge relied on \u201cdo not indicate who[m], if anyone, he ever managed or supervised.\u201d Though the presen-tence report did not go to the trouble of specifically naming the people Gomez oversaw, a number of statements in the report, such as that \u201cGomez advised ... that ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>he actually supervised the delivery of cocaine ... in New York,\u201d leave the reader in little doubt that he was in fact overseeing others. Gomez himself submitted the following statement to his probation officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">It was my position within the conspiring organization to supervise the distribution as well as the collection of proceeds from the sale of the cocaine and then ultimately to respond to individuals in South America who were the heads of the organization and the persons who collected the proceeds derived from the sale of the cocaine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Additionally, Gomez did not object to the following statement made by the government in his plea colloquy: \u201cDuring the course of this conspiracy, the cocaine would be transported either from Houston or Miami ... to New York City. During that conspiracy, defendant Gomez was responsible for overseeing the drivers and making sure that they would get the loaded cars to New York City.\u201d These statements make it clear enough that Gomez supervised others.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Gomez cites no authority for the proposition that the people supervised must be specifically identified by name for the \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement to apply, nor are we aware of any. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>19 F.3d 1123, 1125 (6th Cir.1994) (listing seven factors to be considered in determining whether the \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement applies). Thus the district court committed no error, let alone plain error, in concluding that Gomez was in fact a \u201cmanager or supervisor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
