We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), <em>Lipton v. Pathogenesis Corp., </em>284 F.3d 1027, 1035 (9th Cir.2002), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The district court properly determined that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because the conduct alleged does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. <em>See Brewster v. Board of Educ. of Lynwood Unified Sch. Dist., </em>149 F.3d 971, 980-82 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">The district court properly dismissed without leave to amend because amendment would be futile. <em>See Lipton, </em>284 F.3d at 1038-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">We decline to consider Spittal\u2019s claim regarding the constitutionality of Cal. Educ.Code \u00a7 44953 because he raised it for the first time on appeal. <em>See Int\u2019l Union of Bricklayers &amp; Allied Craftsman Local Union No. 20 v.
