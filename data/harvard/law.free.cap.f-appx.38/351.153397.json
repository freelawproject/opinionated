Contracts between Dayton\u2019s and appellant are the subject of this action. Soomekh began operating the Oriental rug department in Dayton\u2019s department stores in 1976 pursuant to a series of contracts. Dayton\u2019s provided the floor space and Soo-mekh provided the rug inventory. Soo-mekh hired, trained, and paid the rug department employees. All employees that were hired by Soomekh were treated as Dayton\u2019s employees. The parties shared the profits from the sale of the rugs. After Dayton\u2019s acquired the Hudson\u2019s chain of department stores in the 1980s, Soo-mekh agreed to expand its rug business into those stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">In the 1990s, Dayton\u2019s acquired the Marshall Field\u2019s department stores. The Nahigian Brothers were operating the Oriental rug department in the Marshall Field\u2019s stores. During 1996 and 1997, Soo-mekh proposed that the Marshall Fields\u2019s rug department be consolidated with the Dayton\u2019s and Hudson\u2019s departments, and that Soomekh operate the rug departments in all three stores. At the time, Nahigian Brothers still operated the Marshall Field\u2019s rug department separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In 1997, Dayton\u2019s proposed a new one-year contract with Soomekh for operation of the Dayton\u2019s and Hudson\u2019s rug departments. Soomekh alleges that Dayton\u2019s told Soomekh that during the proposed one-year contract term, Soomekh, Nahigi-an Brothers, and others would have the opportunity to submit competitive proposals and bids for consolidated operation of the Dayton\u2019s, Hudson\u2019s, and Marshall Field\u2019s rug departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Soomekh agreed to the one-year contract on November 7, 1997. The contract provided for an unlimited number of automatically renewable one-year terms and included a cancellation clause. The cancellation clause provided that either party could cancel the contract by providing 60 days written notice. The contract also contained an integration clause: \u201cThis Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties and super-cedes any prior agreements between the parties hereto. ...\u201d It did not contain any provision for a competitive bidding process.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">On November 25, 1998, Dayton\u2019s gave notice of its intent to cancel the contract effective January 31, 1999, thus terminating its business relationship with Soomekh. Dayton\u2019s did not give Soomekh an opportunity to participate in a competitive bidding process. Dayton\u2019s later consolidated all of its Oriental rug departments under the operation of Nahigian Brothers in the Dayton\u2019s, Hudson\u2019s, and Marshall Field\u2019s stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Soomekh filed suit in Minnesota state court, alleging fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. The case was removed to federal court on diversity grounds. The district court held that the parol evidence rule barred any evidence of Dayton\u2019s alleged oral promise to hold a competitive bidding process, because it contradicted the parties\u2019 written contract by restricting Dayton\u2019s rights under the contract\u2019s cancellation clause. The court further found the fraud exception to the parol evidence rule to be inapplicable, since Soomekh did not claim that the contract was unenforceable or argue that the contract was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">The district court also rejected Soomekh\u2019s claim that its 25-year business relationship with Dayton\u2019s proved the existence of a fiduciary relationship between them. The court held that mere existence of a longstanding contractual relationship did not suffice to establish a fiduciary relationship, especially where the parties dealt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>at arm\u2019s length and represented adverse interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Finally, the district court denied Soo-mekh\u2019s leave to amend \u201cany deficiencies\u201d in its pleading of one element of its fraud claim, namely the falsity of Dayton\u2019s alleged promise at the time it was made. The district court did not find any deficiency in that element of Soomekh\u2019s pleading and therefore did not see the need to address the request. The district court was not obligated to allow any other amendments, because Soomekh never requested leave to amend any other aspect of its other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Having carefully reviewed the record and the applicable legal principles, we find no error in the district court\u2019s disposition of this matter. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. See 8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-30\">. The Honorable Ann D.
