Stephens appealed, pro se, raising five claims challenging his conviction and sentence. A transcript of the proceedings was ordered on November 10, 1998. However, despite all efforts, it now appears that the transcript is unavailable and the court reporter\u2019s notes and backup tapes have been lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-25\">The Court Reporter Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(b) (1994), requires a verbatim record of criminal proceedings in order \u201cto safeguard a defendant\u2019s right to appellate re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>view.\u201d <em>United States v. Gillis, </em>773 F.2d 549, 554 (4th Cir.1985). Although the requirements of \u00a7 753(b) are mandatory, a violation of that statute constitutes reversible error only if the defendant can show \u201cthat the missing portion of the transcript specifically prejudices his appeal.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Huggins, </em>191 F.3d 532, 537 (4th Cir.1999) (when a transcript is less than complete, the \u201cdefendant must show that the transcript errors specifically prejudiced his ability to perfect an appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">We find that the absence of the entire transcript in this case prevents us from reviewing the claims which Stephens raises on appeal. Accordingly, we vacate Stephens\u2019 conviction and remand to the district court for a retrial. We grant the government\u2019s motion to dispense with oral argument because argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
