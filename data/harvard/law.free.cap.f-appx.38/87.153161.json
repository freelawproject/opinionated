Thereupon the presumption of discrimination mandated by <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), disappeared, and plaintiff assumed the burden of proof. <em>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 142-43, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000); <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 506-08, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993); <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981); <em>Fisher v. Vassar Coll., </em>114 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>1332, 1335-36 (2d Cir.1997) (in banc). To satisfy his burden, plaintiff was obligated to point to evidence that would reasonably support a finding that the adverse employment decision was motivated by age bias. <em>See Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 146-49; <em>James v. New York Racing Ass\u2019n, </em>233 F.3d 149, 156-57 (2d Cir.2000); <em>Fisher, </em>114 F.3d at 1346-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The district judge, granting defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, ruled that the evidence was insufficient to satisfy plaintiffs burden. The court stated that a comment by plaintiffs supervisor, asking plaintiff about his age, and suggesting that he take advantage of a pension plan, could not reasonably be construed to reflect age bias. Plaintiff contends that evidence of false statements and other aspects of the evidence that the district court did not discuss could, if taken together, reasonably support an inference of age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">We vacate the judgment and remand for reconsideration because we are uncertain whether the district court considered the full range of plaintiffs evidence. Upon giving full consideration to the evidence, the court should determine whether to reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict or to reinstate the court\u2019s judgment as a matter of law in defendant\u2019s favor. We imply no suggestion as to which judgment the court should reach. This panel will retain jurisdiction in the event of a subsequent appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
