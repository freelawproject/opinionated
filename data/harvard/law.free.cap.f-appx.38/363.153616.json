We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim as well as its grant of summary judgment. <em>See Barnett v. Centoni </em>31 F.3d 813, 815-16 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-16\">Because prison officials\u2019 temporary disruption of Walton\u2019s correspondence with his incarcerated daughter was reasonably related to the legitimate penological objective of preventing coordinated criminal activities, the district court properly granted summary judgment on Walton\u2019s First Amendment claim. <em>See Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 88-89, 92, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987) (prison officials had a legitimate penological objective in prohibiting communication between inmates where the prohibition was legitimately intended to prevent coordinated criminal activity).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-17\">Walton failed to raise a triable issue regarding whether prison officials were motivated by a legitimate penological interest by requiring him to shave. <em>See Barnett, </em>31 F.3d at 816. Moreover, Walton failed to produced evidence that his brief placement in lockdown constituted an atypical and significant hardship. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment on Walton\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-18\">Finally, the district court properly dismissed Walton\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim that prison officials threatened him, because verbal threats do not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See Gaut v. Sunn, </em>810 F.2d 923, 925 (9th Cir.1987) (stating that it trivializes the Eighth Amendment to believe a threat constitutes a constitutional wrong.).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Walton\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b390-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
