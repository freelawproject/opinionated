INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000) (reviewing adverse credibility determination under a substantial evidence standard). The IJ\u2019s determination that Francisco\u2019s demeanor conflicted with his testimony that he was nervous is entitled to special deference. <em>Paredes-Urrestarazu v. INS, </em>36 F.3d 801, 818 (9th Cir.1994) (according special deference to the IJ\u2019s eye-witness observations of a petitioner\u2019s demeanor).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Moreover, inconsistencies in petitioners\u2019 testimony, and between their testimony and documentary evidence, cast serious doubt on their claim of persecution by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), a political party in Mexico. <em>See Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000) (Inconsistencies must go to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim to support an adverse credibility finding.). First, as the BIA notes, reference letters directly contradict their testimony by stating that it was Francisco and Aurelio\u2019s father, not petitioners themselves, who performed the land distribution that gave rise to the alleged persecution. The letters also indicate that the family received threats from an opposing party, rather than from the PRI.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">Second, Francisco\u2019s testimony that he telephoned his father in their hometown contradicts his later assertion that he made no direct contact because he was afraid the PRI would find him through the communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">Third, Francisco admitted that he initially told an INS asylum officer that he and his parents had received threats from the Party for Democratic Revolution (PRD), instead of the PRI.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">Given the glaring flaws in the testimony, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that petitioners failed to establish eligibility for either asylum or withholding of deportation. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (BIA\u2019s decision that alien had not established asylum eligibility is reviewed under a substantial evidence standard); <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995) (An alien who fails to satisfy the standard of proof for asylum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation.).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We cannot determine on the basis of the BIA\u2019s April 10, 2001 order whether the BIA considered petitioners\u2019 CAT claim apart from their asylum and withholding claims, or whether the BIA considered the evidence of country conditions in the record before denying petitioners\u2019 request for remand to the IJ. We therefore remand petitioners\u2019 request for relief under CAT for reconsideration in light of our later filed decision in <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Finally, we reject petitioners\u2019 claim that their due process rights were violated by their attorney\u2019s allegedly ineffective assistance. <em>See Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001) (reviewing due process claims de novo). Given that the IJ and BIA based their decisions on demean- or evidence and the numerous inconsistencies in petitioners\u2019 story, petitioners have failed to show how their attorney\u2019s purported errors prejudiced them. <em>See Lata, </em>204 F.3d at 1246 (Alien must show that counsel\u2019s errors caused \u201csubstantial prejudice.\u201d); <em>Ortiz v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cPrejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">PETITION GRANTED in part, DENIED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3 may provide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-10\">.
