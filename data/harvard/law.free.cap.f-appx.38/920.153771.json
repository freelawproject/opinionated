Hawkins claims the evidence is insufficient to support the convictions. We disagree and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">On direct appeal of a criminal conviction, a factfinder\u2019s verdict must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). The Government produced evidence that Hawkins sold cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d) to Kelvin Hatchet in the front yard of her home, located at 1513 Williamsburg Road, Richmond, Virginia, on February 8, 2001. During the course of this transaction, Hawkins told Hatchet to inform other people the area was her \u201cterritory,\u201d implying that the \u201cterritory\u201d involved the drug trade. The following day, the Richmond police executed a search warrant at Hawkins\u2019 home and found 5.38 grams of crack on Hawkins\u2019 dining room table and a rock of crack in the pocket of the shorts Hawkins was wearing. Based on this evidence, the district court could properly infer that Hawkins maintained a place for the distribution, use, and storage of controlled substances and possessed crack cocaine with the intent to distribute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">Accordingly, we affirm Hawkins\u2019 convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
