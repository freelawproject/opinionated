Batiste, Jr.\u2019s appeal as untimely. Batiste has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-25\">Batiste sued the United States in the Court of Federal Claims regarding a military pay matter. On December 11, 2001, the Court of Federal Claims dismissed the action as beyond the applicable six-year statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501. On February 7, 2002, 58 days after entry of judgment, Batiste filed a document in the Court of Federal Claims titled \u201cMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, and the Order be Rescinded.\u201d The motion attempted to submit new evidence and argument regarding Batiste\u2019s claim. The motion requested that the United States\u2019 motion to dismiss be quashed and that judgment be entered in Batiste\u2019s favor. Because the motion was not received within 10 days of the entry of the judgment, the motion could not be treated as a motion to amend the judgment under RCFC 59. Thus, the Court of Federal Claims treated the motion as a motion for relief from the judgment pursuant to RCFC 60(b). The Court of Federal Claims denied the motion on February 8, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-26\">On March 8, 2002, Batiste filed a document titled \u201cNotice of Appeal in Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and the Order Be Rescinded.\u201d The notice of appeal was filed 86 days after entry of judgment. A notice of appeal from a judgment of the Court of Federal Claims is due within 60 days of entry of judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. (4)(a)(1) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(b). This statutory requirement may not be waived. <em>Sofarelli Associates, Inc. v. United States, </em>716 F.2d 1395 (Fed.Cir.1983) (appeal must be dismissed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>lack of jurisdiction if notice of appeal is untimely).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Although a motion for relief from the judgment under Rule 60 or a post-judgment motion under other certain rules may toll the time to appeal from the judgment, the motion will toll the time to appeal only if the motion is filed within 10 days of entry of the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4). Batiste\u2019s motion was filed 58 days after entry of the judgment and thus did not toll the time to appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In his document titled \u201cNotice of Appeal,\u201d Batiste states that \u201cI intended for Memorandum in Opposition to the Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, and the Order be rescinded, issues on December 11, 2001, to be NAME AS NOTICES OF APPEAL.\u201d However, that earlier document, treated as a RCFC 60(b) motion, did not indicate any intent to appeal. Instead, it was clearly a motion seeking reconsideration by the trial court. Thus, it cannot serve as a notice of appeal, even under the relaxed standards of Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(4) (\u201c[a]n appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal, or for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Finally, the United States asserts that the notice of appeal would be timely only if Batiste is seeking review solely of the trial court\u2019s denial of his 60(b) motion, because the notice of appeal was filed within 60 days of the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 order denying his 60(b) motion. <em>See Browder v. Director, Illinois Dept. of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). Assuming that Batiste is seeking review of the denial of the 60(b) motion, we apply an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard to review such a ruling. <em>Information Systems and Network Corp. v. United States, </em>994 F.2d 792, 794 (Fed.Cir.1993). Here, there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of Batiste\u2019s attempt to introduce new evidence<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that the trial court held was, in any event, not contradictory to evidence submitted by the United States and considered by the trial court before entry of judgment. Thus, to the extent that Batiste is challenging the denial of his 60(b) motion, we summarily affirm that determination. <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir.1994) (\u201csummary disposition is appropriate, inter alia, when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">(1) The United States\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted. To the extent that Batiste is challenging the denial of his 60(b) motion, that determination is summarily affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\"> The \"new\u201d evidence included pay stubs from 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
