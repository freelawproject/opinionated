Platt, <em>Judge) </em>granting summary judgment to defendants A. Craig Purcell and Edward Manzello.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The plaintiffs belong to Americans for Legal Reform (\u201cALR\u201d), an organization that \u201cseeks to bring about reform in the American legal system through political means.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 18. They filed suit against the defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging violations of their constitutional rights under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Kash alleges that on April 29, 1996, at the Suffolk County Bar Association\u2019s annual \u201cLaw Day,\u201d defendant Edward Man-zello, a security officer employed by the Suffolk County Unified Court System, employed excessive force against him in the course of preventing him from walking in the direction of Congressmen Rick Lazio and Michael Forbes, speakers at Law Day. He further alleges that, thereafter, defendant A. Craig Purcell, then president of the Suffolk Bar Association, maliciously caused to be filed a false misdemeanor complaint against him charging him with disorderly conduct; and that Purcell thereby intended, <em>inter alia, </em>to penalize Kash for attempting to exercise his First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">Gambino asserts that while attempting to extricate Kash from Manzello\u2019s restraint, Manzello elbowed her in the shoulder a few times. She conceded in her deposition that these strikes were \u201c[n]ot intentional.\u201d Lanzisera alleges that sometime earlier on Law Day, as he passed by Manzello, Manzello elbowed him intentionally. Lanzisera speculates that Manzello did this because of an incident that occurred one year earlier. Lanzisera had been demonstrating at a courthouse, and Manzello took his sign. Lanzisera complained to Manzello\u2019s superior, who returned the sign to Lanzisera. This incident, Lanzisera believes, embarrassed Manzello.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">The plaintiffs bring their claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. They therefore must establish that the defendants deprived them of rights \u201csecured by the Constitution or laws of the United States,\u201d and that they did so \u201cunder color of state law.\u201d <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. 40, 49-50, 119 S.Ct. 977, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">I. The Claim Against Purcell</p>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">The plaintiffs\u2019 sole allegation against Purcell is that he \u201cmaliciously, for purpose or purposes personal to him, including the purpose of penalizing plaintiff KASH for exercising his First Amendment rights ... falsely charged HARVEY KASH in an accusatory instrument.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">The plaintiffs do not dispute that Purcell is a private attorney or that the Suffolk County Bar Association is a private not-for-profit organization that receives no governmental funding of any kind. The acts of private attorneys are not deemed to be \u201cunder color of state law,\u201d <em>see Fine v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>City of N.Y., </em>529 F.2d 70, 74 (2d Cir.1975), and \u201can otherwise private person acts \u2018under color of state law\u201d only if he or she \u201cconspir[es] with state officials to deprive another of federal rights.\u201d <em>Tower v. Glover, </em>467 U.S. 914, 920, 104 S.Ct. 2820, 81 L.Ed.2d 758 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The evidence shows that before the Law Day program began, Manzello informed Purcell that he had been assigned to provide security to certain judges there. No evidence suggests that Purcell conspired or acted jointly with Manzello. No evidence suggests that Purcell knew that the plaintiffs would be attending the Law Day program. The plaintiffs contend that Manzello and Purcell discussed ALR before Law Day, but they point to no evidence in the record to support that contention. A conclusory allegation that a private person acted jointly with a state actor fails to state a claim under \u00a7 1983, <em>see Spear v. Town of W. Hartford, </em>954 F.2d 63, 68 (2d Cir.1992); <em>a fortiori </em>it fails to defeat a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Purcell also did not act jointly with a state actor merely by swearing to an affidavit in an accusatory instrument. Private misuse of an otherwise valid state statute is not state action. <em>Dahlberg v. Becker, </em>748 F.2d 85, 90 (2d Cir.1984). Because none of Purcell\u2019s alleged conduct can be deemed \u201cfairly attributable to the State,\u201d <em>Spear, </em>954 F.2d at 68 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), Purcell did not act \u201cunder color of state law\u201d and therefore is not subject to \u00a7 1983 liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">II. The Claims Against Manzello</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">To analyze excessive-force claims, we begin by \u201cidentifying the specific constitutional right allegedly infringed by the challenged application of force.\u201d <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 394, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). \u201c \u2018[I]f a constitutional claim is covered by a specific constitutional provision, such as the Fourth or Eighth Amendment, the claim must be analyzed under the standard appropriate to that specific provision, not under the rubric of substantive due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 843, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Lanier, </em>520 U.S. 259, 272 n. 7, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Because Manzello\u2019s alleged use of force against Kash took place during a brief \u201cseizure,\u201d we apply the Fourth Amendment\u2019s \u201creasonableness\u201d standard and ask whether his \u201cactions [were] \u2018objectively reasonable\u2019 in light of the facts and circumstances confronting [him], without regard to [his] underlying intent or motivation.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>490 U.S. at 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">Manzello, according to a police report he filed, perceived Kash\u2019s movement in the direction of Congressmen Forbes and Lazio as a threat. He responded by obstructing Kash\u2019s path with his back turned toward Kash. Kash does not dispute that he found his path obstructed by Manzello\u2019s back. He also does not dispute that after allegedly tapping Manzello on the shoulder and then speaking to Manzello in a loud voice, he attempted to maneuver himself past Manzello. Manzello then restrained Kash and removed him from the meeting hall. He did not strike Kash, even though Manzello believed Kash to be fighting back and attempting to grab his firearm. After successfully removing Kash from the room, Manzello released him. Deferring to the \u201cjudgment of [a] reasonable officer[ ] on the scene,\u201d who \u201creasonably, but mistakenly, believed that a suspect was likely to fight back,\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2158, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), no reasonable jury could conclude that this brief and minimal use of force against Kash was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Manzello\u2019s alleged uses of excessive force against Gambino and Lanzisera did not take place during a seizure. We therefore analyze them under the substantive due-process rubric, <em>see County of Sacramento, </em>523 U.S. at 843-44, 118 S.Ct. 1708, and ask whether Manzello\u2019s conduct \u201cshocks the conscience,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 846-47, 118 S.Ct. 1708 (collecting cases). Manzello unintentionally elbowed Gambino in the shoulder while attempting to restrain Kash. He allegedly also intentionally elbowed Lanzisera. Neither sustained any injury. No reasonable jury could conclude that this conduct \u201cshocks the conscience.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Finally, the plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment retaliation claims fail because they introduced no evidence that the alleged actions of Purcell and Manzello were motivated by their exercise of First Amendment rights. <em>See Curley v. Vill. of Suffern, </em>268 F.3d 65, 73 (2d Cir.2001). In fact, the plaintiffs do not assert that they intended to or did engage in any expressive activity at the Law Day program. Kash testified that it was a coincidence that he had been walking in the direction of Congressmen Forbes and Lazio; he had intended only to get a cup of coffee from the refreshments table, not to speak to them or anyone else. Lanzisera speculates that Manzello elbowed him to retaliate for the alleged embarrassment that Lanzisera caused him on a previous occasion. Even if true, this would suggest the motive of personal vengeance. It would not raise a reasonable inference that Manzello intended to punish Lanzisera in order to deter the expression of ALR\u2019s views.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
