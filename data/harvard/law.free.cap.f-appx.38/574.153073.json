Unique Industries, Inc. consents.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-18\">Omniglow argues, in effect, that the district court\u2019s ruling that the prosecution history bars Omniglow from claiming that Unique\u2019s use of certain compounds infringes claim 1 of Omniglow\u2019s patent under the doctrine of equivalents establishes a per se rule of law that is erroneous. We are not persuaded on the papers here that the district court has created a new rule rather than applying the law to the facts of this particular case. Additionally, it appears that, based on the district court\u2019s ruling, the case will be decided in the district court sooner rather than later. Thus, Omniglow\u2019s arguments in support of its petition are not compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-20\">This court determines for itself whether it will grant permission to appeal an interlocutory order certified by a trial court. <em>See In re Convertible Rowing Exerciser Patent Litigation, </em>903 F.2d 822 (Fed.Cir.1990). Such a ruling is within this court\u2019s complete discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-21\">Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"b600-22\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-23\">Omniglow\u2019s petition for permission to appeal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
