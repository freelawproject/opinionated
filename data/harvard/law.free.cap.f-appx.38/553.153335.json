The district court determined that one of the firearm-possession convictions was a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d conviction under section 924(c), for which the statute mandates a consecutive sentence of twenty-five years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i), (D)(ii). We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1), and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Marcus Hahn was arrested at his home, where he was cultivating marijuana plants and where he also kept firearms. A jury found him guilty of the following offenses: knowingly and intentionally manufacturing marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(1) and (b)(1)(B); opening and maintaining a place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, and using marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1) and (b); possessing a firearm in furtherance of the manufacture of marijuana, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A); and possessing a firearm in furtherance of the maintenance of a place to manufacture, distribute, and use marijuana, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). This appeal focuses solely on the sentence Hahn received for the second firearm violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">\n<em>II. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b580-14\">Hahn\u2019s challenge to his sentence centers on the following statutory language: \u201cIn the case of a second or subsequent conviction under this subsection, the person shall\u2014(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years .... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). The district court found that the second 924(c) conviction was a \u201csecond or subsequent conviction,\u201d and it therefore imposed the mandatory sentence of twenty-five years for that offense. Hahn argues that the statute does not authorize treating his second firearm conviction as \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d to the first for purposes of the statute\u2019s sentencing enhancement, because the underlying drug crimes were part of a \u201ccontinuing incident\u201d and were \u201ccoterminous in space and time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">We review the legality of a sentence de novo. <em>United States v. Price, </em>75 F.3d 1440, 1446 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-16\">The Supreme Court has held that multiple 924(c) convictions in a single proceeding count as \u201csecond or subsequent convictions\u201d for purposes of the statute\u2019s sentencing requirements. <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993). Hahn argues, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>er, that the two firearms charges here\u2014one for possession in furtherance of growing marijuana and one for possession in furtherance of maintaining a place for that purpose\u2014both arose from the possession of the same firearms in connection with the same marijuana-growing activities. For this reason, he argues, the second of these convictions cannot be a \u201csecond or subsequent conviction\u201d within the meaning of the statute. As Hahn recognizes, however, this argument fails under Tenth Circuit precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">In <em>United States v. Sturmoski, </em>971 F.2d 452, 461 (10th Cir.1992), we wrote that \u201cconsecutive sentences may be imposed for multiple 924(c) counts if the offenses underlying each 924(c) count do not constitute a single offense for double jeopardy purposes.\u201d In <em>Sturmoski, </em>the underlying offenses were attempting to manufacture a controlled substance and maintaining a place for manufacturing a controlled substance. <em>Id. </em>We held that Congress intended multiple convictions under 924(c), even though the counts involved \u201cthe same criminal episode,\u201d because Congress intended the underlying offenses to be separate. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, we found that, by making it a crime to maintain a place for manufacturing drugs, \u201cCongress intended to create a new felony that would punish a defendant\u2019s <em>use of property </em>for manufacturing activities related to narcotics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the conviction for maintaining a place for manufacture was distinct from the attempt to manufacture, and, accordingly, the associated 924(c) convictions were distinct from each other. The only difference between the situations in <em>Stur-moski </em>and in this case is that one of Hahn\u2019s 924(c) convictions was for possession in furtherance of manufacture, rather than possession in furtherance of <em>attempt </em>to manufacture. Thus, <em>Sturmoski </em>clearly controls the outcome of this case. Hahn\u2019s conviction for maintaining a place for manufacture is distinct from his manufacture conviction, and his two 924(c) convictions are also distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">We must also reject Hahn\u2019s argument that there can be no \u201csecond or subsequent conviction\u201d if both convictions involve offenses that were \u201ccoterminous in space and time.\u201d We have consistently held that, even if possession of a firearm occurs in connection with a single criminal episode, a second 924(c) conviction arising out of that episode can constitute a \u201csecond or subsequent conviction\u201d for sentencing purposes. In <em>United States v. Parra, </em>2 F.3d 1058, 1062 (10th Cir.1993), the offenses underlying two 924(c) convictions were possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute. In <em>United States v. Romero, </em>122 F.3d 1334, 1337 (10th Cir.1997), the offenses underlying two 924(c) convictions were carjacking and interference with commerce by robbery and extortion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In both cases, we held that the district court properly treated one of the 924(c) convictions as a \u201csecond or subsequent conviction.\u201d <em>Parra, 2 </em>F.3d at 1071; <em>Romero, 122 </em>F.3d at 1343-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">Thus, prior precedent defeats Hahn\u2019s sole argument on appeal. The district court properly treated one of Hahn\u2019s 924(c) convictions as a \u201csecond or subsequent conviction,\u201d and the sentence imposed by the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b580-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\">.
