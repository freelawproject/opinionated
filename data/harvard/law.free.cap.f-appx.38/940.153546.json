The district court\u2019s order was entered on January 22, 2002, and Whitehead\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on March 16, 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction because we find his notice of appeal untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The timely filing of a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>See Brow-der v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). Whitehead failed to file a notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of the order denying his motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), to obtain an extension of time, or to obtain a reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss Whitehead\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-9\">. In criminal cases, the defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, the court may grant an extension of time to file of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) (holding \u00a7 3582 proceeding is criminal in nature and ten-day appeal period applies).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b945-25\">. For purposes of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been given to prison officials for mailing. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Appl. P. 4(c); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
