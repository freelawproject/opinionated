Ann Gouldin Killalea, County Attorney\u2019s Office, Fairfax, Virginia; Louis Edward Matthews, Jr., Office of the Attorney General of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia; John David Griffin, Fowler, Griffin, Coyne <em>&amp; </em>Coyne, P.C., Winchester, Virginia, for Ap-pellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b912-21\">Before WIDENER, WILLIAMS, and TRAXLER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>No. 01-2042 affirmed and No. 01-2442 affirmed as modified by unpublished PER CURIAM opinion.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b913-5\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">In these consolidated cases, Mustafa H. Sa\u2019id appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his action filed under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West Supp.2001), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 (1994), and the magistrate judge\u2019s interlocutory order declining to recuse herself.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Best Buy, Inc., moves to dismiss the appeal, to strike Sa\u2019id\u2019s reply in opposition, and to impose sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Because Sa\u2019id\u2019s informal briefs raise no challenge to the magistrate judge\u2019s recusal decision, the order denying Sa\u2019id\u2019s motion to recuse is affirmed. <em>See </em>4th Cir. Rule 34(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Sa\u2019id\u2019s action because he failed to comply with its earlier order instructing him to file an amended complaint. Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). However, the dismissal should be without prejudice. <em>Choice Hotels Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Goodwin &amp; Boone, </em>11 F.3d 469, 472 (4th Cir.1993); <em>Ballard v. Carlson, </em>882 F.2d 93, 95-96 (4th Cir.1989). Accordingly, we affirm as modified the district court\u2019s order dismissing Sa\u2019id\u2019s action; we modify the order to reflect that the dismissal is without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">We deny Best Buy\u2019s motions to dismiss the appeal, to strike Sa\u2019id\u2019s reply in opposition, and to impose sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">No. <em>01-2042</em>\u2014AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">No. <em>02-2442</em>\u2014AFFIRMED <em>AS MODIFIED.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b913-12\"> While interlocutory when the appeal was filed, the district court's intervening final order permits review under the doctrine of cumulative finality. <em>Equipment Fin. Group, Inc. v. Traverse Computer Brokers, </em>973 F.2d 345, 347 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
