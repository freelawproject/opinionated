He alleges that his employment was terminated because of his race or national origin and in retaliation for his filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In addition, he alleges that the defendant discriminated against him during his employment by paying him a lower salary. He brought claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and the New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 290 <em>et seq. </em>The district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-18\">The plaintiff was employed as a Senior Computer Graphics Illustrator from 1988, when he was promoted, until his termination in July 1996. Starting in 1989, the plaintiff was ranked in the bottom 25-33% of his peers. During the six months immediately preceeding plaintiffs termination, several rankings of his department were compiled. Although rankings fluctuated somewhat, in each ranking plaintiff was ranked within the bottom four of the sixteen illustrators in his department, and ninth out of nine at his skill level. The defendant laid off the four illustrators ranked lowest in the last ranking assembled. Under the company\u2019s policy, the first employees laid off are those who cannot do the remaining work, followed by \u201ccomparative selection\u201d based on a specially prepared \u201cfinal rank order list,\u201d with ties broken by seniority. In March 1996, the plaintiff filed a complaint with the E.E.O.C.; however, he provided no evidence to indicate either that the defendant\u2019s management was ever aware of the complaint or that the complaint played a role in the decision to terminate him. He also provided evidence that he was the lowest paid Senior Computer Graphics Illustrator, but he provided no other information about salary history.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-19\">We review grants of summary judgment de novo. <em>Bowman v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>238 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>F.3d 468, 470 (2d Cir.2001) (per curiam). The plaintiff has provided insufficient evidence to show that there is any \u201cgenuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). The plaintiff has shown nothing to create an inference of discrimination. <em>See Viola v. Philips Med. Sys. of N. Am., </em>42 F.3d 712 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
