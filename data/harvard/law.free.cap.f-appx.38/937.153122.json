Wilt was indicted as a result of a controlled buy of crack cocaine at his residence within 1000 feet of an elementary school. Wilt\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that his counsel failed to provide constitutionally adequate assistance. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally not cognizable on appeal. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Such claims must ordinarily be pursued in a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2001) motion to allow for adequate development of the record. <em>United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">An exception to this general rule applies when the record on direct appeal conclusively establishes that the defendant did not receive constitutionally sufficient assistance of counsel. <em>King, </em>119 F.3d at 295. Our review of the record reveals no error of this magnitude. In accepting Wilt\u2019s guilty plea, the district court queried Wilt about counsel\u2019s performance and he indicated that he was satisfied. Those statements, coming under oath as they did, are binding absent strong evidence to the contrary. <em>See Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74-75, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977). Wilt\u2019s unsupported allegations that counsel spent less than one hour consulting with him prior to entering the guilty plea do not conclusively establish counsel\u2019s deficiency. <em>King, </em>119 F.3d at 295. As a result, we are constrained to conclude that Wilt\u2019s claim is not cognizable in this direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">Accordingly, Wilt\u2019s conviction is hereby affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
