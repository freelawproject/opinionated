Viands appeals his 238-month sentence imposed upon his conviction following his guilty plea for distribution of cocaine base within 1000 feet of a school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, 860 (1994). Viands\u2019 attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Viands filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">The first issue raised in the <em>Anders </em>brief is whether the district court erred when it declined to award Viands a three-level downward departure for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3E1.1(a), (b) (2000) and increased his offense level by two pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings as to whether to apply a sentence reduction or enhancement for clear error and review the district court\u2019s legal interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Hudson, </em>272 F.3d 260, 263 (4th Cir. 2001). Because Viands failed to appear for sentencing, fled the jurisdiction, and led authorities on a high speed chase before being apprehended, we find the district court did not err in denying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility and applying an enhancement for obstruction of justice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">Next, we find Viands\u2019 sentence of 238 months does not implicate <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum of 480 months as set forth in \u00a7 860.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 199-202 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001) (holding <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated by an application of the Sentencing Guidelines that increases the sentencing range, so long as the sentence imposed does not exceed the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">In his supplemental pro se brief, Viands contends the district court exposed him to double jeopardy by sentencing him under both \u00a7 841 and \u00a7 860. Although the indictment, plea agreement, and judgment recite both statutory provisions, the language describing the nature of the offense of conviction in these instruments, the punishments, the single count, and the single special assessment show Viands was convicted only of the \u00a7 860 offense. The recitation of both statutory provisions in the indictment, plea agreement, and judgment results from the fact that \u00a7 860 enhances the punishment for \u00a7 841(a) offenses committed near a school. Therefore, we find Viands was not subject to double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Viands\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>sel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b885-10\"> The initial maximum sentence for possession with intent to distribute is twenty years under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Under \u00a7 860, the maximum doubles when the offense was committed within 1000 feet of a school.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
