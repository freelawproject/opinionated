Spence\u2019s letter, filed before the expiration of the one-year limitations period for filing \u00a7 2255 claims, expressed a desire to file a \u00a7 2255 motion, and requested appointed counsel, or, in the alternative, to be moved to a federal prison. The district court sua sponte construed the letter as a motion for relief under \u00a7 2255 and denied relief based on the issues raised in the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">In <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644 (4th Cir.2002), we recently outlined the prophylactic measures a district court should follow before construing a motion not specifically denominated as a \u00a7 2255 motion as the prisoner\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because of the consequences associated with converting the letter to a \u00a7 2255 motion, we conclude the district court erred when it construed Spence\u2019s letter as his first motion filed under \u00a7 2255 without giving him proper notice. We therefore grant a certificate of appealability, vacate the district court\u2019s order, and remand in order for the district court to provide Spence with proper notice under <em>Emmanuel. </em>Spence will then have the opportunity to file a timely, non-successive \u00a7 2255 motion in which he could fully develop his claims. We deny Spence\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b898-11\"> We note the district court's order issued before our decision in <em>Emmanuel </em>and express no opinion as to the merits of Spence\u2019s claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
