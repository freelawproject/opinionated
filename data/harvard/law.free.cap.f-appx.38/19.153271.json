R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b47-20\">ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that the judgment of dismissal entered by the District Court is hereby affirmed. \u201cAn aggrieved person may initially file a mixed case complaint with an agency ... or an appeal on the same matter with the [Merit Systems Protection Board] ..., but not both.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.302(b). Although Appellant raised only a discrimination claim before the Postal Service EEO, that claim stemmed from his improper termination\u2014an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>that could be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). Therefore, it must be considered a mixed case complaint. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.302(a)(1). Appellant was required to have both his discrimination claim and his improper termination claim decided in the forum he initially elected\u2014the MSPB. By failing to raise his discrimination claim before the MSPB, Appellant failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and cannot now seek review of that claim before the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of this mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
