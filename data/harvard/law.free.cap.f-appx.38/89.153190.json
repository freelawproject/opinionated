On appeal, Subhan challenges: (1) the district court\u2019s ruling that he was precluded from raising the affirmative defense of duress at trial; and (2) the denial at sentencing of Subhan\u2019s motion for a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Subhan has waived his argument that the district court erred in precluding him from raising the affirmative defense of duress at trial. \u201c[A] defendant who knowingly and voluntarily enters a guilty plea waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the prior proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>243 F.3d 587, 590 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 960, 121 S.Ct. 2616, 150 L.Ed.2d 770 (2001); <em>Lebowitz v. United States, </em>877 F.2d 207, 209 (2d Cir.1989). There is no question that Subhan was aware that he was waiving the right to challenge this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">As to Subhan\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on duress: \u201cAlthough generally a failure to depart downwardly is not appealable, if the due process right asserted by appellant exists and the denial of a departure violated that right, the constitutional aspects of the denial [are] ap-pealable.\u201d <em>United States v. Zagari, </em>111 F.3d 307, 330 (2d Cir.1997). But Subhan has not established any constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Subhan contends that he was not able to present live or videotaped testimony of his witnesses who lived in Pakistan and for whom the government would not furnish visas for travel to the United States. The district court properly determined that it could rely on affidavits of Subhan\u2019s witnesses. The decision whether to conduct an evidentiary hearing at sentencing is committed to the \u201cbroad discretion\u201d of the district court. <em>Zagari, </em>111 F.3d at 330. \u201cWhen any factor important to the sentencing determination is reasonably in dispute, the parties shall be given an adequate opportunity to present information to the court regarding that factor.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3. \u201cWritten statements of counsel or affidavits of witnesses may be adequate under many circumstances.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3, comment para. 2; <em>United States v. Ibanez, </em>924 F.2d 427 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">Subhan was provided an adequate opportunity to present his case and be heard. The court relied primarily on Subhan\u2019s own testimony in concluding that a departure was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Finally, we reject Subhan\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s denial of his departure motion was inconsistent with its decision not to enhance Subhan\u2019s offense level for obstruction of justice. The district court was well within its discretion in denying the departure motion, having \u201cconcluded that there are too many inconsistencies in [Subhan\u2019s] account ... to [warrant] a downward departure for duress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
