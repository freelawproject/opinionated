For the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b29-20\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the orders of the Commission be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-21\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after the resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. See Fed.R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-22\">MEMORANDUM</p>\n<p id=\"b29-23\">Burlington Resources Oil and Gas Company, Amoco Production Company, BP Energy Company, and Conoco, Inc., (together \u201cIndicated Shippers\u201d) challenge as arbitrary and capricious the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\u2019s Order on Remand, <em>El Paso Natural Gas Co., </em>89 FERC \u00b6 61,164 (1999), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>90 FERC \u00b6 61,354 (2000), and its Compliance Order, <em>El Paso Natural Gas Co., </em>91 FERC \u00b6 61,062 (2000), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>91 FERC \u00b6 61,306 (2000). We affirm the Commission\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-25\">The Indicated Shippers argue that the Settlement locked in fuel rates regardless of any refunctionalizations that might occur. Specifically, they point to Section 15.2 of the Settlement, which states that \u201cthe settlement rates established herein will not be subject to change during the term\u201d of the Settlement. Stipulation and Agreement in Settlement of Rate and Related Proceedings, <em>El Paso Natural Gas Company, </em>Joint Appendix at 43 (\u201cSettlement\u201d). Indicated Shippers have failed to show, however, that the Order on Remand was unreasonable in finding that fuel rates were not included in the term \u201csettlement rates.\u201d Section 3.2 of the Settlement states that \u201c[t]he settlement rates shall consist of\u2019 three numbered items, and fuel rates fall under none of the three. <em>Id. </em>at 10. Fuel rates, rather, are governed by provisions in Article 8, which is not referenced in Section 3.2. See <em>id. </em>In addition, Article 8 allows for periodic adjustments in fuel charges. <em>Id. </em>at 25-26; Order Denying Rehearing, 90 FERC at 62,174/1.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-26\">Since we hold that FERC\u2019s interpretation of the Settlement was reasonable, we need not reach the question whether a FERC modification of the Settlement should proceed under \u00a7 4 or \u00a7 5 of the Natural Gas Act. As counsel for Indicated Shippers acknowledged at oral argument, for the Commission to prevail, it \u201cmust either sustain an argument that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>correct in its interpretation or it must sustain an argument that the purported modifications [were valid].\u201d Transcript of Oral Argument. But even if we had reached this issue, we would affirm the Commission. FERC\u2019s approval of the Settlement was an open question after our remand in <em>Williams Field Services v. FERC, </em>194 F.3d 110 (D.C.Cir.1999), and thus the Commission properly acted under \u00a7 4. Indicated Shippers\u2019 citation to <em>Algonquin Gas Transmission Co. v. FERC, </em>948 F.2d 1305 (D.C.Cir.1991), is inapposite because in that case FERC attempted to modify a ratemaking methodology that had been previously approved and used and that the settlement did not purport to disturb. <em>Id. </em>at 1310-11. Here, FERC had never previously addressed the effect of refunctionalization on fuel rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">We similarly find nothing improper in the Compliance Order\u2019s method of calculating fuel charges. In earlier orders FERC did accept fuel rates for 1999-2000 calculated using purely historical data (i.e., the fuel costs associated with the Chaco and South Carlsbad facilities were removed only for the last two months of the historical base period). See Order Accepting Fuel Adjustment Filing, 85 FERC \u00b6 61,388, at 62,504 (1998); Order on Rehearing, 82 FERC \u00b6 61,336, at 62,329 n. 15 (1998). Shortly thereafter, however, our decision in <em>Williams </em>vacated and remanded FERC\u2019s orders insofar as they \u201caddressed the effect of the refunctionalization on El Paso\u2019s rates\u201d and relied \u201con an interpretation of the Settlement.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>194 F.3d at 118-19. We also urged FERC \u201cto consolidate all ... related matters to reach a single, coherent disposition of the outstanding issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120. The effect of this was to draw into question the premises underlying the earlier FERC orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">On the merits, FERC\u2019s subsequent decision to remove the fuel costs associated with the Chaco, South Carlsbad, and Blanco facilities for the entire (24-month) historical base period was not unreasonable. Under the Settlement, historical data is only used as a predictor for future fuel costs. See Order Denying Rehearing, 91 FERC at 62,040. As it was clear that costs from the three facilities would no longer be present in the future, the Commission was entitled to remove them from consideration. See <em>Indicated Shippers v. Sea Robin Pipeline Co., </em>81 FERC \u00b6 61,146 (1997). And as counsel conceded at oral argument, the provisions on the periodicity of the fuel charge changes do not explicitly address the issue of complete removal of a facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Finally, we decline to second-guess the Commission\u2019s use of the date of refunction-alization as the relevant date for fuel cost analysis. Burlington cites no authority establishing that the date of formal abandonment is the sole permissible choice in such circumstances.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
