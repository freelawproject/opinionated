He appeals his sentence, specifically challenging the enhancement of his offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> for obstruction of justice and possession of a dangerous weapon. We conclude that the district court correctly applied these enhancements, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Romero first contends the district court erred in finding that he willfully obstructed justice when he failed to disclose a 1980 misdemeanor conviction in the Southern District of Texas for illegal entry. Section 3C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. \u201c[P]roviding materially false information to a probation officer in respect to a presentence or other investigation for the court\u201d is specifically listed as an example of conduct for which the enhancement is appropriate. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(h)). \u201cMaterial\u201d information is defined as \u201cinformation that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.6). Whether information is material is a factual matter determined by the district court, and the district court\u2019s determination is reviewed by this court under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See United States v. Hicks, </em>948 F.2d 877, 886 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">The district court concluded that Romero\u2019s testimony at sentencing that he did not intend to deceive the probation officer when he failed to disclose the prior conviction was not worthy of belief. Evaluation of witness credibility is reserved to the finder of fact and is generally not subject to review by this court. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989). Moreover, the district court\u2019s conclusion that Romero\u2019s prior conviction was a material fact is not clearly erroneous, as we have held that \u201c[t]he threshold for materiality ... is \u2018conspicuously low.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gormley, </em>201 F.3d 290, 294 (4th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Dedeker, </em>961 F.2d 164, 167 (11th Cir.1992)). Accordingly, the district court acted within its discretion by concluding that Romero willfully provided a materially false answer to the probation officer\u2019s question about his prior convictions and correctly applied the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">Romero next contends the district court improperly enhanced his offense level for possession of a firearm in connection with the drug trafficking offense. A two-level increase applies if a dangerous weapon is present during a drug trafficking crime \u201cunless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), comment, (n.3). The district court\u2019s determination that a firearm or other weapon was present and justifies the enhancement is a factual question that is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Apple, </em>915 F.2d 899, 914 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>After Romero\u2019s drug distribution organization was discovered, a search of a house used by the organization for storage of drugs in Houston, Texas, resulted in the seizure of ten kilograms of cocaine, $42,300, and a 9mm handgun. A subsequent search of Romero\u2019s North Carolina residence yielded a small quantity of marijuana and four firearms. The district court found that Romero falsely testified that the firearms found in his residence were not connected to his drug distribution conspiracy and that he was unaware that co-conspirators in Houston possessed firearms. The district court noted that Romero\u2019s organization distributed drugs in North Carolina for several years and involved numerous individuals. Moreover, Romero admitted that drugs transported from Houston arrived at his North Carolina residence before being stored at other houses. This evidence is sufficient to support the district court\u2019s findings that the firearms found in Romero\u2019s North Carolina residence were possessed for protection of the drug distribution organization and its profits and that the firearm found in the Houston house was reasonably foreseeable to Romero. <em>See United States v. Kimberlin, </em>18 F.3d 1156, 1159-60 (4th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. White, </em>875 F.2d 427, 433 (4th Cir.1989). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court properly applied the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement to Romero\u2019s offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">We therefore affirm Romero\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dis-pense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court, and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b887-11\"> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
