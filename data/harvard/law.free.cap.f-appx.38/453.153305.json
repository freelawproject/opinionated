He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence related to his identity that he alleges was obtained as the result of the unlawful entry of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>home by three sheriffs deputies, and his subsequent thirty-minute detention in his bedroom by the deputies. In the district court, the prosecution did not defend the legality of the deputies\u2019 warrantless entry of Contreras\u2019s residence, but contended that because the challenged evidence related to Contreras\u2019s identity, it could not, as a matter of law, be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Contreras seeks the suppression of two types of evidence. First, he argues that his identity itself should be suppressed. The Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he \u2018body\u2019 or identity of a defendant or respondent in a criminal or civil proceeding is never itself suppressible as a fruit of an unlawful arrest, even if it is conceded that an unlawful arrest, search, or interrogation occurred.\u201d <em>INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1040, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984). Second, Contreras argues that the statements he made to the arresting officers which led to the government\u2019s determination of his alienage should also be suppressed. This argument is likewise foreclosed by precedent. In <em>United States v. Guzman-Bruno, </em>27 F.3d 420, 421 (9th Cir.1994), we interpreted <em>Lopez-Mendoza </em>to mean that statements by an alien that lead the authorities to discover his status as an illegal re-entrant cannot be suppressed as a matter of law. <em>See also Orozco-Rico, </em>589 F.2d 433, 435 (9th Cir.1978) (\u201c[T]here is no sanction to be applied when an illegal arrest only leads to discovery of the man\u2019s identity and that merely leads to the official file or other independent evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Contreras nevertheless contends that his statements to the authorities that led them to identify him as a previously deported alien should be suppressed because they resulted from \u201cegregious violations\u201d of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Lopez-Mendoza, </em>408 U.S. at 1050.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the deportation context, this court has held that evidence seized through a search motivated by racial animus may be suppressed as the fruits of an \u201cegregious violation\u201d of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Orhorhage v. INS, </em>38 F.3d 488, 503 (9th Cir.1994). However, even assuming that the egregious violation exception applies in criminal as well as civil cases, and that such an exception would justify the suppression of statements relating to a defendant\u2019s identity, the exception does not apply here. Accepting the facts set forth by Contreras as true, they do not support the conclusion that the deputies entered his house or detained him there because of his race or national origin. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-5\">. The principal question in <em>Lopez-Mendoza </em>was whether the exclusionary rule applied in deportation proceedings. The Court held that it generally did not apply, but left open the possibility that in a case involving \"egregious violations of Fourth Amendment or other liberties that might transgress notions of fundamental fairness,\u201d suppression might be an appropriate remedy. 468 U.S. at 1050, 104 S.Ct. 3479</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-11\">. Contreras also argues that the warrantless entry of his home constituted a \"bad faith\u201d violation of the Fourth Amendment requiring an exception to the general rule of <em>Guzman-Bruno. </em>He cites no authority for applying such an exception in criminal cases and we do not choose to do so here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
