The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had fraudulently foreclosed a mortgage on his property by presenting fraudulent mortgage documents to the state courts and by deliberately failing to provide him with proper notice of the foreclosure action. The district court dismissed the suit as barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See generally D.C. Ct. App. v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-22\">We review district court conclusions about subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. v. Am. Nat'l Bank, </em>93 F.3d 1064, 1070 (2d Cir.1996). Under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, the \u201clower federal courts lack subject matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>jurisdiction over claims that effectively challenge state court judgments.\u201d <em>Kropelnicki v. Siegel, </em>290 F.3d 118, 127 (2d Cir.2002). The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine covers both matters directly decided in the state court and matters \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the determinations of the state court. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the plaintiff essentially asks us to conclude that the state court foreclosure action was invalid and should be reversed. We lack jurisdiction over this claim. Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The motion for sanctions is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
