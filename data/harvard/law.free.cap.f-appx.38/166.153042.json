Dupont also pled guilty to eight counts of armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(d) (West 2000). Their attorneys have filed a joint brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but addressing the possibility that Brown\u2019s sentence was improper and that Dupont was provided ineffective assistance of counsel or that his case was affected by prosecutorial misconduct. The Defendants were informed of their right to file pro se briefs, but have not done so. Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">We find that both Defendants\u2019 guilty pleas were knowingly and voluntarily entered after thorough hearings pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. Brown and Dupont were properly advised of their rights, the offenses charged, and the maximum sentences for the offenses. The court also determined that there was an independent factual basis for each plea and that the pleas were not coerced or influenced by any promises. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); <em>United States v. De-Fusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">In his written plea agreement, Dupont waived his right to appeal, except for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct. We find this waiver valid. <em>See United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991). To the extent that Dupont asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, because the record does not conclusively demonstrate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, such a claim is more appropriately brought in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2001). <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Further, our review of the record discloses no prosecutorial misconduct. Accordingly, we affirm Dupont\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Brown challenges the propriety of his sentences, contending that his sentences for the two firearm offenses should not be consecutive to the sentence on the conspiracy count. However, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c) sets forth a separate and distinct crime from conspiracy under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371. <em>See United States v. Studifin, </em>240 F.3d 415, 420 (4th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Terry, </em>86 F.3d 353, 355-56 (4th Cir.1996). Accordingly, imposition of the mandatory consecutive sentences for the firearm charges does not violate double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire records in these appeals and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm both Defendants\u2019 convictions and sentences. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
