Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Frank D. Carter\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Mr. Carter responds.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-41\">Mr. Carter appeals from an order of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the \u201cVeterans Court\u201d) denying his petition for mandamus seeking extraor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>dinary relief. Mr. Carter indicates that, upon separation from the Army in 1971, he was given a disability rating of 20 percent for asthma. In 1973, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals assigned him a rating of 10 percent. In his mandamus petition, Mr. Carter asked the Veterans Court to vacate his 10 percent disability rating and to revise the rating upward to 20 percent, retroactively. The Veterans Court denied Mr. Carter\u2019s petition because he had failed to show a clear and indisputable right to mandamus, because he had not alleged that he had exhausted his administrative remedies, and because his petition did \u201cnot contain supporting documents necessary to understand the petition as required by Rule 21 of the Court\u2019s Rules of Practice and Procedure.\u201d Mr. Carter appeals that order to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Veterans Court. <em>See Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). Mr. Carter\u2019s appeal does not satisfy any of the grounds for invoking this court\u2019s jurisdiction. The Veterans Court\u2019s order denying mandamus did not address or otherwise depend on any issue of validity or interpretation of any statute or regulation, nor did Mr. Carter raise any argument concerning the validity or interpretation of any such provision.</p>\n<p id=\"Ane\">Even in this court, the only reference in Mr. Carter\u2019s brief to any statute or regulation is the assertion that the Department of Veterans Affairs failed \u201cto apply 38 U.S.C. 5313 and 38 C.F.R. 3.665 properly (interpret) to veterans claims.\u201d That argument appears at most to constitute a claim that the Department misapplied the cited statute and regulation to his case. The jurisdiction of this court does not extend to \u201ca challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). Mr. Carter\u2019s appeal is therefore not within this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
