Citizen Power, Incorporated and the American Public Power Association (collectively, Citizen Power) petition for review of (1) a February 7, 2001 Commission order disclaiming jurisdiction over the potential disposition of power generation facilities by FirstEnergy Corporation and Duquesne Light Company (collectively, Intervenors), <em>see Am. Pub. Power Ass\u2019n, et al., </em>94 FERC \u00b6 61, 104 (2001); and (2) an April 6, 2001 notice of the Commission\u2019s denial of Citizen Power\u2019s request for a rehearing, <em>see Am. Pub. Power Ass\u2019n, et al., </em>95 FERC \u00b6 61,023 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-20\">Section 203 of the Federal Power Act (Act) prohibits a public utility from \u201cdispos[ing] of ... its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission ... without first having secured an order of the Commission authorizing it to do so.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824b(a). Citizen Power filed with the Commission a complaint against each of the Intervenors and a request for a declaratory order, alleging that the Intervenors had failed to seek Commission approval to transfer (i.e., dispose of) generation-only facilities. Under the plain text of the Act, the Commission properly disclaimed jurisdiction. Section 201 of the Act states that the Commission \u201cshall have jurisdiction over all facilities for ... transmission or sale of electric energy, but shall <em>not </em>have jurisdiction, except as specifically provided in this subchapter and [the next subchapter], over facilities used for the <em>generation </em>of electric energy.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824(b)(1) (emphasis added). As the Commission points out, \u201cSection 203 itself does not \u2018specifically provide\u2019 for Commission jurisdiction over generation facilities within the meaning of \u00a7 201(b)(1) ... [and so] the Commission has for decades consistently disclaimed jurisdiction over dispositions of generating facilities under \u00a7 203.\u201d Br. of Resp\u2019t at 8, 10 (citing, <em>inter alia, Consumers Power Co., </em>52 FERC \u00b6 61,023 (1990), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>aff'd, Mich. Pub. Power Agency v. FERC, </em>963 F.2d 1574 (D.C.Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Citizen Power resists this conclusion, arguing that the Commission has section 203 jurisdiction over the disposition of generation facilities because they are in fact facilities \u201cfor [the] <em>transmission </em>or <em>sale </em>of electric energy\u201d under section 201. <em>See </em>Br. of Pet\u2019r at 7. In doing so, it ignores the clear bifurcation of that section. As the Commission properly found, \u201c[t]here is no necessary nexus between the interstate transmission or sale of electric energy, on the one hand, (the triggering events giving rise to our jurisdiction) and the disposition of a generation facility by itself\u2019 on the other. Deferred Appendix at 3. Moreover, that the Congress granted the Commission limited authority to regulate generation facilities under certain circumstances enumerated in sections 205 and 206 of the Act, <em>see </em>Br. of Pet\u2019r at 8, does not mean that those facilities are \u201csubject to the jurisdiction of the Commission\u201d within the meaning of section 203. Finally, even if the text of the Act could bear the strained meaning Citizen Power advocates, the Commission\u2019s longstanding, reasonable interpretation would be entitled to deference under <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Therefore, it is ORDERED that the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41(a)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
