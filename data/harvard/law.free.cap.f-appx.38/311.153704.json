California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel\u2019s brief is facially adequate and Mr. Smith has not filed a response, <em>see </em>Circuit Rule 51(b), so we limit our review to the single potential issue counsel identifies: whether it would be frivolous to argue that the district court abused its discretion in modifying Mr. Smith\u2019s supervised release conditions pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2) to require mental health and sexual disorder screening and treatment, if necessary. <em>See United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Wagner, </em>103 F.3d 551, 553 (7th Cir.1996). We agree with counsel that such an argument would be frivolous, and so grant his motion to withdraw and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-22\">In October 2001 Mr. Smith was released from federal prison after serving time for drug trafficking crimes. Shortly before, Mr. Smith\u2019s probation officer had learned that Mr. Smith had a history of delusional and paranoid thinking, violence, and abusive behavior. She also learned that some of his delusions seemed to be sexually oriented. She therefore requested that the district court modify Mr. Smith\u2019s supervised release conditions to require mental-health, abusive-behavior, and sexual-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>disorder evaluation and, if necessary, treatment. As the probation officer explained to the district court, the probation office can screen for sexual disorders coupled with abusive behavior only through its \u201csex offender\u201d evaluation program. The program, although denominated a \u201csex offender\u201d evaluation program, is in fact designed to afford evaluation and treatment to offenders suffering from certain classes of mental illness, rather than only to those convicted of sex offenses. The probation officer therefore suggested that Mr. Smith participate in this program, but was careful to assure the district court and Mr. Smith that participation in the program is not tantamount to being labeled a \u201csex offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">At the hearing required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(b), the probation officer testified that Mr. Smith had been hospitalized repeatedly since 1990 for depression and schizophrenia. She also testified that in 1993 Mr. Smith was found not guilty by reason of insanity for an incident during which he held two friends at gunpoint. More recently, a staff psychologist at Mr. Smith\u2019s place of incarceration had repeatedly recommended mental health counseling and psychotropic drug treatment for Mr. Smith\u2019s delusions, which, according to the probation officer, included Mr. Smith\u2019s belief that while he was incarcerated the government implanted devices in his genitals and anus to shock him. The probation officer further testified that while in prison Mr. Smith informed the staff psychologist that the shocks delivered by the government\u2019s devices cause him to grab his genitals compulsively. A pro se motion by Mr. Smith, in which he sought information regarding the government\u2019s \u201crules and regulations\u201d for \u201csecret interventions\u201d and tests, supports the probation officer\u2019s testimony concerning Mr. Smith\u2019s paranoid mental state. A state police officer also testified that Mr. Smith had been involved in a robbery and several batteries in the early 1990\u2019s, and that he had once held a knife to a woman\u2019s throat because she knew of his drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Given Mr. Smith\u2019s history of violence and mental illness, we agree with counsel that challenging the modification of Mr. Smith\u2019s supervised release conditions would be frivolous. Counsel would have to argue that the district court abused its discretion in imposing the new condition. <em>See United States v. Monteiro, </em>270 F.3d 465, 469 (7th Cir.1998) (applying abuse of discretion standard to review of original conditions). He could do so by contending that the new condition was not \u201creasonably related\u201d to the nature and circumstances of Mr. Smith\u2019s crimes, to his particular problems, to his educational, vocational, or medical needs, or to the need to deter future crime and protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e)(2) and 3553(a)(2). He could also do so by claiming that the new condition unnecessarily deprived Mr. Smith of liberty. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2); <em>see also Monteiro, </em>270 F.3d at 472-73. But as counsel determined, arguing that the district court abused its discretion is frivolous where, as here, the court narrowly crafts new supervised release conditions based on an \u201cindividualized assessment\u201d of the defendant\u2019s past and present behavior with an eye toward protecting the public and rehabilitating the defendant. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>154 F.3d 658, 667 (7th Cir.1998) (approving imposition of mental health treatment based on judge\u2019s observations of the defendant and testimony by defendant\u2019s mother and a co-worker that the defendant had a history of \u201cmental health problems\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Schave, </em>186 F.3d 839, 842 (7th Cir.1999). Requiring Mr. Smith to undergo mental health evaluations and treatment, as the prison\u2019s staff psycholo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>gist recommended, is so obviously \u201creasonably related\u201d to his history of paranoia, delusions, and violence, and to the goals of protecting the public and rehabilitating Mr. Smith, that arguing otherwise would be meaningless. Likewise, the sexual undertones in Mr. Smith\u2019s belief that the government periodically electrocutes his genitals and anus make frivolous an argument that the district court abused its discretion by ordering evaluation and treatment, if recommended, for a possible sexual disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Counsel\u2019s motion is GRANTED and this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
