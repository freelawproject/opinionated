A jury convicted Nichols of conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction against the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332a. The jury also convicted Nichols of eight counts of invol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>untary manslaughter, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112. After the jury deadlocked during the death penalty phase, the district court sentenced Nichols to life imprisonment on the conspiracy count, and six years each on the manslaughter counts, with the sentences to run concurrently. We previously detailed the particulars of the crime in <em>United States v. McVeigh, </em>153 F.3d 1166, 1176-79 (10th Cir.1998), and need not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">We granted certificates of appealability pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) on two issues: (1) whether Nichols was denied his right under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) to a jury verdict on each essential element of the conspiracy charge; and (2) whether he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the Government violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) by failing to turn over approximately 40,000 investigative \u201clead sheets.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Nichols argues we should vacate his conviction for conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Nichols first contends \u00a7 2332a is facially unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi </em>because the statute exposes a defendant to the death penalty based on a nonjury finding that death resulted from the use of a weapon of mass destruction. Alternatively, Nichols contends the district court did not properly instruct the jury on the mental state required for each element of the offense. We address each of these arguments in turn.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332a is facially unconstitutional is a question of law we review de novo. <em>United States v. Pompey, </em>264 F.3d 1176, 1179 (10th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>225 F.3d 1187, 1193 (10th Cir.2000). At the time of the bombing, \u00a7 2332a provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-11\">(a) Offense.\u2014A person who uses, or attempts or conspires to use, a weapon of mass destruction\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-12\">(1) against a national of the United States while such national is outside of the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>(2) against any person within the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">(3) against any property that is owned, leased or used by the United States or by any department or agency of the United States, whether the property is within or outside of the United States,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life, and if death results, shall be punished by death or imprisoned for any term of years or for life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Both at trial and on direct appeal, Nichols argued \u201cif death results\u201d is an element of the offense to which a knowing mental state applies. We rejected that construction of the statute in <em>United States v. McVeigh, </em>153 F.3d 1166, 1194-95 (10th Cir.1998), and in Nichols\u2019 direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Nichols, </em>169 F.3d 1255, 1260-61 (10th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We stated that by the plain language and structure of the statute, \u201cthe phrase \u2018if death results\u2019 is a sentencing factor rather than an element of the offense.\u201d <em>McVeigh, </em>153 F.3d at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Nichols now argues (1) we are bound by our prior statement in <em>McVeigh </em>that \u201cresulting death\u201d is a sentencing factor; (2) because resulting death is a sentencing factor, \u00a7 2332a allows the judge to find by a preponderance of the evidence a fact that increases the maximum penalty to which Nichols was exposed; and (3) this result violates <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>holding that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">We have rejected similar arguments concerning the facial constitutionality of federal drug statutes. <em>See United States v. Cernobyl, </em>255 F.3d 1215 (10th Cir.2001) (upholding facial constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841). In <em>Cernobyl, </em>we noted that our <em>pre-Apprendi </em>cases holding that a judge may find drug quantities under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) by a preponderance of the evidence no longer had precedential value after <em>Apprendi. Cernobyl, </em>255 F.3d at 1219. Likewise, <em>McVeigh\u2019s </em>characterization of \u201cresulting death\u201d as a sentencing factor does not render \u00a7 2332a facially unconstitutional. <em>Apprendi </em>is a superseding contrary decision by the Supreme Court that undermines <em>McVeigh\u2019s </em>precedential value regarding this point. <em>See In re Smith, </em>10 F.3d 723, 724 (10th Cir.1993) (\u2018We are bound by the precedent of prior panels absent en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary decision by the Supreme Court.\u201d); <em>Cernobyl, </em>255 F.3d at 1219. Unlike the statute at issue in <em>Apprendi, </em>\u00a7 2332a does not indicate whether the judge or jury is assigned the task of determining whether \u201cdeath results,\u201d nor does it specify the burden of proof. Thus, <em>Apprendi </em>does not render \u00a7 2332a facially unconstitutional, it merely requires the Government to charge in the indictment, and the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt, that death resulted. Here, the Government charged Nichols with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death. The jury found, by special interrogatory, that death resulted and that those deaths were reasonably foreseeable. <em>Apprendi </em>requires no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Nichols alternatively argues if \u00a7 2332a is facially constitutional, then \u201cresulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>death\u201d must be an element of the offense. In <em>McVeigh, </em>we stated that \u201c[i]n light of the nature of the offense at issue and the severity of the prescribed punishments,\u201d \u201cthe intent standard of \u2018knowingly is appropriate for <em>each of the elements </em>of a \u00a7 2332a violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1194 (emphasis added). Hence, Nichols argues <em>McVeigh </em>requires a knowing mental state to attach to each and every element, including \u201cresulting death.\u201d Because the jury was not instructed that Nichols must have known that death would result from the conspiracy, Nichols argues the jury did not find every element of the offense and we must vacate his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">We rejected this argument in <em>McVeigh </em>and in Nichols\u2019 direct appeal. In addition to holding that \u201cresulting death\u201d is a sentencing factor, we went on to state\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3X\">Further, even if the phrase \u201cif death results\u201d were to be construed as an element of the offense rather than a sentencing enhancement, it would not be an intent element but only an element of factual consequences. Nothing in \u00a7 2332a(a) links the \u201cif death results\u201d language of the statute to any scienter whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><em>McVeigh </em>at 1195. While <em>Apprendi </em>undermines <em>McVeigh\u2019s </em>holding that \u201cresulting death\u201d is a sentencing factor that does not increase the Government\u2019s burden of proof, <em>Apprendi </em>has no effect on <em>McVeigh\u2019s </em>alternative holding. <em>See Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., </em>337 U.S. 535, 537, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524 (1949) (\u201c[W]here a decision rests on two or more grounds, none can be relegated to the category of obiter dictum.\u201d); <em>United States v. Rohde, </em>159 F.3d 1298, 1302 (10th Cir.1998) (distinguishing between an alternate holding and dicta). We remain bound by the prior panel\u2019s construction of the statute. <em>See Nichols, </em>169 F.3d at 1261 (referring to both of <em>McVeigh\u2019s </em>holdings on this point as binding precedent); <em>In re Smith, </em>10 F.3d at 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Even if we were not bound by <em>McVeigh, we </em>would reach the same conclusion based on \u00a7 2332a\u2019s structure and language. Section 2332a describes the actions necessary to commit the offense in terms of volitional acts; a person must use, or attempt or conspire to use, a weapon of mass destruction against specified targets. In contrast, the statute describes the death penalty\u2019s applicability in terms of factual consequences.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A person guilty of committing this offense is subject to the death penalty if death <em>results, </em>not if he intentionally or knowingly caused, or attempted or conspired to cause death. We previously interpreted similar statutory language, and held the Government \u201cneed only show the defendants\u2019 illegal conduct resulted in bodily injury; not that the defendants intended bodily injury.\u201d <em>United States v. Woodlee, </em>136 F.3d 1399, 1405 (10th Cir.1998) (interpreting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 245(b)) (emphasis in original). In <em>Wood-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number><em>lee, </em>we based our conclusion in part on a \u201clong line of cases interpreting the phrase \u2018if death results\u2019 under analogous statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(gathering cases). We reaffirm this interpretation of \u201cif death results.\u201d At oral argument, Nichols\u2019 counsel conceded Nichols\u2019 conviction and sentence violate <em>Apprendi </em>only if a knowing mental state attaches to \u201cif death results.\u201d Because we reject this construction of the statute, we affirm Nichols\u2019 \u00a7 2382a conviction and life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Nichols next contends he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine if the Government violated its constitutional duty to disclose material exculpatory evidence under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) by withholding approximately 40,000 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \u201clead sheets.\u201d FBI agents and other FBI personnel use a standard form colloquially referred to as \u201clead sheets\u201d to record information that may be relevant to an investigation. Agents record on the lead sheet the source\u2019s identity, the method, date, and time of contact, and a narrative summary of what the source said. Agents also use lead sheets to document agent-to-agent communications. Agents conducting a follow-up investigation interview the source or others who may have more information. The agent conducting the interview will report what was said on a Form 302 if the information is thought to be relevant to the investigation, or in the form of an \u201cinsert\u201d if the information is of no apparent value. <em>See United States v. Nichols, </em>242 F.3d 391, 2000 WL 1846225, at *1 (10th Cir.2000) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Prior to trial, the Government provided the defense with the Form 302s, but did not turn over any lead sheets. Nichols\u2019 counsel discovered the lead sheets\u2019 existence for the first time during the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal case at trial, and moved for immediate production of similar material. The district court refused to address the matter during trial, and proceeded to verdict and through the death penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">After the verdict, Nichols moved for a new trial, alleging the Government violated its <em>Brady </em>and discovery obligations by failing to turn over lead sheets containing exculpatory or impeachment information. The Government informed the district court the FBI had approximately 50,000 lead sheets which the Government had not turned over to the defense. The FBI sorted the lead sheets into three categories: (1) agent-to-agent communications; (2) lead sheets concerning the identity or location of persons resembling John Doe number two sketches circulated after the bombing; and (3) all other lead sheets. The district court denied the new trial motion, but ordered the Government to produce the approximately 12,000 lead sheets in the third category.. Based on this production, Nichols filed a supplemental motion for a new trial. The district court denied this motion. <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>67 F.Supp.2d 1198, 1202 (D.Colo.1999). The district court also denied Nichols\u2019 requests for further discovery and an evidentiary hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">Nichols directly appealed his conviction and sentence, but did not raise any <em>Brady </em>or discovery claims in his direct appeal. We affirmed and the Supreme Court denied certiorari. <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>169 F.3d 1255 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, 528 </em>U.S. 934, 120 S.Ct. 336, 145 L.Ed.2d 262 (1999). Nichols also appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his new trial motion. Before we resolved Nichols\u2019 appeal of the new trial motion, Nichols filed the present \u00a7 2255 motion in district court. Nichols\u2019 <em>Brady </em>claim in his \u00a7 2255 motion relied on the same arguments and evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>formed the basis of his new trial motion. We subsequently affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of the new trial motion. <em>Nichols, </em>2000 WL 1846225, at *1. Based on our resolution of the <em>Brady </em>and discovery issues, Nichols withdrew his <em>Brady </em>claim in the \u00a7 2255 motion before the district court. Nichols then filed a petition for certiorari from our denial of the new trial motion, which the Supreme Court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Subsequently, the Government revealed it had located additional evidence which had never been turned over to the defense. The new evidence consisted of approximately 1,000 Form 302s and inserts, as well as physical evidence. Although the Government contends this evidence contains no <em>Brady </em>material, the Government concedes it should have produced the evidence under the parties\u2019 reciprocal discovery agreement. Based on this latest round of disclosures, Nichols filed a petition for rehearing with the Supreme Court on his new trial motion. We next granted Nichols\u2019 request for a certificate of appeal-ability on \u201cthe <em>Brady </em>issue\u201d Nichols raised in his \u00a7 2255 motion. The Supreme Court subsequently denied Nichols\u2019 petition for rehearing on his new trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Nichols now argues the Government\u2019s late production of the 302s sheds new light on his prior \u00a7 2255 <em>Brady </em>claim, which was based on the Government\u2019s failure to produce the lead sheets. He argues the Government\u2019s failure to turn over the 302s raises an inference the FBI\u2019s sorting and categorizing of the lead sheets cannot be trusted. He also argues the newly discovered 302s are evidence that the Government perhaps did not turn over all category three lead sheets. Further, Nichols argues that upon remand for review of the lead sheets, he also must be allowed to argue the relevance of the 302s because <em>Brady </em>contemplates a cumulative review of all withheld evidence. <em>See Banks v. Reynolds, </em>54 F.3d 1508, 1518 (10th Cir.1995) (\u201cIn evaluating the materiality of withheld evidence, ... we review the cumulative impact of the withheld evidence; its utility to the defense as well as its potentially damaging impact on the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d) (citing <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 436-37, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">As an initial matter, we note that only the Government\u2019s prior failure to produce the lead sheets is currently before us. Nichols did not raise the 302 issue before the district court, nor does he raise the 302 issue before us as a separate substantive <em>Brady </em>claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With respect to the lead sheets, we considered and resolved this <em>Brady </em>claim on Nichols\u2019 motion for a new trial. <em>See Nichols, </em>2000 WL 1846225, at *3-7. \u201cAbsent an intervening change in the law of a circuit, issues disposed of on direct appeal generally will not be considered on a collateral attack by a motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>United States v. Prichard, </em>875 F.2d 789, 791 (10th Cir.1989); <em>see also United States v. Warner, </em>23 F.3d 287, 291 (10th Cir.1994) (affirming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>district court\u2019s dismissal of \u00a7 2255 issues previously resolved on direct appeal). No relevant intervening change in the law has occurred. Instead, Nichols argues we should employ general \u201claw of the case\u201d principles, including the exceptions to that doctrine. \u201cThe law of the case doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\u201d <em>McIlravy v. Kerr-McGee Coal Corp., </em>204 F.3d 1031, 1034 (10th Cir.2000) (internal quotations and citations omitted). We have recognized three exceptions from this general rule: \u201c(1) when the evidence in a subsequent trial is substantially different; (2) when controlling authority has subsequently made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues; or (3) when the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201cGenerally courts read these exceptions narrowly, requiring district courts to apply the law of the case unless one of the exceptions specifically and unquestionably applies.\u201d <em>United States v. Monsisvais, </em>946 F.2d 114, 117 (10th Cir.1991) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Even assuming all three exceptions are cognizable on a \u00a7 2255 motion, none apply here. Nichols argues the first exception applies because the newly-produced 302s substantially change the evidence. We disagree. Nichols\u2019 current <em>Brady </em>claim is identical to the claim we resolved in Nichols\u2019 prior motion. Nothing about the late production of the 302s changes the content of the lead sheets, and Nichols has not produced any evidence the FBI mischarac-terized or wrongly withheld any lead sheets.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Nichols also argues our prior holdings are not the law of the case because they are clearly erroneous. In essence, Nichols seeks to overturn three rulings: (1) that the Government\u2019s failure to turn over the John Doe number two (\u201cJD2\u201d) lead sheets did not constitute a <em>Brady </em>violation; (2) that the Government\u2019s failure to turn over all the lead sheets did not violate the parties\u2019 discovery agreement or the Jencks Act; and (3) that the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">We resolved the JD2 lead sheets issue in Nichols\u2019 new trial motion. We stated\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADn\">[N]one of the JD2 evidence casts doubt on the overt acts committed by Mr. Nichols.... None of the lead sheets contend someone else committed any acts the evidence attributed to Mr. Nichols. Nor do the sheets cast doubt on the extent of his role because it was conceded he did not actually deliver the bomb with Mr. McVeigh. We simply cannot agree the existence of another participant reduces Mr. Nichols\u2019 relative culpability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">Even proof of the existence of a real John Doe #2 and of his participation would not contradict the government\u2019s indictment. It must be remembered the indictment charged Mr. Nichols conspired with Mr. McVeigh and with others unknown. The participation of another conspirator ... therefore, does not reheve Mr. Nichols of culpability under the indictment. Thus, there is no reason to believe withholding this information from the defense violated Mr. Nichols\u2019 right to a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-10\"><em>Nichols, </em>2000 WL 1846225, at *4-5. Nichols fails to explain how the late production of the 302s changes this calculus. Nichols argues only that he could have used lead sheets to rehabilitate two witnesses. Both of these witnesses testified about the possible identity of JD2, and JD2\u2019s activities on the morning of the bombing. We fail to see how potential rehabilitation of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>two witnesses alters this conclusion where even proof of JD2\u2019s existence would not undermine our confidence in the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Second, Nichols argues our prior ruling that the Government did not violate its discovery obligations with respect to the lead sheets was clearly erroneous. <em>See id. </em>at *6-7. We concluded the parties\u2019 reciprocal discovery agreement did not include the lead sheets, and the lead sheets were not Jencks Act material because \u201cthey were not relevant statements made by a testifying witness called by the prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *7 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(a)(b)(e) <em>&amp; </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 26.2(a, f)). Although the parties continue to factually dispute the parameters of the discovery agreement, \u201c \u2018[w]here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Winsor v. Hinckley Dodge, Inc., </em>79 F.3d 996, 1000 (10th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). Further, the lead sheets are not witness statements as defined by the Jencks Act because they were internal reports prepared by FBI agents investigating the case. Our prior rulings on the Government\u2019s discovery obligations were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Third, Nichols requests a remand for an evidentiary hearing to develop the record regarding the contents of the remaining undisclosed lead sheets. We previously ruled the district court did not abuse its discretion by ruling on Nichols\u2019 new trial motion without an evidentiary hearing. <em>Nichols, </em>2000 WL 1846225, at *7. The late production of the 302s does not undermine our prior conclusion. Nichols has not shown the FBI mischaracterized any of the lead sheets in category one or two, nor has he shown the Government withheld any category three lead sheets. He relies only on an inference of carelessness on the part of the FBI based on the late production of the 302s. We decline to determine a prior panel\u2019s resolution of this issue was clearly erroneous based on mere speculation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">In sum, we previously considered and disposed of Nichols\u2019 claims regarding the lead sheets. The 302s, considered only as evidence to justify re-opening the lead sheets issue, do not undermine our prior rulings. Nichols may pursue the substantive 302 <em>Brady </em>issue on a second and successive \u00a7 2255 motion if he meets the requirements for such a motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b561-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) (new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to cases which have become final before new rules are announced, unless they fall within an exception); <em>see also McCoy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001) (holding \"the new constitutional rule of criminal procedure announced in <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review\u201d); <em>United States v. Moss, </em>252 F.3d 993, 1000-01 (8th Cir.2001) (same); <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 151 (4th Cir.2001) (same); <em>Jones v. Smith, </em>231 F.3d 1227, 1236 (9th Cir.2000) (same). Although the Supreme Court has indicated <em>Teague </em>retroactivity determinations should be made as a \"threshold matter,\u201d <em>see Penry v. Lynaugh, </em>492 U.S. 302, 329, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989), the parties have not briefed the issue to our satisfaction, and the merits of Nichols\u2019 <em>Ap-prendi </em>claims are easily resolved. Nor will we address whether Nichols' <em>Apprendi </em>claims are procedurally barred under <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982) (a defendant collaterally attacking his conviction based on trial errors to which he made no contemporaneous objection must show both \"cause\u201d and \"prejudice\u201d). The Government has not raised a <em>Frady </em>defense, and we decline to raise the issue <em>sua sponte </em>given the posture of this case. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Talk, </em>158 F.3d 1064, 1067 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b563-9\">. Because <em>Nichols </em>relied on <em>McVeigh\u2019s </em>prior resolution of these issues, we refer to <em>McVeigh </em>for the substantive analysis of Nichols\u2019 <em>Ap-prend\u00ed </em>claims. <em>See Nichols, </em>169 F.3d at 1260-61.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\">. Nichols argues our reasoning in <em>McVeigh </em>compels us to find a knowing scienter attaches to \"if death results\u201d because there we stated that the serious penalties in \u00a7 2332a indicate the statute is not a strict liability crime. Thus, Nichols argues the most severe penalty, death, likewise cannot be imposed without the requisite mental state. We rejected a similar argument in <em>McVeigh, </em>noting that while the Government must prove a certain level of criminal intent to secure a death sentence, these necessary findings may be <em>made </em>at any stage of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1195. \"Thus, 'intent to kill\u2019 need not be incorporated into the jury instructions during the guilt phase of a capital case <em>if it is not an element of the charged crime.\" Id. </em>at 1195 (emphasis added). Because we conclude no scienter attaches to \"if death results\u201d to determine guilt, the district court properly instructed the jury regarding the appropriate mental state at the guilt and death penalty phases respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\">. Any such attempt would have to overcome the requirements for a second and successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255 &amp; 2244(b)(2)(B) (requiring court of appeals panel to certify a successive petition contains either (1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven, would establish by clear and convincing evidence no reasonable jury would have convicted defendant of the offense; or (2) a previously unavailable new rule of constitutional law made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court); <em>Calderon v. Thompson, </em>523 U.S. 538, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998) (motion to recall an appellate mandate for reconsideration in light of new claims or evidence is subject to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s restrictions on successive motions); <em>Lopez v. Douglas, </em>141 F.3d 974 (10th Cir.1998) (holding a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion to vacate the judgment denying an initial \u00a7 2254 motion was an uncertified second or successive \u00a7 2254 motion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b568-6\">. Because we And our prior rulings were not clearly erroneous, we need not consider whether those rulings worked a manifest injustice. McIl<em>ravy, </em>204 F.3d at 1034 (noting the third exception to the law of the case doctrine requires that the prior decision was clearly erroneous <em>and </em>would work a manifest injustice).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b568-7\">. Nichols argues subjecting him to the requirements for a second and successive motion is unfair because the Government would benefit from its failure to timely produce evidence where the Government waited until after his initial \u00a7 2255 was resolved before turning over the 302s. Fair or not, \u00a7\u00a7 2255 and 2244(b) do not contain an explicit exception for situations where the Government has violated its discovery or <em>Brady </em>obligations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b568-14\">.
