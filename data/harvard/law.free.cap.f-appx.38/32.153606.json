The district court increased Sordillo\u2019s base offense level from 12 to 14 based on the existence of an \u201corganized scheme to steal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>vehicles or vehicle parts\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B6.1(b)(3) (1998). The district court also imposed a special probation condition, which requires Sordillo to \u201crefrain from engaging in the business of owning or operating any type of motor vehicle repair shop during the term of his supervision.\u201d Sordillo appeals the district court\u2019s increase in his base offense level and the imposition of the special probation condition. Because no objection was made at the time of sentencing to either issue raised on appeal, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Phaneuf, </em>91 F.3d 255, 262 (1st Cir.1996). For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">With respect to his first argument, Sordillo contends that the district court\u2019s imposition of the special probation condition conflicts with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2322(a)(2), which provides that the \u201cAttorney General shall, as appropriate, in the case of any person who violates paragraph (1) [operation of a chop shop], commence a civil action for permanent or temporary injunction to restrain such violation.\u201d Sordillo essentially argues that this provision grants the Attorney General the exclusive power to enjoin future business activities related to motor vehicles, and therefore, the district court\u2019s special probation condition is an impermissible exercise of judicial authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">While Sordillo\u2019s argument is novel, he points to no authority to support his assumption that the court\u2019s authority to impose a special condition of supervised release is limited merely because it tracks an available civil remedy. Moreover, we are unable to read into \u00a7 2322(a)(2) a provision that suggests that a civil injunction is the exclusive means of preventing a defendant from engaging in the same business that provided the means for the commission of the offenses of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\u201cA sentencing judge has broad discretion to impose special conditions of release that are \u2018reasonably related\u2019 to (1) the defendant\u2019s offense, history and characteristics; (2) the need for adequate deterrence; and (3) the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d <em>Phaneuf, </em>91 F.3d at 263. We find the special probation condition imposed by the district court to be <em>directly related </em>to the means by which Sordillo committed the offenses. Sordillo was convicted of operating a \u201cchop shop\u201d; a shop he operated through his motorcycle repair and parts sale business. Thus, Sordillo\u2019s offense and past employment history are completely intertwined. In addition, prohibiting Sordillo from engaging in the business of owning or operating a motor vehicle repair shop serves the purposes of deterrence and protection of the public because it was through Sordillo\u2019s operation of such a business that he was able to engage in the prohibited offenses and cause injury to the public. Thus, we find no error in the district court\u2019s imposition of the special probation condition limiting Sordillo\u2019s post-incarceration employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">With respect to Sordillo\u2019s second argument, we conclude that the district court appropriately complied with section 2B6.1(b)(3) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which provides: \u201cIf the offense involved an organized scheme to steal vehicles or vehicle parts, or to receive stolen vehicles or vehicle parts, and the offense level as determined above is less than level 14, increase to level 14.\u201d Application Note (1) to section 2B6.1 further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">Subsection (b)(3), referring to an <em>\u201corganized scheme </em>to steal vehicles or vehicle parts, or to receive stolen vehicles or vehicle parts,\u201d provides an alternative minimum measure of loss in the case of an ongoing, sophisticated operation <em>such </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>as </em>an auto theft ring or <em>\u201cchop shop.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Because Sordillo was convicted of operating a \u201cchop shop,\u201d a base offense level of 14 was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Accordingly, the judgment and sentence of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
