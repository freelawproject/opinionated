The district court also refused to give Defendants\u2019 proposed jury instructions and found that the jury verdict was supported by the evidence. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">1. The Agents Had Reasonable Suspicion To Stop Defendants\u2019 Taxi-Vans.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">We review de novo whether reasonable suspicion exists to stop a vehicle. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). We look at \u201cthe \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 of each case to see whether the detaining officer has a \u2018particularized and objective basis\u2019 for suspecting [ ] wrongdoing.\u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002). Officers may \u201cdraw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that \u2018might well elude an untrained person.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 750-51 (quoting <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 418, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Here, the prosecution presented the following facts: (1) the border patrol agents knew from previous experience that the back of the Canyon General store was a regular passage point for illegal aliens awaiting transport; (2) there were no payphones or gas pumps behind the convenience store; (3) the store was three miles from the United States-Mexico border; (4) the agents observed Defendants\u2019 taxis emerge from behind the store, speeding, with their headlights off; (5) Goodreau cut the agents off with his taxi while exiting the parking lot; and (6) the border patrol had received an anonymous tip regarding aliens hiding in the brush behind the store two hours prior to the stop. These facts, taken as a whole, created reasonable suspicion to stop Defendants\u2019 taxis.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">2. The District Court Properly Refused To Give Defendants\u2019 Proposed Jury Instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">Whether a district court\u2019s jury instructions adequately address a defendant\u2019s theory of the case is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Pierre, </em>254 F.3d 872, 875 (9th Cir.2001). The district court has substantial latitude so long as its instructions fairly and adequately cover the issues presented. <em>United States v. Frega, </em>179 F.3d 793, 806 n. 16 (9th Cir.1999). Here, the judge instructed the jury on reckless disregard. Defendants\u2019 proposed instructions regarding the effect of civil rights statutes on the intent element of alien smuggling did not require a separate jury instruction. <em>See United States v. Dees, </em>34 F.3d 838, 842 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cIt is not reversible error to reject a defendant\u2019s proposed instruction on his theory of the case if other instructions, in their entirety, adequately cover that defense theory.\u201d). We find the district court\u2019s reckless disregard instruction adequately covered De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>fendants\u2019 theory of the case and the proposed instructions were superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">3. There Is Sufficient Evidence of a Substantial Relationship Between Defendants\u2019 Transportation of Illegal Aliens and the Furtherance of the Aliens\u2019 Illegal Presence in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We review for plain error Defendants\u2019 claims of insufficient evidence because they did not renew their motions for acquittal at the close of all the evidence. <em>United States v. Carlson, </em>235 F.3d 466, 468 (9th Cir.2000). Defendants rely on <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>561 F.2d 1321 (9th Cir.1977), to compel a finding that because their employment required them to transport the aliens, the transportation was only incidental to the violation of law. In <em>Moreno, </em>however, we \u201c[did] not imply that there is an ipso facto exemption for those who transport undocumented aliens for employment or as an incident to employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1323-24; <em>see also United States v. Hernandez-Guardado, </em>228 F.3d 1017, 1024 (9th Cir.2000) (finding a shuttle driver guilty of alien smuggling despite the fact that the transportation was in the course of his employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Here, there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Hernandez-Guardado, </em>228 F.3d at 1024 (providing \u201ctransportation for one leg of illegal aliens\u2019 migration to locations within the United States .... has a direct and substantial relationship to the furtherance of the aliens\u2019 illegal presence in the United States.\u201d). The jury reasonably concluded that Defendants assisted the illegal aliens in one leg of their journey and thus, furthered the aliens\u2019 illegal presence in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) imposes criminal sanctions on any person who: \"knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law, transports, or moves or attempts to transport or move such alien within the United States by means of transportation or otherwise, in furtherance of such violation of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
