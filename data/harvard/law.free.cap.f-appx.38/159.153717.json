Finding no error, we affirm. Gomez contends the district court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of his July 1999 arrest for possessing methamphetamine. We review the district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Murray, </em>65 F.3d 1161, 1170 (4th Cir.1995). Gomez\u2019s July 1999 arrest for possession of methamphetamine occurred during the time frame charged in the indictment. We therefore find the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">Gomez contends the district court erred in denying his post-verdict motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial. A jury\u2019s verdict must be upheld on appeal if there is substantial evidence in the record to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In determining whether the evidence in the record is substantial, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and inquire whether there is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, we do not review the credibility of witnesses and assume the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony for the government. <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998). Gomez argues it was not reasonable for the jury to believe the testimony of his co-conspirators. Because we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>do not review the credibility of witnesses, we find Gomez\u2019s claims meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">For these reasons, we affirm Gomez\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
