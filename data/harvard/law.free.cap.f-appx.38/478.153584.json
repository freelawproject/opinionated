His attorney has filed a motion to withdraw as counsel of record pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and a brief stating that counsel cannot identify any nonfrivolous issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-22\">We have conducted an independent review of the record and the briefs on appeal pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 82-83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), which disclosed that Angulo-Sando-val knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence and he was sentenced within the terms of the plea agreement. Accordingly, we enforce the waiver and dismiss the appeal. <em>United States v.
