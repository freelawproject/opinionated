Johnson appeals, claiming that he was deprived of assistance of counsel at sentencing, the district court failed to make an inquiry into the factual basis for his guilty plea, and he was entitled to an additional reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. We find no merit to his claims; consequently, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">Johnson first argues that the district court deprived him of the right to counsel at sentencing by allowing his attorney to withdraw and then requiring Johnson to proceed pro se. In fact, when Johnson\u2019s court-appointed attorney (his third) moved to withdraw one business day before sentencing, the court required Johnson to proceed with hybrid representation, directing his lawyer to continue as standby counsel. Such a decision was within the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 176, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984); <em>United States v. West, </em>877 F.2d 281, 286 (4th Cir.1989). In this capacity, at Johnson\u2019s request, counsel actively participated at the sentencing hearing, challenging provisions in the presentence investigation report, and playing a significant role in obtaining a lower offense level than that recommended in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">At the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing, the district court advised Johnson that in order for the court to find him guilty of Count Two of the indictment, the government would have \u201cto prove by competent evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt that on or about August 5, 1999, that [Johnson] knowingly and intentionally possessed with the intent to distribute in excess of five grams of crack cocaine.\u201d Shortly thereafter, when the court asked if he needed more advice, Johnson said, \u201cI\u2019m guilty of Count Two.\u201d Johnson argues on appeal that this exchange does not provide a sufficient inquiry into the factual basis of his guilty plea. Because he did not raise this claim in the district court, we review the district court\u2019s findings for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 527 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">Under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f), a court may not enter a judgment upon a guilty plea unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for that plea. We find that, in light of Johnson\u2019s explicit admission of guilt at the sentencing hearing and evidence in the presentence investigation report supporting the guilty plea, the district court did not commit plain error in finding a factual basis to support the plea. <em>Martinez, </em>277 F.3d at 531-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-15\">Finally, Johnson argues that the district court erred by awarding him only a two-level reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility rather than a three-level reduction as provided by <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number><em>States Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 SE1.1(b) (2001). To obtain this additional one-level reduction, Johnson bore the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to the adjustment. <em>United States v. Urrego-Linares, </em>879 F.2d 1234, 1238-39 (4th Cir.1989). We find that the district court did not err by concluding that Johnson failed to meet this burden.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">For these reasons, we affirm Johnson\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b902-16\"> To the extent that Johnson argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his standby counsel did not raise this objection at the sentencing hearing, we find that his claim is not cognizable on direct appeal because it does not conclusively appear from the face of the record that counsel was ineffective. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
