The indictment did not include any charge of drug quantity, nor did defendant allocute to any quantity in his guilty plea. Following a <em>Fatico </em>hearing, the district court adopted the drug quantity recommendations in the Presentence Report and, in addition, imposed a four-level offense enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 for defendant\u2019s \u201csupervisory\u201d role. On October 29, 1999, the district court entered judgment sentencing defendant principally to 324 months on the conspiracy count and 240 months on the distribution count, the two sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-16\">On a previous appeal to this Court, we affirmed the district court\u2019s findings of drug quantity, but we found that the district court had not clearly stated that it was finding defendant to be a \u201cleader or organizer\u201d so as to support a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. <em>United States v. Colon, </em>No. 99-1653, 213 F.3d 627 (Table), 2000 WL 637079 (2d Cir. May 17, 2000). We therefore remanded for the district court to clarify its finding. On June 12, 2000, the district court held a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>hearing at which it clarified that it found defendant to be a leader, and again imposed the four-level enhancement. On June 21, 2000, the district court re-entered judgment, sentencing defendant as before, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">On appeal, defendant argues principally that his sentence of 324 months on the conspiracy count is now invalid under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which was announced a few days after the judgment below was entered, because drug quantity was neither charged in the indictment nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>274 F.3d 655, 660 (2d Cir.2001) <em>(en </em>banc) (where no quantity charged in indictment, sentence for cocaine conviction under \u00a7 841 may not exceed statutory maximum of 240 months under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C)). However, any error that may inhere in the sentence of 324 months for the conspiracy count did not affect defendant\u2019s substantial rights, because <em>Apprendi </em>does not affect the district court\u2019s determination that, based on its drug quantity findings, 324 months was the appropriate sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, <em>see United States v. White, </em>240 F.3d 127, 136 (2d Cir.2001), and the \u201cstacking\u201d provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2 would dictate that the district court run the sentences for the two counts consecutively as far as necessary to achieve the same total term of imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Outen, </em>286 F.3d 622, 638 (2d Cir.2002); <em>United States v. McLean, </em>287 F.3d 127, 136 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">With respect to the four-level enhancement imposed by the district court for defendant\u2019s role as a \u201cleader\u201d of the organization, we find no clear error in the facts as found by the district court during the initial sentencing and clarified by the district court on remand. Further, we find that these facts satisfy the requirements for imposing a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
