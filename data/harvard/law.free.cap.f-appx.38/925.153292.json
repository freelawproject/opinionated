Following the denial of his direct appeal, Wright filed a belated motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp. 2001). The district court dismissed the motion, and this Court affirmed that ruling. Thereafter, Wright filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244 (West 1994 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2001) seeking authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We denied that motion. In this \u00a7 2241 petition, Wright raises a challenge to his sentence based upon <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He also brings claims of prosecu-torial misconduct, a <em>Brady </em>violation, and ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court dismissed the petition, stating that \u00a7 2255 is not rendered inadequate or ineffective merely because an individual is unable to obtain relief under that provision. Wright timely noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">We have held that <em>Apprendi </em>claims cannot be initially raised in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 146 (4th Cir.2001). More recently, we held that <em>Apprendi </em>claims are not cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition because <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively and \u00a7 2255 is not rendered inadequate or ineffective merely because a habeas petitioner, such as Wright, is barred from filing a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See San-Miguel v. Dove, </em>291 F.3d 257, 261 n. 2 (4th Cir.2002). Thus, Wright\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>challenge fails under <em>San-Miguel\u2019s </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">The remainder of Wright\u2019s claims are attacks on his judgment of conviction that can be presented, if at all, only in a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255 \u00b6 8. Section 2255 is not rendered inadequate or ineffective merely because a habeas petitioner such as Wright is unable to obtain relief under that provision. <em>See In re: Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Accordingly we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
