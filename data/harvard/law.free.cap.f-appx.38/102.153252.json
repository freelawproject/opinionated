On September 4, 1997, Ocalin Soto was deported from the United States because of an aggravated felony conviction. On November 30, 2000, Soto was again discovered in the United States and arrested. Soto pled guilty to unlawful reentry after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. On appeal, Soto contends the District Court erred in increasing the statutory maximum penalty based upon a prior conviction for an aggravated felony. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), aliens that have been deported and later found in the United States \u201cwhose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony ... shall be fined under such Title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\u201d Based upon a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of III, Soto\u2019s guideline range was set at 46-57 months. The District Court sentenced him to a 46 month term of imprisonment and a three year term of supervised release. Soto contends his prior aggravated felony conviction should not have been used to enhance his sentence because it was not charged in the indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Nonetheless, Soto acknowledges the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) foreclose his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that Congress\u2019 inclusion of the aggravated felony provision in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) reflected only its \u201cinten[t] to set forth a sentencing factor in subsection (b)(2) and not a separate criminal offense.\u201d 523 U.S. at 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219. The Court expressly refused to view the \u201caggravated felony\u201d provision as an element of the offense, stating, \u201cto hold that the Constitution requires that recidivism be deemed an \u2018element\u2019 of petitioner\u2019s offense would mark an abrupt departure from a longstanding tradition of treating recidivism as going to the punishment only.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 118 S.Ct. 1219 (citation and quotation omitted). The ruling in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>was explicitly preserved in <em>Apprendi, </em>where the Court ruled that, \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. As a result, Soto\u2019s arguments are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The judgment and sentence of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
