Lamonica appeals his sentence, arguing that the District Court acted improperly by enhancing the sentence for obstruction of justice and refusing to grant a downward departure for acceptance of responsibility. The District Court made those sentencing determinations after finding that Lamonica threatened the life of a government cooperator, Jeffrey Glickman, in retaliation for that witness\u2019s cooperation with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Lamonica does not dispute that if he threatened to kill Glickman in retaliation for cooperating with the government, then the District Court correctly sentenced him. Instead, Lamonica argues that the District Court had an inadequate factual basis for making this finding. Lamonica concedes, however, that the circumstances surrounding what happened between him and Glick-man \u201cremain in dispute.\u201d Under his preferred interpretation of events, he lacked the requisite intent to obstruct justice or intimidate a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">We will disturb the District Court\u2019s findings of fact in a sentencing matter only if the findings are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>127 F.3d 277, 283 (2d Cir.1997). We find ample evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s conclusion that Lamonica, contrary to his version of events, threatened Glickman\u2019s life in retaliation for Glickman\u2019s cooperation with the government. Most strikingly, Glick-man testified that Lamonica screamed at him, \u2018You said my name to Linda Lacewell [the AUSA on the case]. I know who you are. Remember my face.... I\u2019m going to fuckin\u2019 kill you.\u201d Based on Glickman\u2019s testimony and the testimony of other witnesses, we find no clear error in the District Court\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">In light of the fact that Lamonica threatened to kill Glickman because he cooperated with the government, the District Court properly enhanced Lamonica\u2019s sentence for obstruction of justice and correctly refused to grant a downward departure for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>971 F.2d 876, 893 (2d Cir.1992); <em>United States v. McLeod, </em>251 F.3d 78, 83 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 304, 151 L.Ed.2d 226 (2001). We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
