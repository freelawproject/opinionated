Smith of conspiracy to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base and distribution of cocaine base. Smith was sentenced to 360 months imprisonment. On appeal, Smith claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to fully investigate the case and interview witnesses as Smith requested. We do not find ineffective assistance of counsel conclusively appears on the face of the record and thus deny Smith\u2019s attempt to raise this issue on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1096, 120 S.Ct. 837, 145 L.Ed.2d 704 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-20\">Accordingly, we affirm Smith\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
