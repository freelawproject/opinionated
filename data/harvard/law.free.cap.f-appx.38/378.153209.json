The facts and prior proceedings are known to the parties; they are not recited herein, except as necessary. We dismiss as untimely Rubio-Espinoza\u2019s appeal of Ms conviction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">On October 7, 1999, Rubio-Espinoza\u2019s judgment and commitment was entered on the district court\u2019s docket. He then had 10 days to file a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A) (\u201cIn a criminal case, a defendant\u2019s notice of appeal must be filed m the district court within 10 days after the later of (i) the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed; or (ii) the filing of the government\u2019s notice of appeal.\u201d); Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(6) (\u201cA judgment or order is entered for purposes of this Rule 4(b) when it is entered on the criminal docket.\u201d). These requirements are both mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>United States v. Eccles, </em>850 F.2d 1357, 1363 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Rather than filing a notice of appeal, on October 18, 1999, Rubio-Espinoza filed a waiver of appeal of Ms conviction and sentence. Then, on November 3, 1999, the government filed a notice of appeal of Ru-bio-Espinoza\u2019s sentence only. Rubio-Espinoza thereby was placed on notice of the government\u2019s appeal, and he again had 10 days to seek to withdraw his waiver of appeal or to file a notice of appeal himself. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A)(i)-(ii). He did not do so. His conviction therefore became final, and he was no longer entitled to appeal it directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">This court\u2019s subsequent vacation of Rubio-Espinoza\u2019s sentence, its remand for resentencing, and Rubio-Espinoza\u2019s present appeal after resentencing do not affect the finality of Rubio-Espinoza\u2019s initial judgment of conviction or Ms waiver of its appeal. Section 3582(b) of Title 18 of the United States Code provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE3\">Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence to imprisonment can subsequently be\u2014(1) modified pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c); (2) corrected pursuant to the provisions of rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and section 3742; or (3) appealed and modified, if outside the guideline range, pursuant to the provisions of section 3742; <em>a judgment of conviction that includes such a sentence constitutes a final judgment for all other purposes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">(Emphasis added). Subsequent resentencing proceedings may offer a defendant the opportunity to appeal the sentence imposed on remand, but they do not reset the clock to again allow the defendant to appeal the initial conviction. <em>Cf. United States v. Nagra, </em>147 F.3d 875, 882 (9th Cir.1998) (refusing to review directly defendants\u2019 claims that their pleas were not supported by a factual basis where defendants could have brought these claims m a prior appeal). Further, Rubio-Espinoza did not file a motion m the district court seeking permission to file an out-of-time notice of appeal of the conviction based on \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d and may not seek this relief here. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4), 26(b)(1). We therefore lack jurisdiction over Rubio-Espinoza\u2019s appeal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">We have jurisdiction to review Rubio-Espinoza\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Nonetheless, we reject Rubio-Espinoza\u2019s argument that his sentence violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Rubio-Espinoza concedes that this issue, which he did not raise below, was decided by <em>United States v. Pachedo-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.) (as amended), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 966, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS Rubio-Espinoza\u2019s appeal of his conviction and AFFIRM his sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b404-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\">. Rubio-Espinoza claims that his plea was involuntary because the district court did not sufficiently explain the nature of the charge against him pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
