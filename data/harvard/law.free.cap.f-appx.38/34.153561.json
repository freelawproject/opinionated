The incident giving rise to the underlying litigation\u2014described in the pleadings as a sexual assault perpetrated by a military recruiter on a teenage girl desirous of exploring enlistment opportunities\u2014is nothing short of tragic, and the conduct attributed to the recruiter is unpardonable. The problem, however, is that the FTCA contains an explicit exclusion for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault [or] <em>battery....\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 2680(h). The Supreme Court has described that exclusion as \u201csweeping,\u201d commenting that it not only \u201cbar[s] claims <em>for </em>assault or battery\u201d but also \u201cexcludes any claim <em>arising out of </em>assault or battery.\u201d <em>United States v. Shearer, </em>473 U.S. 52, 55, 105 S.Ct. 3039, 87 L.Ed.2d 38 (1985) (emphasis in original). This case falls squarely within <em>Shearer\u2019s </em>precedential orbit.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-23\">To be sure, the plaintiffs hint at a possible cause of action for breach of some independent governmental duty (such as the duty to train or supervise the lecherous recruiter). But, as the district court persuasively explained, the facts contained in the summary judgment record simply do not sustain any claim of breach. The plaintiffs\u2019 effort to bring their case within the doctrinal reach of <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 786-92, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998), also fails; the plaintiffs did not include a \u201csexual harassment\u201d or \u201chostile environment\u201d ground in their administrative claim under the FTCA, and they have not complied with the antecedent procedural requirements for filing suit under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2000e-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-24\">We need go no further. Where, as here, a trial judge has astutely taken the measure of a case and has handed down not one, but two, carefully considered decisions, <em>see Pi\u00f1ero-Ocana v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Civ. No. 97-1332 (D.P.R. Sept. 29, 2000) (opinion granting summary judgment); <em>Pi\u00f1ero-Ocana v. United States, </em>Civ. No. 97-1332 (D.P.R. Aug. 9, 2001) (order denying reconsideration), \u201can appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\u201d <em>Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co., </em>101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir.1996). In this case, it is enough to say that we affirm the judgment below for essentially the reasons elucidated in Chief Judge Laf-f\u00edtte\u2019s well-reasoned rescripts. The plaintiffs are, of course, free to pursue their tort claims against the recruiter in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\n<em>Affirmed. 1st Cir.
