It is</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED by this Court that the judgment of the District Court appealed from in this cause is hereby affirmed. As the District Court concluded, no reasonable trier of fact could find that defendants\u2019 proffered reasons for terminating plaintiffs employment were false or a pretext for retaliation; nor has plaintiff adduced any evidence demonstrating that he was subject to a hostile work environment. Plaintiff further failed to demonstrate his ability to perform his job duties even with an accommodation, and his refusal to respond to defendants\u2019 requests for information about his disability vitiates his claim that defendants did not engage in an interactive process to determine an appropriate accommodation. Finally, the District Court properly dismissed plaintiff\u2019s due process claim because plaintiff received all the process he was due, and properly dismissed plaintiff\u2019s claim based on the doctrine of <em>United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, </em>347 U.S. 260, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954), assuming that doctrine applied, because any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing <em>en banc. See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
