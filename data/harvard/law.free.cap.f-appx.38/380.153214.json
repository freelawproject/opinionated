Guzman signed a plea agreement that states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">In exchange for the Government\u2019s concessions in this plea agreement, defendant waives, to the full extent of the law, any right to appeal or to collaterally attack the conviction and sentence ... unless the Court imposes a sentence in excess of: the ten-year minimum mandatory sentence, if the Government does not file a motion pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Guzman contends that the government breached the plea agreement by failing to recommend a substantial assistance departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Guzman\u2019s argument lacks merit. The plea agreement leaves it to the government to decide, in its discretion, whether to recommend a downward departure for substantial assistance. This interpretation is confirmed by another portion of the agreement which states: \u201cIf the United States Attorney\u2019s Office decides that the defendant has provided substantial assistance, it may in its sole discretion, file a motion for a downward departure under ... \u00a7 5K1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>See United States v. Burrows, </em>36 F.3d 875, 884 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cSection 5K1.1 deliberately removes from judges the determination of whether or not a given quantum of assistance is substantial, and leaves the decision to prosecutors.\u201d). Even if it had decided that Guzman\u2019s assistance was substantial, the government still retained discretion to decide whether to file a downward departure motion. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (\u201c\u00a7 5K1.1 ... gives the Government a power, not a duty, to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\u201d). Guzman\u2019s breach argument is without support.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Because Guzman waived her right to appeal, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. The appeal is accordingly DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b406-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
