Following a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Mota\u2019s total offense level was calculated at 33. An offense level of 33 with a criminal history category of I yielded a sentencing range of 135-168 months imprisonment. The District Court sentenced Mota to 135 months and five years of supervised release. We have jurisdiction over Mota\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-20\">Mota\u2019s counsel submitted a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending that there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal. Counsel contends that the District Court imposed a legal sentence, had jurisdiction to accept Mota\u2019s guilty plea, and that Mota\u2019s plea was valid, knowing, and voluntary. After thorough examination of the proceedings, we agree with counsel that there are no non-frivolous issues to raise on appeal. Judge Buckwalter\u2019s plea colloquy was thorough and precise, and there has been no suggestion that it did not meet the requirements of Fed. R.Crim. Pro. 11. Moreover, a review of the sentencing hearing transcript reveals that the Court imposed a sentence that met the requirements of Fed. R.Crim. Pro. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-21\">Mota, however, submitted a pro se \u201cInformal Brief\u2019 and a \u201cSupplemental Reply Brief\u2019 contending (1) that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional per se or void for vagueness because, among other things, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>lacks a penalty element; (2) that the District Court was without jurisdiction to impose a sentence because no penalty was identified in the indictment; (8) that the indictment was insufficient because the grand jury \u201cdid not pass\u201d on the type or quantity of drugs involved; (4) that his sentence of 135 months imprisonment and five years of supervised release impermis-sibly exceeded the maximum guideline and statutory sentences available; and (5) that the District Court improperly enhanced his sentence by two levels for possession of a firearm because the government failed to demonstrate that he \u201cPOSSESSED\u201d a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The bulk of Mota\u2019s contentions are predicated on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Contrary to Mota\u2019s assertion, \u00a7 841 is not \u201cvoid for vagueness as written for ... failing to provide a floor penalty for the \u00a7 841(a) offenses at all.\u201d Memo, in Support of Informal Br. at 2. We recently rejected such an <em>Apprendi </em>challenge to \u00a7 841. <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>272 F.3d 622, 623-24 (3d Cir.2001). Mota\u2019s contentions that the penalty and type and quantity of drugs had to be submitted to the grand jury or to the jury have also been previously rejected. <em>United States v. Vazquez, </em>271 F.3d 93, 98 (3d Cir.2001) (en banc) (\u201c[A]n <em>Apprendi </em>violation only occurs if the drug quantity is not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt and the defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 841 exceeds 20 years.\u201d); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>235 F.3d 858, 862-64 (3d Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 49, 151 L.Ed.2d 19 (2001); <em>United States v. Cepera, </em>224 F.3d 256, 267 n. 5 (3d Cir.2000) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1114, 121 S.Ct. 861, 148 L.Ed.2d 774 (2001). Moreover, because the 135 month sentence and five-year term of supervised release did not exceed the maximum period provided by statute, Mota\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>challenge to his sentence in those respects also fails. <em>Vazquez, </em>271 F.3d at 98, 107 (the term of imprisonment and the 5-year supervised release term were within the range that the court was authorized to impose).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Finally, Mota challenges the District Court\u2019s two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm under U.S.S.G. 2D1.1(b)(1). We review this determination for plain error, as it was not raised before the District Court. Given the presence of a loaded .38 caliber handgun in Mota\u2019s residence where and when drugs and drug paraphernalia were seized, the District Court did not err in imposing that enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">For the foregoing reasons, and after carefully considering all of the arguments raised on appeal, we will grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and will affirm the judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
