Specifically, the Bynums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>challenge admission of hearsay statements by Hazelene Little, who was Barbara\u2019s sister and Tico\u2019s aunt, linking them with the crimes charged. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">The Government\u2019s investigation of the conduct for which the Bynums were convicted initially led to Little, who was terminally ill and close to death. A federal agent twice interviewed Little with her consent at her residence, without indicating whether she would be charged as a result of his investigation. During the first interview, Little identified her nephew Tico as the individual who requested and facilitated her opening of a checking account on which forged checks would be written. During the second interview, she identified a disguised female suspect who was photographed while attempting to pass a forged check as her sister, Barbara Bynum. Little died prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">The Bynums\u2019 challenge to the district court\u2019s admission of Little\u2019s statements under Fed.R.Evid. 807 is unpersuasive. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding the reliability of the statements for clear error, <em>see United States v. Brothers Constr. Co. of Ohio, </em>219 F.3d 300, 309 (4th Cir.2000), and conclude the court properly identified facts that provided a particularized circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>69 F.3d 1249, 1253 (4th Cir.1995). Furthermore, we find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Little\u2019s statements were material, more probative than other evidence reasonably available to the prosecution, and that their admission would serve the interests of justice and comply with the purpose of the Rules of Evidence. <em>See </em>Rule 807. We therefore find no abuse of discretion in the admission of the hearsay statements. <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>951 F.2d 580, 582 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Accordingly, the Bynums\u2019 convictions are affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
