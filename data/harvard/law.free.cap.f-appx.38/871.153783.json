Hayton appeals the district court\u2019s two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 and the court\u2019s refusal to grant him credit for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. We affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The events leading up to Hayton\u2019s conviction and sentence began on July 8, 2000, when two deputies from the Mingo County, West Virginia, Sheriff's Department, Deputy Nathan Glanden and Deputy Steve McAllister, went to Hayton\u2019s house to serve him with a domestic violence petition and a restraining order. Hayton was not home. Hayton\u2019s wife told the deputies that Hayton had left for his mother\u2019s house in his Ford Ranger truck. The officers found Hayton and his truck in his mother\u2019s driveway. Deputy Glanden served the papers on Hayton and advised him that he could not have any firearms. At that point Hayton\u2019s wife, who had followed the deputies, asked Hayton, \u2018What did you do with the guns?\u201d Hayton answered, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about my guns.\u201d When Deputy Glanden asked Hayton if he had any firearms, Hayton responded that he had none. Deputy Glanden looked through a side window of Hayton\u2019s truck and saw the stock of a shotgun sticking out from the corner of a camouflage blanket. After walking to the other side of the truck and looking through another window, the deputy spotted more guns. According to Deputy Glanden, he asked Hayton for the keys to the truck, which Hayton gave him. The deputy found nine firearms in the truck. Mrs. Hayton then volunteered that Hayton was a convicted felon. After radioing their dispatcher for a criminal history check, the deputies seized the guns and arrested Hayton for state firearms violations. Hayton was released on bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Ten days later, on July 18, 2000, Deputy Glanden and Corporal Sidney Gilman arrested Hayton for domestic assault. After he was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Hayton gave a statement to Corporal Gilman that was taped. Hayton acknowledged on the tape that he had received and understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights. In the statement Hayton admitted that he owned the firearms recovered on July 8, 2000, and that he obtained most of the guns by trading game chickens for them or by buying them from people he knew. He further admitted that he had piled all of his guns into his truck and taken them to his mother\u2019s because his wife was \u201craising Cain\u201d and because he knew he was not supposed to have any firearms. On November 14, 2000, Hayton was charged in a superseding federal indictment with being a felon in possession of nine firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Hayton moved to suppress the firearms and his taped statement. At the suppression hearing, held on December 7, 2000, Hayton claimed among other things that when the officers searched his truck on July 8, he did not give them the keys or consent to the search; that he had not been read <em>Miranda </em>warnings before he made the statement on July 18 and that he had initialed a <em>Miranda </em>form without understanding it; that the firearms in the truck were not his; and that Corporal Gilman tricked him into admitting the guns were his by promising him that he would not be prosecuted if he confessed on tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">The district court denied the motion to suppress, finding that Hayton had consented to the search of his truck and that Hayton had received and understood all <em>Miranda </em>warnings before making his July 18 confession. The court also found that the confession was not the result of duress or deceit: \u201cIt is suggested that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>dant was tricked into making the statement and had been given a promise by the officer that he would not be prosecuted beforehand, all of which statements on the part of the defendant the Court finds not credible.\u201d In short, the district court concluded that Hayton had testified falsely during his suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Hayton pled guilty to unlawful possession of nine firearms by a convicted felon on December 14, 2000. He acknowledged that the guns were his and that he had swapped game chickens for some, which is what he had said in his taped confession. On March 13, 2001, he was sentenced to 120 months in prison and three years of supervised release. In imposing this sentence, the district court increased Hayton\u2019s offense level by two for obstruction of justice (testifying falsely at the suppression hearing), see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, and denied any adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. The district court explained the obstruction of justice enhancement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-6\">The Court finds that at the suppression hearing, the defendant did testify falsely in several respects. In particular, the defendant testified falsely that he had been tricked into making the taped statement that was taken by the officers on that occasion, and similarly he testified falsely in stating that he had been given a promise by the officer that he would not be prosecuted if he made the statement. And the Court found at the time of ruling on the motion to suppress, that the defendant\u2019s testimony given at that hearing was not credible, and consequently concluded to deny the motion to suppress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-7\">The Court similarly finds here that the defendant has, by a preponderance of the evidence, plainly impeded administration of justice in this case by thwarting the prosecution of the case at the motion to suppress hearing, and accordingly finds that the defendant has engaged in an obstruction of justice that merits a two level enhancement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">Hayton appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">Hayton first argues that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. This guideline provides for a two-level enhancement for obstructing or impeding the administration of justice. The commentary lists perjury as an example of conduct that triggers this enhancement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 4(b) (2001); <em>see also United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 93-95, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993) (obstruction of justice enhancement proper when defendant commits perjury). We have held that \u00a7 3C1.1 applies to perjury committed at a suppression hearing. <em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 205 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">Hayton claims that his \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement was improper because <em>Dunnigan </em>requires that the district court make specific findings with regard to each element of perjury as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621. Hayton is only partly correct. The <em>Dunnigan </em>Court did say that in determining what constitutes perjury the district court must rely on the definition of perjury provided by \u00a7 1621 and that \u201c[a] witness testifying under oath or affirmation violates this statute if she gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. at 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">However, while <em>Dunnigan </em>encourages the district court to separately address each of the three elements of perjury (falsity, materiality, and willfulness), it does not require that each of the elements be mentioned by name. Rather, it is enough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>if the court \u201cspecifically identifies] the perjurious statements,\u201d <em>Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d at 205, and \u201cmakes a finding of obstruction of, or impediment to, justice that encompasses all the factual predicates for a finding of perjury.\u201d <em>Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. at 95, 113 S.Ct. 1111. Hayton maintains that the district court erred because it failed to mention or cover materiality or willfulness. Although this case presents a somewhat close question, we believe that the district court satisfied the <em>Dunnigan </em>requirements by making factual findings from which materiality and willfulness can be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">We have held that a district court fails to satisfy <em>Dunnigan </em>when its findings are so bare that no inferences can be drawn about the essential elements of perjury. <em>See United States v. Stotts, </em>113 F.3d 493, 497-98 (4th Cir.1997) (concluding that <em>Dunnigan </em>standards were not met when district court merely said, [the defendant] falsely testified at trial.\u201d); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>62 F.3d 641, 647 (4th Cir.1995) (vacating \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement because district court denied objections to the enhancement with no more than \u201cAll right. Well, I will deny the objection to the increase for obstruction of justice.\u201d). On the other hand, we have affirmed a \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement when the \u201cdistrict court, having observed the testimony, found by a preponderance of the evidence that [the defendant] had \u2018not testified] truthfully at trial with regard to the actual drug transaction and also with regard to [a companion\u2019s] age and also with regard to the gun at the time of the transaction.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Cook, </em>76 F.3d 596, 605 (4th Cir.1996). Although the district court in <em>Cook </em>did not specifically mention materiality and willfulness, we nevertheless held: \u201cAlthough the district court did not fully articulate its analysis, its conclusion that [the defendant] had not testified truthfully, and that his testimony was \u2018strained\u2019 in relation to material facts about which he had already confessed, was sufficient to show that the court did find that [the defendant] willfully obstructed justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also affirmed the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement in <em>Ak-inkoye </em>because the essential elements could be inferred from the district court\u2019s finding \u201cthat [the defendant] lied when he stated that he did not make any of the statements attributed to him, and that the issue of whether the statements were lawfully obtained \u2018was the whole hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Here, the district court expressly found that Hayton had testified falsely in several respects during his suppression hearing. In particular, the court found that Hayton lied when he said an officer tricked him into confessing and that he lied when he said the officer promised that he would not be prosecuted if he made the taped confession. This false testimony is directly relevant to the question of whether Hayton\u2019s taped confession was admissible. And the taped confession, in which Hayton admitted owning the nine guns found in his truck, is material to his felon-in-possession charge. The court\u2019s finding that Hayton testified falsely about the voluntariness of his confession in an attempt to \u201cthwart[ ] the prosecution of the case\u201d is sufficient to show that the court found that Hayton willfully obstructed justice. The district court therefore did not err in imposing a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Hayton next argues that the district court improperly denied him credit for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SE1.1. Only in extraordinary circumstances may a defendant who is found to have obstructed justice receive credit for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">\u201cConduct resulting in an enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct. There may, however, be extraordinary cases in which adjustments under both \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 and 3E1.1 may apply.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SE1.1, cmt. n. 4 (2001). <em>See United States v. Murray, </em>65 F.3d 1161, 1165-66 (4th Cir.1995). Hayton has offered no reason why his case should be considered extraordinary. Consequently, the district court did not err in denying credit under \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Hayton\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b878-5\"> Although we affirm the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement, we note that it would have been better had the district court made more direct findings with regard to materiality and willfulness. <em>See Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. at 95, 113 S.Ct. 1111 (\"[I]t is preferable for a district court to address each element of the alleged perjury in a separate and clear finding.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
