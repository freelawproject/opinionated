Ingram appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his habeas petition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (1994). Following his conviction and sentencing in 1995,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ingram appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed. The Supreme Court denied Ingram\u2019s subsequent request for grant of certiorari. He then filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp. 2001) to set aside, vacate, or correct his sentence, which the Eleventh Circuit denied. After the Supreme Court announced its decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Ingram filed a motion for authorization under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244 (West 1994 &amp; Supp. 2001) to file a successive motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp. 2001) in order to raise an <em>Apprendi </em>claim. The Eleventh Circuit denied the motion, holding <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable. Ingram then filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition which the district court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">We recently held that <em>Apprendi </em>claims are not cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition because <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively and \u00a7 2255 is not rendered inadequate or ineffective merely because a ha-beas petitioner, such as Ingram, is barred from filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See San-Miguel v. Dove, </em>291 F.3d 257, 261 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2 (4th Cir.2002). Therefore, Ingram cannot circumvent \u00a7 2255\u2019s bar against filing successive habeas motions by bringing the same claim in a \u00a7 2241 petition and hence, his <em>Apprendi </em>claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-15\">Accordingly, we grant Ingram\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and affirm the judgment of district court as modified to reflect the dismissal of this claim is with prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Ingram v. Dove, </em>No. CA-01-932 (D.S.C. July 24, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-12\">. The record does not identify the federal district court in which Ingram's conviction and sentence occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-13\">. The district court dismissed Ingram's petition without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Given our disposition in light of <em>San-Miguel, </em>we find exhaustion would not render Ingram\u2019s claim cognizable and thus his claim is dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
