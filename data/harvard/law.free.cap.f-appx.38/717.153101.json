We granted Johnson a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Certificate of Appealability (CAPP), pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c), limited to the single issue of whether Johnson\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to seek a cautionary jury instruction relating to witness identification, pursuant to <em>Pennsylvania v. Kloiber, </em>378 Pa. 412, 106 A.2d 820 (1954). Because we find no error in the District Court\u2019s decision, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">On July 30, 1991, Johnson and co-defendant Curtis Simmons were found guilty by a jury, in the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas, of murder in the second degree under Pennsylvania\u2019s felony murder statute, criminal conspiracy, burglary, and two counts of robbery. The charges arose out of Johnson and Simmons\u2019 collaboration in the robbery of a corner pizza shop in West Philadelphia, during which the store\u2019s 69-year-old owner was beaten to death and then locked in his restaurant\u2019s refrigerated meat locker. The court imposed mandatory life sentences for the murder convictions but deferred further sentencing until it reviewed pre-sentencing reports and post-verdict motions for both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">On February 2, 1993 the Judge in the Court of Common Pleas denied Johnson\u2019s motions but reserved judgment as to Simmons\u2019 post-verdict motions. The judge eventually granted Simmons\u2019 motion for a new trial, based on Simmons claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to request a cautionary jury instruction regarding uncertain witness identification testimony, pursuant to <em>Pennsylvania v. Kloiber, </em>378 Pa. 412, 106 A.2d 820 (1954). In Kloiber, the court held that \u201cwhere the witness is not in a position to clearly observe the assailant, or he is not positive as to identity, or his positive statements as to identity are weakened by qualification or by failure to identify defendant on one or more prior occasions ... the Court should warn the jury that the testimony as to identity must be received with caution.\u201d See, <em>Kloiber </em>106 A.2d at 826-827.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The Commonwealth appealed the Judge\u2019s decision to grant Simmons a new trial but the appeal was rejected in <em>Commonwealth v. Simmons, </em>436 Pa.Super. 203, 647 A.2d 568 (Pa.Super.1994). Prior to the commencement of his new trial, Simmons pled guilty to third degree murder. Johnson eventually exhausted all of his appeals in the Pennsylvania courts and, on September 23, 1999, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Johnson\u2019s petition raised various claims relating to his trial. His principal claim was that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to request a cautionary jury instruction regarding uncertain witness identification testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">In April 2000, the Magistrate Judge filed a 20-page Report recommending denial of Johnson\u2019s claims and dismissal of his petition. See, App. at 17-36. In July 2000, the District Court issued an Order in which it approved and adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, and denied Johnson\u2019s Petition for ha-beas relief. See, App. at 37. In its Order, the District Court also determined that no probable cause existed to issue a CAPP because Johnson had not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">On Johnson\u2019s petition for leave to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of habeas relief, we granted a CAPP on the question of whether Johnson\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to seek a jury instruction pursuant to <em>Pennsylvania v. Kloiber.\u201d </em>Also, we directed the Clerk to appoint counsel for Johnson. See, App. at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">After a thorough and careful review of the record, we now affirm the Order of the District Court, substantially for the reasons stated by the Magistrate Judge in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>persuasive and well-reasoned Report. We pause only to note that, even though Johnson\u2019s co-defendant, Simmons, was granted a new trial for substantially the same claim that Johnson now makes, the Magistrate Judge clearly identified the distinguishing factors that allowed her to determine that \u201c[Johnson] failed to show that his trial counsel\u2019s alleged deficient conduct prejudiced his defense,\u201d as required under the applicable Supreme Court precedent. See, <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Specifically, the Magistrate Judge noted that eyewitness testimony was the only direct evidence placing co-defendant Simmons at the scene of the crime. However, Johnson gave a statement to the police in which he placed himself at the crime scene as an accomplice. As the Magistrate Judge pointed out, this confession brought Johnson squarely within the definition of an accomplice to a felony under Pennsylvania law. See, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502(b) (stating that \u201c[a] criminal homicide constitutes murder of the second degree when it is committed while defendant was engaged as a principal or an accomplice in the perpetration of a felony.\u201d [emphasis added] ). In addition, two witnesses offered further incriminating identification testimony when they stated at trial that Johnson had tried but failed to rob the same pizza shop the week before, and had told them that he was going to return there to \u201cget that money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">In sum, we agree with the Magistrate Judge\u2019s conclusion that Johnson is \u201cunable to show that, \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, but for [his] counsel\u2019s [alleged] unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d App. at 36, quoting, <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED and Johnson\u2019s petition for habeas relief is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
