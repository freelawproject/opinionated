In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that defendant failed, in violation of the reinsurance contracts, to indemnify plaintiffs and acted negligently in the appointment and supervision of defendant\u2019s alleged agents. Defendant denies that these agents had either actual or apparent authority to bind defendant under the reinsurance contracts, but asserts nonetheless that plaintiffs\u2019 claims are arbitrable pursuant to the arbitration clauses in the reinsurance contracts. However, plaintiffs argue that since defendant disputes the existence of the reinsurance contracts, the Court must first determine whether the contracts are valid before their arbitration provisions may be invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-16\">The reinsurance contracts at issue each contain a provision calling for dispute resolution by arbitration that states in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Any unresolved difference of opinion between the REINSURER and the CE-DENT with respect to the interpretation of this POLICY or the performance of the obligations under this POLICY including its formation and validity, whether such dispute arises before or after the termination of this POLICY, shall be submitted to arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-5\"><em>See, e.g., </em>Compl., Ex. A at 6, \u00b6 Q.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We agree with the District Court substantially for the reasons stated in its September 7, 2001 Memorandum and Order. <em>See Bank of Am., N. A. v. Diamond State Ins. Co., </em>No. 01-0645, 2001 WL 1029410 (Sept. 7, 2001). As the District Court observed, it is well settled that a court cannot compel arbitration until it first resolves \u201cthe question of the very existence\u201d of the contract embodying the arbitration clause. <em>Interocean Shipping Co. v. Nat\u2019l Shipping &amp; Trading Corp., </em>462 F.2d 673, 676 (2d Cir.1972); <em>see also In re Interbras Cayman Co. v. Orient Victory Shipping Co., S.A., </em>663 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir.1981). That is, \u201c[i]f the making of the agreement to arbitrate is placed in issue ... the court must set the issue for trial,\u201d <em>Sphere Drake Ins. Ltd. v. Clarendon Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>263 F.3d 26, 30 (2d Cir.2001), as the District Court did here, <em>see Bank of Am., </em>2001 WL 1029410, at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">\u201c[Arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T Techs., Inc. v. Communications Workers of Am., </em>475 U.S. 643, 648, 106 S.Ct. 1415, 89 L.Ed.2d 648 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]he question of arbitrability\u2014whether a[n] ... agreement creates a duty for the parties to arbitrate the particular grievance\u2014is undeniably an issue for judicial determination. Unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise, the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be decided by the court, not the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649. That is because \u201carbitrators derive their authority to resolve disputes only because the parties have agreed in advance to submit such grievances to arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648-49. In the instant case, where the reinsurance contracts embodying the arbitration provisions are the sole authority for requiring the parties to submit to arbitration, there is no legal basis for compelling arbitration if, as defendant contends, these contracts do not exist. Likewise, there would be no source of authority empowering the arbitrators to decide this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Defendant contends that plaintiffs should not be permitted to oppose arbitration while at the same time prosecuting this lawsuit to enforce the reinsurance contracts which contain the arbitration provision. This position is problematic for several reasons. First, it requires us initially to assume without deciding the central issue in this case: that the reinsurance contracts exist. Second, we do not agree that the arbitration provisions of the reinsurance contracts at issue \u201cclearly and unmistakably provide\u201d that the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be decided by an arbitrator. <em>Id. </em>at 649. While the arbitration provisions state that issues concerning the \u201cformation and validity\u201d of the contracts \u201cshall be submitted to arbitration,\u201d <em>see, e.g., </em>Compl., Ex. A at 6, \u00b6 Q, it is not clear that this includes the question of the <em>very existence of the contract. </em>In other words, this language could simply mean-that, assuming the existence of the contracts, the parties must arbitrate issues of formation and validity that affect enforceability, such as a dispute over fraud in the inducement of a contract. <em>See, e.g., Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 406, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967). Third, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>plaintiff Bank of America, N.A. insists that the reinsurance contracts do exist, it also argues that it is merely an assignee of plaintiff Platinum Indemnity Limited\u2019s \u201crights and remedies\u201d but not \u201cobligations\u201d under the policies and that, as such, Bank of America, N.A. did not assume a duty to arbitrate. Appellee\u2019s Br. at 9-10. As the District Court understood, this claim need not be addressed until the question of the existence of the reinsurance contracts is settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Finally, we hold that sufficient evidence has been produced substantiating an unequivocal denial that the agreement was made and thereby warranting a trial. <em>See Sphere Drake, </em>263 F.3d at 30; <em>Interocean Shipping, </em>462 F.2d at 676; <em>Almacenes Fernandez, S.A. v. Golodetz, </em>148 F.2d 625, 628 (2d Cir.1945). Here, defendant has repeatedly and unambiguously asserted that the reinsurance contracts are void because its agents had no authority to form those contracts. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Arbitration Demand Letter of 3/16/01 at 1; Def.\u2019s Notice of Mot. to Stay Action and Compel Arbitration at 1; Def.\u2019s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. to Stay Action and Compel Arbitration at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">For the reasons set forth above and substantially for the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s September 7, 2001 Memorandum and Order, <em>see Bank of Am., </em>2001 WL 1029410, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
