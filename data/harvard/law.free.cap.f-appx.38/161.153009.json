On appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction and the two-level enhancement imposed under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) (2000) for possession of a stolen firearm. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Miller first claims that there was insufficient evidence that he possessed a firearm. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence challenge on direct review, the relevant standard is whether the record contains \u201csubstantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support\u201d the jury\u2019s finding. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Moreover, an appellate court\u2019s reversal of a conviction on grounds of insufficient evidence should be confined to cases where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>735 F.2d 785, 791 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Here, Marilyn Kirk and Amanda Martin testified that Miller possessed a gun at a gas station and inside Kirk\u2019s home. In addition, an officer seized a loaded gun <em>from </em>under a rag <em>in </em>close proximity to Miller. Undoubtedly, this testimony is sufficient to prove possession. Miller is essentially arguing that the witnesses\u2019 testimony was not credible. However, this determination is within the province of the jury, and we will not overturn it. <em>See United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1070 (4th Cir.1997) (jury is sole judge of witness credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Next, Miller asserts that the district court improperly increased his sentence under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) because there was insufficient proof that the firearm was stolen. However, the owner of the gun testified that it was indeed stolen. Again, Miller\u2019s claim essentially challenges the owner\u2019s credibility. However, the district court\u2019s decision to credit this testimony was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1095 (4th Cir.1995) (noting that resolution of factual dispute based on credibility of witnesses is not clearly erroneous).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">Thus, we affirm Miller\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
