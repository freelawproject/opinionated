Darden timely appealed his sentence. We have jurisdiction over Darden\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and for the reasons expressed below, we AFFIRM Darden\u2019s convictions, VACATE his sentence, and REMAND for the limited purpose of providing the district court the opportunity to comply with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">1. Computation of Tax Loss</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Darden points out that the statute under which he was convicted, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206 (\u201c\u00a7 7206\u201d), authorizes a three-year maximum term of imprisonment, or thirty-six months, and that he received a forty-one month sentence based primarily on the district judge\u2019s well-documented factual finding that he caused $1.6 million in \u201ctax loss.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2T1.4, 2T4.1. Darden claims that these circumstances violate the constitutional rule expounded in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">Darden failed to make this argument to the district court, so we review his claim for plain error. Plain error requires (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If these three conditions are met, we may reverse, but \u201conly if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 735; <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-16\">Had Darden been convicted of a single violation of \u00a7 7206, his argument might have merit. However, Darden pled guilty to <em>twelve </em>counts of violating \u00a7 7206. Because district courts have discretion to run consecutively the sentences for separate counts, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584 (2000), the statutory maximum for any one count does not necessarily cap the total punishment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d) (instructing district courts to sentence defendants on a consecutive basis when \u201cthe highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment\u201d provided under the Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-17\">In Darden\u2019s case, each of the twelve fraudulent tax return counts carried a three-year statutory maximum, for a potential maximum punishment of thirty-six years\u2019 imprisonment. Darden was never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\u201cexposed\u201d to a sentence in excess of thirty-six years, and therefore no <em>Apprendi </em>violation occurred. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Guizar, </em>234 F.3d 483, 488 (9th Cir.2000). Furthermore, because Darden\u2019s actual sentence of forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment falls well below the thirty-six year statutory maximum to which he was subject, his substantial rights were not affected, and we need not reverse. <em>See United States v. Kentz, </em>251 F.3d 835, 842 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Darden next contends that it is impermissible to \u201cstack\u201d his twelve counts together to arrive at a thirty-six year statutory maximum. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Kentz. See id.; see also United States v. Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc); <em>United States v. Sturgis, </em>238 F.3d 956, 959-960 (8th Cir.2001) (same); <em>United States v. Page, </em>232 F.3d 536, 544 (6th Cir.2000) (same); <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>246 F.3d 56, 62 n. 4 (1st Cir.2001) (collecting cases that have found the availability of consecutive sentences sufficient to defeat claims of plain error in the <em>Apprendi </em>context).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Darden finally argues that the district court violated U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d) by sentencing him to forty-one months for each of his twelve convictions because forty-one months exceeds the thirty-six month statutory maximum for any single count. The government concedes the point. Guidelines section 5G1.2(d) states: \u201cIf the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment [provided by the Guidelines] then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d). To comply with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d), the district court should have sentenced Darden, for example, to (1) thirty-six months on counts one through eleven, to run concurrently, and (2) five months on count twelve, to run consecutively. Accordingly, we vacate Darden\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for the limited purpose of allowing the court to comply with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">2. Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The district court granted Darden a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility because he pleaded guilty and expressed remorse for his participation in this offense, but the court refused to grant Darden an additional one-level reduction. Darden claims he was entitled to the additional one-level reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">We need not address this claim. If \u201cthe district court would have imposed the same sentence regardless of its determination on the [challenged sentencing issue], our resolution of the parties\u2019 dispute on this matter would be purely advisory.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>912 F.2d 344, 348 (9th Cir.1990); <em>accord United States v. Munster-Ramirez, </em>888 F.2d 1267, 1273 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">In this case, the district court stated on the record that even if Darden was entitled to the additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, it still would have sentenced him to forty-one months in prison. Accordingly, we need not address this particular argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">3. Darden\u2019s Previous State Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">Finally, Darden claims that the district court erred by considering his 1992 California state conviction in determining his criminal history category. According to Darden, that prior conviction has been \u201cexpunged\u201d because he successfully petitioned the California Court of Appeal to discharge the conviction pursuant to California Penal Code Section 1203.4. <em>See </em>Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 1203.4 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Darden is correct that \u201cexpunged\u201d convictions are not to be counted in developing an offender\u2019s criminal offense history. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(j). In contrast, convictions that have been \u201cset aside ... for reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law\u201d are not formally expunged and should be counted in computing an offender\u2019s criminal history. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Darden\u2019s successful petition under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 1203.4 merely set aside his conviction; it did not expunge it. <em>See United States v. Hayden, 255 </em>F.3d 768, 772-74 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cA section 1203.4 order does not \u2018erase\u2019 or \u2018expunge\u2019 a prior conviction.\u201d). Because Darden\u2019s previous conviction was merely \u201cset aside,\u201d the court properly considered it in determining Darden\u2019s criminal history category. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">AFFIRMED in part, sentence VACATED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b423-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
