Bright, United States Circuit Judge</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b128-17\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b128-18\">SCIRICA, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b128-19\">This is an appeal from a criminal conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-21\">John Meyers, a failed general contractor, represented himself as an experienced bank debenture trader and the head of RWAI Group, Inc., an \u201cinternational investment group.\u201d Meyers provided poten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>tial investors a list of his \u201cclients,\u201d all affluent individuals, who had invested \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d with him. Meyers told potential clients their investments, like those on the list, would be protected in escrow accounts and by other procedural stratagems, and that he would take no commissions from those sums. Several investors deposited a total of $1,625,000 in RWAI, with promises of million-dollar returns. Meyers used $475,000 of this money for personal purchases. Only $300,000 was invested in bank debenture programs. Some clients lost every dollar invested.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">A jury convicted Meyers of all charges in a thirty-seven-count indictment of wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, engaging in illegal transactions, and making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He was ordered to forfeit $1.25 million, two automobiles and offshore funds. Meyers was sentenced to 131 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">The District Court permitted the testimony of Gerald Robinson, an attorney who had represented RWAI and Meyers in prior civil litigation. Meyers contends Robinson\u2019s testimony violated his attorney-client privilege and the attorney-work-product doctrine. But Robinson testified only to Meyers\u2019s prior business practices and history, not \u201cprivate communications.\u201d That Meyers had filed for bankruptcy and been involved in lawsuits were matters of public record. Neither the attorney-client privilege nor the work-product doctrine was implicated in Robinson\u2019s testimony. Accord <em>Hickman v. Taylor, </em>329 U.S. 495, 508, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947). We review for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Console, </em>13 F.3d 641, 659 (3d Cir.1993). Robinson\u2019s testimony demonstrated Meyers misled potential clients about his past qualifications and experience. Investors detrimentally relied on Meyers\u2019s representations. We see no error in admitting Robinson\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">Prior to trial, the District Court ruled Herbert Biern could testify as an expert of bank debenture programs, but could not testify whether Meyers\u2019s investment plan was fraudulent. Meyers suggests Biern \u201cimplicitly\u201d violated the order by encouraging an inference that Meyers was guilty. Meyers failed to object, so we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Biern\u2019s testimony focused on banking terminology, the accuracy of representations made about the Federal Reserve Board, and certain documents. It did not \u201cseriously affect[] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citation omitted). The Court was well within its sound discretion in allowing this testimony. <em>Cf. Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 158, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999) (\u201cRule 702 grants the district judge the discretionary authority, reviewable for its abuse, to determine reliability in light of the particular facts and circumstances of the particular case.\u201d). We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">Meyers contends the evidence did not demonstrate the, offshore trading program he \u201cestablished\u201d constituted an illegal scheme to defraud, because he honestly believed the program existed. Reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the evidence in the iight most favorable to the government, <em>United States v. Coyle, </em>63 F.3d 1239, 1243 (3d Cir.1995), we find \u201csubstantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Paramo, </em>998 F.2d 1212, 1216 (3d Cir.1993). Witnesses testified Meyers intentionally misled his clients and federal investigators about the offshore trading program. We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Meyers claims statements he made to potential investors concerning his financial acumen and his \u201chumanitarian\u201d motives were \u201cpuffing,\u201d not illegal misrepresentations. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, <em>Coyle, </em>63 F.3d at 1243, Meyers\u2019s statements were \u201cmaterial\u201d to his conviction. Several of Meyers\u2019s clients testified his biographical statements influenced their decision to provide him funds for investment. Additionally, the government presented evidence that Meyers had lied to investors and federal agents about the disposition of \u201cinvested\u201d funds. These statements, not Meyers\u2019s self-aggrandizing biographical boastings, provided sufficient evidence for his convictions of mail and wire fraud. <em>Cf. In re Weinroth, </em>439 F.2d 787, 787-88 (3d Cir.1971). We will not disturb the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Meyers alleges his sentence was inappropriately enhanced, in violation of <em>Ap-prendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We disagree. The jury found the fraudulent scheme involved $1,250,000. The District Court\u2019s calculated loss to RWAI\u2019s three joint venture partners ($400,000) was well within this amount, rendering Apprendi inapplicable. We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">For the foregoing reasons we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
