(\u201cOtto Bock Germany\u201d) and Otto Bock Orthopedic Industry, Inc. (\u201cOtto Bock Minnesota\u201d) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. On November 16, 2000, the Court dismissed with prejudice her claims against Otto Bock Minnesota under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). On January 9, 2001, the Court dismissed with prejudice Khalil\u2019s claims against Otto Bock Germany for lack of personal jurisdiction. Khalil appeals from the order of January 9, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-23\">The only issue we need discuss is whether we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 to hear Khalil\u2019s appeal. An order is not final unless it disposes of all remaining claims between the parties. The order of January 9, 2001, disposed of Khalil\u2019s remaining claims, but did so without prejudice. An order dismissing a claim without prejudice is not appealable unless the plaintiff either cannot amend her complaint <em>(e.g., </em>because the statute of limitations has run) or declares that she will stand on her complaint. <em>Semerenko v. Cendant Corp., </em>223 F.3d 165, 172 (3d Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>2000); <em>Shapiro v. UJB Fin. Corp., </em>964 F.2d 272, 278 (3d Cir.1992); <em>Borelli v. City of Reading, </em>532 F.2d 950, 951-52 (3d Cir.1976). Khalil does not maintain that she is unable to amend her complaint, nor could she\u2014the last instance of alleged misconduct underlying her claims occurred in 1999, and the statute of limitations for claims under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act is six years. <em>Mirra v. Holland America Line, </em>331 N.J.Super. 86, 751 A.2d 138, 140 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.2000). Khalil did not declare before the District Court or in the briefs she submitted to our Court that she would stand on her complaint. We would nevertheless have a final order if her counsel \u201cstated unequivocally\u201d at oral argument that she would stand on her complaint. <em>See Remick v. Manfredy, </em>238 F.3d 248, 254 (3d Cir.2001). But counsel did not, despite our asking him several times whether he wished to do so. Therefore, the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Khalil\u2019s complaint is not a final order, and we thus lack jurisdiction to hear Khalil\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-6\">.
