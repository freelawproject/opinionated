We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-18\">Inasmuch as we write only for the parties, we will not set forth the factual background of this litigation. We have reviewed the Memorandum and Order filed by the district court on August 9, 2001 explaining the court\u2019s reasons for granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment against the plaintiffs. In that Memorandum, the court cogently and thoroughly explained why plaintiffs\u2019 claims were dismissed. We agree with the court\u2019s reasoning and will affirm substantially for the reasons set forth by the court in the thoughtful Memorandum and Order of August 9, 2001.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
