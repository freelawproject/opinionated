It is</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the District Court is hereby affirmed. Appellant challenges the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress tangible evidence on the grounds that sufficient objective information did not support a search under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). The uncontested factual findings of the District Court and more specific Supreme Court authority, however, amply support the search. Appellant concedes, as he must, that <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977), allowed the officer to order him out of his car during a traffic stop. Here, the officer noticed a bulge in appellant\u2019s pocket and furtive behavior by appellant to shield the pocket from view. Under <em>Mimms, </em>the bulge and furtive behavior gave the officer authority to conduct a limited patdown of that pocket. During the patdown, the officer contemporaneously stated that \u2018You have crack\u201d as the officer patted down the pocket. Appellant does not contest the factual findings of the District Court or claim that the patdown involved impermissible manipulation or palpation to determine the exact contents of the pocket. As such, the officer\u2019s limited patdown coupled with the contemporaneous observation that appellant had crack cocaine brings the search within the scope of the \u201cplain feel\u201d doctrine. <em>See Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 375-76, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993). Therefore, the District Court committed no error in rejecting appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
