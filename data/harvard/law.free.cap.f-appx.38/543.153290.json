ALARC\u00d3N, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the appellant\u2019s request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-15\">Carl E. Dixon appeals from his conviction of bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). Dixon argues that the evidence is insufficient to prove that Dixon took the money from the bank by means of force, violence, or intimidation. He also asserts that reversal of the judgment is required because the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b570-17\">The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the Government demonstrates that Carl E. Dixon walked into a Lawrence, Kansas bank on June 30, 2000. He walked to the center island and wrote \u201cGive\u201d on a deposit slip. He then walked to the middle teller window and placed the deposit slip and a plastic grocery bag on the counter. He told the teller, Karen Mueller, to \u201cput the money in the bag.\u201d Ms. Mueller was unsure what Dixon had said and responded, \u2018What?\u201d Dixon then told her \u201cYou have ten seconds.\u201d At the same time, Dixon put his hand on his waistband. Ms. Mueller saw a bulge under his shirt. Dixon\u2019s conduct and statements caused her to fear for her fife and the fives of others in the bank. Based on Dixon\u2019s serious tone and his motioning toward his waistband, Ms. Mueller believed Dixon had a weapon. As Ms. Mueller collected the money, she pressed the silent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>alarm button. Dixon reached over the counter and grabbed the cash from Ms. Mueller\u2019s hands and left the bank with $1,150 in cash. A bank security camera taped the entire encounter. Dixon\u2019s fingerprints were lifted from the center island and a pen located at the counter. The deposit slip was found to contain his handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Dixon was arrested later the same day. He stated his name as Carl E. Dixon. After waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Dixon told the police that he had taken the money, but denied that he used force or violence. He also stated he did nothing to intimidate Ms. Mueller. After running his fingerprints through the FBI\u2019s Special Processing Center, the investigating officers discovered that they matched those of a person named Carl Edward Norris. A check of this name disclosed that Dixon had a prior conviction for car theft and a probation sentence. Before the jury, Dixon\u2019s counsel stipulated to the bank\u2019s location and that Dixon had taken $1,150 from the bank. Lorenzo Bolden, a friend of Dixon\u2019s for 20 years, testified that Dixon told him the night before the money was taken from the bank that he was going to commit a bank robbery. The day of the robbery, Dixon told Bolden that he had actually robbed a bank and \u201cmight have displayed it to look like he had a weapon.\u201d Dixon testified in his own defense. He stated that he did not have a weapon under his shirt and that he did not use or intend to use force, violence, or intimidation in taking the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The jury found Dixon guilty of bank robbery. The district court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 46 months. Dixon timely filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Dixon argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal. He maintains that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he took the money by intimidation. Section 2118(a) provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">[w]hoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, from the person or presence of another, or obtains or attempts to obtain by extortion any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of, any bank, credit union, or any savings and loan association ... Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">We review the sufficiency of evidence de novo. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>107 F.3d 774, 778 (10th Cir.1997). \u2018We review the sufficiency of the evidence in the light most favorable to the government to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>113 F.3d 1528, 1530 (10th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted). \u201cAs an appellate court, we are bound by the rule that the resolution of conflicting evidence and the assessment of the credibility of witnesses is within the sole discretion of the jury as the trier of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Espinosa, </em>771 F.2d 1382, 1391 (10th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">In deciding whether there is sufficient evidence of intimidation to support a conviction of bank robbery, this court looks to three factors: \u201c(1) whether the situation appeared dangerous, (2) whether the defendant intended to intimidate, and (3) whether the bank personnel were reasonable in their fear of death or injury.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>Mitchell, </em>113 F.3d at 1531 (citing <em>United States v. Slater, </em>692 F.2d 107, 109 (10th Cir.1982)). A finding of intimidation may include both subjective and objective factors. <em>Slater, </em>692 F.2d at 109. In addition, a finding of intimidation does not require the showing of a weapon or verbal threats by the defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Applying these three factors to the present case, there was sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that Dixon used intimidation in taking the money. Based on Dixon\u2019s demand that Ms. Mueller had ten seconds to give him the money and his movement toward his waist that appeared to have a bulge, Ms. Mueller believed that Dixon had a weapon and that he was dangerous. Witnesses who were inside the bank testified that Ms. Mueller appeared pale, stunned, and scared after Dixon left. This is sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the situation appeared dangerous to Ms. Mueller.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">There is also sufficient evidence in the record to show that Dixon intended to use intimidation. Despite Dixon\u2019s testimony that he did not intend to use force or intimidation to take the money, Dixon\u2019s demand that Ms. Mueller had ten seconds to comply and hand over the money is objective evidence that Dixon intended to intimidate Ms. Mueller. The jury was free to infer that his placing a time limit on compliance with his demand while motioning to a bulge in his waistband was meant to cause Ms. Mueller to fear that harm would come to her if she did not obey quickly. This is the kind of \u201caggressive behavior which very well could have been considered as intimidating by the jury.\u201d <em>Slater, </em>692 F.2d at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Furthermore, the jury could properly infer that Ms. Mueller\u2019s fear of injury or death was reasonable under these circumstances. Despite the fact that Ms. Mueller did not actually see a weapon, it was reasonable for her to fear injury or death from whatever object was concealed in his waistband. \u201cA stranger\u2019s urgent demand for money typically would create a situation in a banking institution that appears dangerous and would justify bank personnel in fearing for their lives.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>10 F.3d 724, 729 (10th Cir.1993). Based on this evidence, \u201ca jury could find that an expectation of injury was reasonable in the context of an incident of this kind where a weapon and a willingness to use it are not uncommon.\u201d <em>Slater, </em>692 F.2d at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Dixon intended to intimidate Ms. Mueller. The district court did not err in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">Dixon makes several allegations of pros-ecutorial misconduct. Dixon moved for a mistrial based on the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper cross-examination regarding Dixon\u2019s criminal history, his out-of-wedlock children, and his non-payment of child support. This court reviews the denial of a motion for mistrial based on alleged prose-cutorial misconduct for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Gabaldon, </em>91 F.3d 91, 93 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">Dixon asserts that the prosecutor improperly elicited the details of Dixon\u2019s prior conviction and subsequent probation revocation for the unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cOrdinarily, it is improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>for the prosecution to examine into the details of the crime for which the accused was convicted. The cross-examination should be confined to a showing of the essential facts of convictions, the nature of the crimes, and the punishment.\u201d <em>United States v. Wolf, </em>561 F.2d 1376, 1381 (10th Cir.1977). Here, the prosecutor asked Dixon during cross-examination whether he had suffered a prior conviction to impeach his credibility as permitted by Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a)(1). Instead of answering truthfully, however, Dixon initially refused to acknowledge that he had been convicted of a felony or that his probation for that offense had been revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding Dixon\u2019s imprisonment and probation revocation were relevant questions within the scope of Rule 609(a)(1). Dixon\u2019s conviction for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle had initially resulted in a sentence of 10 years of probation in lieu of imprisonment. After Dixon violated the terms of his probation, it was revoked and he was sentenced to five years imprisonment. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding revocation of Dixon\u2019s probation and his subsequent sentence of imprisonment were relevant to show that Dixon\u2019s prior conviction was admissible under Rule 609(a)(1) as a crime punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Dixon next argues that the prosecutor improperly informed the jury during cross-examination that Dixon is not married to the mother of his children and that he had not paid child support. Defense counsel objected to these questions. The district court sustained the objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Dixon\u2019s motion for a mistrial on this ground. In deciding whether to grant a motion for a mistrial, the district court should focus on \u201cwhether the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial was impaired.\u201d <em>Gabaldon, </em>91 F.3d at 93 (quotation omitted). The prejudicial impact of these questions on the jury must be viewed in the context of the entire case. <em>Id. </em>In light of the overwhelming evidence of Dixon\u2019s guilt, Dixon has failed to demonstrate that these questions prejudiced his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">The remainder of Dixon\u2019s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct were not included in his motion for mistrial. In reviewing such allegations of misconduct, this court conducts a two-part process. <em>Gabaldon, </em>91 F.3d at 94. First, we must decide \u201cwhether the conduct objected to was indeed improper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whether prosecutorial misconduct occurred is reviewed de novo. <em>Id. </em>Second, if any of the conduct was indeed improper, we then must determine whether the misconduct warrants reversal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-11\">A prosecutor\u2019s improper statement to the jury is harmless unless there is reason to believe that it influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. In assessing whether the misconduct had such an impact, we consider the trial as a whole, including the curative acts of the district court, the extent of the misconduct, and the role of the misconduct within the case ... [T]o warrant reversal, the misconduct must have been flagrant enough to influence the jury to convict on grounds other than the evidence presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Ivy, </em>88 F.3d 1266, 1288 (10th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Dixon maintains that the prosecutor improperly forced Dixon to testify that he believed the Government\u2019s witnesses were liars. Defense counsel, however, did not object to these questions. Accordingly, we must review these forfeited contentions for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-33, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). The prosecutor\u2019s questions here were substantially similar to the prosecutor\u2019s questions in <em>United States v. Williamson, </em>53 F.3d 1500, 1521 n. 13 (10th Cir.1995). In <em>Williamson, </em>this court declined to adopt a per se rule that it is misconduct for a prosecutor to force a defendant to testify that other witnesses have lied. 53 F.3d at 1523. This court held that merely asking a defendant to comment on the veracity of other witnesses does not amount to plain error. <em>Id. </em>This court stated that more \u201cstarkly offensive\u201d conduct by the prosecutor, such as calling a rebuttal witness to emphasize the cross-examination of the defendant or stating during closing argument that a verdict for the defendant would require a finding that all of the government\u2019s witnesses were lying, would be required to constitute plain error. <em>Id. In the </em>present case, the prosecutor did nothing more than ask Dixon to comment on the veracity of other witnesses. Thus, under <em>Williamson, </em>Dixon has not shown that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Dixon maintains that the prosecutor committed misconduct in asking a series of questions regarding Dixon\u2019s alleged drug use. Before trial, the district court granted Dixon\u2019s in limine motion to exclude any evidence regarding his use of crack cocaine. During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked several questions relating to drug use. Defense counsel objected to only one of these questions. The court sustained the objection. Dixon contends that the prosecutor\u2019s questions assumed facts not in evidence, were not relevant, and were highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Under the plain error standard of review, Dixon must show that the prosecutor made a \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d error that affected his substantial rights, and \u201cseriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-69, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (quotations omitted). While the prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding drug use appear to violate the district court\u2019s pretrial order, Dixon has not demonstrated that the questions were prejudicial to his substantial rights. The prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding Dixon\u2019s drug use were relevant to impeach Dixon with prior statements he made to the police and to impeach his credibility as a witness. Indeed, Dixon admitted during cross-examination that he could not remember all the details of what happened during and after the bank robbery due to inebriation. Evidence of a witness\u2019s drug use may be admitted to show the effect of the drug use on the witness\u2019s memory or recollection of events. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>156 F.3d 1046, 1054-55 (10th Cir.1998). Dixon\u2019s failure <em>to </em>object to the questions at trial deprived the district court of the opportunity to reconsider its in limine order to determine whether questions concerning Dixon\u2019s drug use would be relevant in light of the evidence that had been presented at trial. Because the prosecutor\u2019s questions were relevant to impeach Dixon\u2019s credibility as a witness, we conclude that the questions did not constitute plain error. \u201cNo \u2018miscarriage of justice\u2019 will result here if we do not notice the error, and we decline to do so.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 470 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Dixon further contends that the prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding Dixon\u2019s use of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>alias were irrelevant and prejudicial. During a pretrial conference, the district court granted Dixon\u2019s in limine motion to exclude references to his alias, concluding that \u201cthe name is not relevant.\u201d During trial, however, the district court overruled defense counsel\u2019s objections to these questions. A district court\u2019s admission of evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Acosta-Ballardo, 8 </em>F.3d 1532, 1534 (10th Cir.1993). Under this standard, this court will \u201creverse only when the trial court\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, whimsical, or manifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>156 F.3d 1046, 1054 (10th Cir.1998) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Dixon has failed to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s decision to allow questioning regarding Dixon\u2019s alias was an abuse of discretion. While the district court did not explain its evidentiary ruling, the district court could have reasonably concluded that inquiry into Dixon\u2019s use of an alias was relevant to demonstrate his consciousness of guilt. <em>United States v. Glass, </em>128 F.3d 1398, 1408 (10th Cir.1997) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s use of an alias to conceal his identity from law enforcement officers is relevant as proof of consciousness of guilt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">He further argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during the cross examination of Dixon by asking him the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">1. \u201cAnd Karen Mueller, of all the people in the world, would have no reason to tell stories about you, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">2. \u201cSo, if during deliberations, the jury were to look at that [bank security video tape] and see you reaching over and taking the money like that, you\u2019re telling us that would be the wrong conclusion, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining objections to these questions. In view of the overwhelming evidence of Dixon\u2019s guilt, we are persuaded that the propounding of these questions did not constitute prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct. The only factual dispute concerning Dixon\u2019s guilt was whether he acted with force, violence, or intimidation in taking the money from the bank teller. Ms. Mueller\u2019s testimony was sufficient to persuade the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Dixon intimidated her. In addition, the district court minimized any potential harm from the allegedly improper questions by sustaining defense counsel\u2019s objections and admonishing the jury that a question is not evidence. \u201cA central assumption of our jurisprudence is that juries follow the instructions they receive.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>140 F.3d 874, 884 (10th Cir.1998). Reviewing the record, it appears that while the trial was not perfect, it was fair. <em>See United States v. McHorse, </em>179 F.3d 889, 904 (10th Cir.1999) (stating that \u201c[t]he Constitution guarantees a defendant a fair trial, not a perfect one\u201d). Dixon has not demonstrated that the jury was prejudiced in reaching its verdict by the prosecutor\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b570-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
