First, King argues the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. A challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is reviewed to determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, substantial evidence exists to support a verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). The testimony of the Government\u2019s witness, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, was sufficient to sustain King\u2019s convictions. <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Second, King argues the stop of his vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment. King has waived review of this claim by his failure to bring this challenge in district court. <em>United States v. Ricco, </em>52 F.3d 58, 62 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Accordingly, we affirm King\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not significantly aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
