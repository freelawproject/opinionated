He appeals his sentence, alleging that the district court erred in finding that the offense was a completed fraud and refusing to decrease his offense level pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2X1.1 (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Lang and several co-defendants defrauded a number of banks in Charlotte, North Carolina, by having young women acquaintances open bank accounts in their own names and deposit fraudulent checks totaling $139,477 into these accounts. Under the direction of Lang and the others, the women withdrew over $49,000 before the fraud was detected. Lang was charged in a federal indictment with four counts of bank fraud. The indictment\u2019s thirteen introductory paragraphs described in detail how Lang and his co-defendants \u201crecruited young women that they met at Charlotte-area college campuses and nightclubs to assist them in depositing fraudulent checks at Charlotte-area banks and then withdrawing the money before fraud was discovered.\u201d The introductory paragraphs were incorporated by reference into Counts One through Four, which each charged that the defendants \u201cexecuted and attempted to execute a scheme and artifice to defraud\u201d the banks specified in each count \u201cand to obtain monies and funds owned by and under the custody and control of said banks ... by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises.\u201d Each count further charged that \u201c[i]t was part of the scheme and artifice that the defendants committed acts as set forth in the introductory paragraphs.\u201d Lang pled guilty to all four counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">Lang asserted at sentencing that the actual loss of $49,000 should be used to compute his sentence, rather than the intended loss of $139,477, as recommended in the presentence report. He also argued that, if the intended loss was used, a 3-level decrease for an attempt should be applied under Application Note 8 to \u00a7 2F1.1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Application Note 2 to USSG \u00a7 2B1.1 (Theft),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and USSG \u00a7 2X1.1 (Attempt).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lang argued that, because the full amount of fraudulent deposits was not withdrawn, the fraud was not completed and the offense was only an attempt. The district court denied Lang\u2019s request for a 3-level decrease in the offense level, thus finding in effect that the offense was a completed fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">On appeal, Lang argues that the district court erred in refusing to award him a 3-level decrease under USSG \u00a7 2X1.1. Because the facts are undisputed, this court\u2019s review of the district court\u2019s application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the sentencing guidelines is de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217-18 (4th Cir.1989). Lang contends that his offense was an attempt because not all the deposited funds were withdrawn. He relies on <em>United States v. Mancuso, </em>42 F.3d 836, 848-50 (4th Cir.1994), and <em>United States v. Watkins, </em>994 F.2d 1192, 1196 (6th Cir.1993). In <em>Mancuso, </em>this court held that the district court should have applied \u00a7 2X1.1 because the offense of conviction was part of a larger, uncompleted fraud that comprised the defendants\u2019 relevant conduct. <em>Mancuso, </em>42 F.3d at 848-50. In <em>Watkins, </em>the Sixth Circuit set out three factors that the district court must consider before using the intended loss: (1) whether the defendant intended to inflict the loss viewed as the intended loss; (2) whether the defendant was capable of inflicting the intended loss; and (3) whether the defendant had completed all acts necessary to complete the offense, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2X1.1(b)(1). Because the district court had not considered all three factors, the appeals court remanded for further proceedings. <em>Watkins, </em>994 F.2d at 1195-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">However, the bank fraud committed by Lang and his co-defendants was not part of a larger uncompleted offense. All Lang\u2019s criminal activity was accounted for in the counts to which he pled guilty. Moreover, in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>81 F.3d 1321, 1327 (4th Cir.1996), a case factually similar to Lang\u2019s case, we held that the offense of bank fraud is complete when the defendant \u201cfraudulently obtained credit from ... [the bank] in the form of a balance in a bank account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1328. Under <em>Williams, </em>the district court properly found that Lang\u2019s offense was a completed fraud, and used the intended amount of loss to compute the offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Lang attempts to distinguish <em>Williams </em>by repeating the argument he made in the district court, that the defendant in <em>Williams </em>was charged with fraud by depositing fraudulent funds while the indictment in his case charged that he fraudulently attempted to obtain money, that is, withdraw money, from the banks involved. His argument is baseless because the indictment charged a broad scheme or artifice to defraud the banks and obtain money from them \u201cby means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises.\u201d The indictment simply tracked the language of \u00a7 1344 and did not limit the charged offense to fraudulent withdrawals.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">In his reply brief, Lang argues that the government shifted from a focus on fraudulent withdrawals in the indictment to fraudulent deposits at sentencing and thereby constructively amended the indictment. He relies on <em>United States v. Floresca, </em>38 F.3d 706, 710 (4th Cir.1994) (constructive amendment occurs when jury instructions expose defendant to criminal charge not made in indictment). An issue first raised in a reply brief is not properly before a court of appeals. <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>235 F.3d 215, 218 n. 3 (4th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Cavallo v. Star Enter., </em>100 F.3d 1150, 1152 n. 2 (4th Cir.1996)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 39, 151 L.Ed.2d 12 (2001). Therefore, we need not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">We therefore affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\">.
