Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Flowers first claims that the district court erred in denying his motion for downward departure based on diminished capacity pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 5K2.13 (2000). Because a decision to depart from the sentencing guidelines is a highly factual determination within the exclusive province of the sentencing court, we will only review such a decision if it reflects a purely legal determination, such as the district court\u2019s misapprehension of its authority to depart. <em>United States v. Wilkinson, </em>137 F.3d 214, 230 (4th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30-31 (4th Cir.1990). A review of the sentencing hearing transcript indicates the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward was based on the facts that Flowers and the Government presented at sentencing and not on any misapprehension of its ability to depart. Accordingly, this issue is not reviewable. <em>See United States v. Matthews, </em>209 F.3d 338, 352-53 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 910, 121 S.Ct. 260, 148 L.Ed.2d 188 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">Flowers next contends that the district court erred by refusing to grant him a \u201cminor role\u201d adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Specifically, Flowers contends that the district court should have deemed him a minor participant in the offenses because his mental impairment reduced his culpability for the crime. Because Flowers failed to make this argument before the district court, this court reviews for plain error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Assuming that a \u201cminor role\u201d adjustment may be granted solely based upon the defendant\u2019s mental condition, rather than his conduct, <em>but cf. United States v. Howard, </em>894 F.2d 1085, 1088 (9th Cir.1990) (stating that the court should not rely exclusively on a defendant\u2019s mental state in determining whether U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2\u2019s minor participant adjustment applies), our review of the record reveals that Flowers\u2019s conduct was \u201cmaterial or essential to committing the offense[s],\u201d <em>United States v. Palinkas, </em>938 F.2d 456, 460 (4th Cir.1991). Flowers was involved in many aspects of the planning and execution of the robbery. Although Flowers may have some intellectual limitations, he has not presented evidence demonstrating that his limitations prevented him from understanding and taking part in the crime. We therefore conclude that the district court did not commit plain error in finding that Flowers was not entitled to a \u201cminor role\u201d adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">Finally, Flowers contends that the district court\u2019s restitution order must be corrected on remand to include language stating that the bank\u2019s recovery is limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>the amount of its loss. The district court\u2019s order holds Flowers jointly and severally liable with his co-defendent for the payment of $1484 to the bank. Because Flowers did not raise this issue in the district court, this court reviews for plain error. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732. Because there is no statutory requirement, nor controlling law in the Fourth Circuit, requiring that a restitution order imposing joint and several liability explicitly state the limit of the victim\u2019s recovery, we conclude that the district court\u2019s failure to include this limitation in its order does not amount to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Flowers\u2019s convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b916-10\"> Flowers argued at sentencing that he was entitled to an adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 on the basis that he was merely the getaway driver for the armed bank robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
