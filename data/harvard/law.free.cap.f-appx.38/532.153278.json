R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">Defendant Raul Herrera-Perez pleaded guilty to illegal reentry following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Although a violation of this statute generally carries a maximum prison sentence of two years, \u00a7 1326(b)(2) provides for an enhanced prison term of up to twenty years for those who reenter the country illegally and have a previous aggravated felony conviction. On the same day that Herrera-Perez was indicted for violating \u00a7 1326, the United States filed a Notice of Sentencing Enhancement (the \u201cNotice\u201d). The Notice advised Herrera-Perez that, based on a prior aggravated felony conviction in Utah state court, he was subject to the enhanced penalties set out in \u00a7 1326(b). In written statements made in advance of his guilty plea, Herrera-Perez acknowledged that the maximum term of imprisonment he was facing was twenty years and stipulated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-15\">My previous criminal history includes, but may not be limited to, the following felony conviction in the United States of America, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-16\">1) Distribution, Offering, and Arranging to Distribute a Controlled Substance, to wit: Cocaine, First Degree Felony, Third Judicial Court, Salt Lake County, State of Utah, August 8, 2000, Case No. 001913089</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4Ho\">I have previously been arrested and deported from the United States of America on at least one occasion. The latest arrest and deportation occurred on September 8, 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-17\">I do not have nor have I ever had the express consent of the Attorney General for the United States of America to enter this country at any time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-18\">In accord with this stipulation and based on his prior aggravated felony conviction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Presentence Report increased Herrera-Perez\u2019s offense level by sixteen points pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). Herrera-Perez did not lodge any objections to the Presentence Report. The district court ultimately sentenced Herrera-Perez to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>term of imprisonment of seventy-seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">On appeal, Herrera-Perez relies on <em>Ap-prendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), to argue that his sentence exceeds the maximum penalty for the offense because the fact of his prior conviction was not set out in the indictment, submitted to a jury, or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Ap-prendi, </em>however, acknowledged that a narrow exception to this general rule, established in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), applies when the fact used to enhance the sentence is a prior conviction. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Relying on <em>Almendarez-Tor-res </em>and the narrow exception recognized in <em>Apprendi, </em>this court has held that an indictment which does not contain a separate charge for prior conviction of an aggravated felony does not violate constitutional rights and does not preclude the application of \u00a7 1326(b). <em>United States v. Martinez-Villalva, </em>232 F.3d 1329, 1332 (10th Cir.2000). This panel is bound by <em>Almen-darez-Torres </em>and <em>Martinez-Villalva </em>and therefore rejects Herrera-Perez\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Herrera-Perez concedes that the relief he seeks is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and <em>Martinez-Villalva, </em>but seeks to preserve his argument for review by the Supreme Court in the event that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is overruled. He has done so. <em>See McKnight v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>511 U.S. 659, 660, 114 S.Ct. 1826, 128 L.Ed.2d 655 (1994). \u201cNevertheless, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has not been overruled and directly controls our decision in this case.\u201d <em>United States v. Dorris, </em>236 F.3d 582, 587 (10th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the sentence imposed by the United States District Court for the District of Utah is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b559-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-13\">. It is clear that Herrera-Perez\u2019s drug trafficking conviction in Utah state court constitutes an \"aggravated felony\u201d for purposes of Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.1 note 1 (providing that \"aggravated felony\u201d is defined at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) (providing that the term \"aggravated felony\" means, <em>inter alia, </em>\"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
