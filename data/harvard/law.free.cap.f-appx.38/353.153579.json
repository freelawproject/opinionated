After Rosas pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute 15,876 grams of methamphetamine, the district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> applied a three-level enhancement, reduced Rosas\u2019s criminal history category from III to II, and sentenced Rosas to 210 months in prison followed by five years supervised release. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a), (b)(1)(A), 846 (1994). Rosas appeals his sentence, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-22\">First, Rosas contends the district court committed error when it applied a three-level sentencing enhancement based on its determination that Rosas held a supervisory role in the conspiracy. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.1(b) (2001). We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts de novo. <em>United States v. Elliott, </em>89 F.3d 1360, 1370 (8th Cir.1996). At sentencing, the district court found that Rosas was a primary supplier of illegal drugs for the conspiracy, and that Rosas recruited at least one inter-state drug courier. Contrary to Rosas\u2019s view, we are satisfied the district court did not base its findings on additional information from Rosas\u2019s co-defendants\u2019 trial. Instead, the district court adopted the uncontested factual findings contained in paragraphs 49 and 53 of the presentence report (PSR), stating, \u201cI think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>the presentence investigation clearly lays out the framework of the organization, which sets the source of supply as Mancilla and Rosas in California and the drugs coming to Minnesota, particularly with regard to this one load of methamphetamine through a courier recruited by [Rosas].\u201d (Sent. Tr. at 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Rosas also contends he was denied due process when the court applied the sentencing enhancement. We disagree. Rosas both received \u201cnotice of the proposed ... enhancement\u201d in the PSR and exercised the \u201copportunity to rebut or explain the evidence to be used against him\u201d in a written objection to the PSR and during the sentencing hearing. <em>Smith v. United States, </em>206 F.3d 812, 813 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 951, 121 S.Ct. 355, 148 L.Ed.2d 286 (2000). Having considered the parties\u2019 arguments on appeal, we conclude the district court\u2019s findings are free from clear error and the court properly enhanced Rosas\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Second, Rosas argues the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing enhancement violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) because the sentencing enhancement increased Rosas\u2019s potential maximum sentence. We disagree. <em>Apprendi </em>does not affect the outcome of this case because Rosas agreed he distributed a specific drug quantity and pleaded guilty under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), which provides a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. <em>United States v. McIntosh, </em>236 F.3d 968, 975 (8th Cir.2001). Rosas\u2019s 210-month (17\u00bd year) sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A); <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490; <em>United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, </em>220 F.3d 926, 932 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1026, 121 S.Ct. 600, 148 L.Ed.2d 513 (2000). We thus affirm Rosas\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-17\">The Honorable Ann D.
