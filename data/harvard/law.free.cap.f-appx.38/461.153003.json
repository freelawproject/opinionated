R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">This petition requires us to decide whether the Board of Immigration appeals (Board) properly rejected Chen\u2019s asylum application. If the Board\u2019s finding that Chen\u2019s testimony was not credible is sustained, we will deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The Board had jurisdiction pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.1(b)(3) and 240.53(a), and we have jurisdiction over this timely petition under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Chen contends the Board erred in finding him not credible, in finding that the evidence presented failed to corroborate his asylum claim, and in concluding that he failed to establish his eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">The Board found that Chen\u2019s testimonial evidence was neither detailed nor credible with regard to the circumstances of his wife\u2019s alleged forced sterilization. Based upon this finding, the Board properly considered Chen\u2019s corroborating evidence. <em>Cf Ladha v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 889, 901 (9th Cir.2000) (as amended) (holding that if an alien\u2019s testimony is \u201cunrefuted and credible, direct and specific\u201d corroborating evidence is not required).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">Here, the Board found that the evidence presented did not cure the omissions of detail or implausibilities of Chen\u2019s testimony. Specifically, the Board found that the veracity of Chen\u2019s household registry and the \u201cbona fides\u201d of his marriage certificate were both highly suspect\u2014documents that go to the heart of Chen\u2019s asylum case. It also was unable to verify from the evidence provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that the photograph of a woman with a scar on her abdomen was actually Chen\u2019s wife and that the scar was the result of a forced sterilization procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-17\">After reviewing the Board\u2019s credibility findings, we hold the evidence does not compel a contrary result. <em>See Hernandez-Montiel v. INS, </em>225 F.3d 1084, 1090-91 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-18\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b488-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
