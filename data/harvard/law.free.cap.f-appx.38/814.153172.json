Binkley appeals her sentencing Under the money laundering guideline, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.2, rather than the fraud guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1. She argues that because she merely spent the money obtained by fraudulent means, rather than concealing its illicit origins, her conduct does not fall within the heartland of the money laundering guideline, and instead she should be sentenced under the less punitive fraud guideline. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Because we write for the benefit of the parties, we include only the barest facts necessary for analysis. Binkley and Ruth Streeval, her co-defendant and sister, created false inheritance documents that purported to show that Binkley was the beneficiary of George Earl Markham\u2019s estate. On two separate occasions Binkley and Streeval, posing as her attorney, borrowed money on the strength of these false documents. Upon receipt of the loans, Binkley obtained cash as well as a total of ten bank checks and money orders made payable to several of her creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Binkley pled guilty to an indictment charging her with wire fraud, mail fraud, and one count of money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957. At sentencing, she argued that instead of the money laundering guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.2, the Court should apply the fraud guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, the range of which is significantly less. The District Court sentenced Binkley to twenty-seven months imprisonment and three years supervised release, near the minimum of the money laundering guideline\u2019s range.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">We do not simply apply U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.2 automatically whenever there is a conviction for money laundering. Instead we analyze whether the case falls within the heartland of the money laundering guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These include \u201ccases involving typical money laundering, financial transactions that are separate from the underlying crime and that are designed either to make illegally obtained funds appear legitimate, [or] to conceal the source of some funds.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>245 F.3d 294, 310 (3d Cir.2001). The money laundering cannot be an \u201cincidental byproduct\u201d of the underlying fraud. <em>Id. </em>Instead, there must be a \u201cserious, concerted effort to conceal or to legitimize\u201d the funds. <em>Id. </em>Diaz, the co-owner of a cosmetology school, fraudulently obtained Pell Grants, which were deposited into the school\u2019s account. <em>Id. </em>at 298. Diaz\u2019s conduct failed to meet this standard because she merely transferred fraudulently obtained funds into an account. <em>Id. </em>at 311. It was a \u201csimple reeeipt-and-deposit case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311. As we observed in <em>Diaz: </em>\u201cOf course, the purpose of fraud, in almost all cases, is to obtain money or other property and to put it to some use. A \u00a7 1957(a) violation almost always will accompany the commission of such routine fraud.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">Binkley\u2019s money laundering conduct does not evidence a concerted effort to conceal the funds\u2019 fraudulent origins. Binkley signed the money orders that she obtained. The bank checks were easily traceable to the issuing bank, which she provided with her name, address, social security number, driver\u2019s license number, date of birth, and occupation. This distinguishes the case from <em>United States v. Omoruyi, </em>260 F.3d 291, (3d Cir.2001), where the defendant opened several accounts and used fictitious names to do so. 260 F.3d 291, 301. Binkley left a \u201cpaper trail ... inconsistent with planned conceal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>ment.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>186 F.3d 290, 300 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><em>As </em>such, she should be sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.2, and we reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-10\">. Amendment 591, effective November 1, 2000, overrules <em>United States v. Smith, </em>186 F.3d 290 (3d Cir. 1999), by cabining the discretion of a court to sentence a defendant under a different guideline. However, we do not apply amendment 591 to a case where, although sentencing occurred after the amendment's effective date, the conduct occurred <em>before </em>it, thereby raising <em>ex post facto </em>concerns. <em>United States v. Omoruyi, </em>260 F.3d 291, 297-98 (3d Cir. 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
