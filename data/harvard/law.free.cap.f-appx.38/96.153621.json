(\u201cAz-mat\u201d), on the ground that IFIC had agreed, as a successor, to assume all the debts of Azmat. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-23\">IFIC, as a creditor of Azmat, took possession of all outstanding shares of Azmat stock, caused all of Azmat\u2019s assets to be sold, arranged to receive all of the sale proceeds, and (in the asset sale contract between IFIC, Azmat, and the asset buyer) agreed to pay all of Azmat\u2019s debts (past, present, and future). Under such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>circumstances, a finding of successor liability was not inappropriate. <em>See American Buying Ins. Serv. v. S. Konreich &amp; Sons, </em>944 F.Supp. 240, 249 (S.D.N.Y.1996) (\u201cIn general successor liability will lie [under New York law] when <em>[inter alia </em>] ... there is an express or implied agreement to assume the other company\u2019s debts and agreements.\u201d).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
