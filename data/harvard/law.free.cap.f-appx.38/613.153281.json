The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for a published opinion. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b639-20\"><em>ORDERED AND ADJUDGED </em>that the petitions for review in Nos. 01-1039 and 01-1494 are dismissed for the reasons given in the attached memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-21\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-22\">MEMORANDUM</p>\n<p id=\"b639-23\">Indianapolis Power &amp; Light (IPL) petitions for review of two final rules promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): \u201cFinal Rule Making Findings of Failure to Submit Required State Implementation Plans for the NOx SIP Call,\u201d 65 Fed.Reg. 81,366 (Dec. 26, 2000), and \u201cApproval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Indiana; Oxides of Nitrogen Regulations,\u201d 66 Fed.Reg. 56,465 (Nov. 8, 2001). In its briefs, however, IPL does not challenge these rules. Instead, it challenges EPA\u2019s determination in another rule that Indiana must reduce its NOx emissions. <em>See </em>\u201cFinding of Significant Contribution and Rulemaking for Certain States in the Ozone Transport Assessment Group Region for Purposes of Reducing Regional Transport of Ozone,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>63 Fed.Reg. 57,356 (Oct. 27, 1998) (\u201cNOx SIP Call\u201d). Because IPL brings this challenge long after the expiration of the 60-day review period for the NOx SIP Call, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1), we must dismiss its petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">IPL contends that we should hear its challenge to EPA\u2019s determination because it has not previously had an opportunity to seek review of the NOx SIP Call. In fact, IPL was a petitioner in <em>Michigan v. EPA, </em>213 F.3d 663 (D.C.Cir.2000), in which we rejected the claim that the NOx SIP Call is unlawful as applied to Indiana and therefore denied IPL\u2019s petition. As a result, in addition to being untimely, IPL\u2019s challenge is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. <em>See Natural Resources Defense Council v. Thomas, </em>838 F.2d 1224, 1252 (D.C.Cir.1988). IPL suggests that its participation in the <em>Michigan </em>litigation should not prevent it from bringing this challenge because this court did not allow it to file a separate brief, and because, despite its best efforts, its specific argument against the NOx SIP Call was not included in the industry petitioners\u2019 joint brief. But if IPL encountered any difficulty presenting its position in the <em>Michigan </em>litigation, it should have sought relief from the court prior to the deadline for the submission of the petitioners\u2019 opening brief in that case. Its failure to do so does not permit it to bring a challenge outside the 60-day jurisdictional window\u2014and certainly not a challenge to a rule that has already been reviewed and upheld by this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
