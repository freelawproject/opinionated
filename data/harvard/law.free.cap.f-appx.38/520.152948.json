R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Defendant Juan Ramon Prieto-Zubia appeals the sentence he received pursuant to his guilty plea to the charge of possession with intent to distribute cocaine. He challenges the district court\u2019s decision to increase his offense level by three levels based on its finding that he was a manager or supervisor in the drug transaction in which he participated. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Mark Cardwell transported cocaine in an automobile from Texas to Kansas City, where the car was transferred to Mr. Prie-to-Zubia. Mr. Prieto-Zubia and an accomplice then drove it to a house in Kansas City where the authorities stopped the car, discovered the cocaine, and arrested the car\u2019s occupants. Mr. Prieto-Zubia was charged in a two-count indictment with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. He entered a guilty plea to the possession count and the conspiracy count was dismissed. The district court sentenced Mr. Prieto-Zubia to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The sole question raised by Mr. Prieto-Zubia on appeal is whether the district court erred in applying a three-level enhancement to his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Mr. Prieto-Zubia, the district court erred in finding that he was a manager or supervisor of the criminal activity with which he was involved. We review the district court\u2019s determination for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cruz Camacho, </em>137 F.3d 1220, 1223-24 (10th Cir.1998) (addressing \u00a7 3B1.1(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">The parties stipulated, as part of the plea agreement, that Mr. Prieto-Zubia \u201cwas not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of criminal activity as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1.\u201d ROA, Doc. 67, Plea Agreement at 3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The presentence report, however, found otherwise. Summarizing Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reports, the presentence report indicated that Mr. Prieto-Zubia was the person contacted when Cardwell arrived in the Kansas City area, and that he instructed Caldwell to check into a certain motel and arranged the exchange of the car containing the cocaine. ROA, Vol. IV at 5, \u00b6 15. The presentence report further indicated, again based upon DEA reports, that Mr. Prieto-Zubia recruited Cardwell to act as a drug courier, and was one of the sources of the cocaine. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 16. Based upon these facts, the presentence report proposed enhancing Mr. Prieto-Zubia\u2019s sentence by three levels pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Mr. Prieto-Zubia timely objected to the portions of the presentence report discussing the proposed application of \u00a7 3B1.1(b). Although he admitted that the presentence report accurately summarized the information contained in the DEA reports, ROA, Vol. III at 22, he objected to the factual accuracy of the information. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cAnd I have disputed the points labeled in [paragraphs] 15 and 16 [of the presentence report].\u201d). The government presented no evidence in response to the objection. Instead, government counsel explained why it was the government\u2019s position that Mr. Prieto-Zubia was not a manager or supervisor within the meaning of \u00a7 3B1.1(b). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 16-18. The district court ultimately overruled Mr. Prieto-Zubia\u2019s objection and applied the three-level enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1(b) as recommended by the presentence report. <em>Id. </em>at 24 (\u201cAnd as I said before, I think that the three-level increase is where it should be, and I stand behind the presentence report on this particular point, so your objection is overruled.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">We conclude the district court erred in applying \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). When sentencing a criminal defendant, a district court may rely on facts stated in the presentence report unless the defendant objects to them. <em>United States v. Keifer, </em>198 F.3d 798, 800 (10th Cir.1999). If \u201ca defendant objects to a fact in a presentence report, the government must prove that fact at a sentencing hearing by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In such circumstances, \u201c \u2018the district court may not satisfy its obligation [to find the facts] by simply adopting the presentence report as its finding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Farnsworth, </em>92 F.3d 1001, 1011 (10th Cir.1996)). Here, Mr. Prieto-Zubia timely objected to key facts in the presentence report pertaining to his alleged role as a manager or supervisor. The government, rather than presenting evidence to the district court in an attempt to prove those facts, essentially agreed with Mr. Prieto-Zubia\u2019s position (presumably because it was bound by the stipulation in the plea agreement). Notwithstanding the government\u2019s failure to present any evidence, the district court adopted the facts as set forth in the presentence report and applied a three-level enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1(b). Under <em>Keifer, </em>this was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED, and the matter is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b546-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\">. Section 3B 1.1(b) mandates a three-level increase \"[i]f the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-11\">. Neither party argues that the district court was bound by the parties\u2019 stipulation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6B 1.4(d) (stating that district court is not bound by stipulation of facts in a plea agreement).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
