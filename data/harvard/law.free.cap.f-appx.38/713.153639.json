The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. For reasons that follow, we will affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-24\">Inasmuch as we write only for the district court and the parties who are familiar with the circumstances underlying the instant appeal, a comprehensive recitation of the factual background is not necessary. Accordingly, we will discuss the facts only to the extent they may be helpful to our brief discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-25\">McGlothlin claims that his indictment was invalid because the government failed to allege sufficient facts to support federal jurisdiction. Specifically, he claims that the indictment only alleged that he defrauded \u201cFirst Union Bank.\u201d McGlothlin argues that the indictment had to allege that he defrauded a \u201cfinancial institution,\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 20 in order to support federal subject matter jurisdiction. Consequently, McGlothlin urges us to set aside his plea and the ensuing conviction, and remand this case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>The government argues, however, that \u201cbank\u201d and \u201cfinancial institution\u201d are synonymous with each other, and that the indictment therefore properly alleged the elements of bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. Further, the government argues that we can take judicial notice that First Union is a financial institution within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">A valid indictment must contain all the elements of the crime alleged. <em>United States v. Spinner, </em>180 F.3d 514 (3d. Cir.1999). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344, it is a crime to defraud a \u201cfinancial institution.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 (2000). \u201cFinancial institution\u201d is defined at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 20 and includes, among other things, a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 20(1) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">McGlothlin is correct in noting that the indictment here fails to allege that he defrauded a \u201cfinancial institution.\u201d Rather, it merely alleges that he defrauded \u201cFirst Union Bank.\u201d Although it would have been preferable to allege that First Union is a financial institution for purposes of bank fraud, the defect here is not fatal to our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The Federal Rules of Evidence define a judicially noticed fact as one \u201cnot subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d Fed R. Evid. 201(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">First Union merged with Wachovia Corporation and is now this nation\u2019s fourth largest bank. Rick Brooks, Wachovia\u2019s Results Show Its Progress With Troubled Loans and Merger Costs, Wall St. J., Jan. 24, 2002, at B4. Anyone who passes through, or resides in, the eastern part of the United States will quickly realize that First Union has branch banks up and down the East Coast. It is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock ticker symbol \u201cWB.\u201d Due to its size and preeminence in the banking industry First Union\u2019s status as a federally insured bank, and therefore, as a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d, is beyond dispute. It is a fact that is both generally known, and capable of accurate and ready determination by sources that cannot reasonably be questioned. We will therefore take judicial notice that First Union is a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. Consequently, we find that the indictment sufficiently alleges all the elements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Accordingly, we will uphold the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
