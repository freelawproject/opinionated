Cortez-Castro contends that in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the district court erred by denying him a reduction in his sentencing offense level to the two-year maximum set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) because there was no proof at trial that he had sustained a prior aggravated felony conviction. Cortez-Castro also contends that <em>Apprendi </em>renders inapplicable <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a sentencing factor and not a separate offense). As Cortez-Castro concedes, these arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 966, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001). Accordingly, the sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-21\">We remand for the limited purpose of directing the district court to amend the judgment to reflect a conviction under 8 U.S.C. 1326(a) only. <em>United States v. Herrera-Blanco, </em>232 F.3d 715 (9th Cir.2000) (sua sponte remanding to the district court with directions to correct the judgment of conviction to exclude a reference to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-22\">AFFIRMED in part and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b496-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
