Prudential alleges that Massaro, who has already made multiple disclosures of this nature directly to Prudential\u2019s legal adversaries, has unjustifiably breached his duty as Prudential\u2019s attorney and fiduciary. The District Court agreed. It granted summary judgment to Prudential and ordered a permanent injunction to silence Massaro. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-25\">The long factual narrative of this case is well known to the parties. The central issue on appeal is whether Massaro\u2019s disclosures can be justified under the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege and the duty of confidentiality. We hold that Massaro\u2019s disclosures were not justified by the crime-fraud exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-26\">Generally, attorneys have a duty not to disclose the confidences of their clients. The attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications made between attorney and client for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal assistance. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>Restatement of the Law (Third) Governing Lawyers 68 et seq. (\u201cRestatement\u201d). In addition, an attorney\u2019s broader duty of confidentiality covers \u201cinformation relating to the representation of a client,\u201d regardless of the source of that information or its disclosure by others. Restatement 59. Disclosure of this confidential information is forbidden where \u201cthere is a reasonable prospect that doing so will adversely affect a material interest of the client....\u201d Id. 60. The law in Florida and in New Jersey are substantially consistent with each other and the Restatement. See Fla. State Bar Rule 4-1.6; N.J. Rule of Prof. Conduct 1.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The crime-fraud exception to both the duty of confidentiality and the attorney-client privilege allows an attorney to disclose confidential information in certain circumstances. See <em>Haines v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>975 F.2d 81, 90 (3d Cir.1992). In Florida, an affirmative duty to disclose privileged or confidential information arises only when necessary to prevent a crime or bodily harm. See <em>The Florida Bar v. Lange, </em>711 So.2d 518, 519-20 (Fla. 1998). In this Circuit, use of privileged material under the erime/fraud exception requires a three-step judicial process: (1) presentation of the factual basis for a good faith belief that the exception would apply, (2) in camera evaluation of the material by the court, and (3) affording the party opposed to disclosure \u201can absolute right to be heard by testimony and argument.\u201d See <em>Haines, </em>975 F.2d at 96-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Applying the ethical rules and precedents of New Jersey, Florida, and this Circuit, the District Court thoroughly explained why, as a matter of law, Massaro could not prevail. It stated unequivocally that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-9\">Massaro obviously complied with none of these procedural niceties designed to protect his client, Prudential, from an improvident assertion of the crime-fraud [exception to the] privilege. Massaro had no right unilaterally to invoke the crime-fraud exception; his statement to Prudential that his ethical duty compelled disclosure was completely contrary to law....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-13\">Absent a judicial finding [authorizing disclosure, Massaro\u2019s] confiding in attorneys adverse to Prudential, giving sworn statements to authorities investigating the company, [and] filing an affidavit in open court all were in flagrant violation of Massaro\u2019s duty as an attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ads-dedup-0\">Appendix at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">We agree that Massaro cannot justify his disclosures as within the crime-fraud exception or upon any other basis. Though perhaps in good faith, his actions inexcusably contravened his ethical duties as an attorney. The grant of summary judgment to Prudential and the permanent injunction against Massaro are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
