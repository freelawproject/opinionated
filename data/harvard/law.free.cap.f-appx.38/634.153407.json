BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Allegedly responding to threats against his wife and family, Richard Guess (\u201cGuess\u201d) imported heroin into the United States. Guess was originally searched unsuccessfully by customs agents in San Juan, Puerto Rico, but a second search, carried out by DEA agents on Guess\u2019s arrival at his Manhattan hotel, revealed the heroin. After this second search, he was arrested and subsequently began to cooperate with the authorities. This cooperation led to the arrest of Felipe Berdu-go, who was to have collected the heroin from Guess.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">As a result of these events, Guess was charged with (a) conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute heroin, a Schedule I narcotic drug and controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A)(i); and (b) knowingly and intentionally importing heroin, a Schedule I narcotic drug and controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 960(a)(1) and 960(b)(1)(A). On April 26, 1999, Guess pleaded guilty to a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(3), a lesser included offence contained in Count Two of the indictment. The district court subsequently sentenced Guess to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 supervised release, and a special assessment of $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">Guess now appeals from his indictment and his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 24, 2000, Guess\u2019s appellate counsel filed a motion, pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), requesting that he be relieved. We denied this motion by an order dated October 23, 2000 and directed Guess\u2019s counsel \u201cto brief, by 12/11/00, the issue of whether appellant may have a potentially non-frivolous claim under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Guess\u2019s counsel therefore filed the brief we have received. In this brief, Guess presents a facial challenge to the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 <em>&amp; </em>960, the statutes he was charged with violating in the original indictment. Specifically, Guess argues that the plain and incontrovertible language and the structure of these statutes require that the sentences the statutes mandate depend on factors that are, under the statutes, to be determined by a judge to the exclusion of the jury. But, Guess asserts, because these sentencing factors affect the statutory maximum penalty to which a defendant may be subjected, <em>Apprendi </em>requires instead that they be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, Guess claims that \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 960 are inelimin-ably at odds with <em>Apprendi </em>and must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>struck down as unconstitutional.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, Guess argues that his indictment, which did not charge the quantity of heroin involved in his crime, must be dismissed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In <em>United States v. Outen, </em>286 F.3d 622 (2d Cir.2002) this Circuit recently upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 960 in the face of arguments similar to those raised by Guess. Guess\u2019s constitutional contentions must, therefore, fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Guess\u2019s attack on his indictment also lacks merit. Under the plea agreement in this case, Guess pleaded guilty to violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(3), which imposes a maximum prison term of 20 years and a minimum supervised release term of 3 years. Critically, these subsections apply to the importation of <em>any </em>quantity of heroin (or other Schedule I or II controlled substance). And, Guess\u2019s sentence of 70 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release falls below the lowest statutory maximum and does not involve the triggering of any but the lowest mandatory minimum imposed by \u00a7 960 for a crime involving heroin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under such circumstances, we have held that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>240 F.3d 180 (2d Cir.2001). Accordingly, Guess\u2019s sentence does not raise an <em>Apprendi </em>issue and is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">We have reviewed all of Guess\u2019s remaining claims and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-11\">. The plea agreement contained a waiver provision under which Guess agreed that he would not \"file an appeal or otherwise challenge a conviction or sentence\u201d in the event that the Court imposed a sentence less than or equal to 135 months imprisonment. In spite of the fact that Guess\u2019s 70 month sentence falls well below this 135 month threshold, the government, citing \"the significance of the issues presented,\u201d does \"not rely on the waiver of appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b661-16\">. Although the plea agreement and sentencing in this case occurred before <em>Apprendi </em>was decided, <em>Apprendi </em>applies to this case on direct review. <em>See Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 328, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\">. Although, under the plea agreement, Guess pleaded guilty only to violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 &amp; 960 and not to violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, Guess nevertheless seeks dismissal of the entire indictment against him and therefore challenges \u00a7 841 as well as \u00a7 960.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b662-10\">. We note that Guess does not challenge the voluntariness and intelligence of his guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b662-23\">. We note, in this connection, that the indictment against Guess clearly charged him with crimes involving \"heroin, a Schedule I narcotic drug.\u201d That is, the indictment charged all that was needed for the crime as to which Guess pleaded guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
