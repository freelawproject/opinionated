By order dated September 25, 2001, Judge Daniels adopted the Report and Recommendation of United States Magistrate Judge Eaton, dated October 4, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">We have considered all of plaintiffs contentions on this appeal, and we affirm the judgment of the district court for substantially the reasons stated in Judge Daniels\u2019 Order dated September 25, 2001, and Magistrate Judge Eaton\u2019s Report and Recommendation dated October 4, 2000. Even if Wong established a <em>prima facie </em>ease of discrimination, the defendants articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory motive for Wong\u2019s termination: his limited proficiency with English and his inadequate knowledge of city government. <em>See de la Cruz v. New York City Human Res. Admin. DSS, </em>82 F.3d 16, 22 (2d Cir.1996) (\u201c[A]ppellees have proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory motive for the transfer, de la Cruz\u2019s difficulties with English.\u201d). Wong has faded to adduce evidence capable of supporting a reasonable finding that the defendant\u2019s action was motivated by discrimination. <em>See Fisher v. Vassar, </em>114 F.3d 1332, 1337 (2d Cir.1997) (in banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1075, 118 S.Ct. 851, 139 L.Ed.2d 752 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
