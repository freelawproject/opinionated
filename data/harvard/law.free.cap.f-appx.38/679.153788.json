Plaintiff has also filed a motion for reversal of the district court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">In 1981, the IRS instructed the NYCTA to withhold taxes from Klein\u2019s wages and notified Klein that taxes would be withheld. Klein filed suit in state court, which was later removed by the NYCTA to federal court, alleging that such withholding was unlawful. On appeal, Klein argues that (1) the attorney for the NYCTA, Caroline Laguerre-Brown, committed perjury by asserting that the NYCTA relied on the IRS\u2019s directions and that the IRS is part of the government of the United States; (2) Judge Sweet and Laguerre-Brown entered a conspiracy against Klein in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242; and (3) the district court suppressed evidence submitted by Klein.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, see Allstate Ins. Co. v. Mazzola, </em>175 F.3d 255, 258 (2d Cir.1999), we affirm. Klein has submitted no evidence of perjury by Laguerre-Brown, a conspiracy between Laguerre-Brown and Judge Sweet, or suppression of evidence by the district court. In addition, Klein may not assert a claim under \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242, as these provisions are criminal statutes that do not provide private causes of action. <em>See Robinson v. Overseas Military Sales Corp., </em>21 F.3d 502, 511 (2d Cir.1994). Finally, Klein\u2019s arguments that the payment of taxes is voluntary or that the NYCTA was not authorized to withhold taxes from his wages are meritless. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402(a) (requiring employers to withhold taxes); <em>United States v. Schiff, </em>876 F.2d 272, 275 (2d Cir.1989) (holding that \u201cthe payment of income taxes is not optional\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">Klein\u2019s motion for reversal of the judgment is dismissed for the same reasons stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
