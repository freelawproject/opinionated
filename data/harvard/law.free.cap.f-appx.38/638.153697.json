In 1999, Lajara pled guilty before Judge Martin in federal district court in the Southern District of New York to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms and more of cocaine and one kilogram and more of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and was sentenced to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-18\">Approximately two years later, in the instant case, Lajara pled guilty before Judge Rakoff to racketeering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c). Two predicate acts were enumerated: a December 1997 conspiracy to murder James Kevin Davis and a Spring 1997 conspiracy to kidnap \u201cFrank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-19\">In the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) in the instant case, the Probation Department determined that the two predicate acts were to be treated as if they were separate counts of conviction, and not grouped pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2. The applicable offense level for \u201cRacketeering Act One\u201d\u2014conspiracy to murder\u2014was calculated to be forty-three. With respect to \u201cRacketeering Act Two\u201d\u2014conspiracy to kidnap\u2014the Probation Department concluded that because the victim was kidnapped during the commission of another crime, namely, possession with in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>tent to distribute one kilogram of cocaine, the offense level was determined by adding four levels to the offense level applicable to that underlying crime, which in this case was twenty-six. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(7)(B). The PSR then added two additional levels because a dangerous weapon was used during the offense, resulting in an adjusted offense level of thirty-two for Racketeering Act Two. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Applying the grouping rules for multiple counts, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4, the Probation Department assigned one unit to the adjusted offense level for Racketeering Act One. The PSR assigned no units to the adjusted offense level for Racketeering Act Two, because the offense level for Act Two was more than nine levels less than the offense level for Act One. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4(c). The kidnapping count therefore dropped out of the Guidelines calculation, and the resulting offense level was forty-three. Three levels were then subtracted for timely acceptance of responsibility, yielding an overall adjusted offense level of forty. The Probation Department also concluded that Lajara\u2019s criminal history category was II.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The sentencing range corresponding to offense level forty and criminal history category II is 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment. The PSR did not state this range, but simply recommended that the district court sentence Lajara to the mandatory maximum sentence for the offense, or twenty years. The PSR also suggested that the sentence run concurrently with the sentence imposed by Judge Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Judge Rakoff sentenced Lajara on June 22, 2001. The court stated that it agreed with the PSR that \u201cthe total offense level is 40, the Criminal History Category is Roman numeral II, and therefore the guideline sentence ... would be ... 324 to 405 months,\u201d and that the statutory maximum reduced that sentence to twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The court then addressed Lajara\u2019s request that the sentence run concurrently with the sentence imposed by Judge Martin, of which Lajara had at that point served only thirty-six months. Guideline \u00a7 5G1.3(b) states that if a defendant is subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment, and \u201cthe undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged term of imprisonment.\u201d In <em>United States v. GarciaHernandez, </em>237 F.3d 105, 108-10 (2d Cir.2000), this Court held that, in order for a prior offense to be \u201cfully taken into account\u201d by the sentencing court, the conduct underlying that offense must play a role in the determination of the defendant\u2019s offense level. Generally, this will mean that the prior offense will be considered as \u201crelevant conduct.\u201d More recently, in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>260 F.3d 160, 166-68 (2d Cir.2001), we further clarified that the prior offense conduct must not only qualify <em>theoretically </em>as relevant conduct, but must <em>actually </em>be considered by the sentencing court in its Guidelines calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">The question on appeal is whether the conduct for which Lajara was sentenced by Judge Martin was \u201cfully taken into account\u201d in the instant case by Judge Rakoff in calculating the applicable sentence. Lajara contends that Judge Rakoff considered the prior offense as relevant conduct, citing, <em>inter alia, </em>plea agreement stipulations and the PSR\u2019s recommendation that the sentences run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">There is no evidence, however, that the district court actually considered the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>offense as relevant conduct in its determination of the offense level of forty. The court simply adopted the PSR\u2019s suggested offense level, which was itself based solely upon the two predicate acts of the racketeering charge. Certainly the district court <em>could </em>have considered the prior drug conduct as relevant conduct, but it did not. Under <em>Williams, </em>the fact that the conduct qualifies theoretically as relevant conduct is not sufficient; the conduct must be considered in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The government essentially concedes that the one kilogram of cocaine that was taken into account in the calculation of the offense level for \u201cRacketeering Act Two\u201d was also considered by Judge Martin in the earlier drug conspiracy case. Lajara\u2019s possession of this one kilogram, however, was only <em>part </em>of the conduct considered by Judge Martin, and therefore the drug-related conduct for which Lajara was sentenced in that case was not <em>\u201cfully </em>taken into account\u201d by Judge Rakoff. Under \u00a7 5G1.3(b), therefore, concurrent sentences were not mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Judge Rakoff sentenced Lajara to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. He ordered that two years of this were to be served concurrently with the prior sentence from Judge Martin, pursuant to Policy Statement \u00a7 5G1.3(e), which recognizes the court\u2019s discretion to run sentences consecutively, concurrently or partially concurrently whenever there is an undischarged term of imprisonment and subsections (a) and (b) do not apply.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court\u2019s decision to run the sentences concurrently only for this period of time was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">We have considered all of appellant\u2019s other arguments and find them to be mer-itless. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the sentence of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-7\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(a) does not apply in this case. It states that \"[i]f the instant offense was committed while the defendant was serving a term of imprisonment (including work release, furlough, or escape status) or after sentencing for, but before commencing service of, such term of imprisonment, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
