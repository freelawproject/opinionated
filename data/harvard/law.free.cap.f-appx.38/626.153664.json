To obtain more favorable settlement results, either as to timing or amount, appellants would pay a percentage of the settlement to the middlemen to split with the insurance companies\u2019 adjusters, notwithstanding that each of the insurance companies prohibited the acceptance of any gifts or fees by adjusters and required adjusters to report the offer of any gifts or fees. Appellants Grae and Rybicki were each sentenced to terms of imprisonment of one year and one.day, three years of supervised release, a $20,000 fine, and a $1,150 special assessment. The appellants\u2019 surrender date was stayed pending this appeal. Appellant Grae, Rybicki &amp; Partners, P.C. was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation, an $80,000 fine, and a $4,600 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">On appeal, appellants raise a host of legal and factual challenges to their convictions, which, briefly summarized, are that (1) appellants\u2019 practice of settling personal injury claims through an intermediary who shared his fee with the insurance company adjuster did not constitute a \u201cscheme or artifice to defraud\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 because the government failed to prove actual or intended economic or pecuniary harm and because any breach of duty by the adjuster was not material; (2) the government failed to prove use of the mails sufficient to bring appellants\u2019 conduct within the mail fraud statute; (3) the prosecution exceeded the jurisdictional scope of the mail and wire fraud statutes; (4) the \u201chonest services\u201d fraud provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346, is void for vagueness; (5) several of the district court\u2019s jury instructions were erroneous; (6) appellants\u2019 federal prosecution constituted a vindictive prosecution in light of the dismissal of a similar state case against appellants brought by the same prosecutor; (7) pros-ecutorial misconduct deprived appellants of a fair trial; (8) several evidentiary rulings by the district court were erroneous; and (9) the district court erred in enhancing appellants\u2019 sentences for the \u201cuse of a special skill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">The government has filed a cross-appeal arguing that the district court erred in failing to consider the middlemen\u2019s share of the payments made by appellants in calculating the value of the bribe to determine appellants\u2019 offense level under \u00a7 2B4.1 (\u201cCommercial Bribery and Kickbacks\u201d) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cthe guidelines\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">By an opinion issued today in this case, we have addressed two of appellants\u2019 arguments: that the conduct they engaged in did not constitute a \u201cscheme or artifice to defraud\u201d as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 1346 because there was no evidence of actual or intended economic or pecuniary harm and that \u00a7 1346 is void for vagueness. For the reasons discussed below, we find appellants\u2019 remaining challenges to lack merit. We also reject the government\u2019s claim raised in its cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">Appellants argue that an adjuster\u2019s breach of a company\u2019s internal code of conduct cannot constitute mail fraud, and even if it could, then only if the breach is material to the transaction, which, they argue, was not the case here. We reject this argument. First of all, our cases have made clear that the breach of an internal code of conduct is sufficient to prove deprivation of honest services under \u00a7 1346 because the code of conduct constitutes proof of the duty owed by the employee to the employer. As we held in <em>United States v. Middlemiss, </em>217 F.3d 112, 120 (2d Cir. 2000), by \u201cviolating] his employer\u2019s rules regarding conflicts of interest and financial disclosures!, defendant] ... did not render all the services that a totally faithful employee would have provided [his employer], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>and his actions were not in the best interests of his employer.\u201d Contrary to appellants\u2019 assertion, an employee need not owe a fiduciary duty to his employer for purposes of \u00a7 1346. <em>See United States v. Sancho, 157 F.3d 918, 921 (2d Cir.1998) (per </em>curiam) (\u201cSection 1346 does not require the existence of a fiduciary relationship.\u201d). As for whether the breach must be material to the transaction, we need not address this argument because the case at hand satisfied any such requirement. The very reason bribes were paid to the adjusters was to obtain favorable results in settlements. The insurance companies, acting as reasonable entities, were bound to have considered the fact that their employees had a financial interest in settling cases to be important information with respect to those settlements. <em>See United States v. Dinome, </em>86 F.3d <em>277, </em>280 (2d Cir.1996) (affirming jury instruction charging that a representation was material if \u201ca reasonable person might have considered [it] important in making a decision\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Rodolitz, </em>786 F.2d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.1986) (holding, in a case involving falsified insurance claims, that \u201cthe government needed to prove only that [defendant] employed a deceptive scheme intending to prevent the insurer from determining for itself a fair value of recovery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Appellants next contend that the government failed to establish use of the mails sufficient to bring their conduct within the jurisdictional scope of the mail fraud statute. The mail fraud statute does not require that \u201c[t]he scheme to defraud ... contemplate the use of the mails as an essential part of the scheme.\u201d <em>United States v. Altman, </em>48 F.3d 96, 102 (2d Cir.1995). It is sufficient if the defendant\u2019s use of the mails is \u201cat least incident to an essential part of the scheme.\u201d <em>Middlemiss, </em>217 F.3d at 120. Thus, a conviction will stand if the government establishes that the defendant \u201c \u2018act[ed] with knowledge that the use of the mails will follow in the ordinary course of business, or where such use can reasonably be foreseen, even though not actually intended.\u2019 \u201d <em>Altman, </em>48 F.3d at 102-03 (quoting <em>Per-eira v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 1, 8-9, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1954)) (alteration in original). We hold that this requirement was easily satisfied here given that the settlement checks issued by the insurance companies (i.e., the fruition of the scheme) were sent by mail. In addition, several of the bribes were invoiced and paid by mad. Finally, the appellants\u2019 mandatory filings with the New York State Office of Court Administration, which were adulterated to help conceal the fraud, were sent by mail. <em>See Schmuck v. United States, </em>489 U.S. 705, 712, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 103 L.Ed.2d 734 (1989) (holding that mailing of title-registration forms satisfied mailing requirement because they contributed to success of the scheme).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Appellants argue that their prosecution under the mail- and wire-fraud statutes violated principles of federalism and the Tenth Amendment. These claims are frivolous. Having proved the elements of mail and wire fraud, this case rests squarely within the group of cases that have prosecuted similar private sector frauds under federal law, and appellants\u2019 conduct is precisely the type of misuse of the mails and wires the statutes were meant to address. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Von Barta, </em>635 F.2d 999, 1005 (2d Cir.1980). In a similar vein, appellants argue that the conduct at issue here was not illegal under New York state law and, therefore, could not form the basis of federal charges. We note that both the trial and appellate courts that were involved in the state court proceedings initially brought against the appellants and others based on the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>scheme found that the type of conduct at issue here did violate state law. <em>See New York v. Wolf, </em>284 A.D.2d 102, 726 N.Y.S.2d 83, 84 (N.Y.App.Div.2001) (holding that similar conduct by co-defendant of Grae and Rybicki \u201csatisfie[d] the elements of commercial bribery ... and scheme to defraud\u201d), <em>leave to appeal granted, </em>96 N.Y.2d 926, 732 N.Y.S.2d 644, 758 N.E.2d 670 (2001); <em>People v. Reynolds, </em>174 Misc.2d 812, 667 N.Y.S.2d 591 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1997) (denying motions to dismiss indictment charging multiple defendants\u2014including Grae and Rybicki\u2014with commercial bribery and scheme to defraud on grounds that scheme, if proven, would satisfy all required elements of both statutes). In any event, it is well settled that a fraudulent scheme need not violate state law in order to support a federal mail or wire fraud conviction. <em>See United States v. Sawyer, </em>85 F.3d 713, 726 (1st Cir.1996); <em>see also McNally v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 350, 377 n. 10, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Appellants next challenge several of the district court\u2019s jury instructions, specifically, the instructions given on the issues of \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d harm, \u201cconstructive trust,\u201d \u201cbreach of fiduciary duty,\u201d and \u201chonest belief.\u201d The parties dispute whether appellants preserved their objections for appeal. We need not resolve this dispute because we find that appellants\u2019 claims lack merit even under the less-stringent standard we apply to preserved objections. Under this standard, we review claims of error in jury instructions <em>de novo </em>and will grant a new trial only where the jury has been misled as to the correct legal standard or inadequately informed of the law and where the error is not harmless. <em>Gordon v. New York City Bd. of Educ., </em>232 F.3d 111, 115-16 (2d Cir.2000). An error is harmless \u201cif the court is convinced that the error did not influence the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The district court instructed the jury that in order to convict the appellants, they had to find that it was \u201creasonably foreseeable [to the appellants] that the companies in question might suffer economic harm as a result of the breach of the employee\u2019s duty.\u201d As discussed more fully in the opinion we issue today in this case, this instruction accurately reflected the law and, therefore, was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The district court also charged the jury that among an employee\u2019s duties to its employer is an obligation to account for secret profits. Appellants argue that this was error, relying on <em>United States v. Miller, </em>997 F.2d 1010 (2d Cir.1993). <em>Miller, </em>however, was not an honest services case, but an ordinary property fraud. We held that the government had failed to establish the deprivation of a property interest because a constructive trust was not a property interest. <em>Id. </em>at 1019. Thus <em>Miller </em>is inapposite because the issue here was whether the employer was deprived of its right to honest services. Indeed, the <em>Miller </em>court stated that \u201c[i]t is settled law that an agent owes his principal a duty of loyalty, and must account for any profits realized in connection with his representation of the principal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1018. There was no error in the district court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Appellants also challenge the district judge\u2019s instructions concerning the claims adjusters\u2019 duty of loyalty to their employers, specifically her instruction that the jury need not find that a fiduciary relationship existed and also that each of the insurance companies \u201chad a strict prohibition against claims adjusters [deriving] any personal gain from settlements.\u201d These claims lack merit. As discussed above, \u00a7 1346 does not require proof of a fiduciary duty. <em>See Sancho, </em>157 F.3d at 920-21. In addition, the company codes of conduct did strictly prohibit employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>from deriving personal gain from the settlements. Again, we find no error in this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Finally, appellants rely on <em>United States v. Rossomando, </em>144 F.3d 197 (2d Cir.1998), to argue that the district court\u2019s instruction on good faith warrants reversal. The district court, after instructing the jury about the specific intent the government was required to prove and that good faith is a defense, continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">No amount of honest belief on the part of the defendant, if such a belief existed, that the venture would ultimately succeed in such a way that no one would, in the end, suffer any loss or be deprived of the intangible right of honest services will excuse fraudulent conduct by the defendant if you conclude that such omissions were made with the specific intent to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services, even in the short term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In Rossomando, this court reversed a similar charge under a plain error standard on the ground that it might be prejudicially confusing because it might mislead the jury into convicting even if they found that the defendant did not intend to harm the victim. Rossomando, 144 F.3d at 199-201. The charge here is distinguishable from that given in Rossomando because appellants\u2019 assertion that they never intended any financial loss to the insurance companies created a factual predicate for the instruction and because the instruction here was modified to clarify that the jury had to find that the appellants intended to deprive the insurance companies of honest services. <em>See United States v. Koh, </em>199 F.3d 632, 641 (2d Cir.1999) (upholding similar instruction on grounds that there was a factual predicate for it and the language had been modified so that it \u201cclearly informed the jury that they could not convict [the defendant] unless he intended to cause loss to someone\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original). Accordingly, we find that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Among several challenges to the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, appellants contend that the district court erred in admitting the \u201cMcGrath Cards\u201d against defendant Grae under the business records exception and Quigley\u2019s testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), and, further, that this evidence was unduly prejudicial to co-defendant Rybicki. \u201c[W]e review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion,\u201d <em>United States v. Sewell, </em>252 F.3d 647, 650 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 382, 151 L.Ed.2d 291 (2001), and find no such abuse here. The district court\u2019s decision to admit the McGrath Cards was properly based on its findings that they were created by McGrath, a person with knowledge, in the regular course of business; they were authenticated by Quigley, who was familiar with McGrath\u2019s system and had frequently relied on the cards themselves; and they constituted records whose accuracy was essential to the success of the criminal venture, thus providing adequate indicia of trustworthiness and reliability to warrant their admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">Equally without merit is appellants\u2019 argument that Quigley\u2019s testimony concerning the five to ten transactions he conducted with Grae in the early 1980\u2019s when he was an insurance adjuster was improperly admitted under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), and that even if properly admissible under 404(b), should have been excluded under Rule 403 because its probative value was outweighed by the prejudice it caused to Grae and Rybicki. We agree with the district court\u2019s assessment that Quigley\u2019s testimony about the earlier transactions was relevant to the issue of Grae\u2019s knowledge and intent with respect to payments to adjusters, as well as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Grae\u2019s later relationship with Quigley as a middleman. Thus, the testimony was properly admitted given appellants\u2019 refusal to stipulate to the issues of knowledge and intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">As for spillover prejudice to Rybicki, the district court specifically instructed the jury that they could consider the McGrath Cards and Quigley\u2019s testimony only as evidence of Grae\u2019s relationships with McGrath and Quigley and that the jurors could not consider this evidence against either Rybicki or the firm. This limiting instruction was sufficient to prevent any prejudicial spillover.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The last two issues we address concern the sentences imposed upon appellants by the district court. Appellants object to the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-level enhancement in their sentences for their use of a \u201cspecial skill\u201d in the commission of the crime pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. We must \u201cgive due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e). Here, the district court agreed with the government that the appellants\u2019 skills as attorneys were integral to the fraud scheme. The district court was particularly persuaded by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Fritzson, </em>979 F.2d 21, 22 (2d Cir.1992) <em>(per curiam), </em>where we upheld application of the enhancement for the defendant\u2019s use of accounting skills, finding that \u201c[t]he fact that the same offenses could have been committed by a person without the defendant\u2019s special training is immaterial; a \u00a7 3B1.3 adjustment is proper where the defendant\u2019s special skills increase his chances of succeeding or of avoiding detection.\u201d We agree with the government that here, although the other conspirators need not have been lawyers, it was necessary to the scheme that the appellants were lawyers who represented personal injury clients. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Finally, we address the government\u2019s argument that the district judge erred in calculating the amount of the bribes for sentencing purposes under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B4.1 because she did not include the amount of money paid to the middlemen, but only included the amount paid by the middlemen to the adjusters. We are not persuaded by the government\u2019s argument, which is not supported by the primary case upon which it relies. In <em>United States v. Sutton, </em>13 F.3d 595, 597 (2d Cir.1994) <em>(per curiam), </em>while the court did state that \u201cthe bribes ... paid to Sutton usually ranged from $750 to $1200, including the premiums paid to the middlemen,\u201d this fact had little bearing on the holding affirming the district court\u2019s calculation. In fact, the district court ultimately applied a much lower amount of $250 per bribe. <em>Id. </em>In affirming the district court\u2019s calculation, we observed that \u201c[t]he commentary to \u00a7 2F1.1 specifies that loss \u2018need not be determined with precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, cmt. n. 8 (1993)). We concluded that \u201cthe district court\u2019s findings will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the district court rejected the government\u2019s calculation method, determining that \u201cit is appropriate in light of all the factors to strictly construe this term bribe and to give the defendants the benefit of that interpretation.\u201d We fail to see how the district court\u2019s calculation was either unreasonable or clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">We have carefully considered all of appellants\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to lack merit. Accordingly, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>reasons set forth above, the judgments of the district court are hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
