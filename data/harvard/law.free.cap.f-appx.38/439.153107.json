We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Blitz, </em>151 F.3d 1002, 1009 (9th Cir.1998). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Anderson contends that the district court erred by applying a four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) for transfer of an explosive device with reason to believe that it would be used in connection with another felony offense. Anderson specifically argues that the evidence relied upon by the district court shows that the agent to whom Anderson sold the explosives intended to use them to blow up <em>his own </em>car, thereby not committing another felony as 2K2.1(b)(5) requires. This contention is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The record shows that at sentencing the government produced transcripts of taped conversations between Anderson and a government agent in which: the agent informed Anderson that he intended to use the purchased pipe bombs to \u201cblow up\u201d another man\u2019s car; and Anderson gave the agent specific instructions on how to do so. The defense has failed to produce any evidence supporting its alternative interpretation of these transcripts. Accordingly, the district court did not err by finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that an enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2k2.1(b)(5) was appropriate. <em>See Blitz, </em>151 F.3d at 1009 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b465-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
