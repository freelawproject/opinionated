At trial, the parties stipulated that Lamb was previously convicted of two state drug felonies. One of those felony offenses formed the essential element of the prior felony for the \u00a7 922(g)(1) charge. Pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) and 4Al.l(c) respectively, the district court used these two prior state felony convictions to upwardly adjust both Lamb\u2019s base offense level and his criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-22\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error and its related legal conclusions, including the application of the sentencing guidelines, de novo. <em>See United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). Lamb claims the district court violated the Double Deopardy and Due Process Clauses of the Constitution by impermissibly imposing multiple punishments for a single offense. We find these contentions to be without merit. We held in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>32 F.3d 82, 84 (4th Cir.1994), that \u201cwhere the legislature has specifically authorized cumulative punishments for the same conduct, there is not double jeopardy.\u201d Both USSG \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) and 4A1.1(c) contemplate that prior felony convictions will be used to determine a defendant\u2019s base offense level and his criminal history category. The district court properly followed the guidelines\u2019 directives, and we are \u201cnot at liberty to disturb an otherwise proper application of the guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>18 F.3d 1173, 1180 (4th Cir.1994). Our reasoning is in line with numerous other circuits. <em>See, e.g.. United States v. Alessandroni, </em>982 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>F.2d 419, 428 (10th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Wyckoff, </em>918 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1990). We reject Lamb\u2019s due process contention on the same grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Accordingly we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
