In response to Nicewicz\u2019s request, an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing on his denial and likewise found him to be ineligible for SSI benefits on September 17, 1998. The Appeals Council denied Nicewicz\u2019s request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s determination the final decision of the Commissioner. Nicewicz instituted a civil action under 42 U.S.C. 405(g) to obtain review of this decision in the District Court. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the Court referred the case to Magistrate Judge Thomas M. Blewitt, who filed a Report and Recommendation denying Nicewicz\u2019s appeal on the grounds that substantial evidence existed to support the denial of benefits. The District Court adopted the Report and Recommendation. This appeal followed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-17\">Social Security regulations prescribe a five-step process in evaluating a claim for SSI benefits. 20 C.F.R. 416.920 (2002). First, Nicewicz must establish that he was not performing \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d He must next prove that he suffers from a severe impairment. If so, the Commissioner must determine whether the impairment meets or equals those listed in Appendix 1. If so, the inquiry ends with a finding of disability. If not, Nicew-icz must establish that he cannot perform his past relevant work. If he does so, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to prove that work Nicewicz can perform is available in significant numbers in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-18\">On two separate occasions in 1997, Ni-cewicz briefly returned to work. The ALJ found his post-accident work attempts to be \u201cunsuccessful.\u201d He further found that Nicewicz suffered from severe lumbosacral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>disc disease that did not meet or equal those impairments listed in the Appendix. Despite the impairment, he retained the ability to perform \u201cthe full range of light work activity\u201d work. However, he could not do his past relevant work. To determine if jobs Nicewicz could perform existed in significant numbers in the national economy, the ALJ referred solely to medical-vocational guidelines, or \u201cgrids,\u201d promulgated by the Secretary of Social Security. To apply the grids, the ALJ made two findings: Nicewicz\u2019s allegations as to the severity and extent of his subjective complaints were \u201cnot entirely credible,\u201d and Nicewicz was a \u201cyounger individual\u201d with a limited education.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">We must uphold the ALJ\u2019s decision if it was supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 405(g) (\u201cThe findings of the Commissioner of Social Security as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.\u201d). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (citation omitted). It is not \u201ca large or significant amount of evidence, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Nicewicz raises three issues on appeal. First, he claims that the ALJ erred in giving only \u201climited weight\u201d to the testimony of his treating physician, Dr. Douglas K. Sanderson. Courts give a treating physician\u2019s opinion controlling weight if it \u201cis well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [a claimant\u2019s] case record.\u201d 20 C.F.R. 404.1527(d)(2). Dr. Sanderson merely stated that Nicewicz would be confined \u201cfull time to a very structured and limited sedentary occupational activity,\u201d and that he was \u201cstill having disability.\u201d Dr. Alan E. VanSant found Nicewicz to be capable of light work activity. The opinion of Nicewicz\u2019s current treating physician, Dr. Jay J. Cho, who saw him several times closer to the date of the determination, was that he was capable of light-duty work. Therefore, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision not to give Dr. Sanderson\u2019s opinion, such as it was, controlling weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">Nicewicz next asserts that the ALJ erred in \u201cdisregarding\u201d his subjective complaints of pain, listing all of the medical reports that detail his many complaints of pain. He misreads the ALJ\u2019s decision. The ALJ did not disregard his complaints, but merely found that they were \u201cnot entirely credible regarding the extent and severity of his subjective complaints, and their effect on his ability to perform substantial gainful activity.\u201d There is no doubt that Nicewicz is experiencing real pain. But three doctors\u2014Morganstein, Van Sant, and Cho\u2014found him to be capable of working. There is no evidence of radiculopathy (radiation of pain to the lower extremities) or \u201ctrue\u201d herniation, only a bulging disc that did not affect his neural structures. Nicewitz walks with a normal gait. Therefore, there was substantial evidence from which the ALJ could conclude that Nicewicz\u2019s testimony was not completely rehable.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">Finally, Nicewicz asserts that the ALJ erred by failing to hear testimony by a vocational expert, and instead relied on medical-vocational guidelines, or \u201cgrids,\u201d to assess whether jobs Nicewicz was capable of performing exist in significant numbers in the national economy. Whether he is correct turns on whether Nicewicz suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>fered from nonexertional, as well as exer-tional, impairments. Exertional impairments affect only a claimant\u2019s \u201cability to meet the strength demands of jobs (sitting, standing, walking, lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling).\u201d 20 C.F.R. 404.1569(b). In contrast, nonexertional impairments affect a claimant\u2019s ability to handle other demands of the job. Examples include pain, nervousness, anxiety, depression, and inability to concentrate or remember. <em>Id. </em>at (c). We have held that where nonexer-tional impairments exist, a court cannot rely solely on the medical-vocational grids to determine disability. <em>Sykes v. Apfel, </em>228 F.3d 259, 270 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The Magistrate Judge found that the ALJ relied on substantial evidence in determining that Nicewicz suffered only from exertional impairments. He relied on the reports of Drs. Steven E. Morganstein and Lance Owen Yarus, as well as Dr. Sander-son (the last observing that Nicewicz\u2019s general health, aside from back problems, was \u201cgood\u201d). Nicewicz himself testified at the February 18, 1998, hearing before the ALJ that no condition aside from the back disorder was keeping him from the work force.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Nicewicz argues that his pain is both an exertional and nonexertional impairment. While he acknowledges that the Magistrate Judge was correct in viewing some of his symptoms\u2014his pain while sitting, standing, or walking for more than fifteen to twenty minutes, and his ability to lift only thirteen pounds\u2014as exertional, he argues that \u201cpain affects him in ways that are undoubtedly non-exertional as well.\u201d He points to his testimony about the dizziness, drowsiness, and lack of concentration he experiences as side effects of the pain medication he must take. There is no record of Nicewicz describing these symptoms to any of his doctors, even though he did complain to Dr. Cho about side effects from two other medications, Daypro and Zoloft. This omission, coupled with the ALJ\u2019s finding that his complaints of pain were not entirely credible, supports the ALJ\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Finally, Nicewicz argues the ALJ incorrectly determined that he had a limited, rather than marginal, education level. He was born in Poland, and only received an eighth-grade education there. This constitutes substantial evidence that Nicewicz had a \u201climited education,\u201d defined as seventh through eleventh grade. 20 C.F.R. 404.1564(b)(3). The ALJ took this limitation into account when using the grid at the fifth step of the inquiry, because one of the four factors was education.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Because we find there to be substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s denial of SSI benefits to Nicewicz, we affirm the District Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
