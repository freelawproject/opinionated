It is</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">ORDERED that the petition for review be denied and that the cross-application for enforcement be granted. The Board reasonably determined, based on substantial evidence in the record, that the petitioner is a successor employee to Marriott Corporate Services/Thompson Hospitality L.P. because there is continuity of both workforce and enterprise. <em>See CitiSteel USA, Inc. v. NLRB, 53 </em>F.3d 350, 356 (D.C.Cir.1995) (\u201c[T]he obligation of a new employer to recognize a union rests on two preconditions: <em>\u2018a </em>majority of the employees must have worked for the predecessor employer, and there must be continuity of operations.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United Mine Workers Local 1329 v. NLRB, </em>812 F.2d 741, 743 (D.C.Cir.1987); <em>id. </em>at 354 (\u2018We will uphold the NLRB\u2019s successorship determination unless it is not supported by substantial evidence or the Board acted arbitrarily or otherwise erred in applying established law to the facts of the case.\u201d) (citing <em>Fall River Dyeing &amp; Finishing Corp. v. NLRB, </em>482 U.S. 27, 42, 107 S.Ct. 2225, 96 L.Ed.2d 22 (1987); <em>International Union of Petroleum &amp; Indus. Workers v. NLRB, </em>980 F.2d 774, 778 (D.C.Cir.1992)). Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that the petitioner\u2019s catering workers functioned and were treated as employees, and not as independent contractors, so that the petitioner was under a duty to bargain with their collective bargaining representative and was prohibited from unilaterally changing their terms and conditions of employment. Nor is the Board\u2019s separate finding that the petitioner was not a \u201cperfectly clear\u201d successor <em>ab initio</em>\u2014and was therefore \u201cfree to set initial terms on which it w[ould] hire the employees of [its] predecessor,\u201d <em>NLRB v. Burns Int\u2019l Security Servs., Inc., </em>406 U.S. 272, 294-95, 92 S.Ct. 1571, 32 L.Ed.2d 61 (1972)\u2014at odds with the Board\u2019s finding of a bargaining obligation based on the petitioner\u2019s subsequent hiring of substantially the same workforce to perform substantially the same work. Accordingly, the Board reasonably determined that the petitioner violated section 8(a)(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), (5), by refusing to bargain with its employees\u2019 collective bargaining representative and by unilaterally making changes to the terms and conditions of their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
