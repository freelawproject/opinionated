They now appeal their convictions and sentences, raising a variety of claims. Because none of these claims has merit, we AFFIRM the defendants\u2019 convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">In 1998, while conducting a wiretap on Rodriguez\u2019s cellular phone that had been authorized by the State of New York, John Saager (\u201cSaager\u201d), a detective with the Drug Enforcement Task Force of the New York City Police Department (\u201cNY-DETF\u201d), intercepted Rodriguez\u2019s drug-related conversations with Diaz, who lived in Detroit, Michigan. Based on these interceptions, Special Agent Donald Grace (\u201cGrace\u201d) of the Drug Enforcement Agency obtained a federal court order in Detroit for a wiretap on Diaz\u2019s phones and pager.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Police investigation resulted in the January 17, 1999, seizure of approximately $80,000 in cash from a bag carried by Rodriguez and the February 5, 1999, seizure of two kilograms of heroin from a bag in Rodriguez\u2019s car. On November 3, 1999, the United States (\u201cGovernment\u201d) filed a fourth superseding indictment against Rodriguez, Diaz, and seven co-defendants. Rodriguez and Diaz were charged with two of the six counts: Count One, for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846, and Count Six, for conspiracy to launder monetary instruments in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h). Rodriguez and Diaz pleaded not guilty. Six of their co-defendants pleaded guilty; the case against the ninth co-defendant was eventually dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">On January 4, 2000, after holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Rodriguez\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the wiretap and the searches of his bag and car. On January 13, 2000, Rodriguez and Diaz proceeded to a jury trial and were convicted of all charges. On May 10, 2000, the district court sentenced Rodriguez to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently with an undischarged sentence in New York, a five-year term of supervised release on Count One, and a concurrent three-year term of supervised release on Count Six; it also ordered a special assessment of $100 on each count. On December 11, 2000, the district court sentenced Diaz to imprisonment for 240 months on Count One and 120 months on Count Six, to be served consecutively, and a three-year term of supervised release on both counts, to be served concurrently; it also ordered a special assessment of $100 on each count. These timely appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">II. <em>United States v. Rodriguez</em></p>\n<p id=\"Azg\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">1. Wiretap Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">Rodriguez argues that the district court erred in holding that there was probable cause for the wiretap on his phone, which a New York state court had authorized on the basis of an affidavit submitted by Saager and supported by a confidential informant. Rodriguez alleges that this affidavit was constitutionally deficient because it demonstrated \u201can insufficient showing of veracity of hearsay information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>from an untested drug addict informant.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. I at 22. With respect to a motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and factual findings for clear error, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed in the district court. <em>United States v. Hurst, </em>228 F.3d 751, 756 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">A magistrate may issue a search warrant if \u201cthere is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). The standard for a wiretap requires a court to judge the evidence \u201con the totality of the circumstances and in a reasonable and common sense manner.\u201d <em>United States v. Alfano, </em>838 F.2d 158, 161 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 821, 109 S.Ct. 64, 102 L.Ed.2d 42 (1988). We pay \u201cgreat deference ... to the determination of an issuing judge,\u201d which we will not reverse \u201cif the record contains a substantial basis for his probable cause findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In this case, Saager\u2019s affidavit was supported by a confidential informant who was working for the NYDETF for the first time. Therefore, Saager attempted to corroborate the information provided by the informant. First, he analyzed telephone records to substantiate the informant\u2019s allegation that Rodriguez had used the target cellular phone and a former cellular phone to conduct trafficking in narcotics. Saager\u2019s team also corroborated the informant\u2019s prediction that Rodriguez would be at a particular location on a particular date and at a particular time. <em>See Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 245, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (emphasizing that the \u201cfuture actions of third parties [are] ordinarily not easily predicted\u201d). Surveillance also tended to confirm the information that Rodriguez or the person who used the target cellular phone drove a gray Oldsmobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In <em>Gates, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cindependent investigative work\u201d that corroborated \u201cmajor portions of [an anonymous] letter\u2019s predictions\u201d was enough to sustain a magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 244-46, 103 S.Ct. 2317. The <em>Gates </em>Court specifically noted that the corroboration of certain claims could indicate the veracity of other claims: \u201cBecause an informant is right about some things, he is more probably right about other facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (quotation omitted). Although the evidence presented to the judge in this case might not have been enough to convict Rodriguez, it was sufficient to support the issuance of a wiretap on Rodriguez\u2019s phone. We therefore hold that the district court did not err in refusing to suppress the wiretap evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">2. Consent to Search</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Two searches and seizures are at issue in this case: (1) the January 17, 1999, search and seizure of almost $80,000 from Rodriguez and (2) the February 5, 1999, search and seizure of two kilograms of heroin from Rodriguez\u2019s car. It is well established \u201cthat a search authorized by consent is wholly valid\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 222, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). The prosecution is required to show only that the consent was given both freely and voluntarily. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Bustamonte, </em>the Supreme Court established that the voluntariness of a consent to a search should be determined from the totality of the circumstances, including \u201cboth the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226-27, 93 S.Ct. 2041.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>a. Search on January 17</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Although Rodriguez alleges that any consent to search that he might have given was coerced, he makes no real effort to challenge the first search and seizure. On January 17, after Rodriguez had exited a train at New York City\u2019s Penn Station, Saager and Sergeant Gerard Neville (\u201cNe-ville\u201d) identified themselves as police officers, told Rodriguez \u201cboth verbally [in English] and with ... hand motions\u201d that their dog had hit on the bag that he was carrying, and asked him if they could look inside the bag. Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 376-78, 390. Saager and Neville later testified that Rodriguez appeared to understand them and that he gave his consent to the search. Edwin Ocasio, a Spanish-speaking investigator with the NYDETF, also testified that Rodriguez answered in the affirmative when asked in Spanish whether he understood what was going on and whether the police could search his bags for drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Given these facts, we hold that the district court did not commit clear error in finding that Rodriguez expressly consented to the search of his bag. At the suppression hearing, defense counsel attempted to establish that Rodriguez did not voluntarily give his consent because (1) he was confronted at the train station by eight to ten officers and (2) he stood half a foot shorter than Saager. The other officers, however, talked to other passengers who exited from Rodriguez\u2019s train, and there is no indication in the record that Rodriguez was physically intimidated into consenting to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">b. Search on February 5</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">On February 5, after keeping Rodriguez under surveillance for more than nine hours, Saager \u201cboxed [Rodriguez] into [his] parking spot\u201d and asked him to leave his vehicle. J.A. at 383-84. Saager later testified that Rodriguez appeared to recognize him from their encounter on January 17. Noticing a bag in the back of the car, Saager asked Rodriguez in Spanish if it contained more money. When Rodriguez \u201cshook his head no,\u201d Saager asked, apparently in English, if he could look inside the bag, at which point Rodriguez \u201cshrugged his shoulders and then nodded his head yes.\u201d J.A. at 384. The district court observed that these gestures were less clear in their expression of consent than Rodriguez\u2019s verbal affirmation on January 17, but found that Rodriguez had consented to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Rodriguez argues that his consent was coerced because he \u201cwas in shock, blocked in and unable to move, was not addressed in his own language and was surrounded by the NYPD narcotics team.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. I at 29. The record supports this account, although it is unclear when all the members of Saager\u2019s group arrived at the scene. However, we observe that Saager himself was the only officer who stopped Rodriguez. In addition, there is no allegation that Saager made an \u201covert act or threat of force against\u201d Rodriguez or that the two men had any interaction other than the asking and answering of the question whether Saager could look inside the bag. <em>United States v. Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 424, 96 S.Ct. 820, 46 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976). Furthermore, a key difference between the two searches is that Rodriguez was informed after the January 17 search - in Spanish - of his right to refuse a search. Although Saager did not offer this advice on February 5, Rodriguez knew that he did not have to consent to the search. We therefore hold that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Rodriguez consented to the search on February 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Rodriguez challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>acquittal based on the insufficiency of the evidence. We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of such a motion. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>194 F.3d 758, 764 (6th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1180, 120 S.Ct. 1217, 145 L.Ed.2d 1118 (2000). In reviewing this claim, we determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">1. Drug Conspiracy</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Rodriguez contends on appeal that the evidence was sufficient to prove that he \u201csimply had a buyer-seller relationship with Diaz only,\u201d not that he agreed to be part of a drug conspiracy moving multiple kilogram shipments of heroin and cocaine. Appellant\u2019s Br. I at 35. He also alleges that he was forced into transporting the two kilograms of heroin that were found in his possession at the time of his arrest. \u201cTo establish a drug conspiracy, the government must prove (1) an agreement to violate drug laws; (2) knowledge and intent to join the conspiracy; and (3) participation in the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Layne, </em>192 F.3d 556, 567 (6th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1029, 120 S.Ct. 1443, 146 L.Ed.2d 330 (2000). \u201cProof of a formal agreement is unnecessary; a tacit or mutual understanding among the parties is sufficient to show a conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>928 F.2d 1450, 1457 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In this case, Rodriguez essentially contests the extent of his knowledge of the scope of the conspiracy. The evidence presented at trial, however, indicated that Rodriguez spoke frequently with Diaz about drugs and delivered at least three kilograms of heroin to Diaz in Detroit. This evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. <em>See United States v. Nesbitt, </em>90 F.3d 164, 167 (6th Cir.1996) (noting that \u201cadvanced planning and multiple transactions involving large quantities of illegal drugs is also evidence that [the defendant\u2019s involvement was not confined to a buyer-seller relationship\u201d); <em>United States v. Bourjaily, </em>781 F.2d 539, 545 (6th Cir.1986) (holding that \u201c[a] large volume of narcotics\u201d - one kilogram of cocaine in that case - \u201ccreates an inference of a conspiracy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Rodriguez\u2019s coercion argument is also unavailing. As the Government notes, Rodriguez was part of the drug conspiracy for months before his arrest in February 1999, when he was found to be in possession of two kilograms of heroin. Therefore, a rational trier of fact could have found Rodriguez guilty of conspiracy for the time when he was not allegedly under duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">2. Money Laundering Conspiracy</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Rodriguez argues that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction for conspiracy to launder money. In <em>United States v. Reed, </em>77 F.3d 139 (6th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 U.S. 1246, 116 S.Ct. 2504, 135 L.Ed.2d 194 (1996), we held that the delivery of drug proceeds to another \u201cwith the intent to promote the carrying on of further drug activity\u201d would violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956. <em>Id. </em>at 142. \u201c[T]he mere transportation of cash,\u201d however, would not suffice. <em>Id. </em>at 143. In this case, Walter Ramirez Manasas (\u201cRamirez\u201d) testified that Rodriguez delivered $20,000 in drug proceeds to him to transport to New York. Once in New York, Rodriguez asked Ramirez for the money and then paid him $1,500 for the trip, which, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, presumably induced Ramirez to agree to trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>port more heroin in the future. Therefore, under <em>Reed, </em>a rational jury could have found Rodriguez guilty of conspiracy to launder money, and we hold that he was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">C. Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Rodriguez argues that the district court erred in not instructing the jury about the dual roles that Saager and Grace had in testifying for the Government. In addition to serving as fact witnesses, both agents gave opinions about drug-related conversations between Rodriguez and Diaz. Because Rodriguez did not raise an objection in the case below, we review for plain error under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b). <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Such a review requires us to determine whether there was \u201can error that is plain and that affect[s] substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (internal quotation marks omitted). If so, we may exercise our discretion to correct any forfeited error that \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>74 F.3d 676 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 U.S. 1162, 116 S.Ct. 1558, 134 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996), we recognized \u201cthat when a police officer testifies in two different capacities in the same case, there is a significant risk that the jury will be confused by the officer\u2019s dual role.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682. Therefore, we recommended that juries be properly informed when an officer testified as both an expert and a fact witness. <em>Id. </em>at 683. Four years later, in <em>United States v. Tocco, </em>200 F.3d 401 (6th Cir.2000), we held that the district court had not abused its discretion in allowing a government agent to testify as a fact and an expert witness, in part because the district court had \u201cinstructed the jury, both before he gave his opinion and again in the jury charge,\u201d to consider the agent\u2019s dual roles. <em>Id. </em>at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Rodriguez contends (1) that the district \u201ccourt was silent\u201d about officer testimony, giving the jury \u201cno explanation to assist in this sensitive area,\u201d and (2) that the prosecutor made \u201cno effort\u201d to remedy the error. Appellant\u2019s Br. I at 41, 42. The record does not support these contentions. First, the district court did distinguish between Grace\u2019s dual roles in its final charge to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">You\u2019ve heard the opinion testimony of Special Agent Don Grace, a witness with special knowledge or experience, allowed to give an opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-11\">You should consider the fact that he was also a fact witness and he participated in the investigation of this case in deciding how much of his testimony to believe or what weight to give it, if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">J.A. at 1200. Second, the prosecutor\u2019s request at a sidebar conference to explain Grace\u2019s role was opposed by defense counsel, who wanted the appropriate instruction to be given at the end of the trial. Although defense counsel for Rodriguez stated at sentencing that he did not recall this sidebar, defense counsel for Diaz confirmed the prosecutor\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">Because <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Tocco </em>do not appear to require more than a jury charge, we hold that the district court did not err with respect to instructing the jury about Grace\u2019s testimony. The fact that defense counsel opposed an instruction to the jury before Grace testified means that we also reject this claim under the doctrine of invited error. <em>United States v. Sharpe, </em>996 F.2d 125, 129 (6th Cir.) (refusing to reverse on an error that a party \u201cinvited or provoked the court or the opposite party to commit\u201d (quotation omitted)), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>denied, </em>510 U.S. 951, 114 S.Ct. 400, 126 L.Ed.2d 347 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The testimony of two officers, however, is at issue in this ease. The district court did not instruct the jury about Saager\u2019s testimony. At oral argument, the Government acknowledged that the jury should have been so instructed. At trial, however, the prosecutor did distinguish between Saager\u2019s dual roles by explicitly relying on his knowledge and experience as a narcotics investigator when asking him about coded conversations and heroin prices. <em>See Thomas, </em>74 F.3d at 683. We therefore hold that the absence of a jury instruction about Saager\u2019s testimony did not seriously affect the fairness or integrity of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">D. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Rodriguez\u2019s base offense level was initially calculated at 34 (for at least three but less than ten kilograms of heroin), then increased by two points for his role in the offense, resulting in a total offense level of 36. With a criminal history category of I, Rodriguez\u2019s sentencing range was 188 to 235 months. The district court sentenced him to 188 months. Rodriguez now argues that the district court erred in finding by a preponderance of the evidence that he was responsible for at least three kilograms of heroin and that he played an aggravating role in the conspiracy under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 3B1.1(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Rodriguez admits his responsibility for the two kilograms of heroin that were seized on February 5, 1999. Therefore, his only contention on appeal with respect to the additional kilogram of heroin is that the district court committed clear error in crediting \u201cthe uncorroborated assertions of Walter Ramirez, ... [an] admitted long time drug dealer who\u201d pleaded guilty and became a witness for the Government. Appellant\u2019s Br. I at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s findings of fact at sentencing. <em>United States v. Charles, </em>138 F.3d 257, 267 (6th Cir.1998). \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Ramirez testified at trial that Rodriguez had helped him pack a suitcase containing a kilogram of heroin and then transport it to Diaz in Detroit in early December 1998. Ramirez also testified to a second trip to Detroit later that month in which he transported two kilograms of heroin for Rodriguez. Rodriguez characterizes his role in the offense as that of a courier rather than a supplier. According to Ramirez, however, Rodriguez provided the heroin and paid him for transporting the drugs. The district court expressly accepted Ramirez\u2019s testimony, finding that \u201cRodriguez was involved with at least three kilograms\u201d and \u201cthat he at least played some type of a leadership role or supervisory role with respect to certain aspects of the criminal activity.\u201d J.A. at 1232-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">We do not ordinarily review a district court\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>See United States v. Gessa, </em>57 F.3d 493, 496 (6th Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1098, 116 S.Ct. 827, 133 L.Ed.2d 769 (1996). Although Rodriguez questions Ramirez\u2019s credibility, we hold that the district court did not clearly err in sentencing Rodriguez. Ramirez\u2019s testimony was sufficient to support the district court\u2019s findings as to both the quantity of drugs and Rodriguez\u2019s role in the offense. <em>See United States v. Hough, </em>276 F.3d 884, 892 (6th Cir.2002) (holding that a witness\u2019s testimony at trial, which was subject to cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>examination, provided \u201csufficient indicia of reliability\u201d for the sentencing court\u2019s determination of drug quantity).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">III. <em>United States v. Diaz</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">A. Prosecutor\u2019s Exercise of Peremptory Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Diaz argues that the prosecutor \u201cexclude[d] potential jurors on the basis of race.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. II at 16. We review for clear error a district court\u2019s ruling on whether the exercise of a peremptory challenge violates the Equal Protection Clause. <em>McCurdy v. Montgomery County, </em>240 F.3d 512, 521 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Citing <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), defense counsel objected after the prosecutor excused two black jurors. The prosecutor explained that she had dismissed the first juror for \u201cseveral race neutral reasons:\u201d (1) he evidenced hostility towards the Government in answering questions about his son\u2019s mental health and confinement by the state; (2) he seemed unresponsive to or confused about some questions; and (3) \u201che appeared to minimize his son\u2019s involvement with marijuana\u201d and to be \u201cangry concerning that whole judicial process.\u201d J.A. at 438-39. The prosecutor dismissed the second juror because \u201che was under dressed and ... appeared] cocky and at times not very attentive to the proceedings.\u201d J.A. at 439. From the record before us, it appears that defense counsel did not counter the prosecutor\u2019s explanations. The district court stated for the record that he had listened carefully to the voir dire and that the prosecutor had not discharged either juror because of his race.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The Supreme Court has established the following test for deciding whether a party\u2019s exercise of a peremptory challenge violated equal protection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">Under our <em>Batson </em>jurisprudence, once the opponent of a peremptory challenge has made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination (step one), the burden of production shifts to the proponent of the strike to come forward with a race-neutral explanation (step two). If a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide (step three) whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alm\"><em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 767, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995) (per curiam). Diaz has not carried the burden of proving that the prosecutor purposefully discriminated on the basis of race in dismissing the two jurors. <em>See id. </em>at 768, 115 S.Ct. 1769 (\u201c[T]he ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike.\u201d). Indeed, nothing in the record suggests that defense counsel contested the prosecutor\u2019s explanations for the jurors\u2019 dismissal. We therefore reject Diaz\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">B. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">Diaz challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a mistrial, which was made after the prosecutor alleged during her opening statement that Diaz had put drugs \u201con our streets.\u201d J.A. at 443. Defense counsel understood the prosecutor to be \u201creferring to the community here\u201d and characterized the phrase as \u201can improper appeal both to fear of crime [and the jury\u2019s] civic duty.\u201d J.A. at 443. The district court opined that \u201c[i]t probably would have been better had the comment not been made exactly the way it was\u201d but concluded that the comment was not \u201cso offensive or so out of line\u201d as to warrant a mistrial. J.A. at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial. <em>United States v. Wall, </em>130 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>739, 745 (6th Cir.1997). \u201cAn abuse of discretion exists when the reviewing court is firmly convinced that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>United States v. Carroll, </em>26 F.3d 1380, 1383 (6th Cir.1994). In reviewing a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, we first determine whether the statement was improper. <em>United States v. Francis, </em>170 F.3d 546, 549 (6th Cir.1999). To warrant the reversal of a conviction, improper statements must also be flagrant, which requires consideration of the following factors: \u201c1) whether the statements tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; 2) whether the statements were isolated or among a series of improper statements; 3) whether the statements were deliberately or accidentally before the jury; and 4) the total strength of the evidence against the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Although the prosecutor\u2019s statement may have been improper, it was not flagrant. The prosecutor simply pointed out where the defendants were alleged to have carried out their drug conspiracy. Given the extensive evidence of drug-related activity in Detroit, the single reference to \u201cour streets\u201d does not suggest that the jury was misled or that Diaz was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">C. Consecutive Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">After the jury convicted Diaz of belonging to a drug and money laundering conspiracy, the district court sentenced him to imprisonment for 240 months for the former and 120 months for the latter count, with the sentences to be served consecutively. Diaz argues that the imposition of consecutive sentences constituted an abuse of discretion and \u201can \u2018end run\u2019 around <em>Apprendi.\u201d </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. II at 25. With respect to sentencing a defendant under the Sentencing Guidelines, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>278 F.3d 560, 561 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">If the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment, then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment. In all other respects, sentences on all counts shall run concurrently, except to the extent otherwise required by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d). Therefore, district courts may impose consecutive sentences of imprisonment, as long as the combined sentence is no greater than \u201cthe total punishment,\u201d which under Sentencing Guidelines commentary \u201cis determined by the adjusted combined offense level.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2 commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">Diaz\u2019s base offense level was initially calculated at 36 (for at least ten but less than thirty kilograms of heroin), then increased by two points for his role in the offense, resulting in a total offense level of 38. With a criminal history category of III, Diaz\u2019s sentencing range was 292 to 365 months. Because his combined sentence is 360 months, or less than the total punishment, the district court did not err in imposing a consecutive sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. Page, </em>232 F.3d 536, 544 (6th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 1056, 121 S.Ct. 2202, 149 L.Ed.2d 1032 (2001). At oral argument, defense counsel suggested that the district court was unaware of its discretion to impose concurrent sentences. We reject this argument on the basis of the record, which indicates that the district court believed consecutive sentences to be \u201cappropriate\u201d rather than mandatory. J.A. at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">Diaz\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>argument is similarly unavailing. In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In this case, the fourth superseding indictment alleged that Diaz belonged to a conspiracy moving \u201cmulti-kilogram shipments of heroin and cocaine\u201d and specified two particular shipments of \u201capproximately two kilograms of heroin\u201d and \u201capproximately 3/4ths of a kilogram of heroin.\u201d J.A. at 69-71. Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), the statutory maximum for these drug offenses is life. Moreover, the statutory maximum for a drug conspiracy involving an unspecified quantity of those drugs is 240 months; it is 360 months for \u201cany person [who] commits such a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Because Diaz was convicted in 1985 for criminal possession of a controlled substance and sentenced to four and a half to nine years in prison, his sentence in this case was not in violation of <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">D. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Finally, Diaz argues that the prosecution violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b)(3) by corruptly giving \u201csubstantial assistance bribes\u201d to Government witnesses with the intent to influence their testimony. Appellant\u2019s Pro Per Br. at 7. Because Diaz\u2019s brief contains no allegation of corruption in this case, there is no need for us to discuss this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the defendants\u2019 convictions and sentences.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
