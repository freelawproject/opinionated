Cir. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>27(f) and to dismiss Raymond C. Baker, Jr.\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Mr. Baker responds.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">On February 15, 2001, Mr. Baker filed a motion with the Chairman of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Affairs (BVA) seeking reconsideration of a June 13, 1990 BVA final decision denying a service connection claim for arthritis. The Chairman denied Mr. Baker\u2019s motion and Mr. Baker appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the \u201cVeterans Court\u201d). The Veterans Court issued an order concluding that it lacked jurisdiction because Mr. Baker had filed his notice of appeal (NOA) more than 120 days after the 1990 BVA final decision, citing <em>Mayer v. Brown, </em>37 F.3d 618, <em>overruled on different grounds by Bailey v. West, </em>160 F.3d 1360 (Fed.Cir.1998). Mr. Baker appeals that order to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Veterans Court. <em>See Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). Mr. Baker\u2019s appeal does not satisfy any of the grounds for invoking this court\u2019s jurisdiction. The Veterans Court\u2019s order dismissing for lack of jurisdiction did not address or otherwise depend on any issue of validity or interpretation of any statute or regulation, nor did Mr. Baker raise any argument concerning the validity or interpretation of any such provision. <em>See Albun v. Brown, </em>9 F.3d 1528 (Fed.Cir.1993) (appeal seeking review of Veterans Court\u2019s dismissal of appeal for lack of jurisdiction based on appellant\u2019s failure to submit timely NOA did not fall within this court\u2019s jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">In his response, the primary issue Mr. Baker raises is that his representative in the 1990 BVA case \u201cshould have filed Mr. Baker\u2019s motion to reconsider or NOA within 120 days of the Board\u2019s 13 Jun 90 decision.\u201d Mr. Baker fails to make any specific claims concerning constitutional issues or the validity or interpretation of any statutes or regulations. Mr. Baker\u2019s appeal is therefore not within this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
