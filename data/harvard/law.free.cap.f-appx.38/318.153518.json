Lang because in his supporting brief he mischaracterized as frivolous a potential issue for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). And although we ordered briefing on the merits, Mr. Lang has again moved to withdraw, iterating that there are no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. We disagree and will appoint another lawyer to represent the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">On May 9, 2000, police acting on an informant\u2019s tip raided a home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and discovered large quantities of drugs and drug paraphernalia. Curtis Brewer, who had been convicted of distributing cocaine base in 1993, was apprehended as he tried to flee the home. Police later discovered a firearm in Mr. Brewer\u2019s car, which was parked in front of the residence. A grand jury returned a superceding indictment charging Mr. Brewer with possession of 50 grams or more of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)(iii), and of possession of a firearm by a felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). At his bench trial Mr. Brewer stipulated to all of the facts necessary to establish that he possessed a gun in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1), but he contested the drug charge. The district court eventually found him guilty of the gun charge but not guilty of possession with intent to distribute under \u00a7 841(a)(1). In rendering its verdicts, the court noted that the evidence clearly established that Mr. Brewer possessed cocaine base (police discovered 8.556 grams of the drug in his mouth), but nevertheless acquitted him under \u00a7 841(a)(1) because there was reasonable doubt as to whether he intended to distribute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>After the district court announced its verdicts, the government requested that the court convict Mr. Brewer of simple possession of cocaine base under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) because, in the government\u2019s view, that offense is a lesser-included offense of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute under \u00a7 841(a)(1). The government made this request pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(c), which authorizes conviction on any \u201coffense necessarily included in the offense charged.\u201d After taking the government\u2019s request under advisement, the court found Mr. Brewer guilty of possessing more than five grams of cocaine base under \u00a7 844(a). The court then sentenced him to two concurrent terms of 110 months\u2019 incarceration and two concurrent terms of three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">In his original <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel, citing <em>United States v. Hill, </em>196 F.3d 806, 808 (7th Cir.1999), concluded that it would be frivolous for Mr. Brewer to argue that he was improperly convicted of possessing more than five grams of cocaine base under \u00a7 844(a) because, according to counsel, that offense is a lesser-included offense of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute under \u00a7 841(a)(1). In <em>Hill </em>we recognized that simple possession of a <em>controlled substance </em>is a lesser-included offense of possession with intent to distribute because \u201csimple possession is possession with intent to distribute minus intent to distribute.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>196 F.3d at 808. But Mr. Brewer was convicted of possession of <em>cocaine base, </em>and <em>Hill, </em>citing <em>United States v. Michael, </em>10 F.3d 838 (D.C.Cir.1993), acknowledged that \u00a7 844(a) creates a separate crime of possession of cocaine base that is <em>not </em>a lesser-included offense of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance under \u00a7 841(a)(1). <em>See Hill, </em>196 F.3d at 808; <em>see also United States v. Steward, </em>252 F.3d 908, 909 (7th Cir.2001). Thus, in denying counsel\u2019s motion we identified two questions: (1) whether the district court, acting under Rule 31(c), erred by finding Mr. Brewer guilty of possessing more than five grams of crack cocaine under \u00a7 844(a) as a lesser-included offense of the charged offense of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute under \u00a7 841(a)(1); and (2) whether this court may direct the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 to enter a judgment of conviction on the lesser-included offense of simple possession of a controlled substance under \u00a7 844(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Counsel now contends that the district court did indeed err by convicting Mr. Brewer of possessing more than five grams of crack cocaine under \u00a7 844(a) as a lesser-included offense of the charged offense of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute under \u00a7 841(a)(1). But counsel nevertheless concludes that any potential appeal would be frivolous because, in his view, the district court\u2019s error was harmless. According to counsel, this court may direct the district court to enter a judgment of conviction on the true lesser-included offense-simple possession of a controlled substance under \u00a7 844(a). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106. Counsel further contends, however, that remanding the case would be unnecessary because, in his view, \u201cthe sentence given to Curtis Brewer by Judge Clevert would be the same and have the same effect.\u201d But counsel does not explain how or why Mr. Brewer\u2019s sentences would be the same. Because the court convicted Mr. Brewer of possessing more than five grams cocaine base, it utilized the cross-referencing section of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D2.1 to determine his offense level for the drug offense. The court also imposed a two-level multi-count upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D 1.4 because he was also convicted of unlawful firearm possession. But if Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Brewer were to be convicted of simple possession of a controlled substance under \u00a7 844(a), neither of these provisions would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Mr. Lang has failed twice to advance potentially nonfrivolous arguments on Mr. Brewer\u2019s behalf. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and attorney David J. Lang is discharged. Another lawyer will be appointed for Mr. Brewer by separate order, and the clerk of this court is directed to furnish new counsel with a copy of this order. New counsel should brief the \u201clesser-included offense\u201d and \u00a7 2106 issues, as well as any other issue counsel deems appropriate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
