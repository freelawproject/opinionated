After the indictment was returned, the government discovered that King was not in that drug ring, and thus informed King and his co-defendants that it intended to dismiss the indictment in the Southern District of New York and seek an indictment in the Eastern District of New York. Around the same time, King independently moved to dismiss the Southern District of New York indictment for improper venue. On October 7, 1996, the District Court in the Southern District of New York (Denny Chin, <em>Judge) </em>granted the government\u2019s motion for an order of <em>nolle prosequi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-15\">King was indicted on September 16, 1996, in the Eastern District of New York. Three counts of a nine-count, multi-defendant indictment charged that King: (1) \u201c[i]n or about and between November 1994 and January 24, 1996 ... did knowingly and intentionally conspire to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine base ... in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(1)(A))\u201d (Count One); (2) \u201c[o]n or about January 31, 1995 ... did knowingly and intentionally distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine base ... (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(B)(iii))\u201d (Count Five); (3) \u201c[o]n or about October 13, 1995 ... did knowingly and intentionally distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine base ... (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A)(iii))\u201d (Count Six).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-19\">At trial, the government introduced evidence of King\u2019s activities distributing co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>caine base, including tape-recorded sales of cocaine base to government informants and testimony by co-operating witnesses who had sold cocaine base for King. In addition, the government introduced stipulations on King\u2019s part that substances he sold to government informants or that were seized by the government were cocaine base. In total, King stipulated that forensic experts would testify that 266.7 grams of drugs were tested and identified as cocaine base and that those drugs were, according to the Government, seized from him. King neither testified nor called any witnesses at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The jury convicted King on all three counts. At sentencing, the District Court found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that King was responsible for the distribution of at least one and one-half kilograms of cocaine base. In determining King\u2019s sentence pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines, the District Court began with a base offense level of 38 and adjusted upward by four levels based on King\u2019s leadership role. Combined with King\u2019s Criminal History Category of VI, the District Court found the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range to be 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. The District Court imposed a sentence of, <em>inter alia, </em>three consecutive 360-month terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In the instant appeal, King argues that his sentence violates the teachings of <em>Ap-prendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because drug quantity was neither charged in his indictment nor submitted to the jury; instead, the District Court determined, by a mere preponderance of the evidence, the quantity of drugs involved in his crime. We find that any arguable <em>Ap-prendi </em>error in this case was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Following the teachings of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have held that drug quantity is an element of an offense pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 and, therefore, it is error for a court to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence above a \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d based on drug quantity if the government has not charged drug quantity in the indictment and proved it to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>274 F.3d 655, 663 (2d Cir.2001) <em>(en </em>banc). In the absence of any specified or proven drug quantity, the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 for crack cocaine is twenty years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Accordingly, it was error for the District Court to sentence King to a concurrent sentence of, <em>inter alia, </em>imprisonment for thirty years based on its own findings that his crimes involved at least one and a half kilograms of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Because King was convicted of three narcotics offenses, however\u2014each with a statutory maximum of twenty years, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C)\u2014the error was harmless. We recently held in <em>United States v. McLean, </em>287 F.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2002), that an <em>Apprendi </em>error is harmless where, in the absence of the error, the defendant would have received the same sentence by application of the \u201cstacking\u201d provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d). 287 F.3d at 134-35. In this case\u2014as in <em>McLean</em>\u2014the District Court determined an appropriate term of imprisonment under the Guidelines that exceeded the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for each count of conviction. Accordingly, it was required by section 5G1.2(d) to impose <em>consecutive </em>terms of imprisonment for King\u2019s three counts of conviction such that the sentence included a total term of imprisonment equal to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Guidelines calculation. Because such a sentence could have been imposed without the term of imprisonment for any individual count exceeding the statutory maximum of twenty years, the error in King\u2019s sentence was harmless. <em>See id. </em>at 136-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">King also argues on appeal that comments made by the prosecution during summation deprived him of a fair trial, and that the District Court in the Southern District of New York abused its discretion in granting the government leave to dismiss the original indictment in this case. We have considered these arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
