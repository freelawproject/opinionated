Pendelton appeals his conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-22\">Pendelton asserts error in the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the fruits of an search pursuant to a search warrant that he claims was not supported by probable cause. The affidavit presented in support of the warrant application was supported by probable cause. The reliance of the requesting agent on information provided by a confidential informant was not misplaced, and the confidential informant\u2019s testimony at Pendelton\u2019s trial further supported the district court\u2019s finding that the magistrate judge had probable cause to issue the warrant. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 236, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983); <em>United States v. Han, </em>74 F.3d 537, 539 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-23\">Pendelton also contends on appeal that the district court erred in denying his motion for mistrial when evidence was admitted that he possessed a gun prior to the date of the charged criminal activity. \u201c[E]vidence of uncharged conduct is not considered other crimes evidence if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>arose out of the same ... series of transactions as the charged offense, ... or if it is necessary to complete the story of the crime (on) trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>32 F.3d 876, 885 (4th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, \u201cthe mere fact that the evidence involved activities occurring before the charged time frame of the conspiracy does not automatically transform that evidence into \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the testimony and statements at issue helped to explain the crime and rebutted the testimony of one of Pendelton\u2019s witnesses. The district court\u2019s denial of Pendelton\u2019s motion for a mistrial was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Pendelton\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument will not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
