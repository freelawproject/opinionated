Minneman was convicted of conspiracy to commit income tax fraud and sentenced to 30 months imprisonment. He was also ordered to pay $25,000 in restitution to the IRS. Minneman and Punke appealed, and we affirmed their convictions and the restitution order, at least as to Punke, for Minneman didn\u2019t challenge it. <em>United States v. Minneman, </em>143 F.3d 274 (7th Cir.1998). Minneman then filed a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court denied. We denied his request for a certificate of appeal-ability in an unpublished order. <em>United States v. Minneman, </em>6 Fed.Appx. 422 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">To collect on its restitution order, the government, pursuant to the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3205, initiated garnishment proceedings against Minneman. Minneman\u2019s objections to the garnishment were denied by the district court, as was his motion to reconsider. Minneman again appealed, but we dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">Finally, the government moved for a turnover order, which the district court entered. The order directed the garnishee to turn over the cash value of two Minne-man insurance policies and apply the proceeds to the restitution judgment. Minne-man\u2019s appeal of that order is before us today.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">We decline to regurgitate the facts in this order. Anyone interested in them can consult our 1998 published opinion. We only focus on the narrow issue raised in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-15\">When the government elected to use garnishment proceedings, Minneman had made barely a dent in paying down the restitution order. In fact, his balance due on the original $25,000 bill was $24,800. The two Minneman insurance policies (both with Prudential Life) that the government eyed carried cash surrender values of around $5,000 and $2,700. In trying to block the turnover order, Minneman argued that restitution is not part of a sentence, that the district court had no jurisdiction (or authority) to order restitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>tion for a Title 26 tax conviction, and that there was no evidence in the trial record of damages as a result of the offense. He further claimed that the garnishment could not be maintained because of an alleged payment agreement (with the Bureau of Prisons) which had not been breached. Minneman also claimed that the garnishee did not owe him anything because he had not applied for any benefits under the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The district court denied Minneman\u2019s objections. In particular, the court found that the argument that the restitution order was void had been raised and rejected by us on direct appeal. The court also found that a payment agreement with the BOP did not bar further collections and that although Minneman may not have made application for benefits under the policies, he did not dispute that he has the right to cash surrender values.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The short answer to almost all of Minneman\u2019s objections on this present appeal is that his challenge to the validity of the underlying restitution order is precluded by resjudicata. His criminal restitution order is a final judgment, affirmed on appeal over Punke\u2019s objection, while Minneman stood mute on the point. All of Minneman\u2019s objections to the restitution order either could have been (or were) considered by us in affirming his judgment; therefore, those concerns cannot be relitigated in this garnishment proceeding to enforce the restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Minneman\u2019s argument that the payment agreement with the BOP bars garnishment fails because it simply does not bar proceedings under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act. There are at least two reasons for this: agreements of this sort with the BOP may be unilaterally changed, and any BOP payment agreement would not be effective after Minneman\u2019s release from prison. And Minneman, we think (he appeared in court to argue this case), is no longer behind bars.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Minneman\u2019s argument that the cash surrender values of his insurance policies are exempt is waived because he failed to develop it in his appeal. And that\u2019s not too surprising because the argument is without merit, as the only exemptions applicable to a criminal restitution debt are certain tax levy exemptions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(a)(2) and (f). And those tax levy exemptions do not exclude life insurance policies from enforced collections. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6334(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Minneman\u2019s final argument is that he does not have a property right under state law to the cash value of the life insurance policies; therefore, they are not subject to garnishment. Even if Minneman has not applied to receive the cash value of the life insurance policies, he has a right to them, and thus they are subject to the restitution order and enforceable in garnishment. <em>United States v. Bess, </em>357 U.S. 51, 56-57, 78 S.Ct. 1054, 2 L.Ed.2d 1135 (1958); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(c); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6332(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
