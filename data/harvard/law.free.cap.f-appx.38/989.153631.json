Hill\u2019s counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one possible sentencing issue on appeal but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Hill filed a pro se supplemental brief raising search and seizure issues and claiming innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-24\">The presentence report reduced Hill\u2019s offense level by three points for acceptance of responsibility, but his sentence was increased above the Sentencing Guidelines range because the statutory minimum sentences required by the violations to which he pled guilty were greater than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>Guidelines range. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guideline Manual </em>\u00a7 5G1.1(b). Hill pled guilty and his plea constituted an admission of all material elements of the crime. <em>See McCarthy v. United, States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969); <em>United States v. Willis, </em>992 F.2d 489, 490 (4th Cir.1993). Likewise, a voluntary and intelligent plea forecloses review of allegations of antecedent constitutional deprivations. <em>See Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 266-67, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973); <em>Fields v. Attorney General of Maryland, </em>956 F.2d 1290, 1294 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Hill\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
