(Hampton) petitions for review of the Board\u2019s May 31, 2001 decision finding that Hampton violated sections 8(a)(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 <em>et seq., </em>by refusing to recognize and bargain with the Lumber and Saw Mills Workers Union No. 2767 a/w United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of America, AFL-CIO (Union) beginning on November 30, 1999 when Hampton attained successor status and received the Union\u2019s demand letter for recognition. Responding to Hampton\u2019s argument that it was not required to recognize and bargain with the Union in light of an employee petition submitted to it on December 8, 1999, in which a majority of employees declared their desire not to be represented by the Union, the Board first rejected that defense by affirming the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s application of the successor bar rule adopted in <em>St. Elizabeth Manor, Inc., </em>329 NLRB No. 36 (1999).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In the alternative, the Board found Hampton\u2019s unlawful November 30 refusal to recognize the Union presumptively tainted the subsequent employee petition. <em>See Lee Lumber &amp; Bldg. Material Corp. v. NLRB, </em>322 NLRB 175 (1996), <em>aff'd in pertinent part and remanded on other grounds, </em>117 F.3d 1454 (D.C.Cir.1997) (creating presumption that \u201cwhen an employer unlawfully fails or refuses to recognize and bargain with an incumbent union, any employee disaffection from the union that arises during the course of that failure or refusal results from the earlier unlawful conduct\u201d). Hampton claims the Board erred in applying the <em>Lee Lumber </em>presumption because on November 30, 1999, Hampton merely referred the Union\u2019s demand letter to its counsel, which action, Hampton argues, did not constitute an unlawful refusal to bargain. Hampton failed to make this argument to the Board, however, and, accordingly, the court lacks jurisdiction to consider it now. <em>See Parsippany Hotel Mgmt. Co. v. NLRB, </em>99 F.3d 413, 417-18 (D.C.Cir.1996); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (\u201c[n]o objection that has not been urged before the Board ... shall be considered by the court, unless failure or neglect to urge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>such objections shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances\u201d). Notwithstanding the Board raised the <em>Lee Lumber </em>presumption <em>sua sponte, </em>Hampton was nonetheless obligated to make its objection known to the Board, whether through a motion to reconsider, to rehear or to reopen the record as permitted under section 102.48(d)(1) of the Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.48(d)(1). <em>See Woelke &amp; Romero Framing Inc. v. NLRB, </em>456 U.S. 645, 665-66, 102 S.Ct. 2071, 72 L.Ed.2d 398 (1982). Nor do \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d excuse its failure. Hampton\u2019s assertion that the Board\u2019s adoption of the successor bar rule manifests the futility of seeking reconsideration of the application of the <em>Lee Lumber </em>presumption is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Because we enforce the Board\u2019s Order on the alternative rationale set forth above, the court no longer holds any issue in abeyance. It is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">ORDERED that the petition for review is denied and that the cross-application for enforcement is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b56-10\"> Pursuant to Hampton\u2019s request, the court ordered its challenge to the successor bar rule held in abeyance pending the Board's reconsideration of that rule in unrelated cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
