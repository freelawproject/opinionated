The sole issue presented in his appeal is whether the court\u2019s instruction to the jury defining the term \u201cmanufacturing\u201d was incomplete. We find no error and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">Three deputy sheriffs, on a stakeout investigating the manufacture of marijuana, observed King with a hoe in a field of over 600 marijuana plants. King was digging with the hoe between two beds of the plants. The land, located in a remote section of Floyd County, was not owned by King. At the time King was arrested, he was not in possession of marijuana plants, marijuana seeds, or paraphernalia related to marijuana. After being arrested and advised of his constitutional rights, King stated: \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell anyone who was with me on the marijuana. I promised I wouldn\u2019t. Someone did give me the seeds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the court instructed the jury that \u201c \u2018manufacture\u2019 of marijuana means the production, preparation, propagation, compounding, conversion or processing of marijuana.\u201d In proffering this instruction, the Commonwealth relied on the definition of \u201cmanufacture\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 54-524.2(14a) of the Drug Control Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">King argues that the term \u201cmanufacture,\u201d as used in the statutory offense of \u201cmanufacturing] marijuana,\u201d means something <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>vastly different from its traditional definition. He contends that because the statutory offense of manufacturing marijuana is contrary to everyday understanding, the instruction should have included the entire definition of \u201cmanufacture\u201d as set forth in Code \u00a7 54-524.2(14a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the partial definition of the term \u201cmanufacture\u201d given to the jury was confusing and was an incomplete statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Although King was convicted of a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1(a), and the term \u201cmanufacture\u201d is not defined in that title, the court did not err in giving the jury the definition of \u201cmanufacture\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 54-524.2(14a) of the Drug Control Act. The offense of manufacturing marijuana, Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1(c), was once a part of the Drug Control Act, Code \u00a7 54-524.1 et seq.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1975, marijuana related offenses were recodified in Title 18.2; however, the Drug Control Act\u2019s definition of manufacture continues to be relevant to marijuana related offenses. The validity of using other Code sections as interpretive guides is well established. The Code of Virginia constitutes a single body of law, and other sections can be looked to where the same phraseology is employed. <em>First National Bank of Richmond </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>99 Va. 495, 504, 39 S.E. 126, 129-30 (1901).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">With respect to Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1 violations, the words manufacture and production are used synonymously. Manufacture, as defined by Code \u00a7 54-524.2(14a), \u201cmeans the <em>production, </em>preparation, propagation, compounding, conversion or processing of any item.\u201d (emphasis added). Code \u00a7 54-524.2(29) states that \u201c \u2018production\u2019 includes the manufacture, planting, cultivation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>growing or harvesting of a controlled substance or marijuana.\u201d By these definitions, the legislature has clearly expressed its intent that the term manufacturing includes the planting, cultivating, growing, or harvesting of marijuana. Although the definition of manufacture as used in the context of the manufacture of marijuana may not precisely comport with the present day lay meaning of the term, that does not give us license to find error in the court\u2019s instruction. The court\u2019s function is to interpret the legislature\u2019s meaning of words in statutes. <em>Tiller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 418, 420, 69 S.E.2d 441, 442 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Our sister jurisdictions of North Carolina and West Virginia statutorily define manufacture in terms identical to the Virginia definition. In both states, manufacturing marijuana convictions have been affirmed where the definition was applied to facts substantially similar to those in the present case. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Childers, </em>41 N.C.App. 729, 255 S.E.2d 654 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>281 S.E.2d 491 (W.Va. 1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cabalceta, </em>324 S.E.2d 383 (W.Va. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">King further contends that the instruction to the jury should have included the entire definition of manufacture as set forth in Code \u00a7 54-524.2(14a). Although an instruction may correctly state the law, it should not be given if it is inapplicable to the facts in evidence. <em>Hatcher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 811, 813-14, 241 S.E.2d 756, 758 (1978). Instructions must be tailored to the evidence and should exclude language that might confuse or distract the jury. The language in Code \u00a7 54-524.2(14a) that was omitted from the definition of manufacture given to the jury did not apply to the facts and circumstances of this case. The court used the part of the definition warranted by the evidence. The court did not err in refusing the appellant\u2019s request for the additional language.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Accordingly, the conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">Koontz, C.J., and Benton, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\"> \u201cManufacture\u201d means the production, preparation, propagation, compounding, conversion or processing of any item regulated by this chapter, either directly or indirectly by extraction from substances of natural origin, or independently by means of chemical synthesis, or by a combination of extraction and chemical synthesis, and includes any packaging or repackaging of the substance or labeling or relabeling of its container, except that this term does not include the preparing, compounding, packaging or labeling of a controlled substance:</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">(1) By a practitioner as an incident to his administering or dispensing of a controlled substance or marijuana in the course of his professional practice, or</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">(2) By a practitioner, or by his authorized agent under his supervision, for the purpose of, or as an incident to, research, teaching, or chemical analysis and not for sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b738-10\"> The predecessor to Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1 was Code \u00a7 18.2-248, which defined marijuana as a \u201ccontrolled substance.\u201d <em>See Stillwell </em>v.
