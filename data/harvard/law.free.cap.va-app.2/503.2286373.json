Ingram, Judge of the Circuit Court of the City of Danville, authorized a search of appellant\u2019s residence and person for evidence of illegal numbers or lottery activity. Appellant\u2019s residence was in neighboring Pittsylvania County, but was located within the one mile statutory jurisdictional limits of the City of Danville provided for in Code \u00a7 19.2-250.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to the warrant, members of the Virginia State Police and the Danville Police Department entered and searched the premises. Drugs and drug paraphernalia were discovered and seized. Thereafter, police obtained a search warrant for drugs on appellant\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The search warrant affidavits were filed in the Clerk\u2019s office of the Circuit Court of the City of Danville. The affidavits were not filed in the Clerk\u2019s office of the Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County. At trial, before Judge Ingram, defense counsel challenged the validity of the search warrants and supporting affidavits, and objected to the admission of evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds. All such defense motions were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Appellant was convicted of possession of heroin and cocaine with intent to distribute, and possession of marijuana. He was sentenced to thirty years and fined $5,000 on the former offense, and sentenced to thirty days and fined $100 on the latter offense. Appellant filed a petition for appeal with the Virginia Supreme Court. The petition was denied. Subsequently, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed in the Circuit Court of the City of Danville.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Concerning the first issue raised in the habeas proceeding, appellant argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to object when the same judge who issued the search warrants was sitting at trial to determine their legal sufficiency and validity. In oral argument before us, counsel conceded that this ground for appeal was without merit. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The ineffective assistance of counsel standard set forth in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668 (1984), contains two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>components. Appellant must first show that trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient to the extent that serious errors infringing on appellant\u2019s constitutional rights were made. Second, there must be a showing that appellant was prejudiced as a result. <em>Id. </em>at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Appellant does not now contend that the affidavits and search warrants were in any respect improper or invalid. Therefore, the questions whether Judge Ingram should have recused himself, and whether counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the nonrecusal, are of no legal consequence. No prejudice to appellant was present. As a result, we need not reach the deficiency of performance component of Strickland.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Concerning the second issue raised in the habeas proceeding, appellant contends that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the Commonwealth\u2019s alleged noncompliance with the filing requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-54 amounted to a denial of effective assistance of counsel. Finding that the filing requirements were complied with, we hold that counsel was not ineffective on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-54 requires filing of affidavits with the Circuit Court of the city or county in which the search occurs. Consequently appellant contends that the filing in this case should have been made in Pittsylvania County. Although Code \u00a7 19.2-250 extends the jurisdiction of the City of Danville to include appellant\u2019s residence, appellant argues that this section has no bearing upon \u00a7 19.2-54 filing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\"><em>Garza </em>v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 559, 323 S.E.2d 127 (1984), is controlling here. <em>Garza </em>turned on the interrelation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-54 and 17-126.2. Code \u00a7 17-126.2 reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">The circuit and district courts of Roanoke County shall have, concurrently with the courts of record and courts not of record, respectively, of the city of Salem, jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed in or upon the premises, buildings, rooms or offices located in the City of Salem which are owned or occupied by Roanoke County or any officer, agency or department of the county.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Garza was arrested in Roanoke County, taken to the Roanoke County-City of Salem jail, which is located in Salem. Police obtained a search warrant for Garza\u2019s car, parked at the jail. The warrant, the underlying affidavit, and the search inventory were filed in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the County of Roanoke. Garza argued that \u00a7 19.2-54 required that the affidavit be filed in the City of Salem. The court rejected this argument, holding that Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-54 and 17-126.2 must be read together and that the Circuit Court of Roanoke County was \u201cthe circuit court of the county . . . wherein the search was made\u201d for the purpose of meeting the filing requirement of Code \u00a7 19.2-54. <em>Id. </em>at 566, 323 S.E.2d at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Following the reasoning of <em>Garza, </em>we find that \u00a7 19.2-54 and \u00a7 19.2-250 must also be read together and harmonized. The purpose of \u00a7 19.2-54 \u201cis to give the defendant reasonable opportunity to determine that the affidavit on file is the same one upon which the determination of probable cause was based.\u201d <em>Garza, </em>228 Va. at 566, 323 S.E.2d at 131. Under the facts of the present case, this purpose was best achieved by filing the affidavit in the clerk\u2019s office of the Circuit Court of the City of Danville, that being the court in which the charge was pending. To place a strict construction on \u00a7 19.2-54, as appellant would have us do, would tend to frustrate this notice-based purpose. Accordingly, the filing was appropriate in the City of Danville, not Pittsylvania County, since the Circuit Court of the City of Danville pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-250 had jurisdiction over the crime and the area where the search was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">For all the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Baker, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-12\"> Subsequent to the September 19, 1985, oral arguments in this case, the Supreme Court of Virginia issued an order in <em>Rudiger </em>v. Hanckel-Smith, 230 Va. 255, 335 S.E.2d 257 (1985), dismissing the petition for appeal in that case due to appellant\u2019s failure to timely file an appeal bond under then existing Code \u00a7 8.01-676.1(B). As a result, by order dated November 27, 1985, we dismissed Robertson\u2019s appeal in the instant case for failure to comply with the bond statute. Robertson noted an appeal to the Supreme Court. That Court, by order dated May 22, 1986, remanded the case to the Court of Appeals \u201cfor reconsideration in light of the 1986 amendment to Code \u00a7 8.01-676.1.\u201d We have, by order, reinstated Robertson\u2019s appeal, and consider the merits of that appeal herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\"><em> </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-250 provides in pertinent part: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provisions of this article, the jurisdiction of the corporate authorities of each town or city, in criminal cases involving offenses against the Commonwealth, shall extend within the State 1 mile beyond the corporate limits of such town or city.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
