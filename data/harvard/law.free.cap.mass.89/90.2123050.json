He acquired a legal settlement in Fitchburg, as therein stated; and afterwards, after preaching for a time in West Sutton, removed to Leicester, and commenced preaching for the Greenville Baptist Church and Society in that town on the first Sunday in April 1856, and continued to preach there as an ordained minister until May 1858, when he was committed to the State Lunatic Hospital at Worcester. The Greenville Baptist Society has long been in existence, and was incorporated in 1853. The constitution and by-laws were exhibited to the court, and are sufficiently referred to in the opinion. The following is a copy from the church records : \u201c Greenville, April 11,1856. Owing to the ill health of our pastor, William N. Harvey, he resigned his labors with us and the church. On the recommendation of the standing committee of both church and society, voted to settle as pastor Rev. L. O. Lovell, of West Sutton, and he entered on the duties of pastor the first Sabbath of the present month.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-9\">At the annual meeting of the society, held on the 7th of January 1856, a standing committee were chosen, and, under an article \u201c to see what the society will do in relation to the pulpit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>supply the current year,\u201d it was voted \u201c that the standing committee supply the pulpit,\u201d and <em>\u201c </em>to raise money by subscription.\u201d Lovell\u2019s name appeared but once in the society records, in the record of a meeting held January 18th 1858, thus : \u201c Prayer by Rev. L. O. Lovell.\u201d In the warrant for the annual meeting of the society for 1857, the same article above copied was inserted and the same standing committee were chosen ; but they made no report of their doings for 1856, and they were not instructed to supply the pulpit. Another committee were chosen at this meeting, and at the annual meeting for 1858, to get wood for the minister and meeting-house; and at the meeting for 1857 it was further voted that the money be raised by subscription for paying the salary of the minister, and that he be paid in quarterly payments.

If he has done so, it is by virtue of the enactment in Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>45, \u00a7 1, <em>cl. </em>7, which provides that \u201c every settled ordained minister of the gospel shall be deemed to have acquired a legal settlement in the town wherein he is or may be settled as a minister.\u201d The legal contract as to the settlement of ministers of the Congregational denomination is made by the society, and requires its sanction. The call to the ministerial office by the church alone would not be effectual to give a legal settlement to the person thus selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The church and society in which Mr. Lovell is said to have been settled as a minister were of the Baptist denomination and this leads to the inquiry as to the usages of that denomination in reference to the settlement of ministers. To aid us in that inquiry, we have been referred to the treatise entitled \u201cPrinciples and Practices of Baptists,\u201d by Rev. Dr. Wayland, who, in reference to the earlier practice, says that the church called the pastor and provided for his support. They erected houses of public worship, and assumed the whole management of their ecclesiastical affairs, both spiritual and secular. \u201c In the calling and dismission of a pastor, they acknowledged no authority but their own.\u201d p. 167. But in reference to the system of settling ministers now prevailing, he says that in New England the company of Baptist worshippers is divided into two organizations, the church and the society, and these two organizations have coordinate jurisdiction in the settlement of a minister.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The Greenville Baptist Society in Leicester is a religious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>society, having a regular act of incorporation, with all the powers incident to religious societies established in this commonwealth. It thus appears that these worshippers were divided into two organizations, and each must concur in calling and settling a minister.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The church voted, on the 11th of April 1856, \u201c to settle as pastor Rev. L. O. Lovell,\u201d and this is duly shown by the proper record. The point in controversy is, whether there is competent evidence of a concurrence by the society in this vote. There is no record of any vote of the society declaring in direct terms such concurrence. If that is the only competent evidence of such concurrence, the requisite proof of a legal settlement of Mr. Lovell over this society is wanting.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">As has been heretofore decided in <em>Bellingham </em>v. <em>West Boylston, </em>4 Cush. 556, it is no ground of objection that there was no new ceremony of installation or induction into office, Mr. Lovell having been regularly ordained before. Nor would it be a fatal objection that his settlement was for a limited period of time. The inquiry is, then, whether enough appears from the acts of the society to show that they concurred in the vote of the church and accepted Mr. Lovell as their settled minister.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The positive acts shown by the records of the society, bearing upon this question, are the vote of the society on January 7th 1856, \u201c that the standing committee supply the pulpit,\u201d and the vote of the society in January 1857, that a committee be chosen \u201c to get wood for the minister,\u201d thus adopting the appropriate title, and applying it to the person then preaching there. At the same time it was further voted \u201cthat the money be raised by subscription for paying the salary of the minister, and that he be paid in quarterly payments,\u201d thereby assuming that they had a minister with a fixed annual salary, in distinction from having a temporary supply for the pulpit. It is also admitted that the person thus called \u201cthe minister,\u201d and to whom the salary was payable, and to whom it was paid, was Mr. Lovell The vote for supplying wood to the minister was renewed at the annual meeting in January 1858, but the vote directing the standing committee to supply the pulpit was not renewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>after the call and vote of settlement by the church on the 11th of April 1856. As acts of the society recognizing an existing relation of minister and parish, these votes by the parish are very significant. The church had voted to settle Mr. Lovell as pastor, and the church records add that \u201c he entered on the duties of pastor the first Sabbath of the present month.\u201d That in fact Mr. Lovell performed the ordinary duties of a minister to the society from the first Sabbath in April 1856 to May 1858, is a fact agreed by the parties. It is thus shown that the church had formally voted to settle Mr. Lovell as pastor. The society actually receive him as such, call him in their votes \u201c the minister,\u201d and at the succeeding annual meeting vote \u201c wood for the minister,\u201d proceed to devise ways and means to pay the salary of the minister, pay him as such, and in those various ways indicate their recognition of him as their minister, and their concurrence in the act of the church in voting to settle him as pastor.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In the absence of any by-laws of the society then existing making provisions as to the action of the society in settling a minister, the court are of opinion that these various acts of the society recognizing that relation with Mr. Lovell are sufficient to show an assent of the society to the settlement of Mr. Lovell, in concurrence with the vote of the church, and that he must be deemed to have been the settled minister of the Green-ville Baptist Society in Leicester.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In this view of the case, the defendants have shown that the pauper had acquired a legal settlement in the town of Leicester, and thus discharge themselves from liability to the plaintiffs for expenditures for his support at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
