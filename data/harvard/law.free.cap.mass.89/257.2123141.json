In consideration of which sum Mr. Newbury agrees to annul his contract with us, and to give up all his rights in patents for screw machinery now owned by us, and to give us the right to use any other machinery now used by us, and also to procure patents at Our expense for any improvements in screw or other machinery now used by us not now secured by patents, and which we may deem worthy to be so secured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-5\"><em>\u201cVoted, </em>That we deem it expedient and desirable for the company to consolidate with the American Screw Company of Providence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-6\"><em>\u201cVoted, </em>That Mr. Newbury be appointed by this committee to consult with Mr. Angel\u00ed on the subject of a union, and to report.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-7\">This arrangement was agreed upon and consented to by all the parties in interest, with the plaintiff\u2019s approbation, on the 12th of July 1860; but the agreement was not consummated and the actual union did not take place until the 27th of December 1860. In the mean time the business of the defendants went on as before. On said 27th of December, the defendants paid to the plaintiff the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, according to the terms and for the purposes mentioned in the votes of July 7th ; and it was conceded by the plaintiff that he accepted this sum as a consideration for annulling his agreement with the defendants, and that the same upon his acceptance of said payment became and was thereby annulled. The plaintiff also admitted that a full settlement had' been made by the defendants of all other claims by him under the agreement, before and up to June 1st 1860, and also for his personal services rendered after that date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-8\">Upon these facts, the judge ruled that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, and a verdict was accordingly returned for the defendants; and the case was reported for the determination of the whole court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b267-9\"><em>C.

Until that event the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>business was to go on as before. But this consummation might not have taken place for years. It certainly is not to be presumed that the plaintiff would agree to waive his commissions during that interval. The defendants might as well have refused to pay for his subsequent services. Supposing that his commissions for the preceding year had not been paid; could he not have collected them ? If the construction contended for by the defendants had been contemplated by the parties, there would have been a provision for interest.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-5\"><em>E. H. Bennett, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adiv\">cited <em>AUcott </em>v. <em>Boston Steam Flour Mill Co. </em>9 Cush. 376.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b268-6\">Chapman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ave\">The plaintiff declares upon a contract by which he agreed to labor for the defendants for a certain term, and to assign to them certain patents. No question is made in respect to the labor, it having been performed and paid for. In consideration of the assignment of the patents, they agreed to pay him <em>\u201c </em>an annual commission for the term of fourteen years from the first day of June last, should the company continue to use the said Newbury\u2019s improvements so long,\u201d stating the rate. The term commenced June 1st 1855. The plaintiff was one of the directors of the company; and by an arrangement made with his consent, and partly through his agency, the company agreed to sell out its property to the American Screw Company, of Providence. As a part of the arrangement, the vote recited in the report was passed by the defendants on the 7th of July 1860.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">On the 12th of July 1860 the two companies completed their written agreement for the transfer, which was to include the shares of the stockholders in the Bay State Screw Company. The assignment of property was not completed till December 27th 1860, and in the mean time the business of the defendants went on as before. On that day the plaintiff received the twenty-five thousand dollars, and it is admitted that he accepted it as a consideration for annulling his agreement, and that the same, upon his acceptance of said payment, became and was thereby annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Nothing can be plainer, as elementary law, than that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>mi agreement has been annulled no action lies to enforce it. But the plaintiff contends that he is entitled to recover because the defendants, after having paid him his annual commission for the year ending June 1st 1860, continued to use his patents until December 27th, for which they have paid him no commissions. The answer to this claim is, that when he on that day accepted the sum offered to him by the vote of July 7th, as a consideration for annulling the contract, it was in his power, by his construction of the agreement, to refuse to accept the terms offered, unless they would also pay him commissions up to that time. He did not see fit to demand this, but accepted the offer they made him without any qualification. By annulling the agreement, all claims under it were annulled; and the sum of $25,000 was all that he demanded for doing this.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">This objection being fatal to the action, it is not necessary to consider the other points that have been argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
