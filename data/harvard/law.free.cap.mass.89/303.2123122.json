I have known the defendant four or five years. I saw him in Attleborough in January, February or March last. I think I had liquor of him. I cannot say what kind of liquor; it might have been whiskey or beer. I asked for lager beer. I paid for it. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>cannot say exactly what it was. I asked for lager beer, and I took it for lager beer.\u201d This was all the evidence in the case; and the defendant asked the court to rule that it was not sufficient to warrant a conviction. The judge declined so to rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-6\"><em>G. I. Reed, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABJ\">The whole evidence is reported, and it failed to show that the sale which was testified to was unauthorized. Such evidence is necessary. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Livermore, 2 Allen, 292, and 4 Allen, 434.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-7\"><em>Foster, </em>A. G., for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b312-8\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQu\">It must be taken, upon this bill of .exceptions, that the ruling of the superior court fully met the point raised by the counsel for the defendant. If this was not so, it was the duty of the counsel to state that fact, and to ask further instructions. The ruling of the court was adapted to the inquiry that was naturally presented by the objection that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant them in convicting the defendant, and the instructions given to the jury were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">If the purpose of the counsel for the defendant was to ask instructions as to the necessity of the government\u2019s proving that the sale was not one that the defendant might lawfully make without written license or authority, it was his duty to raise that point distinctly. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
