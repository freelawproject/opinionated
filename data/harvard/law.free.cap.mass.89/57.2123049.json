A general demurrer filed by the defendants was overruled. 4 Allen, 545. The case now came on for hearing upon the bill, answer and proofs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-10\"><em>G. F. Hoar &amp; H. Gray, Jr., </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-11\"><em>D. Foster &amp; T. L. Nelson, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axq\">stated that if the court, in the decision already made, intended <em>to </em>hold that upon the facts stated in the bill the plaintiffs were entitled to a perpetual injunction ; that the intent with which the defendants acted in making their attachment was immaterial; and that the liability of the funds to be lawfully attached and held by creditors residing in other states afforded no ground for refusing the injunction, they did not wish to argue the case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b65-12\">Bigelow, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aag\">On the facts stated in the bill, we certainly intended to decide, in overruling the demurrer, not only that the court had jurisdiction of the case, but also that, in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, it was the duty of the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>take jurisdiction of it, and to grant the relief prayed for. No new fact is now shown which in any respect changes the plaintiffs\u2019 equity. The intent with which the defendants made the attachment does not affect the equitable right of the assignees under our insolvent law to demand and recfeive the funds in controversy for general distribution, and to prevent them from being appropriated solely to the payment of the debt which is due to the defendants from the insolvent debtors. This equitable right is paramount, unless some valid claim or lien exists upon the funds, which under the laws of Pennsylvania would divert them from the assignees, even if the defendants are compelled to abandon their attachment of them in the courts of that state.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b66-7\"><em>Foster, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p id=\"Apn\">moved that, as the defendants had only attempted to maintain their rights under an attachment valid by the laws of the state where it was made, they should be allowed their costs and expenses of trying the question out of the fund, and should not be obliged to pay costs.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b66-8\"><em>Gray, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p id=\"Aoz\">admitted that the defendants (in analogy to the provision of the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>118, \u00a7 127, allowing to creditors who attach property in this state the costs of their attachment to the time of its dissolution by proceedings in insolvency) might be allowed the costs of the suit in Pennsylvania to the time of notice to them of the filing of this bill; but contended that no more could be allowed to them, and that the plaintiffs, as the prevailing party, should be allowed the costs of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In conformity to the principles fully stated in the previous decision, we think a decree must be entered that the</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\n<em>Injunction be perpetual.</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b66-9\">Bigelow, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9F\">After the defendants had notice of the filing of this bill, the proceeding was strictly adversary in its nature, and they went on at their peril, both in prosecuting their action in the courts of Pennsylvania and in defending this suit. It having now been determined that they have acted contrary to equity, they are no* entitled to recover costs since the filing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>the bill, and the plaintiffs must be deemed to be the prevailing party, and as such, in analogy to the rule at law, they are entitled to costs. <em>Decree accordingly.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
