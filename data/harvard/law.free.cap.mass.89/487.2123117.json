On the 1st of July 1861 the defendant left at the plaintiff\u2019s dwelling-house written notices that he and his firm should vacate the store on or before the 1st of October 1861, to which the plaintiff made no reply; and on said 1st of October the store was accordingly vacated, and notice thereof was given and the keys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>were delivered to the plaintiff* who replied that he considered the defendant as still his tenant, and should look to him for payment of the quarter\u2019s rent. The plaintiff received and signed receipts for all the rent due on the 1st of October; and the store remained vacant, the plaintiff refusing applications for the same, until January 1st 1862. Various questions arose in the case, which are rendered immaterial by the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-5\">Under the instructions of the court the jury rendered a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b496-6\"><em>JR.

The inclusion or exclusion of the day of the date of an instrument, in the computation of time, has been a much vexed point; but in a case like the present the authorities are in favor of the defendant. In 4 Cruise Big. (Greenl. ed.) tit. xxxii. <em>c. </em>5, <em>\u00a7 </em>16, the rule is stated to be, that if a lease be made to hold from the date, or the day of the date, that day is excluded; but if it be to hold from the making, it includes the day. It is stated in still better phraseology in <em>\u00a7 </em>17, <em>n. </em>2. Where time is computed from an act done, the general rule is to include the day. Where it is computed from the day of the act done, the day is excluded. The same rule is stated in 2 Parsons on Con. 179, <em>n. </em>It has been adopted by this court, and must be regarded as settled in this commonwealth. <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Willson, </em>1 Pick. 494. <em>Wiggin </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>1 Met. 127. <em>Farwell </em>v.
