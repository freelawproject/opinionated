The waiting period is defined as \u201cthe earliest period of five consecutive calendar months ... throughout which the individual ... has been under a disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(c)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The wage earner here, Chris Sanchez,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> brought this suit claiming that the Secretary of Health and Human Services wrongly interpreted the statutory definition of \u201cwaiting period\u201d and, in doing so, deprived him of Social Security disability benefits. Sanchez claims that the waiting period began on the day he became disabled, November 15, 1977.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Secretary contends that the waiting period began on the first day of the month following the onset of the disability, December 1, 1977, because the statute requires that only <em>entire </em>calendar months be counted. The Appeals Council of the Social Security Administration and the district court agreed with the Secretary\u2019s interpretation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-22\">The Secretary, in his interpretation of the statute, puts great emphasis on the inclusion of the word \u201ccalendar\u201d in the statute. He contends that a \u201ccalendar month\u201d must run from the first day of a month to the last day of that same month. Under his interpretation, Sanchez\u2019 five month waiting period runs from December 1, 1977 to May 1. 1978, with May 1978 being the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>month in which he is entitled to benefit payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">We decline to give the inclusion of the word \u201ccalendar\u201d such importance. It is true that \u201ccalendar month\u201d may have the meaning given to it by the Secretary in certain contexts. But a \u201ccalendar month\u201d may also run from any given day in one month to the day of the corresponding number in the next month. \u201cCalendar month\u201d here means a month\u2019s period of time, whether it be thirty-one, thirty, or twenty-eight days. Five consecutive calendar months of disability for Sanchez ran from November 15, 1977, to April 15, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">Our interpretation of the statute is further supported by the phrase <em>\u201cthe earliest period </em>of five consecutive calendar months\u201d (emphasis added). This phrase has no meaning whatsoever if one were to interpret the statute as did the district court. Its inclusion suggests that the waiting period is to begin on the specific day on which the disability begins rather than waiting until the first day of the following month.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">The language of \u00a7 423(c)(2)(B) also supports our interpretation of part (A) of that section. Subparagraph (B) sets a limit on the earliest point at which the waiting period may begin. The waiting period may begin no earlier than \u201cthe <em>first day </em>of the seventeenth month\u201d (emphasis added) before the application of disability benefits is filed. This indicates that the waiting period as defined in (A) may begin oh days other than the first day of a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">This is a question of first impression for this- circuit. In <em>Malveaux v. Mathews, </em>546 F.2d 108 (5th Cir. 1977), however, a panel of this court set the proper starting date for disability benefits at May 26, 1972, when the disability began on December 26, 1971. There the district court had set the date of eligibility on the date of <em>disability, </em>failing to take the five month waiting period into account. That panel was not called on to construe the phrase that we must construe today, but its judgment contradicts the Secretary\u2019s argument that his interpretation complies with the plain meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-9\">The only other court of appeals to expressly consider the issue of when the statutory waiting period begins came to the same decision as we do. In considering the statute as it existed before the 1972 amendments that changed the waiting period from six months to five months, Social Security Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. 92-603, Title I, \u00a7 116(a), 86 Stat. 1350, the Sixth Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1186-10\">\u201cWe are unable to accept the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the phrase. The Social Security Act is to be construed liberally in favor of the claimant. <em>Davidson v. Gardner, </em>370 F.2d 803 (6th Cir. 1966). Although we realize that a line must be drawn somewhere with respect to the \u2018waiting period,\u2019 the drawing of that line must bear some reasonable relationship to the purposes of the Act. In the present case, the appellee had been disabled for over a half year consecutively. This period fully satisfies the requirement of the Act insofar as the element of time is concerned. The phrase in question is concerned with the length of time an individual must be disabled before he may receive benefits. Under the Secretary\u2019s interpretation, the period of time required would vary from individual to individual depending upon how late in the month the disability occurred. We are of the view that it was the purpose of the Act to provide a uniform time period for all cases and that the District Court\u2019s finding that \u2018six consecutive calendar months\u2019 means one half year is the correct interpretation. The appellee was disabled and out of work for over one half year and was thus entitled to the benefits afforded him under the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1186-11\"><em>Otworth v. Finch, </em>435 F.2d 542,543 (6th Cir. 1970).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>We are also required to consider the remedial purposes of the Social Security Act and broadly construe the statute in favor of coverage if such a construction is reasonable. <em>Broussard </em>v. <em>Weinberger, </em>499 F.2d 969, 970 (5th Cir. 1974). We agree with the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Otworth </em>and will not require claimants for disability benefits to wait longer for those benefits to accrue than the statute obviously contemplates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">We hold that Sanchez completed his statutory waiting period on April 15, 1978, and is entitled to disability benefits as of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1185-16\">. The entire provision reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-17\">(2) The term waiting period means, in the case of any application for disability insurance benefits, the earliest period of five consecutive calendar months\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-18\">(A) throughout which the individual with respect to whom such application is failed has been under a disability, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-19\">(B) (i) which beings not earlier than with the first day of the seventeenth month before the month in which such application is filed if such individual is insured for disability insurance benefits in such seventeenth month, or (ii) if he is not so insured in such month, which begins not earlier than with the first day of the first month after such seventeenth month in which he is so insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arq\">Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, no waiting period may begin for any individual before January 1, 1957.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1185-25\">. Sanchez originally filed this action with the district court. During its pendency, however,' he died and his wife, Nelda Sanchez, was substituted as plaintiff. For simplicity\u2019s sake, throughout this opinion the plaintiff-appellant will be referred to as \u201cthe wage earner\u201d or \u201cSanchez.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1185-26\">. It is conceded by all parties that Sanchez became disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1), on November 15, 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1186-12\">. The Sixth Circuit was considering 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 422(c)(3), which sets the allowable period of trial work for a disabled person entitled to benefits under the Act. That section provides: \u201ca period of trial work ... shall begin with the month in which he becomes entitled to disability insurance benefits.\u201d Since a person is entitied to disability insurance benefits only after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>he completes the waiting period defined in \u00a7 423(c)(2), it became necessary for the court to consider that section in determining whether the wage earner had begun work after the period of trial work began.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
