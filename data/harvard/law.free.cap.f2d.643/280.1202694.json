D. Cunningham &amp; Company, Inc., of payments by company customers for her private use. Greer raises two grounds on appeal: 1) the court intimidated her \u201cyoung\u201d counsel by directing his attention to his professional responsibilities under the Alabama State Bar Code of Professional Responsibility and thus erroneously limited her right to cross-examination of the key government witness; and 2) the court erroneously refused to allow appellant\u2019s character witness to testify regarding the character of the same government witness. Both of appellant\u2019s arguments are without merit; we affirm her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The facts leading up to appellant\u2019s indictment are not relevant here. At trial, Greer defended on the ground that George Cunningham, Sr., President of the company, had proposed the fraud and threatened Greer into compliance. Through cross-examination of Cunningham, Greer\u2019s counsel sought to tarnish Cunningham\u2019s reputation by establishing that the latter had given bribes to Driscoll, a dock worker. Appellant\u2019s counsel inquired whether Cunningham knew Driscoll and the nature of his employment; the government objected to this line of questioning unless appellant\u2019s counsel made a showing of relevancy. At the side bar, defense counsel told the court his purpose \u2014 to show that Cunningham had given bribes to Driscoll. After a recess to allow the court \u201cto look up the law,\u201d the court informed appellant\u2019s counsel of his ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">[The alleged bribes given by Cunningham to Driscoll are] grounds for impeachment. However, I caution counsel that under the Code of Professional Responsibility, and I pass no judgment on this because I don\u2019t know what your evidence is, but if you knowingly advance a claim that is unwarranted under existing law or you take action on behalf of your client when you know, or when it is obvious that such action would serve to merely harass or maliciously injure another, you violate your Canon of Ethics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-13\">So, if you have a basis of [sic] what you are doing, fine. But just going off to ask questions for that purpose and that purpose alone, then I call your attention to the Code of Responsibility of the State Bar, which is 7-102.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Defense counsel inquired no further into the bribery matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Appellant asserts that the court\u2019s above-quoted remarks intimidated her inexperienced counsel,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> thus improperly limiting her right to cross-examination. She cites <em>United States v. Summers, </em>598 F.2d 450, 460 (5th Cir. 1979), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">The right of cross-examination is the primary interest secured by the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee that the accused in a criminal prosecution \u2018shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u2019 Where the witness the accused seeks to cross-examine is the \u2018star\u2019 government witness,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> providing an essential link in the prosecution\u2019s case, the importance of full cross-examination ... is necessarily increased, (citations omitted; footnote supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">These propositions do not aid appellant, however, because one crucial fact distinguishes her case: the trial judge did not limit cross-examination of Cunningham but merely advised appellant\u2019s counsel that the Alabama Code of Professional Responsibility might bear upon counsel\u2019s decision as to how to proceed. We have found no authority, and appellant has shown us none, restricting the court\u2019s power to advise counsel thus. Rather, \u201ccourts enjoy broad discretion ... to monitor the conduct of those who [practice before them],\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>538 F.2d 1214, 1219 (5th Cir. 1976). That discretion encompasses the relatively gentle admonition given by the court to defense counsel to heed the Alabama Disciplinary Rule in question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court made sufficiently clear that counsel\u2019s professional responsibility was to refrain only from asking questions not legally warranted<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or for the sole purpose of harassment or malicious injury to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Nor does trial counsel\u2019s alleged inexperience alter the permissibility of the court\u2019s remarks. Appellant does not claim incompetent or ineffective assistance of counsel, nor does the record support such a claim. Although we have found no case involving a claim analogous to that made here \u2014 that the court intimidated an inexperienced attorney, thus depriving the accused of the sixth amendment right to a fair trial \u2014 we also have found none establishing different rules for those who are tyros at the bar.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that counsel\u2019s alleged inexperience did not render inappropriate judicial remarks that otherwise would have been appropriate. In fact, the court\u2019s admonition may best be interpreted as its attempt to prevent a young attorney from running afoul of the Code of Professional Responsibility, with which he did not have exhaustive practical experience. That, as a result of these remarks, counsel may have mistakenly eschewed a proper line of questioning does not mean that the court impermissibly limited appellant\u2019s sixth amendment right to cross-examination given its specific injunction that the line of inquiry was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Appellant next argues that the court erroneously sustained the government\u2019s objection to appellant\u2019s inquiry, on direct examination of appellant\u2019s character witness, as to Cunningham\u2019s reputation. The question to which the objection was sustained was: \u201cAre you familiar with Mr. Cunningham\u2019s reputation in the community?\u201d Greer contends, offering the same authority regarding the importance of the accused\u2019s right to cross-examination cited above, that the court\u2019s ruling was reversible error. We disagree; the court\u2019s limitation of questions regarding Cunningham\u2019s general character was in accordance with Fed.R.Evid. 608(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">Rule 608. Evidence of Character and Conduct of Witness</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">(a) Opinion and reputation evidence of character. The credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but subject to these limitations: (1) the evidence may refer only to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, and (2) evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the character of the witness for truthfulness has been attacked by opinion or reputation evidence or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The meaning of subparagraph (1) is self-explanatory. The Notes of the Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules, however, restate the rule\u2019s intent: \u201c[T]he inquiry is strictly limited to character for veracity, rather than allowing evidence as to character generally.\u201d We have duly noted this limitation. <em>See United States v. Lollar, </em>606 F.2d 587 (5th Cir. 1979) (defendant\u2019s decision to testify does not open door to attacks on general character); <em>Steele </em>v. <em>United States, </em>243 F.2d 712 (5th Cir. 1957) (rules as to impeachment of defendant same as those for other witnesses). <em>See also </em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence 1608[01]. Since counsel\u2019s question inquired of Cunningham\u2019s reputation in the community, rather than being limited to his reputation for truthfulness and veracity, it was improper under Rule 608(a). The court correctly sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"AcU\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-16\">.

Appellant asserts that this was trial counsel\u2019s first jury trial and first federal case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\">. Appellant claims that Cunningham was the \u201cstar\u201d government witness but has not supported this claim. Rather, the testimony of other witnesses, such as a handwriting expert who testified that appellant had endorsed various customers\u2019 checks which had not been entered in the books of such customers, who testified that she had directed that they make their checks payable to her rather than the company, and of Greer\u2019s banker, who testified that she made several large deposits in amounts and at times corresponding to the missing checks, might have been of primary importance to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\">. This discretion, \u201cto monitor the conduct\u201d of counsel before the bar, is different from the discretion to limit a defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination. We are aware that \u201c \u2018[the trial judge\u2019s] discretionary authority to limit cross-examination comes into play only after there has been permitted as a matter of right sufficient cross-examination to satisfy the Sixth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted) <em>United States v. Summers, </em>598 F.2d at 460. But we think crucial the distinction between a court\u2019s outright limitation of cross-examination and its permission to proceed with a cautionary footnote to beware one\u2019s professional responsibilities. Here, counsel was permitted \u201csufficient cross-examination to satisfy the Sixth Amendment,\u201d but the manner in which the court proceeded in permitting such examination was within its general discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b338-12\">. The Alabama Code of Professional Responsibility was not the sole force militating the judge\u2019s advice. Fed.R.Evid. 609(a) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-13\">Rule 609.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-14\">IMPEACHMENT BY EVIDENCE OF CONVICTION OF CRIME</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-15\">(a) General rule. For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that he has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if elicited from him or established by public record during cross-examination</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-16\"><em>See also United States v. Georgalis, </em>631 F.2d 1199 (5th Cir. 1980) (prosecutor\u2019s violation of Rule 609 harmless error in light of strength of case against defendant, prosecution\u2019s admission of error and trial judge\u2019s instruction to jury to disregard question); <em>United States v. Haskell, </em>327 F.2d 281, 284 (2nd Cir. 1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 U.S. 945, 84 S.Ct. 1351, 12 L.Ed.2d 307 (\u201cAs a general rule ... it is grossly improper for a cross-examiner to suggest that a witness has been convicted of crimes, especially felonies, when he has no support for the question.\u201d). Although Rule 609 does not speak to suggestions that a crime has been committed but only those positing a conviction, we deem it equally improper for a cross-examiner to suggest that a witness has committed crimes when counsel has no support for the question.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b338-17\">. The court erroneously suggested that counsel limit himself to claims warranted under existing law; DR 7-102(A)(2) allows an attorney to advance a claim or defense that \u201ccan be supported by good faith argument for an exten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>sion, modification, or reversal of existing law.\u201d Appellant, however, has not claimed error here. Moreover, since the decision was left with counsel, he was responsible (and would have been even without the court\u2019s admonition) for apprising himself of his responsibilities under the Code. Error, if any, was therefore harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b339-10\">. Other courts have held that counsel\u2019s inexperience does not in itself render their assistance ineffective. <em>Spaulding v.
