(a)(17)), attempted robbery (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 664), and burglary (\u00a7 459). Personal use of a deadly weapon (knife) enhancements (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)) were alleged for each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Jury selection began on December 4, 1987, but had not been completed on April 12, 1988. Appellants and the People then reached an agreement whereby a second murder charge (the Due\u00f1as murder) awaiting preliminary hearing was consolidated with the Woods case, appellants waived preliminary hearing on the Due\u00f1as charges and their right to a jury trial, and the People waived the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">The Due\u00f1as complaint, filed in the superior court the following day and serving by stipulation as an information, charged appellants with murder (\u00a7 187), special circumstances (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(2), (3), and (17)), robbery (\u00a7 211), dissuasion of a witness by force (\u00a7 136.1, subd. (c)(1)), and, as to Fernando only, possession of a deadly weapon in jail (\u00a7 4574). As to the murder and robbery counts, appellants were each additionally alleged to have personally used a deadly weapon (knife). (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">After a court trial of the consolidated cases, appellants were convicted in the Woods case of first degree murder with special circumstances (committed while engaged in the commission of burglary and the attempted commission of robbery), burglary, and attempted robbery. In each of the three counts, the court also found the personal knife use enhancement true as to each appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">In the Due\u00f1as case the court found both appellants guilty of first degree murder with a special circumstance (multiple first degree murder convictions in the proceeding). The court, however, found insufficient evidence to support a special circumstance of murder committed in the course of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>felony. The personal use enhancement was found true as to each appellant. Appellants were found not guilty of the remaining three charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Prior to sentencing, appellants moved to strike the special circumstance findings pursuant to section 1385. The motion was denied, and appellants were given identical sentences: two consecutive life terms of imprisonment without possibility of parole with two consecutive one-year enhancements for personal use of a knife. Sentences for the attempted robbery and burglary were stayed pursuant to section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Appellants timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\n<em>Due\u00f1as Murder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">In May 1987, appellants lived with their mother in an apartment building in Visalia. The rear of the apartment building faced the rear of the Cielito Lindo, a neighborhood bar or restaurant. The rear area of the Cielito Lindo property was separated from the apartments\u2019 backyard area by a chain link fence. There was a hole in the fence large enough for an adult to pass through, close to the apartment where appellants lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">About 7:30 p.m. on May 6, Visalia Police Officer Gary James responded with his partner to the Cielito Lindo where they found the body of Ramon Due\u00f1as in the fenced area behind the building. The body was adjacent to a restroom area at the rear of the building, and there were apparent blood spatters in the sink and on the doorjamb. The toilet seat was up, and there appeared to be urine in the bowl; when Duenas\u2019s body was rolled over, it was discovered that his fly was open and his genitals exposed. Due\u00f1as was clutching a small amount of money, and nearly $100 was found in his pockets. An autopsy revealed Due\u00f1as had received two fatal knife wounds; one a downward blow from the base of the neck into the chest cavity, the other a skull penetration to the side of the left eye resulting in a brain laceration. In addition, Due\u00f1as had a minor defensive wound on his left hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">Several officers examined the apartment backyard area on the other side of the chain link fence. Officer James noticed Fernando leaning out of appellants\u2019 bedroom window, which faced the site where Duenas\u2019s body was found. When questioned by James, Fernando denied seeing or noticing anything but seemed very interested and slightly nervous as James searched the area near the fence for physical evidence. Through the window, James saw Ferm\u00edn seated on a bed during this time but did not recall him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>responding to any questions. Officer David Salazar also came to appellants\u2019 window, and Fernando again denied having noticed any disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Other witnesses suggest that Fernando and Fermin were more than aware of Duenas\u2019s murder. Their brother, David Moreno, testified that he was in appellants\u2019 bedroom around the time that Fernando spoke with Officer James through the window. Both appellants told David they had stabbed Due\u00f1as in the head and throat, apparently because Due\u00f1as was going to \u201cburn\u201d them in a cocaine deal. David talked with appellants again the following day, and both again admitted to the stabbing, indicating that their mother had washed their bloody clothes. They told David they had been playing pool prior to going out back with Due\u00f1as for the drug deal; then, after killing him, they jumped the fence and buried the knife in the backyard area of the apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Freeman Ramirez testified that he saw appellants on the evening after Duenas\u2019s murder. Fermin told him they had killed \u201csome fucking wetback\u201d at the Cielito Lindo. Fernando confirmed the story. Both appeared proud. They specifically stated they had stabbed him twice with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\n<em>Woods Murder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Henry Woods lived at 627 North Bridge, at the corner of Bridge and Grove, in Visalia. On the afternoon of the Due\u00f1as killing, May 6, Henry Woods visited his next-door neighbor, Patty Murphy, seeking assistance in removing appellants from his property. Woods indicated that appellants were giving him a bad time. Murphy and several visiting friends accompanied Woods back to his house and directed appellants to leave. Appellants argued for a bit, then Fermin pointed at Woods and said, in a threatening manner, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back.\u201d They then walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">When appellants saw Freeman Ramirez on the following evening and told him about the Due\u00f1as killing, they also attempted (persistently but ineffectively) to borrow money. Freeman had only $5. \u201c[T]hey wanted enough to get a bottle of wine.\u201d Eventually Fernando indicated appellants had to \u201cgo take care of some business.\u201d It was a little before 6 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Later that evening, Tammy Abila, Vanessa Madrid and Kim Burkhardt were seated at a picnic table in a park area across the street from Woods\u2019s house. The table was 125 feet from Woods\u2019s front door. The women observed appellants approach Woods\u2019s house and knock on the door. Fermin was carrying a knife. Tammy heard Woods, from inside the house, ask who was at the door. Appellants replied, \u201cIt\u2019s Fermin and Fernando. Open up the door.\u201d When Woods failed to open the door, appellants began kicking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>it. The door eventually was opened partially, stopped by a chain lock which Fermin tried to detach with the knife. Unable to do so, he went to windows on either side of the door and pushed the knife through.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Finally appellants kicked the door in, splintering the jamb. Kim heard the voice within crying for help as appellants entered the house. Woods had a board, possibly a piece of the doorjamb. Fermin gave his knife to Fernando and took the board from Woods. Tammy saw Fermin hit Woods in the head with the board. She heard Woods yell, \u201cand like his voice got stuck.\u201d Shortly thereafter appellants left the house at a run, Fermin throwing a knife down beside the steps as they left. A knife was later recovered from the bushes.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Visalia Police Officer Michael Stow and Reserve Officer John Bassett were first on the scene. While Bassett spoke with witnesses, Stow approached the residence and found Woods, still alive, lying just inside the front door. There was blood on the floor and on Woods\u2019s face and waist area; Stow observed a puncture wound in Woods\u2019s abdomen. Stow called for an ambulance and asked Woods who had attacked him. Woods responded, \u201cJimmy knows who they are,\u201d and explained that Jimmy also lived at the house. Jimmy Ramirez, Woods\u2019s brother-in-law, testified that he had previously witnessed an argument between Woods and Fermin over some missing toothpaste, possibly the day before the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Officer Steven Puder arrived several minutes after Stow and Bassett. Puder spoke with Woods who told him that two guys had broken the door in, saying they wanted his money. When Woods refused, one started stabbing him with a large knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Tammy Abila, who knew appellants, gave their names to Reserve Officer Bassett. Before Woods was moved out by the ambulance attendants, Bassett spoke with him. \u201cI asked him if he knew who did it. Without pausing I asked him if he knew Fermin or Fernando Moreno.\u201d Woods responded, \u201cFermin and a guy did it. I am hurting real bad.\u201d Woods later died due to loss of blood from his abdominal wounds, one of which transected the renal artery causing massive blood loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Shortly after Woods\u2019s killing, appellants bragged to Tammy\u2019s brother, Harvey Abila, that they had killed the old man down the street. Harvey told them that the police were coming, and appellants \u201ctook off running.\u201d Harvey saw one knife during this conversation; so did Laura Dobkins, who was also present. She saw one of appellants stabbing a knife into the dirt. As they ran off, she thought she saw Fermin toss a knife over the fence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Approximately a month later, a knife was recovered some 60 feet from the fence in an adjacent field.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Officer James and his partner apprehended appellants near Soroptomist Park. On their arrest, Ferm\u00edn asked, \u201cWhat stabbing are you arresting me for?\u201d No one else had yet mentioned a stabbing. Blood samples were drawn from appellants between 11 and 11:15 p.m. Fermin\u2019s blood-alcohol level was .14 percent; Fernando\u2019s blood-alcohol level was .18 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Blood spots were found on Fernando\u2019s boots. In addition, a bloodstain was found on the inside of the waistband of Fernando\u2019s boxer shorts. Appellants and their victims were typed, using both the ABO classifications and the phosphoglucomutate (PGM) enzyme system. The results suggested that, of the four, the blood on Fernando\u2019s shorts could only have come from Woods. While the others were type O, Woods was type B, as was the blood on the shorts. That blood also appeared to match Woods\u2019s PGM subgroup, and was inconsistent with the others tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Two pennies were found on Woods\u2019s person; no other money was found either on Woods or in his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">\n<em>Jury Trial on Special Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">Section 190.4, subdivision (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf the defendant was convicted by the court sitting without a jury, the trier of fact [for special circumstance allegations] shall be a jury unless a jury is waived by the defendant and by the people, in which case the trier of fact shall be the court. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Memro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 658 [214 Cal.Rptr. 832, 700 P.2d 446], the California Supreme Court held that \u201can accused whose special circumstance allegations are to be tried by a court must make a separate, personal waiver of the right to a jury trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 704.) As retrial was necessary on other grounds, however, \u201c[t]he question as to what standard of prejudice should be applied in this situation is left for another day.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 705.)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">A. <em>Was There a Separate Waiver?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">In the instant case, on April 12, 1988, the trial court advised appellants that each of them, independently, \u201chave an absolute right ... to have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>jury hear this case and impose a sentence.\u201d Each appellant then waived a jury trial in exchange for a commitment by the People not to seek the death penalty. Neither appellant, however, explicitly stated a \u201cseparate, personal waiver\u201d of the right to a jury trial for the special circumstance allegations. Likewise, the record does not reveal any express advisement of the appellants\u2019 rights to such a separate jury trial. Appellants assert the failure to give such advice and obtain separate waivers was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Respondent counters that <em>Memro </em>does not <em>mandate </em>that the court take separate waivers of the right to a jury for the guilt phase and the right to a jury to hear the special circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u201cAlthough the California Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Memro . . . </em>seems to support appellants\u2019 position that the waivers must be separate, language immediately following the \u2018must make a separate, personal waiver\u2019 language clearly indicates otherwise. The court noted that a trial court <em>\u2018could </em>satisfy . . . [the waiver requirement] by taking separate waivers as to each before commencement of trial.\u2019 Since separate waivers are only one way the requirement could be satisfied, the California Supreme Court obviously imagined other ways in which the waiver could occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">We cannot embrace respondent\u2019s reading of <em>Memro. </em>To us, the <em>Memro </em>language quoted by respondent signifies that the defendant can waive his right to a special circumstance jury either before or during trial. The language does not suggest that a waiver proceeding in which a defendant is not informed of, and does not separately waive, his right to a special circumstance jury under section 190.4, subdivision (a) may nonetheless meet the requirements of that statute and of <em>Memro </em>itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Respondent goes on to contend that appellants impliedly made a simultaneous waiver of the rights to a jury in the guilt phase and on the special circumstance allegations. Nothing in the record, however, suggests that either appellant was aware he had a separate right to a jury to hear the special circumstance allegations. While the court did advise appellants that they \u201chave an absolute right, each one of you independently, to have a jury hear this case and impose a sentence,\u201d at most the advice related to the guilt and penalty phases of trial. The separate right to a jury trial in the penalty phase is provided for in section 190.4, subdivision (b). It is clearly distinct from the right to have a jury hear the special circumstances as provided in section 190.4, subdivision (a). The record is simply devoid of any reference to the latter right. Accordingly, we find <em>Memro </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">B. <em>Is the Error Reversible Per Se?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Our conclusion requires us to address the question <em>Memro </em>expressly avoided: What is the proper standard of prejudice to apply? Appellants urge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>that the error is reversible per se. Respondent disagrees and argues the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Appellants concede that their reversible per se contention cannot rest on a federal constitutional footing. There is no right under the Sixth Amendment to have a jury hear and rule on special circumstance allegations. <em>(Walton </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1990) 497 U.S. _,__[111 L.Ed.2d 511, 524-525, 110 S.Ct. 3047].) \u201c[T]he deprivation of a statutory entitlement to a jury trial implicates the federal due process clause. <em>(Hicks </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 343 [].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gastile </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1376, 1382 [253 Cal.Rptr. 283].)  The appropriate standard of prejudice for violations of federal due process is the <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065] \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gastile, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at p. 1383; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1986) 478 U.S. 570 [92 L.Ed.2d 460, 106 S.Ct. 3101].)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Appellants maintain that the California Constitution\u2019s jury trial clause (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16) is an independent constitutional basis for their right to a jury trial on the special circumstance allegations, and further argue that, on violation of this right, reversal is automatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">California Constitution, article I, section 16 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">\u201cTrial by jury is an inviolate right and shall be secured to all, ... A jury may be waived in a criminal cause by the consent of both parties expressed in open court by the defendant and the defendant\u2019s counsel. . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">So far as we are aware, no published California case has considered whether the separate right to a jury trial on special circumstances provided for in section 190.4, subdivision (a), is mandated by the state Constitution. <em>People </em>v. <em>Gastile, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d 1376, discussed and analyzed the right only in light of federal constitutional principles. Thus, we treat the issue as one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">(1) <em>General Principles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">We begin by noting that our Supreme Court has recently indicated that the doctrine of independent state constitutional construction retains vitality in California. <em>(Raven </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 336 [276 Cal.Rptr. 326, 801 P.2d 1077].) While state courts will generally defer to decisions of the United States Supreme Court for interpretation of state constitutional provisions identical or similar to those in the federal Constitution, the policy is inapplicable if there is \u201cgood cause for departure or deviation therefrom.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 353.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Appellants do not articulate any \u201cgood cause\u201d for construing the state constitutional jury trial clause more expansively than the United States Supreme Court has construed the Sixth Amendment. Instead, appellants merely point us to several state court decisions not directly involving the issue under discussion and argue by analogy from those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Before turning to the cases cited by appellants, we note several indications by California courts that the right to jury trial on special circumstance allegations is not constitutionally mandated or, at least, is not subject to the reversible per se standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Granger </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 422 [164 Cal.Rptr. 363] was apparently the first reported case dealing with failure to obtain a separate jury trial waiver on a charged special circumstance. In <em>Granger </em>the court concluded that \u201cdefendant did have a <em>statutory </em>right to a trial by jury on the truth of the allegation of special circumstances . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 427, italics in original.) After finding that the defendant had not waived his right, the appellate court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\u201cOn this appeal, defendant does not question the finding that he was guilty of felony murder, in that the killing was committed in perpetration of both a robbery and a burglary. However, at the trial, he offered evidence to the effect that he was, at the time of the crime, under the influence of PCP to such an extent as to prevent him from premeditating the killing. In fact, the trial judge indicated some difficulty in finding premeditation in light of that evidence. Although there is other evidence from which a finding of premeditation could be drawn, we cannot say, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a jury could not rationally have found in defendant\u2019s favor on the issue of special circumstances. It follows that the case must be remanded for a jury trial on that issue.\u201d (105 Cal.App.3d at p. 429.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Although the <em>Granger </em>court did not expressly address the reversible per se/harmless error issue, it actually applied the Chapman<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> standard in concluding that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, by emphasizing that the defendant\u2019s right was statutory the court implied it did not derive from a constitutional source.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\"><em>Granger </em>was followed by, and cited approvingly in, <em>People </em>v. <em>Memro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 658. The Supreme Court in <em>Memro </em>likewise found error in the failure to obtain a personal jury waiver on a special circumstance. In concluding, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>\u201cHowever, since the judgment must be reversed on other grounds, it is unnecessary to determine whether appellant was prejudiced by that error. The question as to what standard of prejudice should be applied in this situation is left for another day.\u201d (38 Cal.3d at pp. 704-705.) By the language it chose, the Supreme Court indicated that <em>some </em>standard of prejudice applies in such cases. If the Supreme Court considers the error reversible per se, we believe the court would have said so simply and directly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Finally, the Supreme Court has recently made pointed references to the right in question here as \u201cstatutory.\u201d <em>(Curl </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1292, 1299, 1302 [276 Cal.Rptr. 49, 801 P.2d 292].)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">(2) <em>Appellants, Authorities.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">In support of their argument, appellants first rely on cases in which the California Supreme Court distinguishes a special circumstance finding from the finding of an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Odle </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 386, 412 [247 Cal.Rptr. 137, 754 P.2d 184]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Engert) </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 797, 803 [183 Cal.Rptr. 800, 647 P.2d 76]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 539, 552 [205 Cal.Rptr. 265, 684 P.2d 826].) In those cases, however, the court was not facing the issue posed here, i.e., whether the statutory right to a jury trial on special circumstances derives from the state Constitution. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Enger\u00ed), supra, </em>the question was whether section 190.2, subdivision (a)(14) defined a special circumstance with sufficient specificity to satisfy due process. <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Odie, supra, </em>each considered the effect of error in jury instructions on special circumstances. In each case the court rejected the automatic reversal doctrine. Significantly, the <em>Odie </em>court expressly considered the state Constitution and applied the <em>Watson</em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> standard of prejudice. (45 Cal.3d at pp. 415-416.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Appellants next cite <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 194 [249 Cal.Rptr. 850, 757 P.2d 1013]. In <em>Hernandez </em>the court concluded that an enhancement under former section 667.8 (kidnapping for purposes of rape) could not be imposed when it was neither pled nor proven. Analyzing the issue on due process grounds, the court held that the error \u201ccannot be deemed harmless.\u201d (46 Cal.3d at p. 211.) The case did not involve a special circumstance finding and did not rely on the state constitutional right to a jury trial. We find no support for appellants\u2019 position in <em>Hernandez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Finally, appellants rely on a series of California cases for the proposition that failure to obtain an effective waiver of the defendant\u2019s jury trial right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>always results in reversal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Holmes </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 442 [5 Cal.Rptr. 871, 353 P.2d 583]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hopkins </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 107 [113 Cal.Rptr. 880]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Luick </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 555 [101 Cal.Rptr. 252]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ray </em>(1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 734 [48 Cal.Rptr. 167]; <em>People </em>v. <em>De Blasio </em>(1963) 219 Cal.App.2d 767 [33 Cal Rptr. 473]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crouch </em>(1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 157 [32 Cal.Rptr. 141].) After reviewing those decisions we find none of them dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">None of the cited cases dealt with the right to jury trial on a special circumstance allegation. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Holmes, supra, </em>54 Cal.2d 442, <em>People </em>v. <em>De Blasio, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.2d 767, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Crouch, supra, </em>218 Cal.App.2d 157, the respective defendants had not effectively waived jury trial on the question of guilt or innocence of the charged criminal offense. That right is indisputably guaranteed by the state Constitution, so the decisions in those cases shed little light on the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hopkins, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.3d 107, after the defendant waived jury trial the prosecutor amended the information to allege the intentional infliction of great bodily injury on the victim during commission of the offense. The newly added enhancement increased the possible minimum prison term on conviction from five years to fifteen years. Finding that subjecting the defendant to trial without obtaining a new jury waiver was error, the appellate court reversed without any discussion of the reversible per se/harmless error question. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 113-120.) Because the error was clearly prejudicial under any standard, the decision does not necessarily support appellants\u2019 characterization of the case as falling in the reversible per se column.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">In both <em>People </em>v. <em>Luick, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.3d 555, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Ray, supra, </em>238 Cal.App.2d 734, the appellate court considered the trial court\u2019s failure to obtain a separate waiver of jury trial on an allegation of prior convictions. The right to a jury trial on priors is conferred by section 96914. In each case the allegation of prior convictions was added after the defendant had waived jury trial on the offenses currently charged. Each appellate court found error. In <em>Ray </em>the judgment finding the prior convictions true was reversed for retrial. (238 Cal.App.2d at p. 735.) In <em>Luick </em>the appellate court simply ordered the reference to the prior convictions stricken from the judgment in \u201cthe interests of justice.\u201d (24 Cal.App.3d at p. 559.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Appellants argue that because neither <em>Luick </em>nor <em>Ray </em>discusses prejudice, the appellate courts necessarily treated the error as reversible per se. Further, because the jury trial right in those cases was created by statute, as is the one involved here, we are required to reverse even without consideration of the state Constitution. We reject these contentions. <em>Luick </em>and <em>Ray </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>simply did not address the issue. We will not read those courts\u2019 silence as an affirmative holding that the error was reversible per se. For all that appears, the question was never raised. The results may also be explained on the basis that the error was prejudicial under any standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">None of the cases cited by appellants persuades us that their right to jury trial on the special circumstance allegations is guaranteed by the California Constitution or that deprivation of that right is reversible error per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">(3) <em>Constitutional Language and History.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Having concluded that none of the cases cited by appellants is precedent for the reversible per se standard, we look to the language and history of the state constitutional jury trial provision for indications that it is the source of the right expressed in section 190.4, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The pertinent constitutional language (\u201cTrial by jury is an inviolate right and shall be secured to all. . .\u201d [Cal. Const, art. I, \u00a7 16]) is not significantly different from similar provisions in the original California Constitution of 1849 and the 1879 revision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The wording does not expressly refer to trial of special circumstance allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">It is settled that the right to jury trial guaranteed by the pre-1974 state Constitution applies \u201conly in cases where the right existed at common law.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1922) 188 Cal. 281, 285 [205 P. 121, 21 A.L.R. 1399]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Richardson </em>(1934) 138 Cal.App. 404, 408-409 [32 P.2d 433].)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">\u201cIt is the right to trial by jury as it existed at common law which is preserved; and what that right is, is a purely historical question, a fact which is to be ascertained like any other social, political or legal fact. The right is the historical right enjoyed at the time it was guaranteed by the Constitution . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>One 1941 Chevrolet Coupe </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 283, 287 [231 P.2d 832].)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">So far as we know, the determination of special circumstances as a separate requirement for imposing capital punishment was unknown at common law. Appellants have not directed us to any historical authority suggesting otherwise. Thus, we see no basis for concluding that the pre-1974 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>jury trial clause of the California Constitution guaranteed a jury trial on special circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The jury trial provision was included in a measure proposed by the California Constitution Revision Commission and adopted in 1974. As we have noted, the wording of the jury trial clause of the revised Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 16) is not significantly different from its predecessors. One year before the constitutional revision, however, the concept of an allegation, trial, and finding of special circumstances was introduced by statute. (Stats. 1973, ch. 719, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4, 5, pp. 1297-1300.) That statute was enacted in response to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 238 [33 L.Ed.2d 346, 92 S.Ct. 2726], holding that imposition of the death penalty under a Georgia statute was invalid as cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Frierson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 142, 173-174 [158 Cal.Rptr. 281, 599 P.2d 587].)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Arguably, the drafters of the revised Constitution, and the voters adopting it, intended to extend the jury trial guaranty to the special circumstances scheme enacted by the Legislature in 1973. A similar argument was successfully advanced in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 1230 [265 Cal.Rptr. 144, 783 P.2d 731]. In <em>Mitchell </em>the Supreme Court found that the drafters of the 1879 California Constitution intended to afford the right to jury trial in all misdemeanor proceedings, including contempts carrying a punishment indistinguishable from that imposed on a misdemeanant. (49 Cal. 3d at p. 1244.) In doing so, the court relied on reported debates at the 1879 Constitutional Convention <em>(id. </em>at pp. 1242-1243) <em>and </em>on a misdemeanor contempt statute (\u00a7 166) which existed when the new Constitution was adopted. (49 Cal.3d at p. 1244.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The reasons underlying the <em>Mitchell </em>decision, however, do not apply in this case. The California Constitution Revision Commission completed its recommendations for revisions in 1971, long before the special circumstances statute was enacted. (Sumner, <em>Constitution Revision by Commission in California </em>(1972) 1 Western St.U. L.Rev. 48, 52.) Nothing in the commission\u2019s proceedings indicates any intention to enlarge or expand the scope of the jury trial clause (Minutes of the Meeting of the Const. Revision Com., July 23-24, 1970). When the proposed revisions were presented to the voters as Proposition 7 on the November 1974 General Election ballot, the Legislative Analyst\u2019s analysis and the ballot arguments supporting and opposing the proposition made no reference to the jury trial clause. (Ballot Pamp., Prop. 7, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 5, 1974).) For these reasons we do not infer any intent to broaden that clause\u2019s scope by encompassing the newly adopted statutory procedure for capital cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>We discern no \u201cgood cause\u201d for interpreting the California Constitution\u2019s jury trial clause more broadly than the United States Supreme Court has interpreted the Sixth Amendment for the determination of special circumstances in capital cases. Accordingly, we reject appellants\u2019 independent state grounds argument. The deprivation of appellants\u2019 statutory right to jury trial implicates, the federal due process clause and is subject to the <em>Chapman </em>standard of harmless error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gastile, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1382-1383.) We now must examine the case to determine if the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">C. <em>Was the Error Harmless?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The court found that appellants committed the Woods murder while engaged in the commission of burglary and attempted robbery. (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(i) and (vii).) In the Due\u00f1as murder case the court found each appellant had been convicted of more than one offense of first degree murder in this proceeding. (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">While we will later conclude there was sufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that the Woods murder occurred as appellants were engaged in committing burglary and attempted robbery, the evidence did not necessarily compel that finding. Different reasonable inferences could be drawn as to whether the burglary and attempted robbery were committed separately from or only as an incident to appellants\u2019 primary objective\u2014murder. Each of appellants\u2019 trial counsel strenuously argued this theory to the court, relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468], Although the court rejected the arguments, we cannot say that a rational jury would have necessarily done so. Deprivation of a jury trial on those special circumstance allegations was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, that portion of the judgment finding the special circumstances true as to the Woods murder must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The special circumstance found true as to the Due\u00f1as murder rested on the simple, incontrovertible fact that each appellant was, indeed, convicted of more than one offense of first degree murder in this proceeding. If a jury had been selected and sworn to \u201ctry\u201d this special circumstance, the jury\u2019s role would have been limited to \u201cfinding\u201d a fact which is undeniably true. When the trial court found defendants guilty of first degree murder in both killings, the special circumstance applied by its own terms. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gastile, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d 1376, 1383.) The failure to obtain a separate jury waiver on the multiple murder special circumstance was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>II.-V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Those portions of the judgments in case number 25143 which found true the special circumstance allegations with respect to the murder of Henry Woods and which imposed sentences on count I, the first degree murder of Henry Woods, are reversed and remanded. In all other respects, the judgments in case number 25143, including the convictions of each of the defendants of the first degree murder of Henry Woods (count I), are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The judgments in case number 26005 are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Martin, Acting P.
