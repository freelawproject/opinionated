Defendant also argues that when the trial court ultimately sentenced him, the court erroneously applied on-bail enhancements (\u00a7 12022.1). For reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">I. Denial of Continuance<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">II. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">\n<em>Facts and Procedure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">On March 30, 1987, defendant committed the offense of felony possession of heroin. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350.)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">On September 7, 1987, while released from custody for the heroin offense, he committed the offense of possession of a firearm by a ex-felon. (\u00a7 12021.)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">On February 16, 1988, while released from custody for the heroin offense and the firearm offense, defendant committed another offense of possession of a firearm by an ex-felon. (\u00a7 12021.)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">On February 24, 1988, pursuant to a guilty plea to the heroin offense, defendant was sentenced to five months in county jail and placed on probation for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">On August 12, 1988, while released from custody for the two firearm offenses, defendant committed burglary. (\u00a7 459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">The two firearm offenses were consolidated for trial; the jury returned guilty verdicts in November 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">Defendant was found guilty by jury of first degree burglary in December 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">Defendant was ultimately sentenced as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b840-16\">The trial court selected the upper term of six years on the burglary as the base term. The court then recomputed the sentences on the two firearm offenses as subordinate consecutive terms of eight months each. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>added three 2-year on-bail enhancements under section 12022.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court added four 5-year enhancements for prior serious felony convictions. (\u00a7 667, subd. (a).) Defendant also received a concurrent eight-month sentence for violation of probation stemming from the heroin conviction. Thus, defendant was sentenced to a total of 33 years and 4 months in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">A. <em>Imposition of Both Consecutive Sentence and Two-year Enhancement Does Not Violate Section 12022.1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in imposing the two-year enhancements (\u00a7 12022.1, subd. (b); fn. 3, <em>ante), </em>because the two-year enhancement cannot be imposed where the defendant is convicted of both the primary and secondary offense and is <em>sentenced </em>to state prison for each offense. He argues section 12022.1 itself compels this result, because subdivision (e)\u2014the two-prison-sentence situation\u2014contains no language imposing the two-year enhancement, whereas subdivision (f)\u2014where a defendant receives probation for the primary offense\u2014does contain language specifically imposing the two-year enhancement. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>also points out that, prior to a 1985 amendment, the statute specifically imposed the two-year enhancement in the two-sentence situation. (Stats. 1982, ch. 1551, \u00a7 2, p. 6050.) He thus concludes the amendment deleting specific reference to the two-year enhancement in the two-sentence situation (Stats. 1985, ch. 533, \u00a7 1, p. 1906) reflects a legislative intent not to impose the enhancement in that situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">These arguments were rejected in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bar\u00edes </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 313 [256 Cal.Rptr. 920], We agree with <em>Baries\u2019s </em>analysis and therefore reject defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">B. <em>Imposition of Both Consecutive Sentence and Two-year Enhancement Does Not Violate Section 654</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Defendant contends imposition of a consecutive sentence (\u00a7 12022.1, subd. (e)) and a two-year enhancement (\u00a7 12022.1, subd. (b)) constitutes impermissible double punishment for the same act \u201cmade punishable in different ways by different provisions\u201d of the Penal Code within the meaning of section 654.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Warinner </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1352 [247 Cal.Rptr. 197] held section 654 did not apply to section 12022.1 enhancements, on the ground that section 654 is \u201cinapplicable to enhancements because enhancements do not define an offense.\u201d (P. 1355.) The courts of appeal are divided on the question whether section 654 applies to enhancements. (See People v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 517, 519 [253 Cal.Rptr. 633], and authorities there cited [holding \u00a7 654 inapplicable to enhancements]; compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Dobson </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 496, 501 [252 Cal.Rptr. 423] and authorities there cited [holding \u00a7 654 applicable to enhancements].)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">We do not have to take sides in this dispute because, even assuming for the sake of argument section 654 may be properly applied to enhancements in some circumstances, it does not apply in the circumstances advanced by defendant. In essence, defendant says section 654 is violated because the Legislature has seen fit to punish a single statutory violation (commission of a felony while on bail) with two different punishments (a two-year prison term and a mandatory consecutive sentence) described in two different subdivisions of the same statute. (Fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>However, section 654 does not apply where the Legislature has adopted multiple statutory provisions punishing a single statutory violation in different ways. Rather, section 654 applies where the defendant\u2019s act violates more than one statutory provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>(and therefore usually constitutes the commission of more than one crime), and defendant would be punished for each violation in the absence of section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">This view of section 654 emerges from the way our Supreme Court has characterized and applied section 654. Thus, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Clapp </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 835 [151 P.2d 237], the court concluded section 654 was enacted to apply where \u201cthe same act may violate more than one statute, . . .\u201d (P. 842.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Knowles </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 175 [217 P.2d 1], the court remarked that section 654 applies where \u201ctwo offenses [are] committed by the same act . . . .\u201d (P. 186.) <em>Knowles </em>continued, \u201cIf a course of criminal conduct causes <em>the commission of more than one offense, </em>each of which can be committed without committing any other, the applicability of section 654 will depend upon whether a separate and distinct act can be established as the basis of each conviction, or whether a single act has been so committed that more than one statute has been violated.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 187, italics added; accord <em>Neal </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1960) 55 Cal.2d 11, 19 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839].) Similarly, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Beamon </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 625, 636 [105 Cal.Rptr. 681, 504 P.2d 905], the court said section 654 \u201cprohibits the imposition of punishment <em>for more than one violation </em>arising out of an \u2018act or omission\u2019 which is made punishable in different ways by different statutory provisions.\u201d (Italics added, fn. omitted.) Again, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 545, 550-551 [153 Cal.Rptr. 40, 591 P.2d 63], the court said, \u201cThe purpose of this legislative protection against punishment <em>for more than one violation </em>arising out of an \u2018act or omission\u2019 is to insure that a defendant\u2019s punishment will be commensurate with his culpability.\u201d (Pe<em>ople </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 550-551, italics added.) In line with these views, Witkin and Epstein have written that the purpose of section 654 \u201cis to prevent <em>multiple punishment </em>for a <em>single act or omission, </em>even though the act or omission violates more than one statute, and thus constitutes <em>more than one crime.\" </em>(3 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1989) Punishment for Crime, \u00a7 1382, p. 1625, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We have been cited no authority for the view underlying defendant\u2019s argument, i.e., that section 654 prohibits the imposition of different, cumulative punishments for the same proscribed act where the Legislature has set out those punishments in different statutory provisions. Moreover, we have an obligation to give section 654 a reasonable construction in accord with the intent of the Legislature. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pieters </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 894, 898-899 [276 Cal.Rptr. 918, 802 P.2d 420].) We can think of no reason why the Legislature would require itself to set out in a single statutory provision all the various punishments for a wrongful act. Carried to its logical conclusion defendant\u2019s view would effectively nullify statutory provisions that impose forms of punishment in addition to basic periods of incarceration. Common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>examples are the various enhancement statutes themselves and the restitution fine. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 13967.)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Since defendant\u2019s profferred interpretation of section 654 is patently unreasonable we reject it. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pieters, supra, </em>52 Cal. 3d at p. 903.) Here, the sole statutory violation committed by defendant was his commission of a felony while released on bail. In subdivisions (b) and (e) of section 12022.1, the Legislature has ordained that defendant\u2019s statutory violation should be punished both by imposition of a two-year enhancement and by imposition of a consecutive sentence. Section 654 does not preclude imposition of these punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">C. <em>Defendant\u2019s Sentence Does Not Violate the Double-base-term Limitation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Defendant contends his sentence violates the double-the-base-term (DBT) limitation of section 1170.1, subdivision (g).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">As noted, defendant was sentenced to a base term of six years on the burglary, two subordinate consecutive eight-month terms on the firearm offenses pursuant to section 12022.1, three 2-year on-bail enhancements under section 12022.1, and four 5-year enhancements for prior serious felony convictions under section 667.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">Defendant argues: \u201cThe double-the-base term limit of section 1170.1, subdivision (g) requires that appellant be sentenced to a term no greater than twice the six-year base term, or 12 years, plus any enhancements that fall within the exceptions enumerated in the section.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) He points out his section 12022.1 enhancements, including both the mandatory consecutive subordinate terms and the two-year enhancements, totaled seven years and four months. Because section 12022.1 enhancements are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>not specifically excluded from the DBT limitation by statute, defendant seeks a reduction of one year and four months, so that his section 12022.1 enhancements do not exceed his base term.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Defendant\u2019s argument is based on the mistaken premise that section 1170.1 dissects a sentence into component parts, with a separate inquiry as to whether each component may exceed the DBT limitation. This construction of section 1170.1 was rejected in <em>People </em>v. <em>Magill </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d <em>777 </em>[224 Cal.Rptr. 702, 715 P.2d 662], which held that \u201cthe presence of any of the specified enhancements [in subdivision (g)] makes the double-base term limitation entirely inapplicable. [Citation.]\u201d (P. 780.) Here, defendant received four serious felony enhancements under section 667. Section 667 is an enhancement expressly enumerated in subdivision (g) of section 1170.1. (See fn. 5, <em>antel) </em>Consequently, the DBT limitation was wholly inapplicable and defendant was properly sentenced. <em>(Magill, supra, </em>at pp. 780-781.)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Marler, J., and Scotland, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 6, 1991.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-14\"> Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b840-17\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1203.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\"> Section 12022.1 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-9\">\u201c(a) For the purposes of this section only:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-10\">\u201c(1) \u2018Primary offense\u2019 means a felony offense for which a person has been released from custody on bail or on his or her own recognizance prior to the judgment becoming final, including the disposition of any appeal, or for which release on bail or his or her own recognizance has been revoked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-11\">\u201c(2) \u2018Secondary offense\u2019 means a felony offense alleged to have been committed while the person is released from custody for a primary offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-12\">\u201c(b) Any person arrested for a secondary offense which was alleged to have been committed while that person was released from custody on a primary offense shall be subject to a penalty enhancement of an additional two years in state prison which shall be served consecutive to any other term imposed by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-13\">\u201c(d) Whenever there is a conviction for the secondary offense and the enhancement is proved, and the person is sentenced on the secondary offense prior to the conviction of the primary offense, the imposition of the enhancement shall be stayed pending imposition of the sentence for the primary offense.
