We conclude that triable issues of fact preclude summary adjudication and consequently issue a peremptory writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Pistone bought a used Oldsmobile from Nissan on May 13, 1986. For an additional $525, she paid for a used-car service contract (the VSC) under which Nissan (the \u201cDealer\u201d or \u201cSelling Dealer\u201d) would repair or replace covered components should a \u201cmechanical breakdown\u201d occur within the policy term. Work could be done by the selling dealer or any authorized dealer, but all work required the owner to get prior authorization by the dealer or its \u201cAdministrator,\u201d identified in the VSC by office address and telephone numbers. The VSC recited that the administrator was \u201cnot a warrantor or contractor hereunder,\u201d did \u201cnot assume and specifically disclaims any liability to you for any benefits provided herein\u201d and would be liable \u201conly to the dealer, in accordance with their separate agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The VSC identified Pacific Indemnity Company (Pacific Indemnity) as underwriter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The \u201cseparate agreement\u201d between the dealer and administrator is not explained in the VSC and was evidently not disclosed to Pistone. It was an \u201cAdministration Agreement\u201d by which NCDA administered a \u201cprogram\u201d of VSC\u2019s offered by Nissan to car buyers. Under the agreement, Nissan agreed to use forms and contracts furnished by NCDA and to follow a dealer procedure manual also produced by NCDA. The agreement required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Nissan to \u201cconsult Administrator for prior approval in advance of repairing a customer claim\u201d <em>(sic) </em>under any VSC.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Pistone\u2019s Oldsmobile developed engine trouble during the warranty period, requiring repairs, and she ultimately made a claim against her VSC for nearly $3,600. The work was done at an Oldsmobile dealership rather than Nissan, allegedly because Nissan could not service her car. She made her claim directly to administrator NCDA, as provided for in that situation, but NCDA, for reasons not important here, denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Pistone then filed this action against NCDA, Pacific Indemnity and Nissan, allegedly after trying without success to contact Pacific Indemnity at the address listed in the VSC (see fn. 2, <em>ante). </em>Her third amended complaint (hereafter complaint) contains eight causes of action against NCDA, six of which concern us here: breach of the VSC (first), breach of the VSC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>implied good faith covenant (second), tortious denial of the contract (third), bad faith denial of an insurance contract (sixth), negligent misrepresentation (seventh) and fraud (eighth). Each cause of action depends on allegations to the effect that NCDA, though not named as a party to the VSC, in fact was one by virtue of a principal-agent relationship with Nissan during the contracting.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The existence of that agency relationship is key to the ruling on NCDA\u2019s motion for summary adjudication of issues (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (f)), which we review here. NCDA brought the motion on grounds that its lack of party status to the VSC precluded liability, also urging that the VSC was not a contract of \u201cinsurance\u201d for purposes of the sixth cause of action. Pistone and Nissan each opposed the motion. Agreeing with NCDA\u2019s position and relying on <em>Clemens </em>v. <em>American Warranty Corp. </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 444 [238 Cal.Rptr. 339], the superior court granted summary adjudication on all issues (A through F) affecting NCDA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">This petition followed. We issued an order to show cause, ordered all proceedings stayed pending our review and allowed Nissan to file a brief as amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Review of a summary judgment or adjudication involves the same three-step process required of the superior court: (1) identify the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>framed by the pleadings and thus placed at issue by the motion; (2) determine whether the moving party\u2019s showing negated the opponent\u2019s claims; and (3) determine whether the opposing party demonstrated the existence of triable issues of fact. <em>(AAR TS Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1064-1065 [225 Cal.Rptr. 203].) Our function is merely to determine whether issues of fact exist, not to decide them. We strictly construe the moving party\u2019s affidavits and liberally construe those of the opponent, resolving in the opponent\u2019s favor any doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion. <em>(Molko </em>v. <em>Holy Spirit Assn. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1107 [252 Cal.Rptr. 122, 762 P.2d 46], cert. den. (1989) 490 U.S. 1084 [104 L.Ed.2d 670, 109 S.Ct. 2110].)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\n<em>Agency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">We hold that the evidence raised a triable issue of fact whether Nissan was the agent of NCDA in entering into the VSC with Pistone. The existence or absence of agency ordinarily poses a question of fact. Unless the evidence permits only one inference, the question is one for the trier of fact. <em>(Seneris </em>v. <em>Haas </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 811, 831 [291 P.2d 915, 53 A.L.R.2d 124]; <em>DeSuza </em>v. <em>Andersack </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 694, 700 [133 Cal.Rptr. 920]; Civ. Code, \u00a7 2295.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Agency was raised by the pleadings on all affected causes of action. NCDA relied on the VSC\u2019s terms to show lack of agent/party status. The VSC calls NCDA an \u201cAdministrator\u201d and expressly disclaims any contract liability. However, that same contract refers to the relationship between Nissan and NCDA being governed by the separate administration agreement. That agreement shows, in essence, that NCDA engineered, drafted all documents for and had sole authority to preapprove repair work and approve claims made under VSC\u2019s sold by Nissan. Nissan\u2019s role after entering into a VSC with a customer and passing along a set amount of the payment to NCDA was essentially limited to submitting claims documents and approval requests for repairs which Nissan itself made\u2014all in conformance with certain NCDA manual procedures which are not in evidence. It is clear from both the administration agreement and the VSC that if Nissan did not do the work (as in this case), it was not involved at all in performing obligations under the VSC. The customer was directed in the VSC to deal directly with NCDA for claims assistance or whenever repairs were not made by the selling dealer (Nissan).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Nissan\u2019s general manager in 1986, who managed the finance department which sold the VSC\u2019s, declared that Nissan sought approval by phoning in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>repair orders to NCDA but had no authority to approve repairs or pay claims. Nissan\u2019s authority ended with selling the warranty, collecting a commission and forwarding the money and documents to NCDA headquarters. It frequently became an advocate for irate customers, but it had no authority over VSC approvals or claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">This evidence taken together raises a reasonable inference that Nissan acted as an agent for NCDA in contracting with customers under the VSC program. Whether Nissan was a coprincipal or just an agent is unimportant to the analysis here. The point is that NCDA may have been more than the mere \u201cadministrator\u201d it purported to be under the VSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">NCDA relies on <em>Clemens </em>v. <em>American Warranty Corp., supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d 444 <em>{Clemens'), </em>in which the court upheld a ruling that American Warranty Corporation (AWC), the defendant administrator of a VSC program in that case, was not a party to a VSC signed by the customer (Clemens) and the dealer. <em>Clemens </em>held that \u201c[t]he involvement of AWC and [an AWC claims manager] in the VSC, as alleged by Clemens, did not rise to the level of their being parties to the contract.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 452.) The case is easily distinguished since it was a \u201cdenial of the claim <em>... by the </em>Dealer\u201d (italics ours) which was at issue. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 448.) Here, the dealer (Nissan) did not deny the claim and, the evidence shows, had no authority to do so. Only NCDA had that authority. This allows an inference that Nissan, which only sold the VSC and then turned all aspects of performance over to NCDA, was NCDA\u2019s agent at the contract\u2019s making.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">NCDA tries to take refuge in the parol evidence rule, urging that the VSC language describing it as an \u201cadministrator\u201d was clear and unambiguous and thus precluded admitting extrinsic evidence to contradict those recitals. (See respondent court\u2019s decision, fn. 5, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The effort is misguided. First, the rule applies only to \u201cintegrated\u201d agreements (see 2 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (3d ed. 1986) Documentary Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 967-974, pp. 915-920), something which NCDA does not address. Moreover, no matter how clear and unambiguous a writing is on its face, the rule allows admitting evidence to resolve <em>latent </em>ambiguity <em>{id., </em>\u00a7 977, p. 923, \u00a7 983, p. 929), to prove fraud (\u00a7 999, p. 945) and to reveal an undisclosed principal or party in interest (\u00a7 1010, pp. 953-954). (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1856, subds. (e), (g).)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">More fundamentally, contract recitals of the existence or absence of agency, while relevant, are never determinative. (See 2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Law (9th ed. 1987) Agency and Employment, \u00a7 32, pp. 46-47; <em>Tieberg </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 943, 952 [88 Cal.Rptr. 175, 471 P.2d 975] [terminology used in an agreement is not conclusive, even in the absence of fraud or mistake].) The cases freely allow parties to contradict \u201cclear\u201d contract language and show their actual relationships. <em>(Mark Hopkins Inc. </em>v. <em>Cal. Emp. etc. Com. </em>(1948) 86 Cal.App.2d 15, 17-18 [193 P.2d 792]; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Badger </em>(1948) 84 Cal.App.2d 736, 742 [191 P.2d 768]; <em>J. I. Case Co. </em>v. <em>Redfern </em>(1933) 133 Cal.App. 173, 175-176 [23 P.2d 791].)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u201cInsurance\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The agency issue takes on a new twist in the sixth cause of action, for bad faith breach of an insurance contract. The issue is whether NCDA, by its relationship with Nissan, was selling \u201cinsurance\u201d under Insurance Code section 116 (hereafter section 116).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Contrary to NCDA\u2019s protests, this issue was squarely raised below. Page 13 of the complaint alleges in part: \u201cDefendant NCDA in issuing the service contract became an insurer of Plaintiff\u2019s vehicle under CA Insurance Code Sec 116(d).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Subdivision (b) of section 116 defines warranty contracts of the sort at issue here as automobile \u201cinsurance\u201d for code purposes. However, subdivision (c) exempts sales of contracts \u201ccovering only defects in material and workmanship\u201d sold for \u201ca separately stated charge\u201d as long as the sales are \u201cincidental to the business of selling or leasing automobiles\u201d and the maker \u201chas an insurance policy with an admitted automobile insurer providing coverage for the making of those conetracts.\u201d Subdivision (d) states that \u201cdoing . . . any business . . . described in this section in a manner designed to evade the provisions of this section is the doing of an insurance business.\u201d (See fn. 6, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Pistone, backed by amicus curiae Nissan, argues that the evidence supports a reasonable inference that NCDA used the administration agreement and VSC program, coupled with an agency relationship with Nissan, to escape section 116\u2019s reach. In other words, by characterizing itself as an \u201cadministrator\u201d and having Nissan sign all of the VSC\u2019s, NCDA created a front to avoid having its business deemed automobile \u201cinsurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We have already held that a reasonable inference of agency arose. It follows that NCDA could be found a principal to the VSC\u2019s and that the purported \u201cadministrator\u201d arrangement thus masked a direct sale of automobile insurance by NCDA. No argument is made that <em>NCDA\u2019s </em>sales of VSC\u2019s under such a theory were \u201cmerely incidental to the business of selling or leasing automobiles\u201d or otherwise fell within the exemption of section 116, subdivision (c). No one addresses what state of mind by NCDA might be required to satisfy subdivision (d)\u2019s language, \u201cdesigned to evade\u201d (see fn. 6, <em>ante), </em>and we find no case law on point. However, assuming in NCDA\u2019s favor that a purposeful deception is needed, such an inference reasonably arises. The ostensible \u201cadministrator\u201d relationship and resulting agency, while conceivably unintended, also reasonably suggest evasion of the law. A factual question is posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">NCDA again relies on <em>Clemens, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d 444, where the court rejected an argument that AWC engaged in the business of insurance through its administration of the dealer\u2019s VSC\u2019s. The court stated: \u201c[T]he mere fact the Dealer appointed AWC as administrator did not transform AWC into an insurer. It would be anomalous and inconsistent to hold that while the Dealer who incidentally sold the VSC was not an insurer, AWC, as the Dealer\u2019s appointee to administer said VSC, was engaged in the business of insurance.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at pp. 454-455, fn. omitted.) <em>Clemens </em>is distinguishable on at least two fronts. First, there was no suggestion that AWC was hiding behind the title \u201cadministrator\u201d while in fact wielding sole authority to approve work and claims. The agency or alter ego connection was missing. Second, the plaintiff did not rely on section 116, subdivision (d) to support the theory.  \u201c \u2018[Cjases are not authority for propositions not considered.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Canales </em>v. <em>City ofAlviso </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 118, fn. 2 at p. 128 [89 Cal.Rptr. 601, 474 P.2d 417].)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Finally, nothing in the legislative history cited by the parties shows that a nondealer who sells VSC\u2019s is exempt from section 116\u2019s definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>\u201cinsurance.\u201d (See <em>Clemens, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d 444, 454 &amp; fn. 7, quoting legislative counsel digest of 1983 amendment.)  As summarized in <em>Clemens, </em>the section as amended in 1983 was \u201cintended to protect the expectations of consumers who purchase extended service contracts from automobile <em>dealers </em>who are subsequently unable to honor their obligations. The new section 116 gave <em>dealers </em>a choice between either purchasing some form of insurance or becoming an insurer subject to the provisions of the Insurance Code and regulation by the Department of Insurance.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 454, italics added.) Our conclusion is also consistent with the pre-1983 statute, which classified extended service contracts as automobile insurance if \u201cthe maker of the contract did so as a vocation and not merely as incidental to any other business activity.\u201d <em>{Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.) NCDA\u2019s making of VSC\u2019s (if such be found) appears on this record to have been vocational, not incidental to some other business activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Any doubt that evasive \u201cadministrator\u201d actions are within the reach of the statute is dispelled by legislative history showing that past imprudence and fraud by administrators directly motivated the 1983 amendments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing respondent superior court to vacate its order of May 14, 1990, insofar as it grants real party in interest NCDA\u2019s motion for summary adjudication of issues A through F, and to issue a new order denying summary adjudication of those issues consistent with the views expressed in this opinion and in conformance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (g).
