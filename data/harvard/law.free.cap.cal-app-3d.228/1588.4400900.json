The statement declared that all criminal calendar departments of the central district were designated as \u201cdirect calendar courts,\u201d and it listed the judges presiding in those departments. The statement continued: \u201cIn order to be timely, a challenge pursuant to C.C.P. Section 170.6(2) must be filed within ten (10) days of the defendant\u2019s first appearance in the direct calendar court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\">The statement of policy was in effect when the case of People v. Ray Gonzales, which had commenced in the court of Judge Roosevelt Dorn on April 10, 1990, was set for trial. After a number of continuances, the matter was continued for trial until December 5, 1990. On November 30, the People attempted to file a peremptory challenge to Judge Dorn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">On December 3, 1990, the court conducted a hearing on the issue of whether the challenge was timely. The court stated it was \u201cvery familiar\u201d with <em>Mackey, </em>but that <em>Mackey </em>had \u201cno bearing on this case\u201d because of the aforementioned superior court policy statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1591\">*1591</page-number>In fact, this case is controlled by <em>Mackey </em>and it is the superior court policy statement which has no bearing. Giving the superior court the benefit of the doubt, we assume the policy statement was intended to have the force and effect of a local rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Local Rules are expressly authorized by Government Code section 68070, which provides in pertinent part: \u201cEvery court may make rules for its own government and the government of its officers <em>not inconsistent with law </em>or with the rules adopted and prescribed by the Judicial Council.\u201d (Italics added.) The policy statement in issue here is contrary to this court\u2019s interpretation of section 170.6 in <em>Mackey </em>and is therefore \u201cinconsistent with law.\u201d Accordingly, the statement violates Government Code section 68070.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">Respondent court contends that its policy statement is consistent with similar provisions of its Trial Court Delay Reduction Rules (Super. Ct. L.A. County Rules, ch. 11) upheld in <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 611 [253 Cal.Rptr. 748] [upholding project rule 1104.1, requiring challenge to individual calendar judge within 10 days after a party receives notice of the assignment of a case to such judge] and <em>Beverly Union Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 40 [253 Cal.Rptr. 359] [holding that counsel have a professional responsibility to be aware of duly adopted local rules].</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">These rules were adopted under the authority of and in accordance with the provisions of the Trial Court Delay Reduction Act of 1986 (the Act) (Gov. Code \u00a7 68600 et seq.). The Act permits judges in each county who are participating in a trial delay reduction program to \u201cdevelop, and publish the procedures, standards, and policies which will be used in the program, including time standards for the conclusion of all critical steps in the litigation process . . .\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68612.) \u201c[A] project rule, duly adopted under the mandate of Government Code section 68612, and not expressly prohibited thereby, which either imposes a procedural requirement not authorized by statute or shortens the time specified by statute for performance of an act, will control, to the extent reasonably necessary to carry out and further the provisions and goals of the Act, in those cases to which the project rules apply.\u201d <em>(International Union of Operating Engineers </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 340, 353 [254 Cal.Rptr. 782].) Thus, for example, local rule 1104.1, which imposes a procedural requirement that a peremptory challenge under section 170.6 must be made within 10 days of a party\u2019s appearance in the action, controls over contrary case law interpreting section 170.6. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1592\">*1592</page-number>The \u201cFast Track\u201d rules to which the respondent court refers apply to selected civil cases only. The respondent court has made no showing here that a similar trial delay reduction program has been instituted for criminal cases, or that the \u201crule\u201d promulgated in its policy statement was a \u201cprocedure, standard or policy\u201d adopted under such a program. The analysis set forth in <em>Mackey </em>therefore governs this case. Hence, under the \u201c10-day/5-day rule,\u201d the People\u2019s peremptory challenge was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">\n<em>Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">Defendant Gonzales, who remains in custody pending resolution of this proceeding, has filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus seeking immediate release from confinement and dismissal of the information because, during the pendency of this writ proceeding, the statutory period for bringing his case to trial (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1382) expired, and defendant did not waive his speedy trial rights. Although we sympathize with defendant\u2019s predicament, and we have expedited the proceeding in response to defendant\u2019s petition, dismissal of the information is not warranted because the People\u2019s seeking of interlocutory review of the respondent court\u2019s order constituted good cause for delay of trial beyond the statutory period provided in Penal Code section 1382. <em>(Marcotte </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 235, 241 [134 Cal.Rptr. 314]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 7, fn. 3 [212 Cal.Rptr. 563].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">The People\u2019s petition for writ of mandate is granted. Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the respondent court to vacate that portion of its order of December 3, 1990, rejecting the People\u2019s affidavit of prejudice as untimely filed, and enter a new and different order consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The respondent court\u2019s order of December 3, 1990, indicates that date was \u201cDay 0 of 10\u201d for purposes of bringing defendant to trial within the statutory time period provided in Penal Code section 1382. This time period is to resume at \u201cDay 0 of 10\u201d on the date the remittitur is filed in the respondent court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-9\">Defendant\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1593\">*1593</page-number>This opinion is final forthwith as to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajs\">Turner, P. J., and Ashby, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1120-10\"> Section 170.6, subdivision (2), states in pertinent part: \u201cWhere the judge, other than a judge assigned to the case for all purposes, court commissioner, or referee assigned to or who is scheduled to try the cause or hear the matter is known at least 10 days before the date set for trial or hearing, the motion shall be made at least five days before that date.\u201d Statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1121-7\"> In fact, the statement appears to have been designed more as a news release. Appearing at the top of the statement are the words \u201cFor Immediate Release .\u201d A telephone number is listed as the \u201cInformation Number for News Media.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1122-10\"> On December 4, 1990, we issued an order notifying the parties that we were considering the issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance. <em>(Palma </em>v. <em>U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 171, 180-181 [203 Cal.Rptr. 626, 681 P.2d 893].) The respondent court filed opposition to the petition on December 11, 1990. The petition for writ of habeas corpus filed by defendant Gonzales on February 15, 1991, does not address the section 170.6 issues raised in the petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
