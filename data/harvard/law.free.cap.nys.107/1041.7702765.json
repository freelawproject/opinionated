The moving papers are extremely meager. The complaint is not printed, and no information is given as to what the action is about, except that the affiant states that he is informed that the action is brought \u201cto set aside various deeds and to obtain possession of the various parcels of land mentioned and described in the complaint, [the plaintiff] alleging that he is the only heir of Mary Petersen, and entitled to said possession of said premises.\u201d The affiant, who claims to be the attorney in fact of Christien Petersen, although he does not present his power of attorney, alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-14\">\u201cThat he is informed and believes that said Mary Petersen left no heirs at law or next of kin her surviving, and that the said Christien Petersen is the only one entitled to the possession of said premises which was held at the time of her death in trust for Ebbe Petersen, her husband.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-15\">He does not give the source of his information, or state what relation, if any, Christien Petersen bore to Ebbe Petersen. Unless we are prepared to say that any one who wishes may be made a party to an action, whether he shows any interest or not, this order must be reversed. So long as Christien Petersen is not a party to the action, he will not be bound by the result, and can institute any action with relation to the subject-matter thereto that he chooses. If there is any reason why he should be brought into this action, he should show what that reason is.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-16\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with leave to renew upon proper papers. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
