We should not be inclined to disturb this judgment, were it not that it appeared upon the trial that the plaintiff was not the sole owner of the injured property. The proof shows that the plaintiff\u2019s son, one Louis Moppar, was a partner with plaintiff, and that the copartnership owned the damaged goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">The pleadings were oral, and consequently the defect of parties could not be taken advantage of by demurrer. As soon as this fact was made to appear upon the trial, the defendants\u2019 counsel moved to amend the answer, setting up a defect of parties plaintiff. This motion was denied. It should have been granted. It affected a substantial right of the defendants, and was in the furtherance of justice. The rule is well settled that, to maintain an action, it must appear that the plaintiff is the only person possessed of any ownership or interest in the demand, so that, on a recovery and subsequent payment, all rights of action in respect thereto will be barred as against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
