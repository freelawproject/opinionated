The respondent also submits the affidavit of the person who served the summons, who testifies positively to the time and place of the service and to his acquaintance with the defendant served. This witness is corroborated by a person who testifies that he was with the person making the service, and heard him address the defendant by his name, and saw him hand him the copy of the summons in this action. The affidavits submitted uphold the respondent\u2019s contention. The appeal must be dismissed, leaving the appellant to apply to the court below to open his default.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-17\">Appeal dismissed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
