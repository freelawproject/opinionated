It appears from the affidavit of the plaintiff that the parties were married on the 14th of July, 1906, and the defendant took the plaintiff home to live with his parents; that there was constant dispute between the plaintiff and her mother-in-law; that the defendant refused to give to the plaintiff any money, and objected to her visiting her own mother; that, the plaintiff having become pregnant, she requested that the defendant would give her sufficient money to enable her to prepare for the birth of their child, which he refused to do upon the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s cousin had died before their child was born; that during this time the defendant\u2019s mother accused the plaintiff of going out with other men, and, when the defendant was appealed to, to protect his wife, he stated that he would believe his mother in preference to the plaintiff. The plaintiff then demanded that the defendant provide a separate home for her, to which the defendant replied that \u201cin Italy the man was the master and the wife must live where the husband wishes,\u201d and that plaintiff would have to live with his parents, and he would\" not provide any separate home; that the plaintiff\u2019s mother had given her $3,000 as a wedding present, which she had placed in the defendant\u2019s custody-in order to start a home for them, but the defendant refused to apply; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>it to that purpose; that the plaintiff then went to her mother, leaving her clothes and wearing apparel with the defendant, and when they were sent for the defendant replied: \u201cYou [plaintiff] have a home with my parents; the door is open, but you cannot take any clothes from here; I am master;\u201d that subsequently the defendant, accompanied by his parents, removed from the state of New York to the state of 'New Jersey, where he now resides, and he has failed and refused to contribute to the plaintiff\u2019s support in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">I think that, if these facts are true, the plaintiff was justified in leaving the defendant\u2019s parents\u2019 house, and that the defendant, in refusing to provide her with a home,' or support her, was guilty of abandonment which justified a judgment of separation. The defendant denies that the plaintiff gave him $3,000 as a wedding present received by the plaintiff from her mother, but admits that on the evening prior to the marriage the defendant received as a wedding gift from the plaintiff\u2019s mother $350, which the defendant alleges he used for a wedding trip. The defendant then says that he is very desirous that the plaintiff should return and live with him, and he is willing and has always been willing to furnish a house separate and apart from his relatives; but he has furnished no such home, and has done nothing, and he does not appear to deny that the plaintiff constantly requested it during the time that she lived with his mother, and that he did not then and has not since that time taken any steps in that direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">The court denied the motion on condition that the defendant, within 10 days after the entry of the order, serve upon the plaintiff or her attorney a written offer to provide a suitable home for the plaintiff and their child. I think that the court should have provided for a reasonable sum for the support of the plaintiff and her child until the action could be tried. There does not seem to be any doubt but that, if the defendant had provided a home for his wife, instead of compelling her to live with his parents, this whole difficulty would have been avoided. I do not think that any woman is compelled to submit to the treatment that she received from the defendant\u2019s parents, if her statement is true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">I think, therefore, that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, requiring the defendant to pay to his wife $6 per week alimony, and $50 counsel fee. All concur, except CLARKE, J., who dissents. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
