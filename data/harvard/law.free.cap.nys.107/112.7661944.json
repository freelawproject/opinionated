Above the authorization was a printed form containing the name of the plaintiff, the particulars of the property, the purchase price at $52,000, and that the annual rental was $5,-325. The proof shows plaintiff\u2019s employment; the rendition of his services at the defendant\u2019s request; that he procured a purchaser ready, able, and willing to buy on defendant\u2019s terms; that the purchaser was accepted; that the sale fell through because of defendant\u2019s misrepresentation as to the rental value of his property, the rent being $264 less than stated in the authorization to sell; and that the services were reasonably worth $495. More than this he was not required to prove. It appears that, although the original purchase price was fixed at $52,000, the defendant subsequently .agreed to sell for $49,500, and to take in exchange as part payment a piece of property owned by the purchaser and valued at $14,000, and the remainder, over and above the mortgages, in cash. Not only were the terms accepted, but the defendant caused contracts in duplicate to be prepared based on such terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The contention of defendant that plaintiff could only recover by producing a purchaser willing to buy at $52,000 is without merit. Southwich v. Swavienski, 114 App. Div. 681, 99 N. Y. Supp. 1079. The refusal of the purchaser to complete because of defendant\u2019s misrepresentations as to the rental value cannot defeat the claim for commissions. Seidman v. Rauner, 51 Misc. Rep. 10, 99 N. Y. Supp. 862; Putter v. Berger, 95 App. Div. 62, 88 N. Y. Supp. 462. Defendant cannot urge his own wrong, and thus deprive the broker of the commissions earned by him. But for his misrepresentation as to the rental, the contract of sale would have been signed. The plaintiff abundantly established that he produced a purchaser ready, willing, and able to buy, and, instead of dismissing the complaint, judgment should have been awarded to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
