Notice was served February 27th, and the hearing was held March 1st. The charge was somewhat lacking in conciseness, but there was no objection at the hearing and no suggestion that the licensee did not understand what it was about, and the record did not disclose that she requested counsel, or an adjournment, or that she was deprived of the rights or privileges claimed on certiorari. <em>Held, </em>that the notice was sufficient to sustain a revocation.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b867-10\">Certiorari by the people, on the relation of Amalia Pechtold, against John Bogart, as commissioner of licenses of the city of New York.

It appears, therefore, that this court, upon a writ of certiorari, is without power to give any substantial relief, even should we reach the conclusion that the relator was not properly deprived of her license. A license which expired by express provisions of the statute on the first Tuesday of May, 1907, could not be given any vitality by an order of this court after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-15\">We are of opinion, however, that the matters urged here have no' substantial basis in fact. The statute requires that the licensed person shall be served with a reasonable notice, not less than one day, of the charges. The notice was served on the 37th day of February, and the hearing was held on the 1st day of March. We think under the provisions of this statute, in the absence of special reasons, this was a reasonable notice. While the charge was lacking, perhaps, in some of the elements of conciseness, there was no objection made to it at the time of the hearing, and there is no suggestion that the relator did not understand what it was about. The record does not disclose that she made any request for counsel, or for an adjournment, or that she was-deprived of any of the rights or privileges which she now claims be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>longed to her. The evidence is sufficient to warrant the exercise of the discretion vested to revoke the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Final order for the defendant, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
