The plaintiff, on the 14th of April, 1905, brought an action in the County Court of Kings county. Issue was joined therein, and the action thereafter came on for trial, which resulted in a dismissal of the complaint, with $107.33 costs and disbursements. Copy of the judgment, with notice of entry, was duly served upon plaintiff\u2019s attorney. No appeal was taken from .the judgment. Subsequently the plaintiff brought this action in the Supreme Court, the venue being laid in the county of New York, to recover upon the same cause of action. A motion was thereupon made to stay the prosecution of this action until the costs of the former action were paid. The motion was denied, and the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The fact is uncontradicted that this action is brought to recover upon the same cause of action upon which a recovery was sought in the former action, in which the plaintiff was unsuccessful, and in which costs were awarded to the defendant, and that such costs have not been paid. It has many times been held that where a plaintiff is unsuccessful in an action, and costs are therein awarded to the defendant, another action to recover upon the same cause of action cannot be maintained until the costs are paid. Ingrosso v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Co., 105 App. Div. 494, 94 N. Y. Supp. 177; Wilner v. Independent Order Ahawas Israel (decided at the November term, and not yet officially reported) 107 N. Y. Supp. 497; Bigelow v. Drummond, 109 App. Div. 132, 95 N. Y. Supp. 1027; Muratore v. Pirkl, 109 App. Div. 146, 95 N. Y. Supp. 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">The order appealed from, therefore, must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
