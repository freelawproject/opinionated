Subsequently he delivered to the secretary of the corporation life insurance policies, directing the secretary to pay defendant out of the proceeds of the policies a certain amount for account of the corporation. After the president\u2019s death, the secretary collected the policies and filed a bill in equity, making plaintiff and defendant parties, and asking that the rights of the parties to the money be determined. <em>Held </em>that, if the checks were forgeries, plaintiff was entitled to recover, that his right to recovery in no way depended on the disposition made of the proceeds of the policies, and hence that an order staying the trial of plaintiff\u2019s action until the determination of the interpleader action in relation to the insurance moneys was not justified.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1079-9\">[Ed.

The defendant claims that it paid out this deposit upon certain checks drawn by the corporation; the plaintiff claiming that one of the signatures to these checks was forged. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>The question at issue in this action is simply as to whether or not the checks upon which this deposit was paid out were or were not forged. It is alleged that Spier, the president of the corporation, received the money and appropriated it, or the greater part of it, to his own use. Subsequently Spier delivered to Alfred Lauterbach, secretary of the corporation, life insurance policies calling for the payment upon his death of $75,000, with a direction to Lauterbach that, upon receipt of the sums due on the policies, he should pay to the defendant, the Guardian Trust Company, for account of the New York Investment &amp; Improvement Company, $68,067.09. Shortly after Spier died Lauterbach collected from the insurance companies $75,999 and filed a bill in equity, making the plaintiff and the defendant parties, asking that the rights to this money of the various parties to the action should be determined. The court below has stayed the trial of this action until the determination of the interpleader action in relation to the insurance moneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">I do not think such an order was justified. The plaintiff as receiver is suing for an amount claimed to be owing from the defendant. The plaintiff has no connection with the proceeds of these policies of life insurance, and, if he can establish the fact that the checks drawn on the defendants were forgeries, he will be entitled to recover the amount of the deposit remaining to the credit of the corporation, disaffirming the payment on account of the forged checks. The right of the plaintiff to recover cannot in any event depend upon the disposition that is made of the proceeds of the life insurance policies. If the checks are forged, he would be entitled to recover the amount on deposit, whether the defendant could collect the insurance money or not. If it should appear that the checks were not forged and that Spier appropriated the money of the corporation, then the corporation might have a claim against Spier and a right to enforce this trust, or whatever it may be said to be, as to the proceeds of the life insurance policies. But, irrespective of the provision as to what shall be done with the insurance money, if the checks are forgeries, the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">It follows that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for a stay denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
