The pleadings were oral, the answer being a general denial. The trial began on August 8, 1906, and the hearing was-adjourned, and it was not resumed again until January 23, 1907. At the close of the trial the court gave judgment for the defendant. Under one section of the .defendant\u2019s by-laws it agrees to pay a sick benefit of $1 per day to a sick member, and he is also entitled to the medical attendance of the society\u2019s physician. It is undisputed that the plaintiff became ill on the 16th day of September, 1905, and that he was unable to perform labor as a carpenter, which was his trade, until October 16, 1905, a period of 28 days. For the first five days he was-attended by a physician called by himself, and from September 21, 1905, until October 6, 1905, the defendant\u2019s' physician attended him. Another section of the by-laws of the defendant requires the association\u2019s physician to leave with the sick member what is termed a. \u201cdiary,\u201d giving the member\u2019s name, nature of the illness, date of each, visit, etc., until there is a complete cure, also requiring a notice to be given to the corresponding secretary of the defendant of the commencement of the illness and its termination.. It seems that upon, presentation of this diary the association pays the sick benefits based upon the duration of the member\u2019s illness as shown therein. On October 6, 1905, the plaintiff, wishing to obtain from the defendant the sick benefits then accrued, asked the defendant\u2019s physician, then attending him, to declare him cured.. The physician demurred to doing so, but finally gave the plaintiff his so-called \u201cdiary\u201d at the end of which he said: \u201cThe member not yet recovered from the disease requests that the diary be closed and that he be declared cured, at his request, this 6th day of October, 1905. Dr. A. Cavallaro.\u201d It does not appear whether or riot the diary was presented to the defendant until after the plaintiff was completely cured. On October 7th, however, the plaintiff again called upon the defendant\u2019s physician, and asked him to continue to treat him. This he refused to do, saying that the plaintiff\u2019s illness was but slight. Thereupon the plaintiff notified the defendant that its physician refused to attend him, asked that a physician should be sent to visit him, and warned the defendant that upon its failure to send a physician that he (plaintiff) would employ one at the-, expense of the association. Nothing came of this notice, and the plaintiff employed the physician first engaged by him, who visited the plaintiff seven times, for which he charged $14. The $1 per diem for 28 days\u2019 sick benefits, less $3, required by the laws of the defendant <em>to </em>remain with the society on deposit in aid of a certain fund, and the-$14 before stated, making $39 in all, constituted the plaintiff\u2019s claim.. The defendant did not seriously dispute the testimony on the part of the plaintiff. It admitted a liability for 16 days at $1 per day, less $3 as above stated, and paid into court the sum of $13, but claimed that the plaintiff was bound by the report of the society\u2019s physician in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>so-called diary and could not collect for illness after October 6th. We cannot adopt this view. The society\u2019s physician in his certificate of October 6th expressly declares that the plaintiff was not cured, and on October 7th he admitted that the plaintiff had a \u201cslight illness.\u201d It was shown without contradiction by the plaintiff\u2019s physician that the plaintiff was wholly unable to perform labor from October 6th to October 16th, inclusive, so that the claim for 28 days\u2019 illness is established. We are also of the opinion that a fair construction of the by-laws of the defendant would render it liable to one o'f its sick members, to whom the services of the society\u2019s physician had been refused, for the reasonable value of the services of a physician procured by the member after notice to and failure of the society\u2019s physician to attend such a sick member.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
