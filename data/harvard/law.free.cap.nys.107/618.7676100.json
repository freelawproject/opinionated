It is uncontradicted, however, that these garments cost the defendants on the first lot $4.50, and on the second lot $3.85, in all $8.35, to complete the work which the plaintiff should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>have done. As to a third lot claimed to have been done by the plaintiff, it appears by his own testimony that he simply took the lot from one shop to another, but was not allowed to do any work upon the same. The judgment rendered was for $55.50 in favor of plaintiff. As the testimony appears, the defendant was entitled to recover but $40.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Judgment modified, by reducing the same to $40.15, with appropriate costs and $5 extra costs in the court below, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
