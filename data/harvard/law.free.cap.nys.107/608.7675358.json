The answer admits a debt amounting to $82. The justice gave judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appeals. At the end of the case the court said, \u201cThe judgment of the court is clearly for the defendant.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then said, \u201cThere is a concession on the record of $82.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel then said, \u201cWe admit $82.\u201d To this admission the court replied, \u201cEighty-two dollars then would be the amount for the plaintiff.\u201d In spite, however, of the admission in the answer and at the trial that defendant owed $82, the court gave judgment for defendant, with $30 costs. The judgment is clearly against the evidence, and must be reversed. The articles in question consisted of a fur coat, muff, and hat made and delivered to the defendant by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor. It is the contention of the defendant that said articles were delivered upon the order of one Semel, and that the transaction fixed no liability upon defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, and that at the time of the alleged assignment to plaintiff the assignor had no claim against the defendant. There is considerable conflict of testimony upon the main issue. Upon another trial the dates of the sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>eral conversations detailed should, if possible, be more definitely fixed, in order that the relation of oral to the documentary testimony may be accurately determined.
