He then called at another address, given in a directory as defendant\u2019s residence, and was told that defendant had moved to the country and would return in September. He called again in September, and was told that defendant had' moved and that his informant did not know where. It appeared from defendant\u2019s affidavit and that of his attorney that he had no residence in, the city after June 27th, that he disposed of his business in June 21st, and returned to his country home. <em>Held, </em>that the affidavits were insufficient to support an order for substituted service, since they did not show that defendant had either a place of business or a residence in the city after a date some time prior to the issuance of the original summons.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b770-14\">4.

Affidavits were presented by the defendant in support of his contention, and also by the plaintiff in opposition, the contents of which affidavits we shall refer to hereafter. The motion was denied, and an order duly entered to that effect. The defendant not appearing further in the action, judgment was subsequently rendered by default against him. From this judgment the defendant appeals, and in his notice of appeal states that he intends to bring up for review the aforesaid order.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Prior to the amendment to section 253 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1562, c. 580) by chapter 304, p. 554, Laws of 1907, which took effect September 1, 1907, there existed no authority in that court to vacate a judgment, or set aside the alleged service of a summons, upon the ground that such summons had never been served. Diehl v. Steele (Sup.) 97 N. Y. Supp. 1024. The amendment referred to has no application to this case. The only remedy given to a defendant, who claimed that he never was served with a summons, was to .appeal from the judgment under the provisions of section 311 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1578, c. 580). So far, then, as the motion made by the defendant to set aside the service of the summons is concerned, his motion should have been dismissed in the court below. A situation similar to this, was presented in the case of Mann v. Meryash (at the November term of this court) 107 N. Y. Supp. 599, and Mr. Justice Bruce, writing the opinion of the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-9\">\u201cThe defendant has, however, appealed from the judgment, and for the purpose of disposing of the appeal we may consider it as having been taken under section 311, supra, and we may consider the affidavits submitted by the defendant in the court below, inasmuch as they form part of the return, as being the proof relied upon by him on this appeal to show nonservice of the summons; and as such affidavits were never served upon plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and as no notice was given him that the defendant intended to rely upon them on this appeal, an opportunity to controvert the allegations contained therein would be given him, if it was deemed necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">That is undoubtedly the proper practice to follow. It is not claimed by the plaintiff in this case that personal service of the summons was ever made upon the appellant, but that jurisdiction was obtained over him by reason of substituted service. The original summons was issued July \u00cd6, 1907. The defendant swears in his affidavit that he\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-11\">\u201chas had no residence in the city of New York since June 27th; that on June 21, 1907, he disposed of all his business interests in this city and returned to Chautauqua county, his former place of residence; and that he vacated his apartments at No. 418 Central Park West on June 27, 1907,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agx\">In this he is fully corroborated by the affidavit of James C. Foley, the defendant\u2019s attorney, who gives at length and in detail all the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>relating to appellant\u2019s change of residence, etc. Opposed to these unqualified statements is that of one Seelig, a clerk in the office of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, who says that he was given the summons and complaint to serve on July 16, 1967; that \u201cthe business address of the defendants Hunt was in the Times Building; that he called there and was informed by the elevator starter that the Hunts had removed, but they did not know where.\u201d He says that he then ascertained, from the directory, that one of the defendants resided at the Braender, No. 418 Central Park West, and upon inquiry there he was told by the hall man that Hunt was in the country and would return in September. Upon calling again in September the hall man said that Hunt had removed, but he did not know where. An order for substituted service based upon these affidavits was made on October 23, 1907.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The statements contained in these affidavits were entirely insufficient upon which to base such an order. Section 32 of the Municipal Court act provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">\u201cAn order for the service of a summons, upon a defendant residing within the city, may be made in the district in which the action is brought,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">There was nothing in the affidavits upon which the order was based showing that the defendant had either a place of business or a residence in the city after a date some time prior to the issuance of the original summons in this action. It is also evident that no further affidavits bearing upon this question could be presented by the defendant that would change the situation. After the return was filed herein, and on the first day of the term, the respondent\u2019s attorney handed up an affidavit, in an attempt, evidently, to strengthen the return. 'This affidavit, even if we could weigh its contents, which we cannot do, has no bearing upon the question at issue. The return, as settled by the justice who tried the case, is conclusive upon this court, and the practice of handing up affidavits, for the purpose of adding to a return, has been emphatically disapproved by this court. Forman v. N. Y. Transportation Co. (Sup.) 95 N. Y. Supp. 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Judgment as to William W. Hunt, as executor, etc., appellant, reversed, and complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
