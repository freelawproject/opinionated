J.</author>\n<p id=\"Art\">The action is brought to recover the sum of $400. Plaintiffs had a contract with one Pollack and one Goodman to do certain work on a building. Pollack and Goodman got into financial troubles, and defendant, according to plaintiffs\u2019 claim, promised that he would pay to plaintiffs all money due or to become due under their contract with said Pollack and Goodman, if plaintiffs, would complete their work to be done under said contract, and plaintiffs claim that they did complete, and earned the $400 which they seek to recover. Defendant puts in issue the claim of the plaintiffs, and sets up the defense of res adjudicata. The\" court below held that a judgment of the Municipal Court, rendered in an action between these plaintiffs, as plaintiffs, and this defendant, said Pollack, said Goodman, and the Ogden Lumber Company, as defendants, was a complete bar to plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action herein, and the court directed a verdict for defendant. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-15\">The action in the' Municipal Court was to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s-lien, and was for the same amount and the same work involved in the case at bar. The Municipal Court gave judgment for the plaintiffs against Pollack and Goodman, for $308.42, and \u201cdismissed as to other defendants\u201d\u2014i. e., the defendant in the case at bar and the Ogden Lumber Company. Unless the complaint was dismissed as to this defendant on the merits, the judgment of the Municipal Court was-no bar to the present action. There is no statement in the judgment roll that the dismissal was on the merits. Section 1209 of the Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>providing that a final judgment dismissing the complaint does not prevent a new action for the same cause of action, unless it expressly declares, or it appears by the judgment roll, that it is rendered upon the merits, has no application to the Municipal Court. Stecher v. Free Sons of Judah, 45 Misc. Rep. 340, 90 N. Y. Supp. 332, 333 (Appellate Term, Bischoif, J.). The question, therefore,- as to whether the judgment of the Municipal Court was or was not upon the merits was a matter for proof in the ordinary course, and the judgment roll was not necessarily conclusive. Stecher v. Sons of Judah, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">It appears from the record that -in the Municipal Court action plaintiffs under an amendment to their complaint at the trial sought to hold this defendant as owner' of the premises and under his promise to pay to plaintiffs the amount due and to become due if plaintiffs would complete the work to be done under their contract with Pollack and Goodman, which is the same ground upon which plaintiffs seek to hold defendant in the case at bar, and at the end of the trial of the Municipal Court action the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">\u201cDoes your honor find there was no contract between plaintiffs and Bachrach [this defendant] ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">To which-the court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">\u201cYes, sir; I shall find as a matter of fact. I do not think you have sufficiently sustained the burden of proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The only evidence which plaintiffs seem to have offered in the Municipal Court action in support of their claim of a contract with Bachrach, whereby they were to finish the job and he was to pay for it, was that of one of the plaintiffs to the effect that Bachrach said: \u201cYou should.continue the work, and I will see to it.\u2019# The Municipal Court justice might very well have reached the conclusion that plaintiffs had not sufficiently sustained the burden of proof, and found as a matter of fact, upon a conflict of proof, that there was no such contract between plaintiffs and Bachrach. The latter swore positively in the Municipal Court action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">\u201cI got somebody else to do this work\u2014Rado Bros. I have paid them for that work. * * * I never had a contract with Cohen and Goldstein [plaintiffs].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">It seems to us that it must be held that the Municipal Court judgment was on the merits, and is a bar to the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
