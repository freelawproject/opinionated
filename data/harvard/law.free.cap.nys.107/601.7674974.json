J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOE\">The facts in this case are substantially as follows: The action is brought to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien. The defendants Hajek (Frank and William), Zahradnik, hereinafter called the \u201cowners,\u201d and one Newberry, a copartner of said owners, made a contract with the defendants Joseph and Josephine Bernascheff, hereinafter called the \u201ccontractors,\u201d to erect a building on certain premises. The contractors fully performed their contract, and at the time the lien of the plaintiff was filed there was due from the owners and Newberry the sum of at least $319. During the progress of the work plaintiff made an agreement with the contractors to paint the building. The painting was a part of the work to 'be done by the contractors. The price to be paid plaintiff therefor was $125, and he fully performed the labor, and, when the lien was filed, that sum was due the plaintiff. The lien was duly filed against the owners and the contractors, and proper service thereof made upon them. The answer admits the ownership of the property in the two Hajeks and Zahradnik, and substantially denies the other allegations of the complaint. The complaint asks for judgment, that plaintiff has acquired a valid lien on the property for $125, and that the interest of the owners be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>sold, and plaintiff\u2019s lien paid out of the proceeds, together with the \u25a0cost and expenses of the sale and of this action, and for such other and further relief as may be just. No demand is made for a personal judgment against any of the defendants. After the case was tried the court rendered the following judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">\u201cThat plaintiff have a valid mechanic\u2019s lien for the sum of $125, with interest from January 25, 1907, at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, against the said property of the defendant Frank Hajek, William Hajek, John Zahradnik, and Harold Newberry, and that the plaintiff have judgment against Frank Hajek, John Zahradnik, and Josephine Bernaseheff for the sum of $125, with interest thereon from the 25th day of January, 1907, at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, besides the costs and disbursements of this action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The judgment then directs a sale of the title and interest of the \u25a0owners in the premises, and the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment out of the proceeds of such sale. It also provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">\u201cIn case of any deficiency arising upon such sale, the plaintiff have a judgment against the said defendants Frank Hajek, John Zahradnik, and Josephine Bernaseheff for such deficiency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The appellants claim that the judgment gives more than is demanded in the complaint, and wrongfully allows a personal judgment against the two owners as well as against one of the contractors. Why the \u25a0defendants William Hajek, Harold Newberry, and Joseph Bernaseheff are not included in the personal judgment does not appear. Municipal Court Act, Laws 1903, p. 1488, c. 580, as amended by Laws 1905, p. 1173, c. 513, \u00a7 1, subd. 11, provides that the Municipal Court shall have jurisdiction in \u201can action to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien on real property, in which the court shall have power to render judgment for the sum \u25a0due, and to declare the amount a valid lien against the interest of the defendant in the property described in the complaint, at the time of the filing of the lien, where the amount does not exceed $500 exclusive of interest and costs; but said court cannot render judgment for the foreclosure and sale of the property.\u201d See, also, Drall v. Gordon, 51 Misc. Rep. 618, 101 N. Y. Supp. 171. Section 3399 of the Code provides that a mechanic\u2019s lien can be enforced against the property and \u25a0\u201cagainst a person liable for the debt upon which the lien is founded.\u201d Section 3413 of the Code provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">\u201cIf the lienor shall fail, for any reason, to establish a valid lien in an action under the provisions of this title, he may recover judgment therein for such sums as are due him, or which he might recover in an action on a contract, against any party to the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">In order, however, to base a personal judgment under these sections -of the Code against any defendant, the complaint must allege facts which establish the liability of the defendant against whom such a judgment is sought, and personal judgment must be demanded in the complaint against such defendant. Kane v. Hutkoff, 81 App. Div. 110, 81 N. Y. Supp. 85. As there was no contract between plaintiff and the owners, they personally owed him nothing, and therefore no personal judgment against them could be obtained. Siegel v. Ehrshowsky, 46 Misc. Rep. 605, 92 N. Y. Supp. 733. As the owners owed the -contractors $319 and the contractors owed plaintiff $135, plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>remedy against the owners was a sale, under an execution, of their interest in the premises, to the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, which sum-the owners could then offset against the claim of the contractors against them. Had the owners, however, in good faith and without collusion paid the contractors the full contract price, they would not he liable to the plaintiff for the amount due him from the contractors. De Lorenzo v. Von Raitz, 44 App. Div. 329, 60 N. Y. Supp. 736; Droll v. Gordon, supra; and cases cited. The Municipal Court is limited to the rendering of a simple money judgment against the defendant to be enforced' by an execution authorizing a sale of the interest which the judgment debtor had in the property at the time the lien was filed. Droll v. Gordon, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The judgment must be modified by striking out the personal judgment as to all of the defendants, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
