When the note 'became due Aronowsky gave the defendants his check upon the plaintiff bank, where he kept an account under the name of the Empire Belt &amp; Purse Company, for $1,000 to take up the note. The defendants indorsed this check, and delivered it to the German Exchange Bank. It reached the plaintiff bank through the clearing house on March 10, 1903, at about 11:30 a. m. Devlin, plaintiff\u2019s cashier, finding that Aronowsky did not have sufficient funds to meet the check, sent word to Aronowsky\u2019s place of business of the receipt of the check and the condition of his account. Devlin testified that shortly afterwards one Eiebowitz, a bookkeeper of the defendants, came to the bank and stated that the defendants were very anxious to have the check paid \u201cbecause they did not wish it to come back to their bank,\u201d and promised that if the plaintiff would honor the check the defendants would within a day or two procure the assignment to the plaintiff of certain outstanding accounts due Aronowsky, the payment of which the defendants would guarantee. Devlin, after consulting with Radt, the vice president of the plaintiff, told Eiebowitz that if he would bring before <em>2 </em>p. m. what the plaintiff considered satisfactory accounts, it would pay the check. He returned before <em>2 </em>p. m. with a number of \u201cbills and shipping receipts,\u201d .which he delivered to the cashier, and after they had been examined the check was paid. Eiebowitz stated that Aronowsky was ill, and that they could not then get his signature to malee the proper assignment of the accounts, but that the plaintiff need not worry as the defendants were behind it, and that as soon as Aronowsky was better- they would procure \u201chis signature to the accounts.\u201d This was never done. Aronowsky later repudiated the whole transaction, and said that he had never authorized it, that it was all the work of the defendants, and\" that the plaintiff bank must look to them. He collected the accounts, and later went into bankruptcy. He continued his account with the plaintiff until April, 1, 1903. After March 10th it was continuously overdrawn. On the 16th the overdraft was reduced to $181.99, but when the account was closed on April 1st. it .amounted to $908, for which amount the plaintiff obtained judgment below. The plaintiff subsequently brought suit against Aronowsky to recover the balance, but Aronowsky went into bankruptcy and the action was abandoned. Devlin, the cashier, was corroborated by Radt, the vice president. Eiebowitz, however, contradicted both as to what occurred at the time the check was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">The principal defense relied upon by the defendants was that the \u201cagreement, promise, or undertaking\u201d of the defendants, if there was any, \u201cis a special promise to answer for the debt, default, or miscar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>riage of another person,\u201d and therefore void under the statute of frauds. The trial justice decided that this was an original undertaking of the defendants, and I think his decision was correct. Aronowsky received no benefit from the honoring of the check, except a substitution of creditors. If the check had not been honored, he would have been indebted to these defendants. By the honoring of the check, he became indebted to the plaintiff. All the benefit of the transaction accrued to the defendants. Furthermore, the undertaking of the defendants was not to make good the $1,000 if Aronowslcy did not, but was to procure the assignment to the plaintiff of certain accounts due to Aronowslcy, and to guarantee these accounts, and in the event that they failed to do this, to pay the amount of the check. Aronowslcy was not obligated to assign the accounts, even if the bank did honor his check. In that event his obligation was to pay $1,000, an entirely different thing. \u201cIt is well settled that promises which are in form collateral are, in reality, original, when founded upon a new and independent consideration, and when the promisor receives the benefit and will be held to be so construed.\u201d Wysong v. Meyer, 58 App. Div. 422, 426, 69 N. Y. Supp. 286; Raabe v. Squier, 148 N. Y. 81, 42 N. E. 516; Clark v. Howard, 150 N. Y. 232, 44 N. E. 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The court submitted to the jury the question whether or not Eiebowitz was the duly authorized-agent of the defendants in the transaction, and'also whether or not mis money was advanced by the plaintiff upon the undertaking of the defendants that these accounts would be assigned to the bank by Aronowsky within a few days. The jury determined each of these questions in the affirmative. The appellants urge that the delivery of the accounts constituted an assignment thereof. There is, however, no evidence tending to show that Aronowsky at the time either authorized or had knowledge of their delivery. On the other hand, he later told to the plaintiff\u2019s cashier that the transaction was wholly without his knowledge, and was altogether that of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
