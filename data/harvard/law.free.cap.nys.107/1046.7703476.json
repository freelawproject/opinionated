The defendant served upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney an instrument whereby he offered \u201cto the plaintiff, Mary P. Mossa, to provide a suitable home for her and our child, and shall, upon the acceptance of such offer by her, forthwith proceed to furnish said home, and shall provide for the maintenance of plaintiff therein.\u201d That was returned by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney upon the ground that it was impossible for the plaintiff to determine the location of the home offered, or whether the same \u201cis in any wise suitable for her habitation,\u201d whereupon the defendant made a motion to compel the plaintiff and her attorney to receive the offer to provide a home, and it was ordered that the plaintiff or her attorney receive the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">I do not think there was any authority for this order. The original order did not require the plaintiff to receive an offer. It only denied the motion on condition that the defendant served one. The result was that, if this offer was a compliance with the condition of the order, the motion stood denied. The offer was indefinite. No home was designated. It was a simple renewal of the offer that had been made in the affidavit to provide what the defendant was pleased to call a suitable home. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-11\">As upon the appeal from the order denying the motion for alimony we have reversed the order, this order should follow the same course and be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied. All concur, except CLARKE, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
