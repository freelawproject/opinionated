The defense is the breach of an implied warranty that the pipe in question, being a manufactured article, should be merchantable and reasonably adapted to the use for which it was intended, to wit, the carrying of water under high pressure for the purpose of furnishing power for what are known as hydro-electric installations in the republic of Mexico. The defendant in its answer admits the sale of the merchandise in question, but sets up, as and by way of offset or counterclaim, that the defendant was compelled to lay out and expend large sums of money on the alteration and repair of the pipe and its accessories in order to make the same, as far as possible, answer the purpose for which it was intended, and in replacing large portions thereof with new pipe where the pipe was \u00a1bo imperfect as to make it impossible to make th\u00e9 same water-tight; that the said defendant was thereby greatly hindered and delayed in the carrying out of contracts for the purpose of which said pipe and accessories had been ordered, all to the damage of the defendant in the sum of $11,500, which said sum the defendant offsets and counterclaims against the alleged cause of action in the complaint set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">There were two kinds of pipe contracted for\u2014a flanged pipe for the bulk of the installments, and a slip-joint pipe for an installation known as the \u201cSan Miguel.\u201d So far as the flanged pipe is concerned we are satisfied with the conclusion of the learned referee. A different question is presented in regard to the slip-joint pipe. The contract provides that the pipe should be delivered f. o. b. in New York, and the directions were to deliver on lighters alongside the ship. The defendants testified that they sold the pipe to a certain Mexican concern, and delivery to it was made by the transfer of the bill of lading, so that delivery to the defendants and delivery by them to their vendee was a simultaneous act. Mr. Doswell, an employ\u00e9 of the defendant, sent by them from time to time to inspect the pipe, examined the pipe for the San Miguel line on the lighter alongside the Southern Pacific steamship dock. He observed that the slip joints were not made in a proper manner, that the plates w\u00e9re not sheared parallel with the rivets, that too much lap was left on them, and his impression was that, with the way the slip joints were made, it would not be possible to make a tight joint of the pipe. He reported the condition of the pipe to Mr. Kunze, the manager of the defendant, and subsequently made a second inspection with Mr. Tic\u00e9r, the sales agent of the plaintiff\u2019s assignors. Mr. Kunze testified that, when Ticer returned after looking at the pipe with Doswell:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">\u201cHe said that Doswell had greatly exaggerated the situation; that the pipe, while It was a rough job, was all right; to go ahead and ship it He said he was confident we would have no trouble. * * * I said: \u2018Very well; we will do so, but if there Is any trouble you will have to make good.\u2019 He said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>there would be no trouble. The pipe was all right. He requested me to go ahead and ship the pipe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Ticer testified that he received a letter from Kunze, written on September 13, 1899, giving him Boswell\u2019s report on the pipe, and thereafter examined it himself. Ticer wrote to plaintiff\u2019s assignors September 16, 1899, in regard to this pipe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">\u201cThis pipe is not a good job by any means. * * * I must say that your interests will suffer greatly it you are not here Monday morning to examine this pipe before shipment. I feel sure that many claims will result, and that Pelton will not pay you in full for this job until they have gotten settlement out of their customer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">He wrote again on September 18th:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">\u201cI have already told you the condition that I found the pipe in on personal examination of it, and I have found nothing more to add. I have arranged with Pelton to ship it forward, and when it reaches destination Mr. Kunze will be down there himself, and if the work is not right will notify you, and you must make it so, or he will be obliged to do it at your expense. * * * Now that is all that there is in Mr. Kunze\u2019s contention in the matter, and he would be glad to have the pipe go through without any trouble <em>-r </em>but if it does not, and defective workmanship is clearly demonstrated, what can he do but to look to you to make it right? Such will undoubtedly be his course of action in the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">It seems to me that, taking all of this testimony together, there was a waiver of acceptance upon delivery, and that the time for inspection was postponed until the pipe should arrive in Mexico. After it reached Mexico there were renewed complaints of the condition of this pipe. On December 4, 1899, Ticer telegraphed: \u201cCustomer rejected 1474\u201d\u2014the San Miguel job. On December 5, 1899, plaintiff\u2019s assignor wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-9\">\u201cIf the pipe is not yet in position, they have no way of telling what the leaks will amount to. * * * For a man to go on the ground as their superintendent has and condemn work without trying it is not very great proof of his supposed experience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Thereafter Mr. Porter, of Carroll-Porter Company, plaintiff\u2019s assignor, went personally to Mexico with an employ\u00e9 and worked for some time installing this line. While he was there plaintiff\u2019s assignors wrote to defendant January 5,1900:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-11\">\u201cThere is no question in our mind but that this pipe will be made perfectly satisfactory, and we can guarantee such results. Such being the case, coupled with the fact that we are making shipments on your other contracts right along, we would ask that you as early as possible send us, if not settlement for old accounts, an amount which would be equivalent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">The line never did hold water. New material had to be bought and substituted to some' extent; and the defendants, in making the line good, expended various sums of money. The referee has found that the difference between the value of the San Miguel line as it was and as it would have been if said defects had not existed was $1,121.02. It seems to me, taking all the facts together, that the plaintiff\u2019s assignors waived acceptance upon delivery in New York, and postponed inspection, and insisted upon actual installation of the line, and that under these circumstances they are estopped from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>claiming that the implied warranty of a manufacturer did not survive delivery in this port upon the lighter, and are likewise estopped from insisting upon a tender back of the pipe line, which they required should be actually installed in Mexico before they would admit that proper inspection was possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Under the facts as here developed, the judgment should be modified, by reducing the amount thereof by $1,121.02, the sum found by the referee, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
