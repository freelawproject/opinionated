In order to establish its defense the defendant introduced in evidence over the plaintiff\u2019s objection two letters, written by the Beck Company to the plaintiff, containing statements which tended to negative the plaintiff\u2019s claim. These declarations, made by a total stranger to the action, were in no way binding upon the plaintiff, and the letters should have been excluded. While the effect of these letters upon the result is problematical, it was sufficiently prejudicial to the plaintiff\u2019s case to call for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Judgment reversed, and' new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.
