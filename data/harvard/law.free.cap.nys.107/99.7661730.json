This doorway led to the cellar, and the plaintiff fell down the stairs and was injured. The only evidence of the defendants\u2019 negligence lies in the mere statement that the hallway was dark. The plaintiff had visited the premises the week preceding the accident, and-had selected an apartment for her daughter on the southerly side of the hall. The entrance to this apartment was on the right, and the entr\u00e1nce to the northerly apartment was on the left, of the cellar door. The conditions as to light were practically the same as to the-three doors. The cellar door opened into the hallway. The plain\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>tiff, apparently taking no precautions against accident, opened this door and walked through into the darkness of the stairway. Under these circumstances she cannot charge the defendant with negligence. He was not an insurer of th\u00e9 plaintiff\u2019s safety, and the mere fact that the hallway was dark, or that the cellar door was not locked,- will not support a finding of negligence. Robinson v. Crimmins (Sup.) 104 N. Y. Supp. 1076; Hilsenbeck v. Guhring, 131 N. Y. 674, 30 N. E. 580. There is no presumption that a person can walk through any door he comes to .in a strange house without taking proper precautionary measures. The proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s accident seems to have been her own carelessness. The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
