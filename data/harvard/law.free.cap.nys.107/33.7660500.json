The plaintiffs detailed the- services rendered by them and' recovered a judgment in the sum of $250. We think the value of the services has been overestimated and that $75 would be fair compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">The judgment will be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs-to appellant to abide the event, unless the plaintiffs stipulate to reduce the judgment to the sum of $75, in which event the judgment, as-reduced, will be affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
