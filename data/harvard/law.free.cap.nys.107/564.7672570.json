Appellant contends that the transcript was competent evidence under sections 952 and 953 of the Code, which provide that a copy of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>record or other judicial proceeding of a court of a foreign country is evidence, when authenticated by the attestation of the clerk of the court with the seal of the court affixed, or of the officer _ in whose custody the record is legally kept, under the seal of his office. In Trebilcox v. McAlpine, 46 Hun, 469-471, it is held \u201cthat sections <em>952 </em>and 953 of the Code of Civil Procedure relate only to the authentication of copies of records, etc., of courts of foreign countries. The Code contains no provision as to the records of courts of other_ states in this country. Provisions for these are contained in the Constitution and statutes of the United States.\u201d Section 1, art. 4, Const. U. S., provides : \u201cPull faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every other state,\u201d and section 905 of the United States statutes [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 677] provides the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The record offered in evidence by plaintiff would be competent evidence, if authenticated in the manner provided by the United States statute, but it has not been so authenticated. The statute provides that the record or judicial proceeding shall be proved \u201cby the attestation of the clerk and the seal of the court annexed, if there be a seal, together with a certificate of the judge, chief justice, or presiding magistrate that the attestation is in due form.\u201d The action in New Jersey, as appears from the record, was brought in a \u201ccourt for the trial of small causes,\u201d and tried before a justice of the peace, and the judgment roll was certified by said justice. But the clerk\u2019s certificate is made by the county clerk of the county of Monmouth, not by the clerk of the trial court, the seal attached is the seal of the common pleas court, and the certificate of the justice of the common pleas court is solely to the effect that the attestation is in due form and that the signature of said county clerk is genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">No statute of the state of New Jersey was introduced in any way connecting the common pleas court or. the justice thereof or the county clerk with the proceedings in the \u201ccourt for the trial of small causes,\u201d or with proceedings before a justice of the peace. The United States statute contemplates a certificate by the clerk of the court in which the action was tried, and a certificate by the judge of such court that the attestation is in due form.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In the absence of such authentication, the record was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Judgment affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
