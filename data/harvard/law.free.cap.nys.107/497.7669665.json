Issue was joined, but when the action came on for trial plaintiff did not appear, and the complaint was dismissed on defendant\u2019s motion, with $32.41 costs. No motion was made, so far as appears, to open the default, nor were the costs paid. Subsequently this action was brought to recover upon the same cause of action. Thereupon defendant moved to stay the prosecution of this action until the costs of the prior action were paid. The motion was denied and defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">Where the costs of a motion in an action are directed to be paid, all proceedings on the part, of the party required to pay the same\u2014 except to review or vacate the order\u2014are stayed without further direction of the court, until the payment thereof. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 779. This court has held that the same rule should 'be applied to the payment of costs in an action where another action is commenced between the same parties to recover upon the same cause of action. Ingrosso v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Co., 105 App. Div. 494, 94 N. Y. Supp. 177. This seems to be the general rule (Cuyler v. Vanderwerk, 1 Johns. Cas. 247; Perkins v. Hinman, 19 Johns. 237; Edwards v. Ninth Ave. R. R. Co., 22 How. Prac. 444; Richards v. White, 27 How. Prac. 155; Spaulding v. American Wood Board Co., 58 App. Div. 315, 68 N. Y. Supp. 945; Barton v. Speis, 73 N. Y. 133), and it will be enforced unless special facts are presented which indicate that an exception ought to be made. The fact that a person is pecuniarily unable to pay the costs of the prior action is not an excuse sufficient to bring the case within the exception. The reason for this rule is a wholesome one. It has for its basis the fact that, where a party has successfully defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>ed a prior action, he ought not to be put to the trouble and expense of defending another action predicated upon the same cause of action* until he has been paid the costs awarded to him by the court in the action first commenced. Provision is made in the statute how a person who is pecuniarily unable to prosecute an action may do so as a poor person. Here, it does not appear, except by an allegation of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, which is made upon information and belief, that the plaintiff is pecuniarily unable to pay the costs of the former action. No affidavit is presented, nor is. any excuse given by her why she has not paid such costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The order appealed from, therefore, must be reversed, with $19 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10. costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
