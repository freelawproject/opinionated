Thereafter, and on November 19th, defendant sent an order for the goods specified, upon which order was also written the words: \u201cShipment: Earliest possible.\u201d The order was accepted, and part of the pipe was shipped on November 27, 1906, and defendant paid for the same. The balance of the pipe, comprising the greater portion of the order and many items beside the exception above mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s letter of October 27th, was not shipped from plaintiff\u2019s factory until December 28, 1906, 31 days* after the shipment of the first car load of goods, and -39 days after the giving of the order. On account of this long delay defendant claims to have obtained the articles elsewhere and refused to accept the shipment from plaintiff or to pay for the pipe. It notified plaintiff by telegram on December 26th, two days before the pipe was sent from plaintiff\u2019s factory, that it would not accept delivery after such delay. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>This telegram, however, was signed by one Van Alstyne without prefixing the name of defendant, and plaintiff\u2019s agents claimed they did mot know Van Alstyne was the representative of defendant. The plaintiff brought this action to recover the price of the pipe in the second shipment, and the court gave judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\">When a specified date for delivery is mentioned in the contract, the goods must be delivered on that day, and in case of failure the purchaser may usually refuse to accept a subsequent tender; and in ordinary cases of sales, where no specific time for delivery is mentioned in the contract, delivery must be made within a reasonable time after the making of the contract. What constitutes a reasonable time usually depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, such as the parties may be supposed to have contemplated in a general way when making the contract. Eppens v. Littlejohn, 164 N. Y. 191, 58 N. E. 19, <em>52 </em>L. R. A. 811. The requirement of defendant that t\u00edre shipment of the goods should be the \u201cearliest possible\u201d must be construed as meaning that the goods should be sent as soon as plaintiff could possibly send them, and signified rather more than that the goods should be sent within a reasonable time. It was what may be called a \u201churry order.\u201d Is there anything to indicate that it was in the contemplation of the parties, at the time of making the contract, that unless the goods were sent before December 29, 1906, the defendant was to be at liberty to refuse acceptance, and was the delay of 39 days an unreasonable one? We should be inclined to hold that defendant\u2019s request in the first instance for a statement of the time of the \u201cearliest possible delivery,\u201d and plaintiff\u2019s reply that it had all the articles on hand with one exception, and that it \u201ccould make immediate delivery on receipt of order,\u201d together with defendant\u2019s request in the order itself that the shipment should be the \u201cearliest possible,\u201d made it clear that it was contemplated by the parties in making the contract that all possible haste in delivery was to be an element of said contract, and that, in view of - such understanding, a delay of 39 days was an unreasonable one, were it not for certain qualifying circumstances. On the letter head of the plaintiff\u2019s letter of October 27, 1906, conspicuously appeared the words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\">\u201cQuotations are for prompt acceptance. Shipments are subject to strikes, accidents, car supply, and delays beyond our control.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">After waiting a few days to hear again from defendant, plaintiff sent a representative to defendant to urge defendant to give the order, and stated to defendant\u2019s representative that it was necessary for plaintiff to have-the order at once if defendant wanted a quick delivery, that there was a car shortage' that was increasing, and that it would be difficult for defendant to get its goods as quickly as it might want them. After calling, several times in vain, plaintiff\u2019s representative abandoned his efforts to secure the order. Defendant waited until November 19th before giving the order, with full notice that delay in giving the order might result in considerable delay in receiving the goods after the order had been given, and that plaintiff\u2019s quotations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>in its letter of October 27th were \u201cfor prompt acceptance,\u201d and that \"shipments were subject to strikes, accidents, car supply, and delays beyond plaintiff\u2019s control.\u201d It will, therefore, be seen that defendant has been guilty of delay, as well as plaintiff. That plaintiff, on receiving the order, nearly a month after its letter of October 27th, had ceased to have all the articles, with one exception, on hand, and that it could no longer make shipment immediately, is apparent from plaintiff\u2019s undenied inability to get the goods ready and ship the same. There is nothing to indicate that plaintiff had received any intimation that defendant intended to cancel the contract for the failure of plaintiff to malee a prompt or immediate delivery, until the goods had actually been sent and tendered to defendant on or about December 28th, except the telegram of December 26th, signed by one Van Alstyne, who was unknown to plaintiff, and whom plaintiff was unable to connect with defendant, the American Locomotive Company. Under the circumstances indicated we are inclined to the opinion that the evidence does not support defendant\u2019s contention that the delay in sending the goods justified a cancellation by defendant of the contract of purchase and sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The errors presented on rulings upon the evidence are not of such a serious character as to require a reversal. The price of the goods was fixed in the contract at 83 per cent, discount from the regular list price, less freight to Dunkirk, less 2 per cent, if paid in 15 days. No list of prices was put in evidence, nor was any testimony given as to what the list price was, except the general statement of one Lowenthal, an agent of plaintiff, who said he was entirely familiar with the class of goods in question, and that the lowest net price of the goods on the car sent to defendant was $122.64, and that the freight to Dunkirk was $21.60, making $101.04, for which sum, with interest and costs, judgment was given in favor of plaintiff. Although this witness has not actually seen the goods on the car, the quantity and class of those goods are undisputed, and his statement of the net price is evidently taken by making the contract deductions from the price list. If his evidence was too indefinite to satisfy defendant\u2019s counsel, he could have gone into further detail on the cross-examination; but he did not see fit to do so. While this evidence is open to criticism, we do not think, under all the circumstances of the case, that there was insufficient proof of the agreed price to sustain the finding of the court below in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
