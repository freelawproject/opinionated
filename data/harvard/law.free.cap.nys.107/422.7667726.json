The defendant did not refuse performance, but the plaintiff claims the right to recover on the ground that the contract was not sufficiently expressed in writing to satisfy the statute of frauds. But this is wholly irrelevant. It is only the vendor who can raise that question. Even if the contract be oral, the vendee has to carry it out or. forfeit the amount which he has paid, on a tender of performance by the vendor. The statute only requires that the contract of sale be reduced to writing and signed by the vendor; the vendee does not need to sign it.
