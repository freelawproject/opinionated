There were bowls and faucets at the top of the fountain, and drinking cups chained there. It is impossible to make out from the testimony of the plaintiff and her daughter whether they say she slipped on water or on grease or some slimy substance; and they were the only witnesses for the plaintiff on that head. The plaintiff said she looked at the floor after she fell, and continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-19\">\u201cIt was wet, and there was dirt\u2014something slimy on it.\u201d \u201cAfter I fell I saw a wet spot or something of that sort.\u201d \u201cI do not think I could tell ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>actly how large was the wet spot.\u201d \u201cAfter I had fallen I saw there was something wet and slimy on that floor. I cannot tell you how large was that spot where I say looked wet; It was a run lengthwise, just where my heel had taken the water.\u201d \u201cI cannot recollect; all I can recollect is seeing the mark of my heel on the wet floor, the impression where I had fallen; that is all I can remember. I do not mean to say this floor was all wet all around there. I cannot exactly say how large was this place where I say was wet; I would only have to guess at it\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">She said the mark made by her heel was about as long as the back of a chair (agreed upon by counsel as 16 inches) and as wide as her heel. \u201cAside from that mark I could not say how large a place was it that was wet on that floor, because I do not recollect. I have no recollection only of looking and seeing the mark's and the water, but I could not specify the length of it or the largeness of the spot.\u201d \u201cIt was like slime\u2014something slimy that I had slid on the same as you would slide on a banana peel.\u201d \u201cIt looked just like grease or something that slid and made a ridge right into the wood; just like slime, water on the dirt.\u201d The daughter is equally indefinite. \u201cThere was water, and it was slimy\u2014you know how oil looks.\u201d \u201cThere was a large sized puddle, I should say there, of water, and she slid, you could see just where her heel went.\u201d \u201cWell, it looked dirty looking to me.\u201d She finally said the \u201cpuddle\u201d was \u201cjust about as large as that book\u201d, (a volume of our Reports).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">No jury could do more than guess from this what the plaintiff slipped on, if she slipped at all. But if it could be found to be grease, or fruit, or some other slimy or slippery substance, there was no evidence that the defendants put it there, or that it had been there long enough for them to see it and clean it up. There is no way to prevent people, especially children, from dropping things' on floors. And if it was only water, the case is the same. There is no evidence that it came from the fountain. And it could not have come from there unless some one threw it on the floor needlessly or mischievously. It would be more reasonable to suppose that some child wet the floor, a thing common enough. Nor was a little water <em>on </em>a floor ever taken to be dangerous until this action was brought. V On wet days, and when there is a snow fall, the floors of stores and public places are wet in many places from the feet and dripping garments and umbrellas. It would be going altogether too far, and encouraging the bringing of cases like this, of which there are already too many, to hold as matter of law that this case was for the jury. O\u2019Reilly v. L. I. R. Co., 4 App. Div. 139, 38 N. Y. Supp. 779; Id., 15 App. Div. 79, 44 N. Y. Supp. 264; Kelly v. Otterstedt, 80 App. Div. 398, 80 N. Y. Supp. 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">MIDLER and RICH, JJ., concur. HIRSCHBERG, P. J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b134-14\">HOOKER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqnS\">(dissenting). The jury would have been justified in finding, had the case been submitted for its determination, that the plaintiff slipped upon a spot near a water fountain on the main floor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>of the defendants\u2019 department store, which had the appearance of being wet and slimy. The public was tacitly invited to walk over the spot where plaintiff fell, and it was the duty of the_ defendants-to exercise reasonable care to keep the floor in a safe condition. Quirk v. Siegel-Cooper Co., 43 App. Div. 464, 60 N. Y. Supp. 228; Graham v. Bauland Co., 97 App. Div. 141, 89 N. Y. Supp. 595. While it may be true, as urged by the respondents, that the mere incidental spilling of water from the fountain upon the floor would not create a condition which a reasonable person would apprehend to be dangerous, the inferences most favorable to the plaintiff present a different case. The jury were authorized to find that the defendants were not in the exercise of reasonable care in permitting that part of the floor where plaintiff fell to be in a slimy condition, for one might readily enough-slip thereon. See Dent v. Grimm, 65 App. Div. 81, 72 N. Y. Supp. 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
