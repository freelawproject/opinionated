The plaintiff claims that he aided the defendants in the negotiations which resulted in the sale, and that under the custom of the trade he was entitled to one-half of the commission. The defendants deny the rendition by the plaintiff of any service, and claim that under the custom of the trade, where two brokers work jointly in a transaction which results in a sale, a division of the commission is usually made, but not necessarily in equal shares; the division being governed by the special circumstances attending the transaction. The issu\u00e9s were submitted to the jury in a charge to which no exception was taken; hence the alleged errors cannot be considered. The jury allowed plaintiff $475 damages. This amount is excessive, as the undisputed evidence is that defendants received as the entire commission only $500, and, even if the custom contended for by the plaintiff prevails, he is not entitled to more than one-half of that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
