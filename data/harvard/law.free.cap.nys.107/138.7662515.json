Halsted, 106 N. X. Supp. \u2014. The defendant Hotchkiss and William McMutrie Speer were both members of the constitutional convention which met in Albany in 1894. Speer was at that time the vice president of the plaintiff company. Both Hotchkiss and Speer were attorneys at law, although Speer was not at that time practicing the profession. In a conversation during the summer of 1894 Hotchkiss told Speer that he had a large case that was to be printed, and \u201cthat he was personally interested to have it done cheap and wanted to know what price.\u201d Other conversations followed about the size of the case and the price of the printing of it. It was agreed that the plaintiff company would print the case for 70 cents per page. Thereafter the case was sent to the Argus Company and was printed by them. The total cost of the printing amounted to $1,207. Of this $950 had been paid by the plaintiff in the case which was printed, to wit, Charles S. Halsted. The defendants were counsel, but not attorneys, for the defendant in the case of Halsted v. Halsted, which was an action for divorce. In the trial court the plaintiff recovered judgment for the balance of the bill remaining unpaid. From the judgment entered upon the verdict of the jury, and from an order denying the defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial, this appeal has been taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b175-5\">Argued before SMITH, P.

Bonynge v. Field, 81 N. Y. 159; Judson v. Gray, 11 N. Y. 408-411; Covell v. Hart, 14 Hun, 252; Middledith Co. v. College of Dentistry, 31 Misc. Rep. 259, 64 N. Y. Supp. 140; Tyrrel v. Hammerstein, 33 Misc. Rep. 505, 67 N. Y. Supp. 717. Whether or not at the time of the making of the contract for the printing of the case \u2022defendant Hotchkiss revealed to Mr. Speer the nature of the case and the nature of his interest therein, when the case was sent to the printer it was a fair notice that the action was one for divorce, a purely personal action, in which the defendants could only be interested as attorneys or counsel. It was not a case involving property rights, in-which the defendants might have a property interest which would make probable their entering into a personal obligation for the payment of these fees. Mr. Speer must have known, as all lawyers know, that in this class of cases usually the husband provides for the expenses of the litigation on behalf of the wife. In case of failure by the husband to pay the same, neither the attorney nor the counsel of the wife incurs any personal liability for the expenses of a lawsuit, unless by special contract. The question is not only what, in fact, Mr. Speer understood from the conversation with Mr. Hotchkiss, but what inferences he had the natural right to draw therefrom, considering the fact, as it appeared to him when the copy was furnished him, that the action in which the papers were to be printed was purely a personal action between third parties for divorce. The mere procurement of the printing of a case by counsel certainly does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>create personal liability. Nor can the statement by Hotchkiss of a. personal interest that the work be done cheaply be construed to be a special promise to pay a debt for which he would not otherwise be liable. I am unable to find any words which would import any intention on the part of Hotchkiss, and certainly not on the part of Maddox, to be personally liable for this debt. The judgment seems tome, therefore, wholly unsupported by the evidence, and, with the order, should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to-appellant to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">SEWELL, J., concurs.
