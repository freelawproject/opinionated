Section 2281 of the Code, however, provides that, where the failure to obey such an order was \u201ccalculated to,\u201d or did actually, defeat, impair, impede, or prejudice the rights or remedies of a party to an action, the court may impose a fine, and the authorities hold that such fine may be imposed irrespective of whether actual damage is proven. Swenarton v. Shupe, 40 Hun, 41; Moffat v. Herman, 116 N. Y. 131, 22 N. E. 287. The mere fact that a fine imposed happens to be identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>cal with the amount of the judgment in favor \u00f3f the judgment creditor would not be ground for reversal of the order. The statute is remedial in character, and certainly was intended to preserve and promote \u201cthe rights or remedies of a party to an action,\u201d so that it necessarily follows that a failure to comply with an order based thereon is \u201ccalculated to\u201d defeat, impair, impede, or prejudice such rights. The more serious point, however, is that raised by point 1. of defendant\u2019s brief, that the judgment debtor was not guilty of contempt for the reason that he was not given a reasonable opportunity to appear for examination. It appears by the affidavit of the attorney for the judgment creditor submitted in support of the motion that said attorney and the judgment debtor, subsequent to the issuance of the order in supplementary proceedings, had a conversation over the telephone, at the termination of which said attorney \u201ctold judgment debtor that he would hold the matter for 30 days, as he had promised, in order to give him an opportunity to arrange his matters so as to-pay this judgment.\u201d The attprney denies that he agreed to call the matter off as claimed by the judgment debtor; but it is impossible to place any other construction upon the language admitted to have been used by the creditor\u2019s attorney than that it was intended that the requirement of the order should not be insisted upon for 30 days, and that the attprney waived the right to make such examination on the return day of the order. Judgment had been entered and execution issued, and there appears to have been no other matter to \u201chold off,\u201d save the examination in supplementary proceedings. The only other construction that might be placed upon the language so used would indicate an intent on the part of the attorney to enter a default and hold the order of the court over the head of the debtor in order to compel the fulfillment by him of an agreement entered into subsequent to the issuance of the order, an abuse of the process of the court which would be deserving of condemnation and censure.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
