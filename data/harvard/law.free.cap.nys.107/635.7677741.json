The case was tried and a verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff on April <em>24, 1907. </em>The defendant thereupon made a motion to set aside the verdict, which motion was denied. Subsequently, and on May 2; 1907, the defendant made a motion for a reargument of the motion theretofore made to set aside the verdict, and the court granted said motion, and on May <em>7, </em>1907, an order was entered setting aside the verdict and vacating the judgment, and the case was set down for trial on May 22, 1907, upon payment of the sum of $10 costs to the plaintiff within 10 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-21\">Upon the hearing of the motion for reargument, the plaintiff urged that more than 5 days had elapsed after the rendition of the judgment, and that under section 254 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902&gt; p. 1563, c. 580) the motion could not be entertained. In this position the plaintiff was undoubtedly correct. The defendant could not, under the guis\u00e9 of a motion for a reargument, extend the limitation prescribed by section 254, supra, in which a motion to set aside the verdict of a jury or vacate a judgment must be made, and the order herein would have to be reversed, were it not that it is conceded that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney received, accepted, and retained the $10 costs imposed by the terms of the order setting aside the verdict, and is thereby precluded from bringing this appeal.

C. 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-22\">Appeal dismissed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
