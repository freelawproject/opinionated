The defendant, a physician, claims, and his claim is substantially undisputed, that the plaintiff was indebted to him for services rendered to the amount of $76, and that he had paid some of the items on plaintiff\u2019s bill, notably for one of the suits charged for; and he produced upon the trial a receipted bill which clearly established such payment. 'The receipted bill, together with the items for medical services, aggregate $124.10. Nevertheless, the plaintiff had a judgment for $20.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">From an examination of the record it is impossible to ascertain upon what basis of calculation the judgment for this amount was arrived at. The plaintiff claimed $94.50. The amount allowed the defendant, therefore, must have been $74.50; but there is no proof in the case which by any reasonable calculation would disclose such sum. Defendant\u2019s proof was a receipted bill for $37.50, his bill for medical attendance $76, and a claim of $10.60 for overcharges made by the plaintiff. By no combination of these figures can the deduction from plaintiff\u2019s bill of $74.50 be reached. The judgment can be sustained only by the arbitrary use of figures for which there is no basis in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">No objection was made in the court below that the motion for a new trial was not made in time, and it cannot be raised for the first time upon appeal. Duryee v. Hunt (decided at present term) 107 N. Y. Supp. 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-15\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
