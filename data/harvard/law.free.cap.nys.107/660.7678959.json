As plaintiffs have never seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the contract of sale, and are unable to state the values placed upon the exchanged properties or the amount of the commission to which they are entitled, and are unable to state the date of said contract, they moved for an inspection of said contract in order to frame their complaint, and from the order granting the same defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The application was based on affidavits only, whereas section 805 of the Code of Civil Procedure requires the application to be based upon a petition verified by affidavit, and failure to do so deprives the court of any power to enter an order thereon. Lee v. Winans, 99 App. Div. 297, 90 N. Y. Supp. 960; Hirshfield v. Rosenthal, 51 Misc. Rep. 644, 99 N. Y.

All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
