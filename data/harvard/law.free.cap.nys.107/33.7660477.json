The action was for work, labor, and services and materials furnished, and the answer to the plea a \u201cgeneral denial and misjoinder.\u201d The copartnership was put in issue by the general denial, and no recovery could be had against the defendants jointly, unless the proof showed such liability. Counsel for plaintiffs at the close of the entire case conceded that he had failed to prove a co-partnership by asking for leave to discontinue the action; but the court declined to grant the motion, and decided the case as above indicated.
