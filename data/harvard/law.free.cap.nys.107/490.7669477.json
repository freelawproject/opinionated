After the action had been commenced\u2014but before issue was joined\u2014the defendant moved for a bill of particulars. The affidavit upon which the motion \u25a0was principally based was to the effect that the allegations of the complaint set forth, in gross, various sums of money, in large-amounts, which had been advanced; that the defendant had never been permitted to examine the books of the plaintiff or given a statement of the sums advanced; that he was unable to answer the complaint intelligently and with safety to his interest; and that he could not properly defend the action without a detailed statement. The plaintiff, in opposition, submitted affidavits to the effect that the plaintiff had advanced certain amounts of money each week to defendant, and obtained receipts\" from him showing that the money was advanced on account of the commissions, and that monthly statements were rendered to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-18\">A bill of particulars is not ordered\u2014except under very extraordinary circumstances\u2014prior to the joining of issue, and this for the obvious reason that a party has no necessity for a bill of particulars until he disputes the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Not a single fact is here stated which would justify the order. The defendant knows, or ought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>know, whether or not he received the amounts alleged to have been paid him for the time stated; he also knows, or ought to know, the commissions earned by him, as well as by his subagents. If he knows these facts, then he is in a position to interpose an answer; if he has not the necessary information, then he can interpose an answer denying that he has any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the allegations of the complaint, and this puts the plaintiff to his proof. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 500. Substantially all the defendant claims is that he does not know whether the plaintiff\u2019s claim is correct or not, and a bill of particulars, under such circumstances, will not be ordered\u2014certainly not before issue is joined. Hicks v. Eggleston, 95 App. Div. 162, 88 N. Y. Supp. 528; McClellan v. Duncombe, 26 App. Div. 353, 49 N. Y. Supp. 679; American Credit Indemnity Co. v. Bondy, 17 App. Div. 328, 45 N. Y. Supp. 267; Morrill v. Kazis, 8 App. Div. 304, 40 N. Y. Supp. 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\">The order appealed from, therefore, must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
