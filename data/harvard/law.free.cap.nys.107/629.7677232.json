The facts appearing upon the trial are substantially undisputed and are briefly as follows: ' \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">On March 19, 1907, the plaintiff boarded one of the defendant\u2019s elevated railroad trains at Eighth street and Second avenue; his destination being 121st Street Station. When the train reached 121st street the plaintiff was asleep; and he remained on the train until it reached 129th street, at which station he left the train. He then crossed the street to another station in order to reach the defendant\u2019s southbound cars, for the purpose of taking a south-bound train to be carried back to his destination, which he had missed while asleep. When he attempted to board the south-bound train, he was stopped by one of the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s, who inquired if the plaintiff had a ticket. The plaintiff answered: \u201cNo; I do not need any ticket.\u201d He persisted in his attempt to get on the south-bound train without paying any fare. ' The defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s in charge of the train resorted to force to prevent the plaintiff from boarding the train.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">It is clear that at the time the alleged assault was committed the relationship of carrier and passenger between the parties had ceased to exist, and the defendant was engaged in an attempt to obtain passage upon a south-bound train with the avowed intent of paying no fare. The defendant had fully performed its contract when it carried the plaintiff on its north-bound train to his destination, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>under no obligation to furnish him a return passage free of charge. The case of Busch v. Int. R. T. Co., 110 App. Div. 705, 96 N. Y. Supp. 747, has no application to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and 'complaint dismissed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
