The court below, however, made an error in giving judgment for plaintiff for the sum of $59 upon the first cause of action. The amount conceded by the parties upon the trial upon, that cause of action was but $52.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-16\">The judgment is therefore modified, by reducing the amount of recovery to the sum of $155.21, and, as' modified, affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
