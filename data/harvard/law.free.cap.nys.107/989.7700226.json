The application for an additional allowance was denied by the court at Special Term for want of power. The appellants, conceding that only such costs as are expressly allowed by statute are recoverable, rely upon the provisions of section 3369 of the Code of Civil Procedure for such statutory authority. The provision thus relied upon is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-15\">\u201cJudgment shall be entered pursuant to the direction of the court or referee in the decision filed. If in favor of the defendant, the petition shall be dismissed, with costs to be taxed by the clerk, at the same rates as are allowed, of course, to a defendant prevailing in an action in the Supreme Court, <em>including the allowances for proceedings before and, after notice of trial.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-16\">The appellants contend that the word \u201callowances\u201d means \u201cadditional allowances.\u201d We do not so read the section. There is no provision for notice of trial in condemnation proceedings; section 3367 of the Code of Civil Procedure providing that the court shall try the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>issues at such time and place as it may direct or that it may order the same to be referred to a referee to hear and determine. The words-italicized were therefore intended to reinforce the words immediately preceding, and to make clear the intention that the defendants should have all of the allowances specified in section 3251 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If there could otherwise be any do-ub.t about the meaning of the language used, that doubt would be removed by comparing it with the language of section 3372, regulating the costs in case of an award. I quote from said section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-5\">\u201cIf the compensation awarded shall exceed the amount of the offer with interest from the time it was made, or if no offer was made, the court shall, in the final order, direct that the defendant recover of the plaintiff the costs of the proceeding, to be taxed by the clerk at the same rate as is allowed, of course, to the defendant when he is the prevailing party in an action in the Supreme Court, including the allowances for proceedings, before and after notice of trial, <em>and the court may also grant am, additional allowance of costs, not exceeding five per centum upon the amount awarded.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and; disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
