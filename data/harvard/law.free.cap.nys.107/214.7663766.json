Defendants objected to the assignment offered as not properly proved and insufficient, and the court excluded it. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then called the court\u2019s attention to the fact that according to a case cited defendant could not question the validity of the assignment and that the assignment was executed by a corporate officer in its name, to which the court replied that there must be authority for it and that there was no evidence of any corporate act Thereupon plaintiff offered a resolution authorizing the assignment to - which defendants\u2019 counsel objected, and on its admission defendants\u2019 counsel stated that, the assignment having been excluded as a separate exhibit, it had been by plaintiff\u2019s counsel annexed to the resolution, that the annexation was without authority, and that they were separate instruments. <em>Held, </em>that though, ordinarily, a colloquy between court and counsel had no place in the record on appeal, yet that defendants were entitled to have all of such colloquy appear, in order that there might be such a statement of the proceedings as would enable them to secure a proper review of what actually took place.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-8\">Appeal from City Court of New York, Special Term. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-9\">Action by Edward Moroney against George W.

His ownership of the claim was put in issue. Upon the trial the plaintiff offered in evidence the assignment, after its identification by the secretary of the Astor Company. The record discloses the following colloquy between court and counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-14\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: We offer the paper in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoU\">\u2018\u2018Defendants\u2019 Counsel: Objected to as incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial; that the paper is not properly proved, and is not a sufficient assignment There is no evidence whatsoever that it is a proper assignment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap0\">\u201cThe Court: Paper excluded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-17\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: I desire to call your honor\u2019s attention.to that fact that the defendants\u2019 counsel in this case cannot question that assignment. It is not within his province to do so. According to the case of Sheridan against the Mayor, the defendant cannot question the validity of the assignment if the assignment is sufficient. Here is an assignment executed by an officer of the corporation in the name of the corporation assigning the account. An assignment of account does not need to be in writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-18\">\u201cThe Court: There must be authority for it. There is no evidence of any corporate act, or anything of that kind, before me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Thereupon the plaintiff offered in evidence a resolution purporting to authorize the execution of the assignment. The defendant objected, on the ground that the resolution was incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial, and the record continues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: * * * Here is a paper which is separate, and comes into court separate and distinct, which your honor has admitted over my objection. That is Exhibit B, and when you say you would not take the assignment as a separate exhibit they immediately annex it to the other paper. Mr. Epstein is a lawyer, and I do not see what authority he has to do this, and I object to the admission of the paper on the ground that they are separate and distinct instruments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">\u201cThe Court: Not necessarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: And I further object to the alleged assignment on the ground that it is insufficient and improper in form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">To the proposed case on appeal from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff respondent, the defendant appellants proposed amendments which called for the striking out from the case of the portions of the record which we have quoted. These amendments were allowed by the trial judge, the portions referred to were stricken out, and the defendants\u2019 motion to resettle the case and restore them was denied. \u25a0 The order entered on that denial gave rise to this appeal. .</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">We think the portions of the record omitted should be included in the case on appeal. The assignment to the plaintiff bears no date, and the resolution, dated December 28, 1906, purports to ratify an assignment of November 1, 1906. If, as we infer from the record, these instruments were not attached until after the offer of the assignment had been rejected, and they were then attached in the manner suggested, the appellant is entitled to have these circumstances appear in the record. We are not concerned with the effect these circumstances have on the questions which may be presented on the appeal. But we are concerned with the right of the appellant to have such a statement of the proceedings on the trial, such a reproduction of the occurrences incidental thereto, as will enable him to secure a proper reconsideration of what actually took place. An appellate court must necessarily be governed by the record on appeal, irrespective of the incidents of the trial. It is, therefore, the duty of the trial court to see to it that the case presented for review contains substantially all that transpired, to the end that the ultimate rights of both parties may be intelligently considered and effectually conserved. While ordinarily colloquy between court and counsel has no place in the record on appeal, we do not think that the order in this case was proper, since its effect would be to deprive the defendants of their right to have what may prove to be a most material circumstance reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs, and the motion granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
