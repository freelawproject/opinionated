It is apparent that this evidence is most material, and is necessary for the plaintiff upon the trial of the action, and the fact as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>whether the defendant wrote the letters and sent the telegrams can-be proved by the defendant. Every fact required by section 872 of the-Code of Civil Procedure appears. The materiality of the defendant\u2019s-letters and telegrams as proof upon the trial to prove the representations must be conceded, and the fact that the defendant would testify as to his handwriting and whether he wrote and sent the letters and' telegrams can certainly be inferred:</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">The only question presented is whether the order should have been-granted upon the affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, or whether it required. an affidavit of the plaintiff personally. In the affidavit the plaintiff\u2019s, attorney, who was to try the case and had charge of its preparation,, deposes that the plaintiff must prove the representations made by the-defendant\u2019s letters. He certainly is presumed to have knowledge of' the proof required to prove the plaintiff\u2019s case, and, that fact being-established, the other conclusions that the testimony of defendant as-to whether or not he wrote these letters and sent the telegrams will) be material upon the trial. The reason given for the affidavit not being made personally by the plaintiff is stated to be the fact that he resides in the state of Tennessee and is not within the state of New York.. I think that is a sufficient excuse for the making of the affidavit by the attorney and counsel, who was to try the case and necessarily had' knowledge of the proof required. It is a mere useless formality insuda a case to require the client, who cannot have the knowledge as-to the facts that it is necessary to prove and the nature of the proof\" necessary to sustain plaintiff\u2019s case that his counsel has, to make am affidavit. There certainly can be no doubt, from the facts sworn to by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2014facts which necessarily are within his knowledge\u2014that the defendant\u2019s testimony will be most material and necessary to be used upon the trial of the action, and I think the affidavit fairly shows that the examination is sought to obtain a deposition for use upon the trial. See Goldmark v. U. S. Electro-Galvanizing Company, 111 App. Div. 526, 97 N. Y. Supp. 1078; McKeand v. Locke, 115 App. Div. 174, 100 N. Y. Supp. 704; Grant v. Greene, 118 App. Div. 850, 103 N. Y. Supp. 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">The examination of the defendant should, however, be confined <em>to </em>the letters and telegrams sent by the defendant; and the order is modified so as to so limit such examination, and, as so modified, affirmed,, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
