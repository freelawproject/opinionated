The judgment so taken was rendered upon an inquest; the defendant being in default at the time of the trial. Subsequently the defendant made a motion to open his default, which was denied, and, so far as appears, no appeal has been taken from such order. Therefore the present appeal cannot be entertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-14\">Appeal dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
