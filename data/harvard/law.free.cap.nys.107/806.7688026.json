Upon October 21, 1907, when the case was reached upon the call of the calendar, the defendant stated to the court that the $10 costs, theretofore imposed, had not been paid. Thereupon the court dismissed the complaint for nonpayment of such costs, and judgment was entered against the plaintiff, from which judgment he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>The dismissal of the complaint for nonpayment of costs was error. There is no provision of the Municipal Court act which authorizes the court to dismiss an action for the nonpayment of costs, imposed as a condition for granting an adjournment; and section 779 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which directs a stay if such costs are not paid, is not applicable to Municipal Courts. Section 3347, Code Civ. Proc. The remedy is for the party awarded such costs to add them to the judgment, if successful, or to offset them against the judgment obtained by the other party. Farber v. Flauman, 30 Misc. Rep. 627, 62 N. Y. Supp. 784. The court was therefore wrong in dismissing the complaint. Fallon v. Crocicchia (Sup.) 102 N. Y. Supp. 541, 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-3\">The respondent admits in his brief that the court was without jurisdiction to dismiss the action for failure to pay the costs, but urges that such dismissal was also based upon the plaintiff\u2019s failure \"to proceed with the action\u201d when the same was called for trial. This court is bound by the record as it is filed. Eisenbud v. Gellert, 26 Misc. Rep. 367, 55 N. Y. Supp. 952; Forman v. N. Y. Transportation Co. (Sup.) 95 N. Y. Supp. 581. The return herein contains nothing in support of the respondent\u2019s contention. If the return is defective in material respects, this court is always open for a motion to amend the same, and it is the duty of both the appellant and respondent to promptly examine it -as soon as filed, for the purpose of ascertaining defects therein.
