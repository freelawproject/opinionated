The preponderance of proof shows that plaintiff never brought the defendant and the purchaser together. The proposed purchaser refused to buy on the terms named by plaintiff, the negotiations between them were broken off, the plaintiff did nothing further, and the transaction, s\u00f3 far as'he was concerned, came to an end. In other words, his efforts- ended in failure. Subsequently the d\u00e9fendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>negotiated with the proposed purchaser, the terms of sale were modified, and a sale was effected. Where a broker\u2019s efforts fail, his employer is not precluded from thereafter negotiating with the purchaser found by the broker, even on the same terms; and the mere fact that the broker\u2019s efforts may have led to subsequent negotiations, which, under more favorable circumstances, resulted in a sale, does not alone entitle the broker to a commission. Donovan v. Weed, 182 N. Y. 43, 74 N. E. <em>563; </em>Miller v. Vining, 112 App. Div. 304, 98 N. Y. Supp. 466; Sibbald v. Bethlehem Iron Co., 83 N. Y. 378, 38 Am. Rep. 441; Wylie v. Marine National Bank, 61 N. Y. 415. The judgment is against the weight of evidence, and should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
