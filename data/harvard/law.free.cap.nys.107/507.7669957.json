After the reversal of the judgment in so far as the same related to the defendant Sloane, it applied to the court for leave to serve a supplemental answer, setting up specifically the fact that the action had been tried, and resulted in a judgment dismissing the complaint as to Astor; plaintiff\u2019s failure to appeal therefrom; and the subsequent payment by' Astor to Sloane of its claim. Provision is made in section 544 of the Code of Civil Procedure for the serving of a supplemental pleading. This section provides that upon the application of either party the court may, and in a proper case must, upon such terms as are just, permit him to make a supplemental complaint, answer, or reply, alleging material facts which occurred after his former pleading, or of which he was ignorant when it was made. The facts which were sought to be set up in the supplemental answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>occurred subsequent to the service of the original answer. They were material and necessary to be alleged in order to enable Sloane to prove them. The facts proposed to be set out in the supplemental answer will, under our former decision, constitute a valid defense to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, unless it can show that when the payment was made the money was impressed with a trust, and was intended to take the place of the lien on the land. Indeed, I do not see how the plaintiff is in a position, without serving a supplemental complaint, to maintain the action, it having, by failing to appeal from the judgment against Astor, relinquished its lien upon the land. But however this may be, the defendant Sloane, as it seems to me, has an absolute right to have its answer put in such shape as will enable it to prove facts which will constitute a perfect defense to the action, unless the plaintiff can establish that by reason of the existence of other facts such defense ought not to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The order appealed from, therefore, should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur, except PATTERSON, P. J., and HOUGHTON, J., who dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
