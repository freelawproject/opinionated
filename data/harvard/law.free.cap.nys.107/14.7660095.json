Judgment was rendered for the defendant, and the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">It is urged by the respondent that the plaintiff could not recover, as he was not a passenger for hire. This position cannot be upheld. The plaintiff had boarded the car as a passenger, he had tendered in payment of his fare a transfer, and, upon being told that the transfer was of no value, he expressed a willingness to leave the car as soon as it could be stopped. He was entitled to as much consideration from the servants and employ\u00e9s of the defendant as though he had actually handed the conductor the fare demanded. The defendant owed him the duty of either carrying him safely to his destination or affording him a reasonable opportunity to alight. Even if he had refused to pay his fare and had persisted in riding, his ejectment for nonpayment could only be accomplished by resorting to no more force than was actually, necessary. Under the facts disclosed the plaintiff proved a cause of action, and the judgment rendered has absolutely no foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
