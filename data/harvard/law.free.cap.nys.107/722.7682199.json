Proc. \u00a7 822, provides that, where plaintiff unreasonably neglects to proceed in an action, the court may in its discretion, upon application, dismiss the complaint, etc. Rule 36 of the Supreme Court provides that whenever an issue of fact has been joined, and plaintiff fails to bring it to trial, after younger issues have been tried in their regular order, defendant may move to dismiss; but, if it appears that the neglect has not been unreasonable plaintiff may be permitted to bring the action to trial at a future term. Nothing was done by plaintiff toward bringing an action to trial for three years after issue was joined, and after younger issues had been tried in their regular order. <em>Meld, </em>that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>prima facie case of unreasonable neglect was established, requiring plaintiff to show a satisfactory excuse.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b759-3\">[Ed.

It is not disputed that after issue joined the plaintiff for three years has done nothing towards bringing the action to trial, and in the meantime younger issues have been tried in their regular order. These facts, under section 822 of the Code of Civil Procedure and rule 36 of the Supreme Court, established a prima facie case of unreasonable neglect, and threw upon the plaintiff the burden of satisfactorily excusing the same. In the affidavit used in opposition to the motion the only reason asserted for the delay is that plaintiff\u2019s attorneys were copartners when they brought the action, and in June, 1905, dissolved, and until a few weeks before the motion was noticed had not agreed as to substitution in the action brought by them as co-partners. This fact does not in any degree tend to excuse the delay, and does not meet the requirement of the rule that, before the court is authorized to exercise its discretion in favor of a negligent plaintiff, it must be made to appear that the neglect to bring the action to trial has not been unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint granted. All concur, except HIRSCHBERG, P. J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
