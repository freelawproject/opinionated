The fallacy of this is in the assumption that Young and the appellant were dealing together as principals. V It is plain that Young was an agent and not a principal, which fact the appellant knew and understood when he dealt with him, and therefore was bound to know the limitation placed upon his authority.)( When the \u201cinterim certificates\u201d were delivered to Young, they were not delivered free from all conditions. On the contrary, they were delivered for a specific purpose. The evidence is satisfactory that Young applied for them in order that they might be used in Paris simultaneously with the carrying out of the subscription agreement made by the Rogniat Syndicate; for Young, in applying for them, stated to the trust company issuing them that it was necessary to settle with the appellant his commission account at the same time the bonds were issued or withdrawn in Paris, and with that understanding, and for that purpose alone, the certificates were issued and forwarded to Young. <em>J </em>There was thus a limitation placed upon Young\u2019s right to use the certificates, and the present contest being between the original parties to the transaction, the appellant is bound by this limitation. He therefore holds them not independently of, but still connected with, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>terms of his agreement respecting the subscribers procured by him in France to the shipbuilding scheme. If By the terms of his agreement his duty was not fulfilled in simply procuring the names of subscribers, of whom he was one to a large amount. He was not only to procure subscribers, but the fair import of the terms of his agreement is that he undertook to procure, in addition to that, either the public issue or withdrawal of the bonds. The several things he was obliged to do before he became entitled to his commission were (1) to procure the underwriters, (2) procure the public issue of the bonds, or (3) their withdrawal from public issue. Thus it would appear that the claim of the appellant must stand upon his right to compensation for services, which right has not accrued because he has not performed his contract, and it does not stand upon the possession of the \u201cinterim certificates\u201d which, as the facts are shown in the record, gave him no additional or other rights than he possessed under his agreement with Young acting as agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Nor does the appellant stand in any better position with reference to the \u201cinterim certificates\u201d which he claims to h^ve purchased from Young. As already said, the certificates were delivered to Young, acting as agent for the trust company, for a specific purpose, viz., to settle with the appellant his commission account when he had fully performed the agreement entitling him to such commissions. He was bound to know that Young could not use the certificates for any other purpose, and that he had no right to purchase them from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
