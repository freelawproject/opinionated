Plaintiffs accepted the check and credited the amount on defendants\u2019 account as part payment. <em>Held, </em>that there was a genuine and unquestioned dispute between the parties, and hence the acceptance and retention of the check constituted a complete accord and satisfaction, since the acceptance of the check involved the acceptance of the conditions imposed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b833-10\">[Ed.

The learned trial justice, in disposing of the issues, seems to have been controlled by the idea that the claim was a liquidated one, the amount due certain, and the check sent represented an amount that would have to be paid in any event, as concededly the defendants had received, retained, and used the merchandise forwarded at least up to a value equivalent to the sum so paid, and under such conditions the claim of accord and satisfaction was not tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-17\">' The facts may be practically taken as conceded. The defendants purchased from the plaintiffs a certain bill of merchandise, predicating the same upon a sample submitted by a traveling salesman. The delivery of the goods was to be made in-three separate allotments, and the first allotment, representing a value of about $39, was received, used, and partially disposed of by the defendants. Under the claim of the defendants that the goods were defective in the material used or manufacture thereof, the defendants refused to receive any but the first allotment, returning the rest to the plaintiffs, and inclosing a check for $35.10 in payment; the said amount representing the value of the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>allotment less a sum allowed the defendants under some custom o\u00ed the trade for commissions. This check was on an Oklahoma bank, and was returned to defendants in a letter dated December 14, 1905. Thereafter, and on February 7, 1906, the defendants wrote a letter to the plaintiffs, inclosing a check on the Citizens\u2019 National Bank of New York for the same amount, payable to the plaintiffs, and by the terms of the letter the defendants notified the plaintiffs that the check was forwarded in full satisfaction and settlement of all claims by the plaintiffs, and in settlement of all disputes and matters between the plaintiffs and defendants; and this check the plaintiffs retained, indorsed, and collected the amount the payment of which it provided for. It is true that the plaintiffs immediately wrote to defendants, acknowledging the receipt of the check and that they intended to credit it on full account, and demanded payment of balance due. Now what does such a state of facts show?</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">First. Unquestionably that the contract was an entire.one, even though the delivery of the goods was by installment, and no right of action accrues, nor can a recovery be had, until the whole quantity contracted for is delivered (Nightingale v. Eiseman, 131 N. Y. 288, 24 N. E. 475); and by the doctrine announced in the same case (50 Hun, 189, 2 N. Y. Supp. 779) these defendants had a right to receive and use the first allotment without waiting to see whether the plaintiffs would fulfill their contract by delivering the residue. So that it will be observed that it was erroneous to assume that :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">\u201cIn any event, the defendants, on their own showing, were liable to the plaintiffs for $35.10.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Secondly. A genuine and unquestioned dispute between the parties; and under such circumstances the acceptance and retention of this check constituted a complete accord and satisfaction, and this, too, whether the claim is to be regarded as liquidated or unliquidated. Le Page v. Balance &amp; Grosjean Mfg. Co., 98 App. Div. 179, 90 N. Y. Supp. 676. The situation is not ameliorated by the writing of the letter of February 15th stating the amount received would be credited to the full account, and demanding payment of balance; for when that check was sent in full payment, etc., the plaintiffs either had to accept under the conditions imposed or return it. They could not keep it and impose other conditions. The acceptance of the money involved the acceptance of the conditions. Fuller v Kemp, 138 N. Y. 231, 33 N. E. 1034, 20 L. R. A. 785; Dunn v. Whalen, 120 App. Div. 729, 105 N. Y. Supp. 588; Williams v. Bienenzucht et al. (Sup.) 104 N. Y. Supp. 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">For the reasons thus advanced, this judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
