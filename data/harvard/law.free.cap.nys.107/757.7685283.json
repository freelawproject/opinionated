The plaintiffs were wholesale diamond merchants, and their place of business was No. 2 Maiden Lane, borough of Manhattan, N. Y. During many years the defendant was a retail jeweler in the city of New York, and prior to the time in'question had taken his wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>and one Trebilcock into business as partners, under the firm name of J. C. Proudman &amp; Co. The partnership business was conducted in the main by Trebilcock, who had been manager for the defendant. The plaintiffs had from time to time delivered diamonds to the defendant and to his firm on consignment. On the 1st day of October, 1904, Trebilcock sent one TJlner, a clerk of the firm, to the plaintiffs\u2019 store for two diamonds which were delivered to him, together with a memorandum in the usual form, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">\u201cNew York, Oct. 1, 1904.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-6\">\u201cMr. J. 0. Proudman:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">\u201cMemorandum from J. R.

No later claims allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-14\">\u201cDuplicate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-15\">Ulner delivered the diamonds, together with this consignment memorandum, to Trebilcock, who sold the diamonds 10 or 13 days thereafter, and deposited the proceeds, so far as received, to the credit of his firm. Before making the sale, he did not send to the plaintiffs a list of the diamonds selected, or obtain their approval of his selection. . The complaint describes the property and alleges the conversion thereof by the defendant, who interposed merely a general denial. Upon the trial the defendant gave evidence tending to show that, after the alleged conversion, it was waived, and credit was given the defendant\u2019s firm by the plaintiffs\u2019 credit agent for the diamonds as upon a sale. This evidence was received under plaintiffs\u2019 objection and exception that the answer merely contained a general denial; that a waiver of the conversion was not pleaded, and, also, that the authority of the credit agent to waive conversion was not shown. The court submitted to the jury the question as to whether there was a conversion, and, if- so, whether it was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-16\">We are of opinion that there should be a new trial. The sale of the diamonds without the approval of the plaintiffs, and affording them an opportunity to determine whether of not they were willing to extend credit to the defendant\u2019s firm therefor, constituted a conversion as matter of law. The consignment memorandum clearly apprised the defendant of the fact that his firm had no authority to sell the diamonds until they reported to the plaintiffs the selections made, and obtained the approval of the plaintiffs. The title to the diamonds remained in the plaintiffs, and never passed to the. defendant\u2019s firm. The action being in tort, the plaintiffs were at liberty to proceed against all or one or more members of the firm. The defendant was not at liberty to show that the conversion was waived without specially setting up that defense. The conversion was complete by the act of the defendant\u2019s firm in selling\" the diamonds. The subsequent negotia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>tions for credit may have constituted a waiver, if the credit man was authorized to waive the tort; but this could not be proved under the general denial. It did not tend to disprove the conversion. It constituted matter in avoidance, which it was essential to allege affirmatively. The plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action became complete by the conversion. The defendant, in effect, seeks to show under a general denial, not that the cause of action did not accrue to the plaintiffs, but that after it accrued it was compromised or waived. I think the question falls on principle within the rule that the release of a cause of action or rescission of a contract must be specially pleaded. Horton v. Horton, 83 Hun, 213, 31 N. Y. Supp. 588; Chapin v. Pratt, 66 Hun, 628, 20 N. Y. Supp. 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\">It follows that the judgment and order should be reversed and a new trial \"granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur, except PATTERSON, P. J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
