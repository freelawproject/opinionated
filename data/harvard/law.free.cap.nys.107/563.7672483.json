The Municipal Court had therefore no jurisdiction of this cause of action against the said defendant. As to the-defendant Riesser, there is an entire failure of proof on the part of the plaintiff as to any act on the part of said defendant constituting a conversion of the property in question, and positive proof by said defendant, corroborated by another witness, that said property was never in the possession of the defendant Riesser.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">The judgment is therefore reversed, and the complaint dismissed as to both defendants, with costs to the appellant in this court and the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
