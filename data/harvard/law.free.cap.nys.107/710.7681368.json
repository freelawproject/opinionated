They appear to be for the most part in answer to reports sent in by plaintiff, and contain words of praise for orders taken, encouragement \u201cto keep up the good work,\u201d and similar kindly comment upon particular favorable results accomplished by plaintiff. If they are competent at all as tending to prove defendant\u2019s mental estimate of the value of the whole period of plaintiff\u2019s services, they are at most the ordinary messages of an employer t\u00ae his employ\u00e9, calculated to stimulate him to renewed effort. Under the terms of the contract it lay with the master alone to determine whether or not the services of the servant were satisfactory. Tyler v. Ames, 6 Lans. 280; Zeiss v. American Wringer Company, 62 App. Div. 463, 70 N. Y. Supp. 1110; Duplex Safety Boiler Company v. Garden, 101 N. Y. 387, 4 N. E. 749, 54 Am. Rep. 709; Crawford v. Mail &amp; Express Co., 163 N. Y. 404, 57 N. E. 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-16\">In this case the defendant not only adjudged them unsatisfactory, but testified that he actually lost money on the sales made by the plaintiff, and showed in detail why his services were unsatisfactory in other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-17\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
