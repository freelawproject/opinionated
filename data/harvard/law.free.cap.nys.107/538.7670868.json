No notice of application for a preference was served, although it appeared upon the face of the complaint that plaintiff was entitled to a preference under subdivision 5, \u00a7 791, Code Civ. Proc. On May 6, 1907, plaintiff served a notice of motion returnable on the 13th for a preference, and on the 17th this motion was granted and an order entered setting the cause down for trial on the 33d. The plaintiff by his failure to serve notice of application for a preference with his notice of' trial waived any claim to such preferment. Section 793, Code Civ. Proc.; Rule 3 of the Rules of the City Court of the City of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion for preference denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
