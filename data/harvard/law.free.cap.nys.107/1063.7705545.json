It is alleged in the petition, and not denied by the return, that the relator was given less than 48 hours\u2019 notice of trial; the notice having been served on him at 1:35 p. m. on February 26th to appear for trial at 10 a. m. on February 28th, thus giving him only' 44% hours\u2019 notice. The rule of the department (36g) requires that a notice of trial shall be served not less than 48 \u25a0 hours before the hour of trial, exclusive of Sundays, legal holidays, and half holidays. The defendant, when arraigned for trial, asked for an adjournment, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-14\">The failure to give sufficient notice was fatal to the validity of the proceedings, and the writ must be sustained, the determination of the respondent annulled, and the relator reinstated, with $50 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
