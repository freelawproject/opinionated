The grounds set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit as a basis for the adjournment were not such as to absolutely require that the motion should be granted. The application was addressed to the favor of the court, and the granting or refusal of it was within the court\u2019s discretion. The judgment, however, should have been rendered without prejudice to a new action.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Judgment modified, by directing that the same be without prejudice to a new action, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs to either party-on this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
