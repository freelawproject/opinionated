The contract provided that the deed and possession of the premises should be delivered on September 1, 1905. The plaintiff made a tender of a deed on said day, but was not in position to deliver actual possession of the premises for the reason that they were in the \u2022occupancy of tenants of the plaintiff. Because of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to deliver possession the defendant refused to complete the purchase. I think there can be no doubt that the possession referred to in the contract of purchase and sale meant actual, not simply constructive, possession. The defendant was not obliged to perform on her part unless she could get both the deed and possession of the property, -and she certainly was not obliged to take the hazard of dispossess proceedings against the tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>The trial court found \u201cthat prior to the 1st day of September, 1905, the defendant notified said tenants that she was not going to buy said property and that they need not move from said premises\u201d; and it is claimed that the def\u00e9ndant cannot take advantage of the situation resulting from her own act. One of said tenants did testify on direct examination to a conversation with the defendant substantially as found; but upon cross-examination she testified as follows, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-5\">\u201cI suppose I did tell her [meaning the defendant] in substance, \u2018We cannot move by the 1st of September,\u2019 and Mrs. Devoe did say in answer to that, \u2018Well, now, if I cannot get this house by the 1st of September I don\u2019t want it.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">It clearly appears from the entire testimony of the witnesses who were sworn on the subject that the defendant was desirous of getting possession of the property on the 1st of September; that she so informed the tenants, who told her that they could not give possession at that time, whereupon she said she did not want the property unless she could get possession. It cannot be said, therefore, that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to deliver possession -was due to any act of the defendant; and, as the parties expressly stipulated for possession on a stated day, equity should not decree specific performance now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the final award of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
