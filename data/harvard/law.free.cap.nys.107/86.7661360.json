Said house to be delivered free of all violations of tenement house department, city of New York, and all other departments. This price and terms to hold good for six days from date. If Schwitzer &amp; Levis sell the house, they are entitled to commission. If they don\u2019t sell, they are not entitled to anything. A. Bloch.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">The plaintiff procured a purchaser whose acceptability seems to be unchallenged, but who refused to enter into an enforceable contract.because the defendant would not warrant the title to a certain portion of the premises covering the bed of an old street. The defendant was willing to quitclaim as to this portion, or sell subject to a possible paramount title. The character of the deed could not be agreed upon, and the parties separated without further negotiations. The plaintiff was permitted to introduce evidence of a custom that, where the character of the instrument of conveyance of title is not mentioned, a deed of warranty shall be delivered. It is clear that the minds of the defendant and proposed purchaser never met. They never reached any definite agreement as to the conditions and details of the sale. Therefore the plaintiff cannot be said to have earned a commission. And, even if the custom contended for by the plaintiff did exist, it could not avail him in view of the legal principles which must control his right to recover. Hasse v. Schneider, 112 App. Div. 337, 98 N. Y.
