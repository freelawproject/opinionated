On December 6, 2016, Employer learned from a news report that Claimant had been arrested. At approximately 7:30 p.m. that same day, Claimant notified Employer of his arrest. Employer discharged Claimant for violating its arrest reporting policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Claimant applied for UC benefits. On January 19, 2017, the Erie UC Service Center determined that Claimant was not eligible for UC benefits pursuant to Section 402(e) of the Law. Claimant appealed and a Referee hearing was held on February 17, 2017, at which Claimant appeared pro se. On February 22, 2017, the Referee affirmed the UC Service Center's determination. Claimant appealed to the UCBR. On April 4, 2017, the UCBR adopted and incorporated the Referee's findings and conclusions, as modified, and affirmed the Referee's decision.

It is also uncontested that Claimant notified Employer of his arrest on the evening of December 6, 2016. Thus, at issue here is whether, under these specific facts, Claimant \"immediately\" reported his arrest to Employer as required by Employer's policy and, if not, whether Claimant had good cause for failing to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the hearing, Employer's human resources representative Leslie Frescatore (Frescatore) testified that Claimant's employment was terminated because he failed to immediately report his December 5, 2016 arrest.

Before this Court, Claimant argues that the Referee \"should have elected to\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    exclude[ ] ... [it] ... from the record to ensure fairness to [C]laimant.\" Claimant Br. at 15. Although the law requires that a referee must act reasonably in assisting a pro se claimant to develop facts necessary for the referee to render a decision,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hackler v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7280699\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/24/1112/\">\n     24 A.3d 1112\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Pa. Cmwlth. 2011), \"the referee is not required to become and should not assume the role of a claimant's advocate.\"\n    <em>\n     McFadden v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11355795\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/806/955/#p958\">\n     806 A.2d 955\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 958 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2002). This Court has ruled that \"[t]he referee need not advise an uncounseled claimant on specific evidentiary questions or points of law, nor need the referee show any greater deference to an uncounseled claimant than that afforded a claimant with an attorney.\"\n    <em>\n     Brennan v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review\n    </em>\n    , 87 Pa.Cmwlth. 265,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=487%20A.2d%2073\">\n     487 A.2d 73\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 77 (1985) (citation omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    We acknowledge that \"[h]earsay evidence, [a]dmitted without objection, will be given its natural probative effect and may support a finding of the [UCBR], [i]f it is corroborated by any competent evidence in the record[.]\"\n    <em>\n     Walker v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review\n    </em>\n    , 27 Pa.Cmwlth. 522,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=367%20A.2d%20366\">\n     367 A.2d 366\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 370 (1976). Moreover, under Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 803(25), a party's out-of-court admission is an exception to the hearsay exclusion. This Court has long held \"that words of a party constitute an admission and therefore may always be used against him.\"\n    <em>\n     Evans v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review,\n    </em>\n    86 Pa.Cmwlth. 297,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=484%20A.2d%20822\">\n     484 A.2d 822\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 826-27 (1984). This exception is based upon the fact that, unlike hearsay, a party's admission is personal first-hand knowledge, and it may support a referee's finding of fact.\n    <em>\n     Braun v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review\n    </em>\n    , 96 Pa.Cmwlth. 238,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1346065\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/96/238/\">\n     506 A.2d 1020\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1986).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    In this case, although the Referee admitted the police report, it does not appear that the Referee relied upon Claimant's arrest record in reaching his decision. Rather, the Referee and the UCBR based their determination upon Claimant's representations regarding his arrest details.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
