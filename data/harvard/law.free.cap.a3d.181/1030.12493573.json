We also recognized that the proceedings would be most efficiently handled by a single judge; we, thus, designated the Middlesex chancery judge to provide a \"global resolution\" of the pending issues.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3907325\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/415/37/#p40\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3907325\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/415/37/#p40\">\n    at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4188201\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/440/118/\">\n    111 A.3d 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   The question before us now is whether, following our remand, the factual clarity we sought was actually achieved. Following our remand, the chancery judge conducted as thorough an evidentiary hearing, over the course of four days, as the parties' presentations permitted and rendered written findings. After identifying and quantifying the various debts, property sales, and collection efforts, the judge concluded Brunswick Bank was entitled to \"$2,670,825.92 plus additional interest not calculated, attorney's fees and costs, such as real estate taxes paid, not included in the [Law Division judgment].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge was not precise about the total dollar amount due when adding those other items; he simply concluded Brunswick Bank was owed\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   at least $2.7 million dollars [and] ... has received $2,599,208.51. [Brunswick Bank] also, as a result of two [s]heriff's [s]ales, owns Beacon Hill and Baldwin. Defendants failed to introduce any competent evidence to establish the fair market value of these properties at the time of the [s]heriff's [s]ale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Consequently, the judge \"discharged\" the Law Division judgment and, because Brunswick Bank so \"stipulated,\" the judge restrained-we assume permanently-Brunswick Bank from \"pursuing any deficiency judgment\" against defendants. The judge entered orders memorializing those determinations in October and December 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In appealing, defendants argue that: (1) Brunswick Bank's many claims \"merged into\" the Law Division judgment and created \"one debt to be collected and satisfied\"; (2) the successive foreclosure complaints constituted \"de facto deficiency actions\" and allowed defendants to challenge them as deficiency actions; (3) the judge erred in failing to provide them with the benefit of a fair market value credit for the properties ultimately received by Brunswick Bank through the foreclosure actions; and (4) \"a deficiency action\n   is illusory where a mortgagee has first brought an action on its note prior to foreclosing its mortgage.\" In a fifth point, defendants explain they \"are not seeking damages, but only a credit against the amount due and the voiding of the sheriff's sales, the return of title and the enforcement of settlement on Loren Terrace.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We start by recognizing, as previously held, that Brunswick Bank was entitled to collect only what was collectively owed from these defendants. Although the loans were separately made, Brunswick Bank recognized the link among all the loans by, among other things, commencing a single Law Division suit on four of the loans, apparently leaving out the fifth only through oversight.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although our earlier opinion could have been clearer, our mandate directed that all the loans and\n   payments against all the loans be accounted for in a single proceeding so that Brunswick Bank would not, as a result of the sequential manner in which collection was sought or occurred, come away from these proceedings with a windfall. It cannot be over-emphasized that the very nature of a foreclosure action suggests the potential for a forfeiture, and that-because \"equity abhors a forfeiture,\"\n   <em>\n    Dunkin' Donuts of Am., Inc. v.

Ascertaining the fair market values of property acquired by Brunswick Bank is one way in which a court of equity may determine whether it has been overcompensated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although understated in our earlier opinion, our direction that the chancery judge conduct an evidentiary hearing to ascertain what was collectively owed and what was collectively received on these loans was intended to ensure that through the many complications in the prior trial court proceedings Brunswick Bank had not been overcompensated. The judge's findings as to the amount owed to Brunswick Bank (\"at least\" $2,700,000\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) and the money received by Brunswick Bank in compensation ($2,599,208.51)-findings supported by the evidence and entitled to our deference,\n   <em>\n    Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v.

So, we proceed with an understanding that at a\n   certain period of time-and this presents a gray area to explore on remand, as we will soon explain-Brunswick Bank had received in cash from defendants all but $100,791.49. But, as the chancery judge recognized, Brunswick Bank also came away with the\n   properties known as Baldwin and Beacon Hill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The evidence about the collection efforts as Brunswick Bank neared receipt of a one-hundred percent recovery revealed that sheriff sales on Baldwin and Beacon Hill occurred on June 17, 2013, and December 30, 2013, respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In January 2014, after those sales occurred, Brunswick Bank also obtained $147,387.37 from a settlement regarding property known as Loren Terrace.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Simple but admittedly inexact math suggests Brunswick Bank was only owed approximately $250,000\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   when the first of these last three collection events occurred on June 17, 2013. These general circumstances alone suggest a likelihood that Brunswick Bank gathered through its collection efforts more than that to which it was entitled. The chancery judge denied relief and did not make the findings necessary to make that determination but only because he found defendants' evidence \"incompetent.\" Because we disagree with that conclusion and because the judge's findings do\n   not permit a clearer understanding as to whether Brunswick Bank received a windfall, we remand again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To be exact as to what must follow today's decision, we direct that the judge first determine whether Baldwin had a fair market value greater than the approximate $250,000 shortfall. If so, then Brunswick Bank, by becoming Baldwin's owner, would have been fully compensated and no further right in equity would have existed to proceed against any other mortgaged property or any other assets of defendants. The precise amount above the rounded shortfall of $250,000-that is, if Baldwin's fair market value was greater-would be irrelevant since that is the type of windfall law and equity would allow Brunswick Bank to reap.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   If, however, Baldwin did not possess a fair market value in excess of $250,000, then Brunswick Bank was entitled to further pursue its collection efforts and to force a sheriff sale of Beacon Hill. If the judge's future findings are in accord with this possibility, the judge must ascertain what thereafter remained due to Brunswick Bank and, once ascertained, whether the fair market value of Beacon Hill exceeded what remained of the $250,000 shortfall. If Beacon Hill's fair market value\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   did not swallow that remaining shortfall, then the judge could find Brunswick Bank entitled to pursue the Loren Terrace proceeds but only to the extent of the remaining shortfall once the fair market values of both Baldwin and Beacon Hill have been applied against the shortfall existing on June 17, 2013. If, however, the shortfall was\n   extinguished by Brunswick Bank's receipt of the fair market value of both Baldwin and Beacon Hill, Brunswick Bank would have no right to any part of the Loren Terrace funds ($147,387.37) obtained in January 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   If we could answer these questions by resort to the existing factual findings, we would spare the parties further expense and trouble and simply exert original jurisdiction to bring down the curtain on this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:10-5;\n   <em>\n    Price v.

In considering the parties' contentions, the chancery judge concluded that defendants \"failed to introduce any competent evidence to establish the fair market value[s] of [Beacon Hill and Baldwin] at the time of the [s]heriff's [s]ale[s].\" The judge gave little further inkling and left us with no explanation why he found the evidence on that subject to be \"incompetent.\" Indeed, it is not entirely clear what the judge meant when describing the evidence as \"incompetent.\" Three possibilities come to mind; the judge could have meant: (1) that the evidence was not persuasive; (2) that the evidence on that subject was inadmissible; or (3) that the evidence did not come from a competent source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As to the first, had the judge held the evidence failed to persuade, our standard of review would require some deference.\n   <em>\n    Rova Farms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1930491\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/65/474/#p483\">\n    65 N.J. at 483-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=323%20A.2d%20495\">\n    323 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In considering the second possibility-that the evidence offered on that subject was inadmissible-we would look to determine whether that ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. This standard provides some leeway, but a judge's exercise of discretion is never unbridled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Commitment of M.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5337489\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/384/313/#p332\">\n    384 N.J. Super. 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5337489\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/384/313/#p332\">\n    894 A.2d 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. Div. 2006). In this context, a valid exercise of discretion presupposes a reasoned application of the rules of evidence, and the judge here did not allude to a particular rule to guide us in understanding why he might have viewed the evidence inadmissible-assuming that's what he meant by \"incompetent.\" And it is not at all clear whether the judge's unexplained determination that defendants' evidence was \"incompetent\" was meant to convey that the source of the evidence was an unreliable vehicle for conveying those facts; in short, that defendants had not called an expert.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the final analysis, we are unable to defer to the judge's conclusory determination about the \"competency\" of defendants' evidence. It may be-as the proponent of a credit-defendants were rightly\n   saddled with the burden of introducing evidence on the fair market value of Baldwin and Beacon Hill.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even so, the\n   judge received competent evidence that shed light on Baldwin's fair market value. He heard, for example, from defendant Jeffrey Miller that a third party had contracted to buy Baldwin in 2012 for $335,000; that transaction, he testified, would have closed but for Brunswick Bank's refusal to release its lien for whatever it would have recouped from the transaction. This testimony was \"competent\" within the meaning of the rules of evidence\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the source of that evidence asserted he possessed personal knowledge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nowhere in his findings did the judge conclude Miller was not a credible witness. And the judge never said whether or not he found Miller truthful in this regard. The judge also heard testimony from Brunswick Bank's representative that, after its acquisition, Brunswick Bank listed Baldwin for sale for $349,900\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; that testimony, if true, would appear to corroborate Miller's testimony\n   and provide some insight into Baldwin's value. To be sure, none of this is necessarily conclusive about the property's fair market value, but the presence of this evidence belies the\n   judge's sole conclusion for declining to make a finding on fair market value: the lack of \"competent\" evidence. If we interpret that conclusion as being based on the absence of expert testimony, the judge was correct; defendants presented no expert testimony. And, to be sure, it would have behooved defendants to present an expert to give an opinion on the fair market value of these properties. But fair market value may be demonstrated by other types of evidence, including the existence of an arms-length agreement to purchase the same property at or about the same time of the inquiry: what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller, neither acting under a compulsion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The issuance of an equitable remedy when pitted against an asserted equitable defense calls for a court's exercise of equitable discretion according to the circumstances of each particular case.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Pomeroy,\n    <em>\n     Specific Performance\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 46 (3d ed. 1926). Consequently, it is not often helpful to grant or deny relief purely on the assignment of the ultimate burden of persuasion on an issue. For example, if we are to consider a litigant's \"burdens\" in a chancery case, we might start with a defendant who has urged laches, which has been defined as \"a defense when there is delay, unexplained and inexcusable, in enforcing a known right, and prejudice has resulted to the other party because of that delay.\"\n    <em>\n     Gladden v. Pub. Emp. Ret. Sys. Tr. Bd.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"479634\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/171/363/#p370\">\n     171 N.J.

That defendant has the burden of pleading that defense.\n    <em>\n     R.\n    </em>\n    4:5-4. But, as the matter progresses beyond the pleading stage, each party may be expected to introduce evidence to support some aspect of that defense or a response to it. That is, defendant may be expected to show a particularly lengthy passage of time, the plaintiff may then be called upon to explain or provide an excuse for that delay or whether the right now asserted was known, or when it became known, and the defendant may then be expected to offer evidence to show prejudice has resulted from the delay. Consequently, to generalize about which party has the burden of proving or disproving the defense of laches-upon pain of a rejection of its position-becomes an unnecessary distraction to the exercise of equitable jurisdiction. The court must consider all the evidence offered in determining the presence of all aspects of the defense.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Certainly, none of the recognized circumstances for finding a witness incompetent to provide evidence in general or on a particular subject was remotely suggested.
