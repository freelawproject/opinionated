In addition to requiring Exxon to pay a civil penalty, the ACOs required the company to: undertake remedial investigations; prepare work plans and feasibility studies; undertake all additional investigations and actions necessary to remediate the sites under DEP's supervision; submit quarterly progress reports; and reimburse DEP for all oversight costs and costs incurred in investigating and responding to Exxon's discharges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.J.

In August 2004, DEP filed two complaints against Exxon seeking NRD at Bayway and Bayonne, and asserting claims under the Spill Compensation and Control Act, N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11 to -23.24\n   (Spill Act), and common law theories of public nuisance and trespass.\n   We need not discuss in detail pretrial rulings and controversies, except to note that in 2006, the trial court granted DEP summary judgment holding Exxon was strictly liable for NRD and restoration costs under the Spill Act.

In 2014, Judge Michael J. Hogan presided over a sixty-six day bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Both DEP and Exxon moved pre-trial to bar the testimony of all or most of their adversaries' experts. Rather than conduct pre-trial hearings to determine admissibility,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   N.J.R.E. 104(a), with the judge's approval, all experts testified while the parties preserved their objections. Utilizing a complex, mathematical methodology known as \"Habitat Equivalency Analysis\" (HEA), DEP's experts estimated that NRD damages at both sites totaled $8.9 billion. Exxon's experts challenged the admissibility of any opinions based on HEA in the first instance, although, as Judge Hogan noted in his written decision, Exxon's experts, utilizing HEA, estimated NRD damages to be between $1.4 and $3 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After two days of summations and the submission of written closing arguments, Judge Hogan set about to render a written decision on the reserved N.J.R.E. 104(a) motions and the case in chief. Before he did, however, the parties advised they had reached a settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under the terms of the proposed consent judgment, Exxon agreed to pay $225 million to the state treasurer, and the State agreed to place that money in a segregated account within the Hazardous Discharge Site Cleanup Fund, where the monies \"shall earn interest and may not be used for any purpose\" until the consent judgment \"becomes final and non-appealable.\" The State also agreed to: release Exxon from all NRD claims based on the discharge of contaminants onto the soil and sediments of Bayway and Bayonne; dismiss surface water NRD claims without prejudice to raising them, under certain conditions, in a future action; release Exxon with prejudice and covenants not to sue for all NRD claims relating to more than one thousand Exxon retail gas stations in New Jersey, excluding those where methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   had been discharged; release Exxon with prejudice from all NRD claims relating to sixteen other statewide facilities (designated as\n   Attachment C facilities), including the former Paulsboro Terminal, which had been the subject of ongoing litigation since 2007, but excluding those facilities where MTBE had been discharged; and defer the final remedy determination and remediation of Morses Creek near Bayway until Exxon ceased refining operations at the site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties further agreed that: the consent judgment would not alter, suspend, or otherwise impact Exxon's obligations under any ACO, except for the Morses Creek deferral; the State would retain full authority and sole discretion to require Exxon to take any action to \"address an immediate environmental concern, an\n   imminent and substantial endangerment to public health, welfare or the environment, or an emergency response arising from or related to\" Bayway, Bayonne, the gas stations and Attachment C facilities; and, the court would retain continued jurisdiction and enforcement of the consent judgment's terms. Lastly, the consent judgment declared that nothing contained therein \"shall be considered an admission by [Exxon],\" and it granted Exxon contribution protection \"to the fullest extent possible\" pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 675, the Spill Act, and any other statute, regulation, or common law principle that allowed contribution rights against Exxon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   DEP provided notice of the proposed consent judgment in accordance with N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11e2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cumberland Farms, Inc. v.

DEP received 16,013 public comments, mostly objections, including comments from Raymond J. Lesniak, a resident of the Bayway section of Elizabeth and State Senator for the 20th Legislative District, (appellant in A-0668-15), and the New Jersey Sierra Club, Clean Water Action, Environment New Jersey, and Delaware Riverkeeper Network (collectively, the Environmental Groups) (appellants in A-0810-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before DEP responded to the comments and indicated whether it intended to seek approval of the consent judgment or not, Lesniak and the Environmental Groups moved to intervene in the lawsuit. In a written opinion, Judge Hogan denied those motions without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The same day, DEP issued its response to the public comments, portions of which we summarize. DEP stated the proposed judgment was the second largest NRD settlement with a single corporate defendant in United States' history, and the largest NRD settlement in New Jersey's history. DEP asserted that Exxon had already spent more than $130 million remediating Bayway and more than $120 million remediating Bayonne, and that the proposed consent judgment would not change or cap Exxon's continued obligation to \"spend whatever amount of money is necessary to fully remediate all of its contaminated sites in accordance with DEP's regulatory standards.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   DEP also noted \"numerous and significant\" legal and evidentiary issues in the lawsuit were still unresolved, with no assurance DEP would ultimately succeed. For example, early pretrial decisions in the\n   State's favor as to liability could be subject to appeal and ultimately reversed. Additionally, Judge Hogan had not yet ruled on the admissibility of DEP's experts' opinions, or determined the amount of NRD, if any, actually proven by the State. Under the proposed settlement, Exxon gave up its right to appeal all issues. DEP further noted that the proposed consent judgment did not settle claims against Exxon at gas stations and other facilities where MTBE was discovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With Exxon's support, DEP subsequently moved before Judge Hogan for approval of the settlement. Judge Hogan permitted the Environmental Groups and Lesniak to appear as amicus curiae. They filed extensive briefs and orally argued against approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In a written decision and conforming order filed August 25, 2015, Judge Hogan approved the consent judgment, holding it was fair, reasonable, faithful to the Spill Act's goals, and in the public interest. He concluded that DEP had applied \"rational methods\" to estimate total damages and to determine what Exxon's fair payment would be for those damages, and that $225 million represented \"a reasonable compromise given the substantial litigation risks the DEP faced at trial and would face on appeal.\" The\n   court filed a fully executed consent judgment on August 31, 2015; Exxon tendered payment a few weeks later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Environmental Groups and Lesniak renewed their requests to intervene, arguing in part that intervention was appropriate so they could appeal Judge Hogan's approval of the consent judgment. By orders dated October 9, 2015, accompanied by a comprehensive written decision, Judge Hogan denied both applications with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   These appeals followed. We have consolidated them now for purposes of issuing a single opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellants argue Judge Hogan erred in concluding standing was a prerequisite to their intervention in the lawsuit, and, even if he was correct, they established standing both to intervene at trial and to challenge the court's approval of the consent judgment on appeal. We first consider whether standing is a prerequisite to intervention at trial, and, if so, whether appellants had standing to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Our Rules of Court govern intervention at trial, and the trial court's interpretation of those rules is subject to our de novo review.\n   <em>\n    Washington Commons, L.L.C. v.

This case is atypical in that the position of the primary regulator (DEPE) in the administrative hearing was at variance with that of the final review body (CARB). ALS argues that it could not have foreseen that existing DEPE policy would not be applied to the case under review. ALS did not lay back to sandbag its opponents later. Thus, although our dissenting colleague makes an excellent argument that notions of fundamental fairness and exhaustion of administrative remedies should preclude sophisticated third-party objectors from intervening in litigation after observing its progress for several years, this is not the case for application of those principles. These facts are much too unusual to deny ALS standing to appeal, even though ALS should have made its position known earlier in the administrative process. Under the circumstances, the Appellate Division did not err in concluding that ALS, as an association concerned with the preservation of our coastal resources, had sufficient interests in the water-dependent development issues of this case to appeal the CARB action under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   2:2-3(a)(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    SMB Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1371958\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/137/58/\">\n    137 N.J. at 61-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1371958\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/137/58/\">\n    644 A.2d 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   We therefore reject Exxon's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   DEP acknowledges that a party may challenge settlements under the Spill Act, but only if the challenger can independently assert standing.

The judge summarized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   After years of litigation and negotiations, [DEP] and [Exxon] have resolved their disputes and potential disputes over Bayway, Bayonne, Paulsboro, fifteen other Attachment C Facilities, and 1768 Retail Gas Stations. Through the approval of the Proposed Consent Judgment, the DEP will recover $225 million for alleged natural resource damages, while still retaining their right to refile their Surface Water Claims and pursue MTBE pollution allegedly caused by Exxon. In reaching this result, the court finds that the DEP applied rational methods in order to estimate total damages and determine what a fair payment would be for those damages. Although far smaller than the estimated $8.9 billion in damages, Exxon's payment represents a reasonable compromise given the substantial litigation risks the DEP faced at trial and would face on appeal. Furthermore, the Consent Judgment is faithful to the Spill Act's goals and in the public interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Environmental Groups make several arguments. They contend the amount Exxon paid is not reasonable based on DEP's experts' estimate of damages, and the judge did not properly consider the relative strength of the parties' litigation positions. They also argue Judge Hogan lacked jurisdiction, and DEP lacked authority, to settle CERCLA claims. The Environmental Groups further contend the consent judgment violates the Spill Act and CERCLA because it does not direct all recovered funds to be used for the remediation and restoration of natural resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   We found no New Jersey decision that defines our standard for reviewing Judge Hogan's approval of the settlement following the hearing. Clearly, since Judge Hogan conducted the trial, heard the\n   testimony and observed the witnesses, we should defer to his fact-finding and review of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Twp. of W.

In one such case, the Third Circuit said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Appellate review, therefore, is \"encased in a double layer of swaddling.\" First, there is deference to the administrative agencies' input during consent decree negotiations and the law's policy of encouraging settlement. Where the appropriate agency has reviewed the record and has made a reasonable determination of fault and damages, that determination is owed some deference. Second, there is deference accorded the District Court under an abuse of discretion standard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Tutu Wells\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9311856\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/201/#p207\">\n    326 F.3d at 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He heard all the witnesses and considered all of the parties' arguments and submissions, including the issues raised by appellants, during his review of the proposed consent judgment. Judge Hogan had the best opportunity to gauge the strength of the experts' estimates regarding NRD, the relative\n   strength of the parties' litigation positions, and whether any more specific analyses of the additional sites included in the proposed consent judgment were needed in order to evaluate the settlement. We find no mistaken exercise of the judge's discretion in finding the consent judgment was fair, reasonable, consistent with the Spill Act's goals, and in the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   We lastly consider whether Judge Hogan committed a \"material error of law\" because (1) the court lacked jurisdiction, or DEP lacked authority, to release Exxon from CERCLA exposure, or (2) the consent order did not specifically limit redirection of the settlement funds away from the Spill Act Fund and remediation and restoration of natural resources in the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   We agree with DEP that the agency does not need authority from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to decline prosecution of an environmental claim. None of the cases cited by the Environmental Groups supports their argument that DEP could not include as part of the consent judgment its intention to release Exxon from any CERCLA claims. The effect of the consent judgment upon possible unasserted claims of other parties is simply not before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   DEP argues the Spill Act does not compel that all monies recovered by DEP be deposited in the Spill Act Fund. It cites other statutory provisions where the Legislature specifically required monies the agency recovered be deposited in specific funds.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , N.J.S.A. 58:10A-14.4 (requiring \"all monies from penalties, fines, or recoveries of costs or improper economic benefits collected by the department\" under the Water Pollution Control Act, N.J.S.A. 58:10A-1 to -14.6, to be deposited in the Clean Water Enforcement Fund).
