Kirila Contractors, Inc. (Kirila) and Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland (F &amp; D) cross-appeal from the same order, which declared specified numbered exhibits inadmissible at trial because they were fully or partially privileged as attorney-client communications or attorney work product. There are five issues before this Court: (1) whether the February 28, 2017 Order is an appealable order; (2) whether this Court may, by stipulation, consider deposition transcript excerpts and proposed exhibits on appeal despite that they were not before the trial court; (3) whether the Township waived the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine; (4) whether the trial court erred by ruling that certain exhibits were in whole or part protected by the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine; and (5) whether the Township should be precluded from filing any future interlocutory appeals pertaining to allegedly privileged evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This appeal arises from a contract dispute between the Township, and Kirila and Kirila's surety insurer F &amp; D relating to a Township sewer construction project. On April 8, 2011, the Township filed a breach of contract action against Kirila and F &amp; D. The Township's contracted engineer Hatch Mott MacDonald and related companies (HMM) were named additional defendants. During discovery, the parties disputed the Township's withholding of documents based on the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine. On March 22, 2013, the Township filed a Motion for Protective Order. Kirila responded to the Motion for Protective Order and also filed a Motion for Appointment of Master Regarding Documents Asserted by [Township] to be Protected from Production (Motion for Appointment of a Master), wherein Kirila requested the appointment of a special master to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the disputed documents. The Township filed a brief opposing Kirila's Motion for Appointment of a Master, and a brief in support of its Motion for Protective Order. On September 18, 2013, the trial court denied the Township's Motion for Protective Order and granted Kirila's Motion for Appointment of a Master.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Accordingly, by November 15, 2013 order (Master Order), the trial court appointed a special master (Master) to review the purportedly privileged documents and directed the Master to file a written report (Report) identifying the documents and portions thereof subject to production, and those not subject thereto. The Master Order also declared that the parties had ten days to file written objections to the Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 13, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Master filed his Report and notified the Township that it had thirty days to file exceptions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Report identified the documents which must be produced, and those which were privileged. The Report also explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   If no exceptions are filed to this [R]eport, and this [R]eport is confirmed by [the trial court], then the [d]iscovery [f]ile will be sent to counsel for [Kirila], it being noted that the [d]iscovery [f]ile contains all of the email communications, however the documents that have been protected will be removed from that file, and portions of the documents that have been determined to be protected will be deleted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 618a. On February 23, 2015, Kirila filed objections to the Report. On March 4, 2015, the Township filed its objections. The Township challenged the Master's recommendation that the Township pay the entire Master's fee. The Township also disagreed with the Report, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [T]he Township objects to the Report on the grounds that it does not provide the detail required by [the Master] Order. The [Master] Order specifically provided that the Master was to write a report containing the factual and legal reasons for his findings. Without this factual and legal reasoning, the Township cannot determine whether it has specific objections to any of the documents that he has determined are not privileged prior to their production to [Kirila].\n   <strong>\n    However, as this process has already delayed this case for nearly one and a half years, the Township is not requesting that the Master submit a revised report. Rather, the Township is requesting that it reserve the right to object to the production of each of these documents on the grounds that they are privileged when and if they are introduced as an exhibit at any deposition or at the trial.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   R.R. at 647a-648a (emphasis added; citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 22, 2015, the trial court issued an order (May 22, 2015 Order) that granted the Township's \"request to reserve the right to object to the introduction of each document if the documents are produced at a deposition or at trial on the ground that they are privileged[,]\" but overruled the Township's objections on all other grounds. R.R. at 722a. It also overruled Kirila's objections. Thereafter,\n   <strong>\n    the Master delivered the documents he determined to be unprotected to Kirila. The Township\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    did not appeal from the trial court's May 22, 2015 Order\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Trial was scheduled for April 10, 2017. Kirila provided the Township a list of Kirila's proposed trial exhibits, including some of the documents the Master had reviewed. On September 27, 2016, the Township filed its Motion to Exclude, Kirila filed a response thereto, and the trial court held oral argument regarding the same on November 28, 2016. On February 28, 2017, the trial court granted the Township's Motion to Exclude in part and denied it in part. On March 29, 2017, the Township appealed to this Court pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure (Rule) 313,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and filed an Emergency Motion for Stay Pending Appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 12, 2017, Kirila filed a Petition for Permission to File Cross Appeal in this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 17, 2017, this Court transferred Kirila's Petition for Permission to File Cross Appeal to the trial court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and directed the trial court to treat the petition as a cross-appeal from its February 28, 2017 Order. On May 31, 2017, this Court consolidated the matters and directed the parties to brief the appealability of the trial court's February 28, 2017 Order. On October 5, 2017, the parties filed a stipulation pursuant to Rule 1926 agreeing that certain deposition transcript excerpts and trial exhibits should be made part of the record on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 9, 2017, this Court held a conference call regarding the parties' stipulation, and conditionally approved their stipulation subject to a Panel of Judges' determination of whether the Court may, by stipulation, consider the excerpts and proposed exhibits although they were not before the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   First, we address the issues raised by this Court: (1) whether the February 28, 2017 Order is appealable; and, (2) whether this Court may, by stipulation, consider documents on appeal that were not part of the certified record. With respect to whether the February 28, 2017 Order is appealable, our Supreme Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Generally, subject to limited exceptions, litigants may appeal only final orders. One of the exceptions is the collateral order, which is addressed in [ Rule 313 ]. Pa.R.A.P. 313. Rule 313 permits the immediate appeal as of right from an otherwise unappealable, interlocutory order provided that three requirements are met: '(1) the order must be separable from, and collateral to, the main cause of action; (2) the right involved must be too important to be denied review; and (3) the question presented must be such that if review is postponed until after\n   final judgment, the claim will be irreparably lost.'

Kirila contends that it offered to agree to the entry of an order precluding the use at trial of documents determined by the trial court to be privileged, and documents for which the trial court reserved its decision, conditioned on the withdrawal of the instant appeal. Kirila notes that the Township offered no reason for its refusal to accept Kirila's offer and speculates as to the basis for the Township's refusal. Kirila is also concerned that the Township intends to further delay or interrupt the trial in this matter by filing Rule 313 appeals if the Township believes that the trial court has made erroneous admissibility rulings. Kirila provides no legal basis for preemptively prohibiting the Township from filing such appeals, and we will not attempt to predict the Township's trial strategy or conduct, or presume that the Township will use the legal process to improperly delay trial. Thus, we deny Kirila's request to enjoin the Township from filing appeals pursuant to Rule 313.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For all of the above reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part the trial court's\n   February 28, 2017 Order granting in part and denying in part the Township's Motion to Exclude.

The instant case does not pertain to whether disclosure to the Master waived the privilege, but rather, whether disclosure to Kirila did so. In\n    <em>\n     Miller v. Haulmark Transport Systems\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7853441\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/104/442/#p445\">\n     104 F.R.D. 442\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 445 (E.D.

The\n    <em>\n     Miller\n    </em>\n    Court concluded that the disclosure of the document at deposition over objection did not constitute a waiver of the privilege.

However, in the end, the Township failed to prevent disclosure by taking action in opposing the Report, requesting the trial court to conduct its own\n    <em>\n     in camera\n    </em>\n    review and, if necessary, appealing from the trial court's order. Instead, the Township requested disclosure in exchange for the right to object during deposition or at trial.

The Township contends that Kirila waived that argument because it was not contained in Kirila's Rule 1925(b) Statement or addressed by the trial court. We disagree. The Township filed its Designation of Contents of the Reproduced Record on June 23, 2017 and filed the reproduced record on July 25, 2017. Both filings occurred after Kirila filed its Rule 1925(b) Statement on May 31, 2017. Thus, at the time Kirila filed its 1925(b) Statement, it was unaware that the Township intended to again disclose the documents. The Township further argues that because the Master conducted an\n    <em>\n     in camera\n    </em>\n    document review, the documents had to be made a part of the sealed record on appeal. Because the Township did not appeal from the trial court's May 22, 2015 Order as well as failed to \"pursue all reasonable means\" to again prevent the document's disclosure, it waived the privileges; therefore, its argument is not compelling.\n    <em>\n     In re Grand Jury\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"257055\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/138/978/#p981\">\n     138 F.3d at 981\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
