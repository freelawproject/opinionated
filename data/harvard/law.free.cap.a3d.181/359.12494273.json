We consider in this case whether PCRA courts have jurisdiction to address collateral petitions despite the pendency of a previously filed petition challenging the same judgment of sentence. We hold that PCRA courts possess jurisdiction to decide subsequently filed petitions under these circumstances. As to the merits of this appeal, we conclude that the PCRA court properly characterized Appellant's fourth filing as a PCRA petition. Moreover, we hold that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miller v.

As Appellant was 22 years old at the time of the offense in question, the new rule of constitutional law announced in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miller\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and held retroactive by\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Montgomery\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , does not apply in this case. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The factual background of this case is as follows. On November 4, 2000, James Carter (\"Carter\") and George Maxwell (\"Maxwell\") attempted to visit a club in McKeesport; however, the club was closed when they arrived. While waiting for a jitney ride home, Carter and Maxwell observed Kijafi Fuqua (\"Fuqua\") jumping on the hood of his vehicle while singing and dancing to the music emanating from the vehicle. Carter then saw an individual he knew sitting in an SUV across the street from the jitney station. Carter walked over and began speaking to the individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At this time, Carter noticed Appellant walk into the middle of the street with a firearm while looking at Fuqua. Fuqua got off the hood of his vehicle and opened his trunk. Maxwell then crossed the street to speak with Appellant. The conversation became heated and Appellant struck Maxwell with the firearm. This strike caused Maxwell\n   and the firearm to fall to the ground. Appellant then began kicking Maxwell. Soon thereafter, Trent Thompson joined in kicking Maxwell. Appellant retrieved the firearm from the street and hit Maxwell in the head with the firearm. Appellant then shot Maxwell in the neck, fatally wounding him. Appellant was 22 years old at the time of this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The procedural history of this case is as follows. On January 19, 2001, the Commonwealth charged Appellant via criminal information with twelve offenses including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , criminal homicide.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 24, 2002, Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and related crimes. On January 28, 2003, the trial court sentenced Appellant to an aggregate term of LWOP. The trial court was required, by statute, to impose a LWOP sentence for the first-degree murder conviction.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1102(a) ; 61 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6137(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On direct appeal, this Court affirmed Appellant's judgment of sentence and our Supreme Court denied allowance of appeal.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

On September 26, 2006, Appellant filed a timely, counseled first PCRA petition. On July 29, 2008, after an evidentiary hearing, the PCRA court denied the petition.

This Court directed counsel to address, in addition to any other issues deemed meritorious, whether a PCRA court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over a subsequent PCRA petition when a previous PCRA petition regarding the same judgment of sentence is pending before the PCRA court. Prior, three-judge panels of this Court reached divergent conclusions regarding this issue in unpublished memorandum decisions.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Compare, e.g.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Super. 2015). This case presents a vehicle to definitively resolve the issue and is now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellant presents three issues for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. Whether the PCRA court had jurisdiction to address a subsequent PCRA petition while a prior PCRA petition was still pending [before the PCRA court]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2. Whether Appellant, a 22[-]year[-]old adult at the time his crime was committed, can rely on\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miller\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ... to satisfy the [new constitutional rule] timeliness exception to the PCRA?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3. Whether Appellant is entitled to\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   relief because the PCRA prohibits Appellant from challenging the legality of his sentence and Appellant continues to serve an illegal mandatory [LWOP] sentence[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Appellant's Substitute Brief at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his first issue, which this Court directed counsel for both parties to brief, Appellant argues that a PCRA court may exercise subject matter jurisdiction over two PCRA petitions relating to the same judgment of sentence at the same time. The Commonwealth agrees with Appellant that the pendency of a prior PCRA petition does not divest the PCRA court of subject matter jurisdiction to consider a subsequent PCRA petition. For the reasons set forth below, we agree with Appellant and the Commonwealth regarding this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As noted above, Appellant's third PCRA petition was pending before the PCRA court when Appellant filed his fourth PCRA petition. Some prior three-judge panels of this Court have held that a PCRA court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a fourth PCRA petition in these circumstances because of the pendency of the third PCRA petition. Other three-judge panels of this Court have reached the opposite conclusion and held that the pendency of a prior petition before a PCRA court does not divest the PCRA court of jurisdiction over a subsequent PCRA petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The confusion over this issue stems from two prior Supreme Court decisions addressing a PCRA court's jurisdiction over subsequent PCRA petitions.

Such a holding would be so contrary to the fundamental principles of subject matter jurisdiction as to be absurd.

We do not address that scenario in this opinion; instead we focus on the scenario where a PCRA petition is pending before the PCRA court when the petitioner files another PCRA petition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    At oral argument, counsel requested that we provide guidance to PCRA courts regarding the handling of multiple PCRA petitions. We decline this invitation as we believe these issues are best left to the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    When a petitioner pleads the applicability of a timeliness exception under 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9545(b)(1), the petition \"shall be filed within 60 days of the date the claim could have been presented.\" 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9545(b)(2). In\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Lark\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    , our Supreme Court held that when a prior PCRA petition is pending on appeal, a subsequent PCRA petition must be filed within \"[60] days of the date of the order which finally resolves the previous PCRA [appeal], because this is the first date the claim could have been presented.\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Lark\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471640,95775\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/746/585/\">\n     746 A.2d at 588\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We note that, under our holding today, even though an individual may have a PCRA petition pending before the PCRA court, (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , not pending on appeal), the 60-day period is not tolled. Thus, an individual must comply with the 60-day rule if he or she wishes to file a new petition that satisfies a timeliness exception even though he or she has another petition pending before the PCRA court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
