Weckerly argues that the court's admission of evidence of crimes of which he was acquitted in a prior trial violated the collateral estoppel component of double jeopardy. Given the unique circumstances presented in this case, we agree and vacate the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] In November of 2011, a Penobscot County grand jury indicted Weckerly on one count of arson (Class A), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 802(1)(B)(2) (Count 1), for setting fire to a vehicle driven by an investigator with the State Fire Marshal's office on August 3, 2011, in Prentiss Plantation, a remote area of the county. Five months later, in April of 2012, the same grand jury issued a second indictment against Weckerly containing eleven additional charges, all alleged\n   to have been committed by Weckerly in Prentiss Plantation between May of 2010 and July of 2011: aggravated criminal mischief (Class C), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 805(1)(A) (2017) (Count 2); burglary (Class B), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 401(1)(B)(4) (2017) (Count 6); theft by unauthorized taking (Class E), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 353(1)(A) (2017) (Count 7); five counts of criminal mischief (Class D), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 806(1)(A) (2017) (Counts 3-5, 8, 11); two additional counts of arson (Class A), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 802(1)(B)(2) (Counts 9-10); and another count of arson (Class A), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 802(1)(A) (2017) (Count 12). In particular, in Counts 9 and 10, the State alleged that Weckerly had committed arson on the property of Chris Jones on November 16, 2010, and July 3, 2011, respectively; in Count 11, the State alleged that Weckerly had committed criminal mischief by spray-painting graffiti on the property of Joseph Couture on July 11, 2011; and in Count 12, the State alleged that Weckerly had committed arson on the property of John Dreon on July 20, 2011. Weckerly pleaded not guilty to all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 3] After a six-day trial in 2013, the jury found Weckerly not guilty of Counts 2-12, but could not reach a verdict on Count 1, the arson of the fire marshal's vehicle. The court entered a judgment acquitting Weckerly of Counts 2-12 and, with Weckerly's agreement, declared a mistrial on Count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] In preparation for the second trial, Weckerly moved in limine to exclude any evidence relating to Counts 2-12 on the ground that such evidence would violate double jeopardy principles because he had already been acquitted of those charges. After a hearing, the court denied the motion, concluding that double jeopardy did not preclude the admission of the evidence and that the evidence was admissible to show Weckerly's motive, intent, and state of mind.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5] In 2015, the court conducted a second jury trial on Count 1. During the second trial, the court admitted evidence relating to Counts 9-12 that was presented in the first trial. Three times during the trial, the court instructed the jury that Weckerly had already been charged with-and acquitted of-those four crimes. The court denied Weckerly's later motion for a judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6] The jury found Weckerly guilty of the arson of the fire marshal's vehicle. The court entered a judgment on the verdict, sentencing Weckerly to seven years in prison, all suspended, with four years of probation and $5,000 in restitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Weckerly appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 7] Both the United States and Maine Constitutions offer protections against double jeopardy. U.S. Const. amend.

As the United States Supreme Court has explained, the prohibition against double jeopardy serves\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   two vitally important interests. The first is the deeply ingrained principle that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty. The second is the preservation of the finality of judgments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Yeager v.

As applied here, the ultimate issue that bears on the application of double jeopardy collateral estoppel is whether Weckerly committed arson on Jones's or Dreon's property or criminal mischief on Couture's property. We must therefore ascertain whether the jury in the first trial necessarily acquitted Weckerly on the eleven\n   counts on the ground that he was not the person who committed arson on Jones's or Dreon's property or criminal mischief on Couture's property, or whether the jury could have acquitted Weckerly based on some finding other than the identification of Weckerly as the actor-for example, (1) as to the arson charges, that no fires were set at all, that the fires were not set with the intent to damage or destroy the property, or that the fires did not recklessly endanger any person or property, and (2) as to the criminal mischief charge, that no spray-painting occurred, that Weckerly spray-painted Couture's property but lacked the requisite intent in doing so, that the property belonged to Weckerly rather than to Couture, that the graffiti did not damage or destroy the property, or that Weckerly had reasonable grounds to believe he had the right to spray-paint the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 802(1)(A), (B)(2), 806(1)(A). If the jury in Weckerly's first trial rationally could have acquitted him\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on the ground that he was not the perpetrator of those crimes, the prohibition of double jeopardy demands that any evidence presented by the State to prove Weckerly was the perpetrator of those crimes in the first trial is inadmissible for any purpose in the second trial. If the jury in the first trial rationally could have acquitted Weckerly on some ground other than his identification as the perpetrator, the evidence relating to those crimes was admissible in the second trial as long as it was \"relevant and probative\" and \"otherwise admissible under the Rules of Evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Dowling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11331685\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/342/#p348\">\n    493 U.S. at 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11331685\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/342/#p348\">\n    110 S.Ct. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b6 19] The trial court explicitly found that \"there is little doubt that the basis for the jury's decision [in the first trial] was that the State had not proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [Weckerly] was the person who had committed the acts alleged.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our review of Weckerly's first trial unequivocally leads us to the same conclusion.
