Article IV, \u00a7 4A(a) creates the Commission, and Article IV, \u00a7 4B(a)(1) authorizes it to conduct investigations of complaints about judges.

Veolia Transp. Servs. Inc.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Since 2007, Judge Pamela J. White (whom we shall sometimes refer to as \"Respondent\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   has served as an Associate Judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. She also served as the Supervising Judge for the Circuit Court's Civil Alternative Dispute Resolution Program (\"ADR\") from 2009 until 2015. In 2014, Respondent presided over hearings in a civil matter.\n   <em>\n    Louise V. Joyner v. Veolia Transp. Servs. Inc., et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 24-C-014000589 (Baltimore City Circuit Court). Attorney Rickey Nelson Jones represented the plaintiff, Joyner, in her action for negligence while attorney Andrew Stephenson represented the defendant, Veolia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Early in the litigation, Veolia moved to dismiss Joyner's punitive damages claim. When counsel for both parties appeared before Judge White for a hearing on the motion to dismiss, Jones tried to justify his claim for punitive damages, which stemmed from the phone calls made by an insurance adjuster to the plaintiff following the accident. Dissatisfied with Jones's attempted explanation, Judge White said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    The Court:\n   </strong>\n   Oh Mr. Jones, are you telling me this with a straight face? .... Are you telling me as an officer of the court, admitted to the bar, with a straight face, that you think you have an ill-will punitive damages claim against Veolia Transportation because of something that an insurance adjuster, employed by an insurance company, has said in the course of calling your client to inquire of her status? .... Do you think this allegation can stand, in the face of your responsibility as an officer of the court?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Jones:\n   </strong>\n   Do I believe that a representative of the defendant can act on their behalf, I do believe they can act on their behalf. If you're asking me do I believe another corporation-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    The Court:\n   </strong>\n   I'm asking you, is there any conceivable case authority, any statutory authority, that allows you the chutzpah to claim punitive damages in a negligence case suggesting that a claims adjuster working for an insurance company asking questions of your client about the status her injury should be attributed as an ill-will punitive damages claim by Veolia Transportation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Jones:\n   </strong>\n   I have no case law on that, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After this exchange, Respondent granted Veolia's motion and dismissed the punitive damages claim with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The pretrial scheduling order for\n   <em>\n    Joyner\n   </em>\n   required that \"all counsel, their clients and insurance representatives must attend the pretrial conference in person,\" on September 17, 2014, before another judge of the court (not Judge White). The order also directed that \"[a]ny request for accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act should be directed to the Administrative Office of the Circuit Court for Baltimore\n   City,\" and provided a phone number to contact that office. Finally, the order permitted modification \"only upon a written motion for modification setting forth a showing of good cause that the schedule cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the parties seeking modification.\" On September 5, 2014, Jones filed a pretrial conference statement in which, under the heading \"Other Matters,\" he wrote \"Plaintiff requests that her attorney attend the Pretrial Conference\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   due to her poor health and doctor recommendation that she not travel without ambulance assistance.\" (Emphasis in original). Joyner did not attend the pretrial conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After the pretrial conference, Jeff Trueman, then the Deputy Director of the Circuit Court's Civil ADR program, advised Judge White of Joyner's unexcused absence at the conference. Judge White issued a show cause order requiring Joyner and Jones to appear at the Circuit Court on October 31, 2014, and explain why the Court should not hold them in civil contempt. In his response to the order, Jones contended that his proffer in the pretrial conference statement sufficed as the written \"motion\" required for modification of the pretrial scheduling order. Jones also included, in a postscript to his letter response that was not sent to opposing counsel, an offer to speak to Judge White about the postponement. Judge White immediately responded in writing that trial would go forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The next day, October 15, 2014, Jones and opposing counsel appeared before Judge White for trial. Jones requested a\n   postponement and presented a motion for Judge White's recusal. He alleged three \"partial\" acts by Respondent. First, he argued that the Judge insulted him by \"questioning his bar membership\" during the May 5, 2014 hearing. Second, he alleged that Respondent incorrectly issued the show cause order. Finally, he contended that Respondent was not impartial because she had directed him to Postponement Court. Responding to the recusal motion in open court, Judge White recused herself and said the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [B]ecause I am incredulous, because I am in disbelief, because I find myself incapable of believing virtually anything that Mr. Jones has just told me, I'm in the unfamiliar\n   territory of finding that I must recuse myself from any further proceedings in this case because I cannot believe anything that the Reverend Rickey Nelson Jones[,] Esquire\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   -and I'm reading off the letterhead-tells me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   I think that 99% of what Mr. Jones has told me about his conduct on behalf of his client is pure bullshit[.] So I'm forced to recuse myself and I can't get past the idea that I cannot believe a darn thing that Mr. Jones tells me now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   So I am compelled under ... Rule 2.11 [of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct]\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   to disqualify myself in any further proceedings in this case, because I now believe, based on Mr. Jones' conduct and representations in this case, in his discussion and exploration of \"who struck John\" in recent days about his request for accommodation, all without following the precise instructions and procedures in the Scheduling Order and the website and resources available to him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   I find that I cannot be impartial. I am personally biased or prejudiced concerning Mr. Jones and his conduct. So, I'm going to recuse myself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Regarding the request for postponement, Judge White raised her voice and admonished Jones for offering to engage in\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communication with the Court. She then added:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   I am dumbfounded at your irresponsible behavior, Mr. Jones. All the more reason I am compelled by your dumbfounding behavior to recuse myself because I cannot believe a single word you say. And what I am compelled to do now because the Rules of Professional Conduct and the Judicial\n   Code compel me to do so is to reexamine what I just said and heard and reported on the record whether I must report you to the Attorney Grievance Commission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   In addition to not believing a word that Mr. Jones tells me, I am so very frustrated with his failure to attend to the basic rules of procedure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge White issued a written order explaining her recusal from\n   <em>\n    Joyner\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At the hearing on the show cause order, Jones attempted to explain why his client could not come to court without an ambulance. Judge White acknowledged the plaintiff's status and inquired as to how Jones felt he had complied with the pretrial scheduling order. Jones presumed that his warning that he would attend without his client, made in his pretrial conference statement, sufficed as a \"motion\" to modify the scheduling order. After some discussion, Judge White held Jones in contempt of Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Proceedings Before The Inquiry Board\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Five days after Judge White recused herself from\n   <em>\n    Joyner\n   </em>\n   , the Commission received Jones's first complaint regarding her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   He complained of Respondent's comments and conduct during the hearings on Veolia's motion to dismiss, and on his motion to recuse. He also averred that, although Judge White had recognized she could not be impartial, she refused to recuse herself from the hearing on her show cause order. After receiving Jones's first complaint, the Commission's Investigative Counsel, then Carol A. Crawford, opened a preliminary investigation into Respondent's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On November 17, 2014, the Commission received Jones's second complaint against Judge White. Jones based this complaint on Respondent's conduct during the October 31 hearing. He also alleged that Judge White improperly decided not to recuse herself from considering the show cause order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Inquiry Board extended the time to complete the preliminary investigation and delayed giving notice to Judge White, for \"good cause shown,\" in January, February, and April. In April, Investigative Counsel sent a letter notifying Judge White of the two complaints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Judge White timely responded to Jones's first two complaints, asserting that her demeanor toward Jones was appropriate because he showed no concern for the\n   rules of procedure or proper professional behavior. She also averred that she properly presided over the show cause proceedings because Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct (\"MCJC\") Rule 2.11 did not require her recusal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The following day, Investigative Counsel submitted a memorandum to the Inquiry Board recommending that the Inquiry Board find that Judge White committed sanctionable conduct \"with regard to her demeanor throughout the [\n   <em>\n    Joyner\n   </em>\n   ] proceedings,\" and by failing to recuse herself from the October 31 hearing. Investigative Counsel recommended that the Inquiry Board, in turn, recommend to the Commission, that a private reprimand be issued. The memorandum attached copies of Jones's complaints, audio recordings of the hearings, and Respondent's response to the complaints. On December 11, 2015, the Inquiry Board forwarded its report and recommendation to the Commission, but no copy was sent to Respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    Proceedings Before The Commission\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   At its December 2015 meeting, the Commission reviewed the complaints, recordings of the hearings, Judge White's correspondence with Investigative Counsel, and the recommendations of the Inquiry Board and Investigative Counsel. The Commission concluded that probable cause existed to believe that Respondent had committed sanctionable conduct and, by unanimous vote, directed Investigative Counsel to initiate proceedings against Respondent by filing public charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It was only when Judge White was notified of this action that her counsel requested, and finally received on January 12, 2016, a copy of the Inquiry Board's report. In a 40-page filing, Respondent objected to the report and argued that her conduct in\n   <em>\n    Joyner\n   </em>\n   did not amount to misconduct, and requested a hearing before the Commission. At its February 2016 meeting,\n   the Commission voted to set the matter for further discussion at a special meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   That special meeting was held on March 2, 2016. But the Commission rejected Respondent's objections to the Inquiry Board's report, denied her request for a hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and again directed Investigative Counsel to file charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Commission filed public charges against Judge White on March 31, 2016, alleging that she violated several provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct, specifically MCJC 1.1 (Compliance with the Law),\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   1.2 (Promoting Confidence in the Judiciary),\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   2.2 (Impartiality and Fairness),\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   2.3 (Bias, Prejudice, and Harassment),\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   2.11 (Disqualification).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her answer,\n   Respondent moved to dismiss the charges. She argued that her decisions in\n   <em>\n    Joyner\n   </em>\n   were legal judgments not subject to scrutiny through the disciplinary process and that, even if the Commission had the authority to review her actions, she did not commit misconduct. Respondent also alleged a due process violation after Investigative Counsel failed to comply with certain time standards, did not inform her of Jones's complaints in a timely fashion, and failed to convey information about the proceedings to Judge White.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Respondent served interrogatories on Investigative Counsel pursuant to the civil discovery rules, specifically Md. Rule 2-421. In response, Investigative Counsel filed a request to strike the discovery demands. Investigative Counsel explained that, although the Rules expressly provide that discovery in judicial disciplinary proceedings shall be governed by civil discovery rules, this \"does not mean that every rule in [the civil discovery rules] is relevant, appropriate, or applicable to proceedings before the Commission.\" Investigative Counsel also contended that Judge White could not serve her with requests for admissions because Investigative Counsel \"is neither a party nor a witness ....\" Investigative Counsel closed her request by asking the Commission to enter a protective order prohibiting Judge White from receiving certain documents prepared by Investigative Counsel. Investigative Counsel claimed that these documents were subject to confidentiality restrictions (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Md. Rule 18-409(a)(4) ) and amounted to attorney work product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   After a hearing, where both Investigative Counsel and Respondent's attorney appeared, the Commission denied Judge White's motion to dismiss. The Commission opined that it had no power to dismiss the charges under Md. Rule 18-406 until after it held a hearing on the merits under Md. Rule 18-407.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Commission also interpreted the discovery rules to vest complete discovery authority in the Chair of the Commission. Without further explanation, the Commission simply stated that the decision to strike Respondent's interrogatories and request for admissions did not eliminate her access \"to a fair discovery process.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Commission held an evidentiary hearing on July 7 and 8, 2016. Investigative Counsel called no witnesses, but offered five exhibits: (1) the Baltimore City Circuit Court file for\n   <em>\n    Joyner\n   </em>\n   ; (2) video recordings of the May 5, 2014, October 15, 2014, and October 31, 2014 proceedings before Judge White; (3) a transcript of the October 15, 2014 proceeding; (4) a transcript of the October, 31, 2014 hearing; and (5) a copy of the charges. Investigative Counsel then played recordings of the May 4, October 15, and October 31 proceedings for the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In addition to her own testimony, Judge White presented five witnesses: (1) Circuit Administrative Judge W. Michel Pierson; (2) Judge in charge of the Civil Docket, Athea M. Handy; (3) retired Judge Carol E. Smith; (4) Jeff Trueman; and (5) Andrew Stephenson. Investigative Counsel thoroughly cross-examined Judge White. Members of the Commission also questioned her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On August 3, 2016, the Commission, by unanimous vote, publicly reprimanded Judge White. The Commission concluded that Judge White violated the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct through her \"undignified, discourteous, and unprofessional\" treatment of Jones and her failure to recuse herself from the show cause hearing after admitting that she could not be impartial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As we explained in our earlier opinion, while we do not have \"\n   <em>\n    appellate\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction for review of Judge White's claims, this Court is able to review her allegation that the Commission proceeding denied her procedural due process as a petition for a common law writ of mandamus.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    White I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489209,12315396\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/451/630/\">\n    451 Md. at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489209,12315396\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/451/630/\">\n    155 A.3d 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

In our Discussion, below,\n   we divide her contentions into two categories: (1) those relating to preliminary matters before the Commission decided to issue charges (\"Proceedings Preliminary to Charges\"), and (2) those relating to events occurring after public charges were filed against her (\"Proceedings After Charges Filed\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Overall, Judge White insists that the Commission's material deviations from the requirements of the Maryland Constitution and the Rules were serious failures that deprived her of procedural due process and thus rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Specifically, she asserts that Investigative Counsel waited approximately six months from when Jones filed his first complaint to notify her. Respondent asserts that this delayed notification prejudiced her ability to dispute the allegations before the Inquiry Board, and to raise objections to Investigative Counsel's failure to comply with time standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Maryland Rule 18-404(e)(4) requires that Investigative Counsel notify the judge of a complaint before the completion of the preliminary investigation, which is due within 90 days of the complaint filing. It also permits the Inquiry Board to delay giving notice of the investigation to the judge \"for good cause shown\" by Investigative Counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489209,12315396\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/451/630/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because Jones filed his first complaint on October 20, 2014, the preliminary investigation was due to be completed on January 19, 2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489209,12315396\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/451/630/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (e)(6). Judge White did not receive notice until three months after that date-on April 17, 2015. In the meantime, though, on January 15, 2015, the Inquiry Board granted a 30-day extension \"for good cause shown\" as allowed by the same Rule, and a second 60-day extension thereafter. The minutes for the Inquiry Board meeting, and the\n   Commission's brief, fail to articulate any explanation of the \"good cause\" the Inquiry\n   Board relied upon to extend the deadline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Rule 18-405(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   This Court can readily understand Judge White's frustration when she learned that the complaint was filed six months before she was given notice thereof, especially when the \"good cause\" extension was unclear. Judges, who hold positions of great responsibility and respect, need to be trusted by the public, and are rightfully sensitive about ethics complaints against them. Her frustration may have been compounded when she later learned that Investigative Counsel's disposition recommendation explained that the investigation consisted merely of reviewing: (1) Mr. Jones's complaints; (2) the recordings of the hearings held before Judge White; and (3) Judge White's response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   At oral argument, the Commission explained that there can be extensive delays in obtaining either a recording or transcript from a trial court. This, we think, would be sufficient reason to grant an extension under Md. Rule 18-404(e)(4). On the other hand, Investigative Counsel's volume of work would probably not be sufficient, absent some unusual circumstance. There is nothing in the record to document the reason for the delay in this case. Although there is no requirement in Md. Rules 18-404 or 18-405 that the Commission document the reason for extension, it would be better practice in future cases to do so-thus, perhaps, avoiding a future challenge of this nature. To resolve this case, we assume that the delay was without due cause, and move on to consider the consequences of this Rule violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Judge White contends that the delay affected her due process rights because it prejudiced her ability to defend herself even at the very early stages in the disciplinary process. We are not persuaded this is so.

In terms of due process, Judge White had sufficient opportunity, even before the filing of public charges, to defend against the misconduct allegations made by Jones, and she took advantage of that opportunity, filing extensive written objections with the Commission before public charges, and afterwards, a motion to dismiss the charges, with a\n   hearing thereon, as well as a full-fledged defense on the merits. Further, Respondent does not offer any explanation of what she would have done during those 90 days ending with April 17, 2015, to enhance her defense against the charges. We can see no due process violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    Investigative Counsel's Communications With The Inquiry Board And The Commission\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Judge White objects to several instances of so-called \"\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   \" communications between Investigative Counsel and the Inquiry Board or Commission. The Inquiry Board discussed Respondent's case with Investigative Counsel, but without Respondent's counsel, at its meetings in 2015. Investigative Counsel advised the Inquiry Board of her conversations with Respondent's attorneys, yet Respondent's attorneys were not present during these meetings. After the Inquiry Board issued its report to the Commission, Investigative Counsel was present when Respondent's case was discussed at the Commission meetings. Again, Judge White's attorney did not attend these meetings. Respondent contends that Investigative Counsel's communications with the Inquiry Board and Commission resulted in prejudice to her because she had no way of knowing that her submissions to the Inquiry Board and Commission were presented accurately and she could not refute any assertions made by Investigative Counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As the Commission argues, the Rules plainly contemplate ongoing communications and coordinated activity between Investigative Counsel, the Inquiry Board, and the Commission. Specifically, the Rules permit Investigative Counsel to take several actions without notice to the judge. Investigative Counsel must \"inform the Board or Commission that the\n   preliminary investigation is being undertaken.\" Md. Rule 18-404(e)(1). Investigative Counsel can also apply to the Inquiry Board for an extension of the time for completing the preliminary investigation and must report the results of the preliminary investigation to the Inquiry Board.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7073205\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/805/255/#p273\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (e)(6), (f). Investigative Counsel must also \"report and make recommendations to the Commission as directed by the Commission.\" Md. Rule 18-402(d). Indeed, the Maryland Constitution authorizes the Commission to investigate, as well as hear charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md.

The report was not sent to Respondent until January 12, 21\n   days later, after she requested the report upon being notified that charges would be filed.

Respondent then filed extensive objections, which the Commission reviewed before it proceeded to file public charges. A special meeting was called on March 2, 2016 for the Commission to reconsider the case in light of Respondent's objections.

Specifically, Respondent objects to the Commission's striking the interrogatories and request for admissions she served upon Investigative Counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Maryland Rule 18-407(g)(3) provides that the discovery rules for civil actions in the circuit courts shall apply to proceedings before the Commission. That same Rule also states that the \"Chair of the Commission, rather than the court, may limit the scope of discovery, enter protective orders permitted by Rule 2-403, and resolve other discovery issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition to the civil discovery methods mentioned by this Rule, Md. Rule 18-407(f) also allows the Judge to inspect and copy the Commission record and to subpoena witnesses and the production of documents or other tangible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Judge White embraced her right to inspect and copy the Commission record as provided by Md. Rule 18-407(f). In addition, Investigative Counsel furnished her, belatedly, with a copy of the Inquiry Board's report. Wanting still more information to mount a defense of the charges against her, Judge White served Investigative Counsel with interrogatories and a request for admissions. Most of Respondent's interrogatories requested that Investigative Counsel provide further explanation of Judge White's \"sanctionable conduct.\" Respondent also requested the identification of any facts or evidence reported\n   by Investigative Counsel to the Inquiry Board or the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Investigative Counsel proffered several reasons why the Chair of the Commission should strike Judge White's discovery requests. First, Investigative Counsel argued that the civil discovery rules provided in\n   Rule 2-401\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   only apply to a \"party,\" and she was not a \"party,\" but merely an \"attorney appointed by the Commission.\" She also contended that the interrogatories requested her work product, presumably the May 19, 2015 memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Commission agreed with Investigative Counsel and struck Judge White's discovery requests. Specifically, the Chair agreed that Investigative Counsel should not be considered a \"party\" for purposes of applying the civil discovery rules in a judicial discipline case. Before this Court, the Commission continues to assert that the Chair properly limited the scope of discovery as permitted by Md. Rule 18-407(g)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Commission is wrong-discovery cannot be refused on the grounds that Investigative Counsel is not a party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the Chair could entirely prohibit a respondent judge's use of civil discovery because Investigative Counsel is not a \"party,\" Md. Rule 18-407(g)(3) would be meaningless. Moreover, such interpretation would also, to be consistent, preclude discovery sought by Investigative Counsel, which is not a result we intended. We decline such interpretation of the Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The procedures in attorney grievance cases are analogous. In attorney grievance cases, Md. Rule 19-726\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   -governing discovery-like Md. Rule 18-407(g)(3), also provides\n   for application of the civil discovery rules. There, interrogatories and requests for admissions are frequently issued and answered by both Bar Counsel and respondent attorneys.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v. Frost\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160093\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/437/245/#p260\">\n    437 Md. 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 260-61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160093\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/437/245/#p260\">\n    85 A.3d 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Although Investigative Counsel is an agent of the Commission, she serves nearly the same function as Bar Counsel in attorney grievance cases.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Md. Rules 18-404-407 (powers and responsibilities of Investigative Counsel),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Md. Rule 19-703(b) (powers and responsibilities of Bar Counsel). We conclude that for purposes of the discovery rules, Investigative Counsel is a \"party\" to judicial discipline cases and the civil discovery rules apply accordingly.

The Rules already require Investigative Counsel to provide open-file discovery to the respondent judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Rule 18-407(g)(1) (\"Upon request of the judge at any time after service of charges upon the judge, Investigative Counsel shall promptly (A) allow the judge to inspect the Commission Record and to copy all evidence accumulated during the investigation ....\"). Judge White had notice of the charges against her and was informed of the conduct the Commission reviewed when deciding to issue charges. The Commission's record, which she reviewed, indicated that Investigative Counsel intended to rely exclusively upon the video recordings and transcripts of Judge White's behavior at the\n   <em>\n    Joyner\n   </em>\n   hearings-and that is exactly what occurred. Although Respondent claims that she went into her evidentiary hearing \"confused and muddled\" as to the facts giving rise to her charges, the record reveals the contrary. Her detailed arguments in response to the Inquiry Board's report to the Commission, in her motion to dismiss,\n   and her defenses to the charges, all indicate that she perfectly understood the nature of the allegations against her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Because the evidence adduced against her consisted strictly of transcripts of\n   hearings and Jones's complaints that were disclosed to her well before the hearing, although the Commission improperly struck Judge White's discovery requests, we conclude that this mistake did not result in a fundamentally unfair hearing-because it resulted in no prejudice to her. An appropriate discovery response would only have identified these transcripts and complaints and perhaps reproduced them for her attorneys.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Investigative Counsel had already sent to Judge White's counsel copies of the complaints and recordings of each of the disputed hearings on April 17, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    The Commission Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Judge White has several complaints about the evidentiary hearing before the Commission. First, she contends that\n   the Commission violated her due process rights by preventing her from offering relevant evidence, in the form of witness testimony. Specifically, she objects to the Commission's decision to limit her examinations of her witnesses to only ten minutes each. Respondent contends that the witnesses would have presented valuable \"mitigation evidence\" relevant to the charged misconduct and her decision not to recuse herself from the show cause proceedings involving Jones. She asserts that the excluded evidence would have detailed the circumstances giving rise to the contempt finding against Jones and explained the proper functioning and importance of the ADR system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Commission limited Judge White's presentation of witnesses. Investigative Counsel argued that the proffered testimony-regarding the Circuit Court's ADR program and Jones's interactions with opposing counsel-was irrelevant to determining whether Judge White committed sanctionable misconduct. Without explaining the reasoning for its ruling, the Commission limited the testimony of Judge Pierson, Judge Smith, and Judge Handy to ten minutes each. The Commission further limited the testimony of Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Trueman to matters related to the pretrial settlement conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Administrative or quasi-administrative agencies, such as the Commission, \"must observe the basic rules of fairness as to parties appearing before them so as to comport with the requirements of procedural due process ....\"\n   <em>\n    Travers v.

The Commission charged Judge White with misconduct for allegedly treating Jones in an unprofessional manner and failing to recuse herself from his show cause proceedings after stating her bias against him. Although the proffered testimony of Judge White's witnesses might have been relevant for mitigation-to explain why Judge White was justifiably perturbed with Mr. Jones, they were not relevant to the charges of misconduct. A judge cannot justify unprofessional treatment of\n   a litigant on the judge's personal misgivings with that litigant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge White seems to agree that the testimony of these witnesses related only to mitigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Although the testimony was limited in time, her witnesses still managed to testify extensively regarding Judge White's good character and her role as supervisor of the ADR program. Before this Court, Judge White has offered no example of any further evidence that these witnesses could have offered if allowed to testify beyond the limitations imposed by the Commission. We see no violation of due process on this record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zeigler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2017534\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/330/540/#p557\">\n    330 Md. at 559-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2017534\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/330/540/#p557\">\n    625 A.2d 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Investigative Counsel's case consisted merely of the recordings and transcripts of the hearings in\n   <em>\n    Joyner\n   </em>\n   , and Jones's complaints.
