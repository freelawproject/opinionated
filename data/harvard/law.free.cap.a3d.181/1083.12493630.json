(the \"2011 Plan\"), clearly, plainly and palpably violates the Pennsylvania Constitution. This adjudication was based upon the uncontradicted evidentiary record developed in the Commonwealth Court, wherein the Petitioners established that the 2011 Plan was a partisan gerrymander and that this gerrymander was extreme and durable. It was designed to dilute the votes of those who in prior elections voted for the party not in power in order to give the party in power a lasting electoral advantage. In stark contrast, Article I, Section 5 of our Constitution provides: \"Elections shall be free and equal; and no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent the free exercise of the right of suffrage.\" Pa. Const. art. I, \u00a7 5. On this record, it is clear that the 2011 Plan violates Article I, Section 5, since a diluted vote is not an equal vote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Having determined that the 2011 Plan violates our Constitution, the question of the appropriate remedy remained. This Court was compelled to decide whether to perpetuate an unconstitutional districting plan, which would result in the unlawful dilution of our citizens' votes in the impending election, or to rectify the violation of our Commonwealth's Constitution immediately. So stated, our choice was clear. As this Court has aptly recognized, the fundamental rights guaranteed by our organic charter \"cannot lawfully be infringed,\n   even momentarily.\"\n   <em>\n    Pap's A.M. v. City of Erie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1070140\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/571/375/\">\n    571 Pa. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11367121,1070140\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/812/591/\">\n    812 A.2d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 607 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In our January 22 Order,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   this Court directed that, \"should the Pennsylvania General Assembly choose to submit a congressional districting plan that satisfies the requirements\" of that Order, the General Assembly was to submit such a plan to the Governor on or before February 9, 2018. If the Governor accepted the General Assembly's congressional districting plan, this Court ordered such plan to be submitted to the Court on or before February 15, 2018. Thus, the General Assembly had a full eighteen days to submit a plan to the Governor, and the Governor had five days to consider and approve or disapprove the General Assembly's plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This Court recognized that the primary responsibility for drawing congressional districts rested squarely with the legislature, but we also acknowledged that, in the eventuality of the General Assembly not submitting a plan to the Governor, or the Governor not approving the General Assembly's plan within the time specified, it would fall to this Court expeditiously to adopt a plan based upon the evidentiary record developed in the Commonwealth Court. We also offered the opportunity for parties and intervenors to submit proposed remedial districting plans to the Court on or before February 15, 2018. The Court specified that, to comply with the January 22 Order, any remedial congressional districting plan, whether enacted by the General Assembly and Governor or submitted by the parties and intervenors, should consist of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   congressional districts composed of compact and contiguous territory; as nearly equal in population as practicable; and which do not divide any county, city, incorporated town, borough, township, or ward, except where necessary to ensure equality of population.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Order of January 22, 2018, at Paragraph \"Fourth\". Furthermore, the Court advised the Executive Branch Respondents to anticipate that a remedial congressional districting plan would be available by February 19, 2018, and they were directed to take all measures, including adjusting the election calendar if necessary, to ensure that the May 15, 2018 primary election would take place as scheduled under that remedial districting plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court issued a supplemental Order on January 26, 2018, in which the Court appointed Professor Nathaniel Persily as an advisor to assist the Court in adopting,\n   if necessary, a remedial congressional redistricting plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, in that Order, we directed the Pennsylvania General Assembly and/or its Legislative Data Processing Center to submit to the Court data files containing the current boundaries of all Pennsylvania municipalities and precincts. In response, counsel for the General Assembly indicated no such current files existed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Thereafter, on February 7, 2018, this Court filed its Opinion in support of the January 22 Order, setting forth its legal rationale for determining that the 2011 Plan is violative of our Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In explaining the Court's rationale, we emphasized that nothing in the Opinion was intended to conflict with, or in any way alter, the mandate contained in the January 22 Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Neither the General Assembly nor the Governor sought an extension of the dates set forth in our January 22 Order. The General Assembly failed to pass legislation for the Governor's approval, thereby making it impossible for our sister branches to meet the Court's deadline. As a result, it has become the judiciary's duty to fashion an appropriate remedial districting plan, and this Court has proceeded to prepare such a plan, a role which our Court has full constitutional authority and responsibility to assume.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Pursuant to the January 22 Order, certain parties, the intervenors, and several\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   submitted to the Court proposed remedial districting plans for the Court's consideration, all of which were carefully reviewed by the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Proceeding expeditiously, the Court prepared a constitutionally\n   sound plan in accordance with our announced criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After full deliberation and consideration, the Court hereby adopts this remedial plan (\"Remedial Plan\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   , as specifically described below, which shall be implemented forthwith in preparation for the May 15, 2018 primary election.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Remedial Plan is based upon the record developed in the Commonwealth Court, and it draws heavily upon the submissions provided by the parties, intervenors, and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   . It is composed of congressional districts which follow the traditional redistricting criteria of compactness, contiguity, equality of population, and respect for the integrity of political subdivisions. The Remedial Plan splits only 13 counties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of those, four counties are split into three districts and nine are split into two districts. The parties, intervenors, and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   differ in how they calculate municipal and precinct splits, and, as noted earlier, the Legislative Respondents suggest that updated data on precinct and municipal boundaries does not exist. The Remedial Plan is superior or comparable to all plans submitted by the parties, the intervenors, and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   , by whichever Census-provided definition one employs (Minor Civil Divisions, Cities, Boroughs, Townships, and Census Places)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   . The compactness of the plan is superior or comparable to the other submissions, according to the Reock, Schwartzberg, Polsby-Popper, Population Polygon, and Minimum Convex Polygon measures described in the Court's January 26 Order. Here, too, the parties, intervenors, and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   disagree on the precise ways to calculate these measures, and some failed to deliver compactness scores with their submissions. By whichever calculation methodology employed, the Remedial Plan is superior or comparable. Finally, no district has more than a one-person difference in population from any other district, and, therefore, the Remedial Plan achieves the constitutional guarantee of one person, one vote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Accordingly, this 19\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of February, 2018, the Court orders as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, the Pennsylvania primary and general elections for seats in the United States House of Representatives commencing in the year 2018 shall be conducted in accordance with the Remedial Plan as described by the 2010 Census block equivalency (denominated the \"Remedial Plan Census Block Equivalency Files\") and ESRI shape files (denominated the \"Remedial Plan Shape Files\") uploaded to this Court's website at http://www.pacourts.us/news-and-statistics/cases-of-public-interest/league-of-women-voters-et-al-v-the-commonwealth-of-pennsylvania-et-al-159-mm-2017, under the heading \"Order Adopting Remedial Plan\". The Remedial Plan, in its constituent parts, is hereby made part of this Order, and is hereby adopted as the division of this Commonwealth\n   into eighteen congressional districts, unless and until the same shall be lawfully changed. For reference, images of the Remedial Plan are attached at Appendix A, and available in high resolution at the above website; and images of the 2011 Plan are attached at Appendix B, and available in high resolution at the above website. Also uploaded to the above website are computer generated reports describing the Remedial Plan, identifying (1) county/minor civil division/voting district splits, (2) census place and municipal splits, and (3) compactness scores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, Executive Respondents and Respondent General Assembly, including its Legislative Data Processing Center (\"LDPC\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   shall forthwith prepare textual language that describes the Remedial Plan\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and submit the same to the Secretary of the Commonwealth without delay. The Secretary of the Commonwealth shall thereafter file with this Court's Prothonotary a certification of compliance of the preparation of the textual description of the Remedial Plan, along with a copy of the textual description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Third, Respondent Secretary of the Commonwealth shall, without delay, following the preparation of the textual description of the Remedial Plan, publish notice of the Congressional Districts in the Pennsylvania Bulletin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Fourth, to provide for an orderly election process, the schedule for the primary election to be held May 15, 2018 for the election of Representatives to the United States Congress shall be implemented by the Secretary of the Commonwealth and all election officers within the Commonwealth in accordance with the Revised Election Calendar as proposed by the Secretary of the Commonwealth and Commissioner of the Bureau of Commissions, Elections and Legislation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   which Calendar is hereby approved, and is attached to this Order as Appendix C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Fifth, should there be any congressional vacancies existing now or occurring after the entry of this Order, but prior to the commencement of the terms of the members to be elected in the General Election of 2018, they shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired terms from the districts formerly prescribed in the Congressional Redistricting Act of 2011, 25 P.S. \u00a7 3596.301.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Sixth, the Secretary of the Commonwealth is directed to notify this Court by 4:00 p.m. on Tuesday, February 20, 2018, should it foresee any technical issues concerning the implementation of the Remedial Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p

The latest round includes: the submission, within the past few days, of more than a dozen sophisticated redistricting plans; the lack of an opportunity for critical evaluation by all of the parties; the adoption of a judicially created redistricting plan apparently upon advice from a political scientist who has not submitted a report as of record nor appeared\n   as a witness in any court proceeding in this case; and the absence of an adversarial hearing to resolve factual controversies arising in the present remedial phase of this litigation. In these circumstances, the displacement to the judiciary of the political responsibility for redistricting-which is assigned to the General Assembly by the United States Constitution-appears to me to be unprecedented.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-135\">\n   JUSTICE BAER, Dissenting\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Throughout these proceedings, it has been my position that the Pennsylvania Congressional Redistricting Act of 2011 should apply to the impending 2018 election. While I have expressed my misgivings with allowing an election to proceed based upon a constitutionally-flawed map, I continue to conclude that the compressed schedule failed to provide a reasonable opportunity for the General Assembly to legislate a new map in compliance with the federal Constitution's delegation of redistricting authority to state legislatures. U.S. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   My skepticism regarding the time allotted the Legislature has been borne out. Democracy generally, and legislation specifically, entails elaborate and time-consuming processes. Here, regardless of culpability, the Legislature has been unable to pass a remedial map to place on the Governor's desk for signature or veto. Under these circumstances, Pennsylvania and federal law permit the use of the existing, albeit unconstitutional, map for one final election.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Butcher v.

In addition to the reasons set forth in my January 22, 2018 Dissenting Statement, and my February 7, 2018 Dissenting Opinion, which I incorporate herein, I have concerns regarding the constitutionality of the judicially created congressional districts adopted today. Despite the Majority's characterization that this Court \"was compelled to decide whether to perpetuate an unconstitutional districting plan ... or to rectify the violation of our Commonwealth's Constitution immediately,\" Majority Opinion and Order at 1084, three members of this Court cautioned restraint in favor of ensuring the preservation of the legislative process, as set forth in the United States Constitution. U.S. CONST. art I, \u00a7 4, cl. 1. I cannot agree that the Legislature was afforded the time necessary to accomplish the immense task of redistricting in accordance with the criteria imposed by this Court. Based on the foregoing, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
