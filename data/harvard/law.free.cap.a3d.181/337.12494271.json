Appellant claims the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence that she was \"informed\" that she was \"the subject of an official investigation of a violation of law\" when she falsely identified herself.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   After careful review, we agree, and reverse Appellant's conviction for False ID, vacate the corresponding sentence, but otherwise leave the remainder of Appellant's judgment of sentence intact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The trial court summarized the facts adduced at trial as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Philadelphia Police Officer Thomas Dempsey, assigned to the 35th District, testified that on June 2, 2015, at approximately 3:00 a.m., he performed his tour of duty in the 5531 North 5\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street area of the city of Philadelphia. Officer Dempsey stated that he was traveling northbound on 5th Street in a patrol car with his partner, Officer Hanton, approaching Duncannon [street] when he came into contact with [Appellant] operating a white Nissan Altima with New York tag GSD4632. He observed [Appellant] head westbound on Duncannon at 5th Street and then make a right-hand turn onto 5th Street, heading northbound, without using a turn signal. Officer Dempsey activated his lights and sirens and pulled [Appellant] over approximately three to four (3-4) blocks up at 5531 North 5th Street for failing to signal on the turn. Officer Dempsey stated that he then approached the driver's side of the vehicle and that [Appellant] was the only person in the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Officer Dempsey testified that he asked [Appellant] for her license, registration, and insurance. [Appellant] was unable to provide any form of identification and notified Officer Dempsey that the car was rented. [Appellant] could not\n   produce any documents to prove a rental agreement. Subsequent to failing to give Officer Dempsey any of the requested identification, [Appellant] gave him the name of \"Chelsea Thomas\" with a date of birth of 12/21/90. [Appellant] provided Officer Dempsey with a TD Bank credit card with the name \"Chelsea Thomas\" and a social security number. Officer Dempsey stated that from his investigation, the name \"Chelsea Thomas\" came back with a suspended license. Officer Dempsey stated that he and his partner then decided to live stop the vehicle for the suspended license. Officer Dempsey testified that he and his partner followed procedure: they notified the Parking Authority, removed [Appellant] from the vehicle, and performed a search incident to the live stop of the vehicle to \"make sure there was [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] no dangerous things in the vehicle and to inventory anything of the driver, money that was there, whatever was valuable, just to cover all of my bases.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Officer Dempsey testified that upon searching the vehicle pursuant to the live stop, he noticed a 12-ounce green can of Mountain Dew in the driver's seat cup holder, which he testified caught his eye because it was larger than usual, looked swollen, and there was no condensation. Officer Dempsey testified that he possesses ample experience discovering narcotics hidden inside soda cans; during his years on the force, he has uncovered approximately fifteen (15) to twenty (20) false cans, most of them soda cans, and only one of them was empty and did not contain narcotics. From this experience, Officer Dempsey stated that he has made several narcotics arrests where narcotics were hidden in false cans.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Dempsey testified that he touched the can and felt that it was rock hard[,] which further indicated from his experience that this was a false can. Officer Dempsey proceeded to pick up the can and to unscrew the top, which revealed that the can was indeed false; inside the can were seventy-six (76) small baggies with an off-white chunky substance, crack cocaine. Officer Dempsey stated that he arrested [Appellant] and placed her in the back of his vehicle. He continued his search of the vehicle pursuant to live stop procedure and discovered a driver's license with a different name under the brake pedal on the driver's side floor area. Officer Dempsey ran the discovered driver's license through the system to find that name also had a suspended license.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Dempsey testified that he continued with the live stop and [was] completing paperwork when Officer Snell arrived as backup. Officer Snell completed an inventory search of the trunk of [Appellant]'s vehicle in Officer Dempsey's presence. Upon opening the trunk, Officer Dempsey observed a clear sandwich bag with eighty-four (84) zip tie baggies with crack cocaine, an off-white chunky substance inside them. Officer Dempsey stated that in total he recovered one hundred and sixty (160) baggies of crack cocaine later placed on Property Receipt No. 31976333. The false Mountain Dew can was placed on Property Receipt No. 3197634. A search incident to arrest recovered one hundred and forty-five dollars ($145) in US currency from [Appellant]'s front pants pocket later placed on Property Receipt No. 3197635. Officer Dempsey stated that the vehicle was live stopped and [Appellant] transported to the 35th District for processing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Officer Dempsey testified that the identification was found on the driver's side floor area under the brake pedal. Officer Dempsey stated that the name of\n   the driver's license was [Appellant]'s, Tyleesia Kitchen, and had a date of birth of 7/10/90 with a picture matching what [Appellant] looked like on the day in question. Officer Dempsey stated that this information was inconsistent with the information provided by [Appellant] when he first asked her for her identification. He explained that [Appellant] first gave him the name \"Chelsea Thomas\" which, through further investigation, he believed to be [Appellant]'s girlfriend. Officer Dempsey restated that he determined that both \"Tyleesia Kitchen\" and \"Chelsea Thomas\" did not have valid licenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Officer Dempsey further testified that in his nine years on the job he has seen fifteen to twenty (15-20) false cans. Officer Dempsey stated that most of these cans are soda cans and that he has also observed \"Fix-A-Flat cans, a Pringles can, but the majority are soda cans.\" Officer Dempsey stated that he has found narcotics in these false cans fourteen (14) out of fifteen (15) times, specifying only one occasion where a false can was empty. Officer Dempsey testified that the can in the instant case caught his eye before he touched it. He stated, \"[i]t looked like it was swelled up. There was no water dripping off of it as if it was cold. It was swelled-up looking and that caught my eye and that's why I touched it. I immediately felt it was rock hard.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   When asked to describe the area where [Appellant]'s vehicle was stopped, Officer Dempsey testified that it was at 5\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and Olney where [Appellant] pulled over to the right, placing her vehicle only partially in a parking spot. Officer Dempsey stated that [Appellant]'s vehicle was interfering with traffic as half of [Appellant]'s vehicle was sticking out in the north bound [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] lane causing cars to have to go partly in the southbound lane to get past her. Officer Dempsey described the area as heavily populated and busy. Officer Dempsey stated that this area is well[ ]known by police to be a common site for loud music, narcotics calls and arrests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   On cross-examination, Officer Dempsey affirmed that [Appellant]'s car had New York plates and that it was rented. [Appellant] told Officer Dempsey that \"Chelsea rented it.\" Because [Appellant] did not refer to herself in the first person, Officer Dempsey stated \"that was one of the things that stuck out because either she was talking about herself in the third person or she just messed up.\" When asked to review the notes of testimony from the preliminary hearing, marked as Defense Exhibit 1 (D-1), Officer Dempsey affirmed that he stated that there were no cars parked on 5\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street, there were plenty of spots, and that [Appellant] had pulled over in a legal parking spot. Officer Dempsey further affirmed that he answered in the affirmative at the preliminary hearing when asked if it was not until he had removed [Appellant] from the vehicle and actually picked up the can that he realized it was a false can.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Officer Dempsey testified that after he determined that Chelsea Thomas had a suspended license, he removed [Appellant] from the car and placed her in the police car, un-handcuffed and shut the police car door. Officer Dempsey affirmed that he began the inventory search of the vehicle once he verified that [Appellant] had a suspended license. Officer Dempsey explained that he believed [Appellant] to be \"Chelsea Thomas\" because she provided that name and the social security number.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Trial Court Opinion, 6/15/16, at 2-6 (footnote and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Commonwealth charged Appellant with possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance (PWID), 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) ; possession of a controlled substance, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(16) ; and False ID. Appellant filed a timely suppression motion on August 4, 2015. On October 7, 2015, the trial court denied Appellant's suppression motion, conducted a non-jury trial, and found Appellant guilty on all counts. On December 9, 2015, the trial court sentenced Appellant to 6-23 months' incarceration and 2 years' probation for PWID, and a concurrent term of 12 months' probation for False ID. The court imposed no further penalty for Appellant's possession conviction. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on January 5, 2016, and a timely, court-ordered Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement on February 25, 2016. The trial court filed its Rule 1925(a) statement on June 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A panel of this Court affirmed Appellant's judgment of sentence on January 12, 2017. On January 26, 2017, Appellant filed a timely application for\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   reargument. On March 10, 2017, this Court granted\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   reargument, and simultaneously withdrew the January 12, 2017 memorandum affirming Appellant's judgment of sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Appellant now presents the following question for our review: \"Was not the evidence insufficient to sustain a conviction for false identification to law enforcement where the police officers never informed [A]ppellant that she was the subject of an official investigation?\" Appellant's Substituted Brief at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Our standard of review of sufficiency claims is well settled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A claim challenging the sufficiency of the evidence is a question of law. Evidence will be deemed sufficient to support the verdict when it establishes each material element of the crime charged and the commission thereof by the accused, beyond a reasonable doubt. Where the evidence offered to support the verdict is in contradiction to the physical facts, in contravention to human experience and the laws of nature, then the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law. When reviewing a sufficiency claim[,] the court is required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict winner giving the prosecution the benefit of all reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

False ID constitutes a misdemeanor of the third degree. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4914(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Appellant argues that the police must\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     expressly\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   inform an individual that they are \"the subject of an official investigation of a violation of law[,]\" for that individual's subsequent presentation of false identification to constitute a crime. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4914(a). The Commonwealth disagrees, contending that an individual can be so \"informed\" by the attendant circumstances, including the conduct of the investigating officer, and that no spoken pronouncement is required by the statute. Commonwealth's Substituted Brief at 7-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court adopted the Commonwealth's position. It found that Appellant was informed that she was subject to an investigation by \"the surrounding circumstances of the traffic stop[,]\" which the court concluded, \"implied there was an official investigation of a violation of law prior to the presentment of false identification.\" TCO at 11. The trial court distinguished the facts of this case from this Court's decision in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Barnes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7281309\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/14/128/\">\n    14 A.3d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Super. 2011). The Commonwealth supports the trial court's reasoning, arguing that the statute \"does not require a verbal pronouncement, or any particular method of informing.\" Commonwealth's Substituted Brief at 5. Appellant argues that the trial court's interpretation of the False ID statute was rejected by our Supreme Court's decision\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re D.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206479\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/614/650/\">\n    614 Pa. 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315532,4206479\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/39/968/\">\n    39 A.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, the police did not make an express statement to Appellant that she was under investigation prior to her presentment of false credentials. There is also no question before us whether Appellant's credentials were false, or whether the police were in uniform. Appellant does not dispute that a reasonable person would likely understand that they were under investigation given the attendant circumstances of this case. Accordingly, there are no facts in dispute, and the matter before us is a pure question of law regarding the interpretation of the legislature's use of the term, \"informed[,]\" in the False ID statute. Under such circumstances, \"our standard of review is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and our scope of [review] is plenary.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

The statute does not specifically state that a person may be \"informed\" of an investigation by inference alone. In crafting the False ID statute, the legislature immediately modified the term \"informed\" with the phrase, \"by a law enforcement officer[.]\" 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4914(a). The use of the term \"informed\" in this context\n   strongly suggests that the legislature intended a statutory element akin to a formal notice requirement, rather than imposing an additional\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element focused on the accused's inferential knowledge about the presence of an investigation at the time he or she presents false credentials.

The Commonwealth cites the presence of the air fresheners, which are recognized as useful in masking the odor of narcotics, the high crime area, and the fact that neither the driver nor [Barnes] could produce any actual identification. Assuming, for purposes of this discussion, that the circumstances of the stop provided grounds for an investigative detention, we would agree that the statute would be violated by the provision of false information after being provided proper notice. However, the stumbling block to the Commonwealth's argument is Officer Reeder's admission that the investigation he referenced in notifying [Barnes] that he was now the subject of an official investigation was the failure to provide truthful information. Officer Reeder was asked, \"So your official investigation was involving that he was giving you a false name?\" To this question, Officer Reeder replied, \"Yes, after the second time.\" Going back to our initial point of discussion, if [Barnes] was not yet under official investigation for a violation of law when asked for his name and DOB, the provision of false information was not a violation of law. Thus, that failure to provide true information cannot constitute the basis for the official investigation of a violation of law. Officer Reeder may very well have been investigating [Barnes'] provision of false information regarding his identity; however, such investigation was not for a violation of law pursuant to Section 4914.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Barnes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7281309\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/14/128/\">\n    14 A.3d at 131-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

As noted above, a person violates the statute if he furnishes law enforcement authorities with false information about his identity \"after being informed by a law enforcement officer who is in uniform or who has identified himself as a law enforcement officer that the person is the subject of an official investigation of a violation of law.\" 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4914. Under the plain language of the statute, three conditions must be satisfied before an individual will be found to have violated the statute by providing false information about his identity. First, if the law enforcement officer is not in uniform, the officer must identify himself as a law enforcement officer. Second, the individual must be informed\n   by the law enforcement officer that he is the subject of an official investigation of a violation of law. Third, the individual must have furnished law enforcement authorities with false information after being informed by the law enforcement officer that he was the subject of an official investigation of a violation of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   We cannot agree with the Commonwealth's suggestion that an individual may be \"informed\" of an officer's identity and/or purpose by surrounding circumstances.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In stating that an individual violates Section 4914 when he provides false information to law enforcement authorities \"after being informed by a law enforcement officer\" that he is the subject of an official investigation, the General Assembly made clear its intent that such information must be provided to the individual by the law enforcement officer.

In the instant case, we are not faced with what notice a law enforcement officer must give a passenger, as was the issue in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Barnes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Moreover, in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , plainclothes police officers, who were brandishing firearms,\n   stopped the appellant, who was not in a vehicle, without notifying him that they were law enforcement officers.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315532,4206479\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/39/968/\">\n    39 A.3d at 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   is distinguishable because there was no police uniform, no marked police vehicle, no lights, no sirens, and no traffic stop conducted under the authority of Section 6308. The notice of investigation that a lawful traffic stop provides the driver of a vehicle was never an issue in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Therefore, neither\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Barnes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   nor\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   required interpretation of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4914 in conjunction with 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6308.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   It has long been the law of this Commonwealth that everyone is presumed to know the law and that ignorance is no excuse.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. McBryde\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459202\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/909/835/#p838\">\n    909 A.2d 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 838 (Pa. Super. 2006) (citing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Kearney\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1018242\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/136/78/\">\n    136 Pa.Super. 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20A.2d%20159\">\n    7 A.2d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1939) ). When read\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   , Section 4914's requirement that a law enforcement officer must inform an individual that she is under investigation is satisfied with respect to\n   <strong>\n    the driver\n   </strong>\n   of a vehicle when a law enforcement officer conducts a traffic stop under Section 6308 of Pennsylvania's Motor Vehicle Code (\"the Vehicle Code\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the Vehicle Code expressly authorizes law enforcement officers to stop drivers who are suspected of violating the Vehicle Code, and it requires the driver to produce,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , identification. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6308. The obligation of a driver to produce identification is not optional; rather, during a lawful traffic stop, it must be produced upon demand. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1511.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   There can be no dispute that in this Commonwealth, a driver is required to stop her vehicle when a law enforcement officer lawfully directs her to do so. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6308. When a law enforcement officer, who is in full uniform and operating a police vehicle with its lights and siren activated, initiates a traffic stop pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6308, the driver of the vehicle being stopped is presumed to know that she is under investigation for a suspected violation of the Vehicle Code, and she is presumed to know that she is obligated to produce identification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The argument that Appellant, as\n   <strong>\n    the driver\n   </strong>\n   of the vehicle, needed an additional and express verbal warning that she was under investigation is specious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Under the Majority's interpretation, a driver who is subjected to a lawful traffic stop may provide false identification, yet avoid conviction under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4914, if the police officer who conducted the traffic stop does not expressly and verbally reiterate to the driver that she is under investigation. Stated differently, the authority of a uniformed officer in a police vehicle using flashing lights and a siren is manifest and mandates that the driver stop the car and provide identification pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6308. However, in the Majority's view, that authority does not require the driver to provide accurate identification under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4914 ; rather, it allows the driver to provide false identification with impunity. I cannot conclude that the legislature intended this unreasonable and absurd result. Therefore, I am constrained to respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The term \"apprise,\" means to \"inform or\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      tell (someone)\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    .\" The New Oxford American Dictionary 76 (1st ed. 2001) (emphasis added).
