This appeal raises two questions: whether the grant program violated the Religious Aid Clause of the New Jersey Constitution and, if so, whether the Religious Aid Clause conflicts with the Free Exercise Clause of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Religious Aid Clause has been a part of New Jersey's history since the 1776 Constitution. The clause guarantees that \"[n]o person shall ... be obliged to pay ... taxes ... for building or repairing any church or churches, place or places of worship, or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    N.J. Const.\n   </em>\n   art. I, \u00b6 3. The clause reflects a historic and substantial state interest. We find that the plain language of the Religious Aid Clause bars the use of taxpayer funds to repair and restore churches, and that Morris County's program ran afoul of that longstanding provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Morris County and the grant recipients claim that to withhold grants from eligible churches would violate their rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The County and the churches rely heavily on\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer\n   </em>\n   , 582 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605129\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2012/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 2012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605129\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2012/\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), for support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the case before us, all of the churches have active congregations, and all have conducted regular worship services in one or more structures repaired with grant funds. Several churches specifically explained that they sought funds in order to be able to continue to host religious services. We do not believe\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   would require that grants be considered and extended to religious institutions under those circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We therefore reverse the trial court's decision to uphold the grants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 1992, the voters of Morris County approved a referendum to create a trust for open space and farmland preservation. The trust was funded by a county property tax. Ten years later, the voters authorized the County Freeholder Board to permit historic preservation funding under the trust. Today, the trust is known as the Morris County Open Space, Farmland, Floodplain Protection and Historic Preservation Trust Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the time of the grants in question, the trust considered applications to stabilize, repair, rehabilitate, renovate, restore, improve, protect, or preserve historic properties. To be eligible for consideration, a property had to be located in Morris\n   County and\n   either be listed on the National or New Jersey Register of Historic Places or be eligible for listing by the State historic preservation office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Only four kinds of entities could apply for grants: municipal governments within Morris County; Morris County government; charitable conservancies whose purpose includes historic preservation; and religious institutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A review board evaluated applications and made recommendations to the Freeholder Board. Among other things, the review board considered the significance of the property, its physical condition and proposed use, the applicant's ability to match the funds requested, and the project's relationship to heritage education and tourism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Freeholder Board approved final awards. For religious institutions, grants could fund assessment reports, preparation of construction documents, construction projects for a building's exterior as well as its mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems, and other items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Certain conditions applied to grant recipients. Successful applicants that received construction grants of more than $50,000 cumulatively, over any number of funding cycles, had to execute a thirty-year easement agreement with the County. The \"easement is a deed restriction that is used to assure long-term preservation of a historic property through proper maintenance and by limiting changes in use or appearance and preventing demolition of the property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Grantees were also required to provide public access to properties that received grant funds. The County and the grant recipient were to \"negotiate the days and hours that the property [would] be open to the public.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   All work on a project had to be completed within two years once a grant was awarded; a one-year extension could be sought. Applicants who received funding also had to list their property on the National and New Jersey Registers of Historic Places.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   From 2012 to 2015, the Freeholder Board approved a total of $11,112,370 in grants from the trust fund. The Board awarded $4,634,394, or 41.7 percent, to twelve churches. The grants funded the preparation of construction documents and plans, and the restoration of church buildings, towers, parish houses, windows, and other items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   According to the parties' joint statement of stipulated facts, all twelve churches \"have active congregations\" and all \"have conducted regular worship services in one or more of the structures\" for which grant funds have been or will be used. All twelve houses of worship are Christian churches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In addition to the stipulation, the record also includes the grant applications that the churches submitted, which detailed how the requested funds would be used and why they were needed. Several successful applicants specifically stated that funds were needed to allow the church to offer religious services. The Presbyterian Church in Morristown, for example, sought funds to restore the exterior of its chapel. The Church explained that a grant would \"historically preserve the building allowing its continued use by our congregation for worship services as well as by the community and many other outside organizations that use it on a regular basis.\" The Church received a preservation grant to repair the chapel's roof and the air shaft in the church building; to pay for finishes, moisture protection, and other costs; and to finance interior carpentry, masonry, and concrete work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Church of the Redeemer received grants for the restoration of the exterior of its church building and parish house. As to the building, the Church wrote in its application that \"[t]he impact of restoring the large slate roof and tower is entirely positive. It will restore a key structural element that has failed and assist in assuring that the building can continue in its existing use as a church and as an important building in Morristown.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Saint Peter's Episcopal Church of Morristown sought and received funds to repair the interior of its church tower. The Church observed that the funding would \"ensure continued safe public access to the church for worship, periods of solitude and meditation during the week, and several concerts throughout the year, as well as the treasures the church and tower contain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The First Baptist Church of Ledgewood received funds to create preservation plans, in particular, for \"the tower, heating system, and the original stained glass window.\" The application noted that \"[p]reservation of the Ledgewood Baptist Church will enable the congregation to continue to provide religious and community activities to the county's diverse population.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At least one application reveals that grant funds financed the restoration of religious imagery. The First Presbyterian Church of Boonton received funds to restore its \"Rose Window\" and \"Walk to Emmaus\" window.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Interior photos of both windows are in the record. The Rose Window is above the entrance to the chapel; the \"long, arched\" Emmaus Window is located directly in front of the altar and depicts Jesus and two disciples. The Church explained in its application that \"[p]reservation and repair of stained glass windows increase the beauty and the ambiance of the structure, as viewed from inside and outside.\" It is not clear from the record whether the stained glass windows at the First Baptist Church of Ledgewood, noted above, depict religious images.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On December 1, 2015, the Freedom from Religion Foundation (FFRF) and David Steketee, a member of the group and a Morris County resident and taxpayer, (plaintiffs), filed a complaint in Superior Court. The complaint named the Freeholder Board, the review board, and the Morris County Treasurer, in his official capacity, (collectively, Morris County), as defendants. Plaintiffs\n   asserted that the grants were unconstitutional and violated Steketee's substantive constitutional rights under the New Jersey Civil Rights Act, N.J.S.A. 10:6-2(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants removed the matter to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The District Court later granted plaintiffs' motion to remand the case to state court. The court observed that plaintiffs \"opted to allege a violation of their state rights, placing this case squarely within the state court,\" and explained that \"[a]lthough Defendants' arguments center around potential federal defenses they may raise, that does not bring Plaintiffs' original cause of action within [federal] jurisdiction.\" After the remand, plaintiffs amended the complaint to include the grant recipients-the twelve churches-as defendants (Churches).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   All parties moved for summary judgment. On January 9, 2017, the trial court granted defendants' motion and denied plaintiffs' cross-motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In a statement of reasons, the trial court noted that the case implicated several provisions\n   of the New Jersey Constitution and centered on the Religious Aid Clause. The court concluded \"that the only thing that is clear about [the Religious Aid Clause's] intended meaning is that it is not meant to be read literally\" and that the grants were examples of \"benevolent neutrality\" on the part of the government, consistent with \"the spirit of our state and federal Constitutions.\" For support, the court relied on\n   <em>\n    Resnick v.

I, Para. 4 and 5.\" The court added that the Religious Aid Clause \"must also be harmonized with\" provisions in the Constitution that allow for eminent domain and the funding of historic preservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The court also noted that \"[e]xcluding historical churches from receipt of reimbursements available to all historical buildings would be tantamount to impermissibly withholding ... general benefits to certain citizens on the basis of their religion,\" contrary to federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We granted plaintiffs' motion for direct certification.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304616,12304634\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/230/478/\">\n    230 N.J. 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304616,12304608,12304634\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/974/\">\n    169 A.3d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).

Const.\n   </em>\n   art. I, \u00b6 3. The clause states that no person shall \"be obliged to pay tithes, taxes, or other rates for building or repairing any church or churches, place or places of worship, or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry, contrary to what\n   he believes to be right or has deliberately and voluntarily engaged to perform.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"331456\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/140/366/#p378\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The text of the Constitution has deep roots in our State's history.\n   <em>\n    The CONCESSIONS and Agreement of the Lords Propriators of the Province of New Cesarea or New Jersey to and with all and every the Adventurers and all such as shall settle or plant there\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Concessions\n   </em>\n   ), dated February 10, 1664, is considered the first document for the governance of what was then a province.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Samuel Smith,\n   <em>\n    The History of the Colony of Nova-Caesaria, or New Jersey\n   </em>\n   61, 512-21 (1877).

To that end, the General Assembly of the province was granted the power to \"appoint such and soe many Ministers or Preachers as they shall think fitt, and to establish their maintenance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In the years that followed, charters were enacted for the governance of East and West New Jersey, and each contained a provision in support of religious freedom.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Charter or Fundamental Laws of West New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ch.

Erdman, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    The New Jersey Constitution of 1776\n   </em>\n   4 (1929). It appears, though, that the establishment of religion provided for in the\n   <em>\n    Concessions\n   </em>\n   was successful on paper only. Esbeck, 2004\n   <em>\n    BYU L. Rev.\n   </em>\n   at 1470-71. In reality, \"a diverse array of religious traditions\" took hold in New Jersey and \"produced a spirit of toleration and liberty by the time independence was declared.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1468. And \"in 1776, New Jersey settled any lingering uncertainty concerning church-state affairs by expressly prohibiting in its constitution the establishment of religion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1472.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   New Jersey's first Constitution, adopted on July 2, 1776, rejected the establishment of and compelled support for religion in two clauses. The first clause contains an express guarantee of the right to freedom from compelled support. The Religious Aid Clause in the 1776 Constitution provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   That no Person shall ever within this Colony be deprived of the inestimable Privilege of worshipping Almighty God in a Manner agreeable to the Dictates of his own Conscience; nor under any Pretence whatsoever compelled to attend any Place of Worship, contrary to his own Faith and Judgment;\n   <em>\n    nor shall any Person within this Colony ever be obliged to pay Tithes, Taxes, or any other Rates, for the Purpose of building or repairing any Church or Churches, Place or Places of Worship, or for the Maintenance of any Minister or Ministry, contrary to what he believes to be right, or has deliberately or voluntarily engaged himself to perform.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    N.J. Const. of 1776\n   </em>\n   art. XVIII (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The second provision contains language similar to the federal Establishment Clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   That there shall be no Establishment of any one religious Sect in this Province in Preference to another; and that no\n   <em>\n    Protestant Inhabitant\n   </em>\n   of this Colony shall be denied the Enjoyment of any civil Right merely on Account of his religious Principles; but that\n   <em>\n    all Persons, professing a Belief in the Faith of any Protestant Sect\n   </em>\n   , who shall demean themselves peaceably under the Government as hereby established, shall be capable of being elected into any Office of Profit or Trust, or being a Member of either Branch of the Legislature, &amp; shall fully &amp; freely enjoy every Privilege &amp; Immunity enjoyed by others their Fellow-Subjects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    N.J. Const. of 1776\n   </em>\n   art. XIX (second emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The two clauses, in combination, reveal that (1) the freedom from being compelled to fund religious institutions through taxation-including the repair of churches-was a grant of personal liberty, and (2) unlike other rights, that freedom was not limited to Protestants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The fact that New Jersey's first Constitution included a Religious Aid Clause is highly significant. First, it underscores the fundamental nature of the religious freedom clauses in our State's history. The 1776 Constitution is a brief document that outlines the organization of government and the powers of the executive, the legislative council, and the general assembly. The document guarantees only a few distinct rights: the right to vote,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   art. IV; the right to religious freedom,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   arts. XVIII-XIX; the right of an accused to have counsel and call witnesses,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   art. XVI; and the right to trial by jury,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   art. XXII. Viewed in that context, it is telling that the founders devoted careful attention to religious liberty in the first Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, of the twelve states that adopted constitutions from 1776 to 1780, none included a compelled support clause as precise and clear as the Religious Aid Clause. South Carolina adopted a compelled support provision in its second constitution, which it framed exclusively in terms of worship: \"No person shall, by law, be obliged to pay towards the maintenance and support of a religious worship that he does not freely join in, or has not voluntarily engaged to support.\"\n   <em>\n    S.C. Const. of 1778\n   </em>\n   art. XXXVIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Pennsylvania and Vermont adopted compelled support clauses that are similar to each other; both are more expansive than South Carolina's but less detailed than New Jersey's.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pa. Const. of 1776\n   </em>\n   , Decl. of Rights, art. II (\"[N]o man ought or of right can be compelled to attend any religious worship, or erect or support any place of worship, or maintain any ministry, contrary to, or against, his own free will and consent ....\");\n   <em>\n    Vt. Const. of 1777\n   </em>\n   ch. I, \u00b6 3 (\"[N]o man ought, or of right can be compelled to attend any religious worship, or erect, or support any place of worship, or maintain any minister, contrary to the dictates of his conscience ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   North Carolina's first constitution, which took effect several months after New Jersey's, contained a provision most like the Religious Aid Clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [N]either shall any person, on any pre[t]ence whatsoever, be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his own faith or judgment, nor be obliged to pay, for the purchase of any glebe, or the building of any house of worship, or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry, contrary to what he believes right, [or] has voluntarily and personally engaged to perform[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    N.C. Const. of 1776\n   </em>\n   art. XXXIV.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Even that relatively detailed clause, though, does not mention the \"repair\" of houses of worship or ban payment of \"taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.J. Const. of 1776\n   </em>\n   art. XVIII. New Jersey's Religious Aid Clause thus stands out as particularly specific for its time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   It is also worth noting that among the first states to adopt a constitution, some did not prohibit compelled support. Maryland's first constitution permitted the legislature to collect tax dollars \"for the support of the Christian religion.\"\n   <em>\n    Md. Const. of 1776\n   </em>\n   , Decl. of Rights, art. XXXIII. Massachusetts, the last of the earliest states to disestablish, Esbeck, 2004\n   <em>\n    BYU L. Rev.\n   </em>\n   at 1458, permitted towns, \"at their own expense,\" to support \"the institution of the public worship of God\" and \"Protestant teachers of ... religion.\"\n   <em>\n    Mass. Const. of 1780\n   </em>\n   art. III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Religious Aid Clause in New Jersey's first Constitution also stands out in the broader context of the process states followed to ban the establishment of and compelled support for religion. That\n   process reflected the views of some \"religious sects [that] opposed establishment on the ground that it injured religion and subjected it to the control of civil authorities.

The document began with a detailed list of individual rights and, among\n   other things, moved the Religious Aid Clause to a new Article I, Paragraph 3 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   No person shall be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping Almighty God in a manner agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience; nor under any pretence whatever be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his faith and judgment; nor shall any person be obliged to pay tithes, taxes, or other rates for building or repairing any church or churches, place or places of worship, or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry, contrary to what he believes to be right, or has deliberately and voluntarily engaged to perform.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The words \"other\" and \"the purpose of\" do not appear in the Religious Aid Clause in the second Constitution, and no record explains those edits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   A streamlined Establishment Clause, which removed all restrictions to Protestants, can be found at Paragraph 4:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   There shall be no establishment of one religious sect in preference to another; no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust; and no person shall be denied the enjoyment of any civil right merely on account of his religious principles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    N.J.

A revised Establishment Clause, along with strong non-discrimination language inspired by a similar provision in the New York Constitution,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   3\n   <em>\n    Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of 1947\n   </em>\n   (Proceedings) 451, appears in Paragraphs 4 and 5. The text of those provisions remains unchanged since 1947:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   3. No person shall be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping Almighty God in a manner agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience; nor under any pretense whatever be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his faith and judgment; nor shall any person be obliged to pay tithes, taxes, or other rates for building or repairing any church or churches, place or places of worship, or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry, contrary to what he believes to be right or has deliberately and voluntarily engaged to perform.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   4. There shall be no establishment of one religious sect in preference to another; no religious or racial test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   5. No person shall be denied the enjoyment of any civil or military right, nor be discriminated against in the exercise of any civil or military right, nor be segregated\n   in the militia or in the public schools, because of religious principles, race, color, ancestry or national origin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    N.J.

The provision was not inspired by the \"Blaine Amendment\"; nor was it a response to anti-immigrant or anti-Catholic bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \"[T]he Blaine Amendment is a remnant of nineteenth-century religious bigotry promulgated by nativist political leaders who were alarmed by the growth of immigrant populations and who had a particular disdain for Catholics.\" Joseph P.

According to plaintiffs, the challenged grants fall squarely within the Religious Aid Clause's prohibition and are unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In plaintiffs' view, the Federal Constitution does not compel a different result. Plaintiffs assert that the Religious Aid Clause\n   does not violate either the Free Exercise or the Equal Protection Clauses. \"\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   's free exercise protections do not apply to this case,\" plaintiffs contend, because \"[b]uilding or repairing houses of worship directly advances religion,\n   <em>\n    even if that is not the government's intent\n   </em>\n   .\" Plaintiffs distinguish between church buildings that are active houses of worship and facilities that either never were or are no longer used for religious purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In addition, plaintiffs contend that the County's program would be unlikely to pass muster under the federal Establishment Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The ACLU agrees with plaintiffs' interpretation of the Religious Aid Clause and adds that the history of the clause does not support an exception for \"historical preservation.\" The ACLU also submits that no other part of the State Constitution overrides the Religious Aid Clause. Like plaintiffs, the ACLU maintains that the Free Exercise Clause does not compel funding of historic-preservation grants that support religious worship. In addition, the ACLU argues that the federal Establishment Clause would not permit the grants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Churches dispute plaintiffs' interpretation of the Religious Aid Clause. They assert that the clause, read in context, permits religious institutions to participate in programs that advance secular government interests and are governed by neutral criteria. According to the Churches, the language of the Religious Aid Clause cannot properly be read in isolation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Churches also argue that plaintiffs' interpretation of the Religious Aid Clause violates the First Amendment under\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   . According to the Churches, the grants challenged in this case cannot be distinguished from the program at issue in\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Churches add that the federal Establishment Clause does not call for a different result. Finally, the Churches maintain that there are no grounds to order them to refund the grants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Like the Churches, the Morris County defendants focus on\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   and argue that \"the First Amendment jurisprudence of the United States Supreme\n   Court requires\" that the grants be upheld. Morris County adds that excluding churches from the list of eligible grant applicants \"would force the County to deny religious institutions equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\" They join the Churches in asking the Court to uphold the grant program and affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Becket agrees with defendants that the grant program here is governed by\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   because it \"is a generally available public benefit whose recipients are selected through a competitive grant application process based on secular criteria and ... is open to 'all historic sites within the State' without reference to religious status.\" Becket stresses that to exclude religious groups from the program \"because of their religious status\" would \"violate[ ] the Free Exercise Clause under\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   .\" According to Becket, \"New Jersey's anti-establishment interest\" in this matter \"is nil,\" and any such state interest \"would be insufficient because the grant program does not even come close to violating the federal Establishment Clause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The NJHT represents that it has awarded \"grant funds for historic preservation of eligible properties owned by religious institutions for decades.\" To exclude religious institutions from public benefits \"based solely on their religious status,\" the NJHT asserts, would conflict with the State and Federal Constitutions and related case law. The NJHT contends that \"the trial court aptly analogized Morris County's program to Detroit's revitalization program considered in\"\n   <em>\n    American Atheists\n   </em>\n   . The NJHT also argues that because the programs have a \"neutral public purpose and are administered in a way that ensures secular use of funds,\" the programs pass muster under the religion clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The first step in our analysis is to determine whether the historic preservation grants awarded to repair twelve churches\n   violated the Religious Aid Clause of the State Constitution.

I, \u00b6 3.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The clause does not prevent local or State authorities from providing taxpayer-funded police, fire, and emergency services to houses of worship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Resnick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1382055\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/77/88/\">\n    77 N.J. at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20A.2d%20944\">\n    389 A.2d 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor does it preclude the provision of other services tied to general public safety. Instead, for more than 240 years, the Religious Aid Clause has banned the use of public funds to build or repair any place of worship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Here, the County awarded $4.6 million to twelve churches to repair active houses of worship-from roofs to bell towers, from stained glass windows to ventilation systems. The use of public funds to pay for those repairs violated the plain language of the Religious Aid Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The clause does not ask about the governing body's intent-that is, whether the authorities meant to fund repairs to churches, to preserve history and promote tourism, or both. In fact, the change from the 1776 Constitution to the 1844 Constitution removed the bracketed phrase \"no taxes ... for [the purpose of] building or repairing any church.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.J.

Thus, for most of its existence, the Religious Aid Clause has banned public funding to repair a\n   house of worship without regard to some other non-religious purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, there is no exception for historic preservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Nor is there a basis to distinguish between \"restoration\" and \"repair\" under the Religious Aid Clause. The terms mean the same thing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (3d ed. 2009) (defining \"repair\" as \"[t]o restore (a damaged, worn, or faulty object or structure) to good or proper condition by replacing or fixing parts; to mend, fix\"; and noting that definition was in place before and after 1776).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   There is very little case law that construes the Religious Aid Clause, and no case is directly on point. Some cases have focused on the prohibition against \"the maintenance of a minister or ministry,\" not the \"repair\" of \"any church.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Resnick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1382055\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/77/88/\">\n    77 N.J. at 102-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20A.2d%20944\">\n    389 A.2d 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (relating to a school board's permitting a religious group to rent school property for religious instruction and services during non-school hours);\n   <em>\n    Everson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"139113\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/njl/133/350/\">\n    133 N.J.L. at 366-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%20333\">\n    44 A.2d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Case, J., dissenting) (relating to the use of public funds to reimburse parents for the cost of bus transportation to private and parochial schools).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Thus, nothing in the prior case law requires a departure from the plain language of the Religious Aid Clause.

Justices Thomas and Gorsuch, who joined the majority opinion aside from footnote 3, each filed a concurrence in which the other joined. Justice Thomas expressed doubts about the Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Locke\n   </em>\n   but noted that no party had asked the Court to reconsider it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2025 (Thomas, J., concurring).

Justice Gorsuch also expressed concern that footnote 3 might be \"mistakenly read ... to suggest that only 'playground resurfacing' cases, or only those with some association with children's safety or health, or perhaps some other social good we find sufficiently worthy, are governed by the legal rules recounted in and faithfully applied by the Court's opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2026.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Justice Breyer concurred in the judgment but wrote separately to \"emphasize[ ] the particular nature of the 'public benefit' here at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). He noted that in\n   <em>\n    Everson\n   </em>\n   , the Court made clear that a state could not exclude church schools from services like police and fire protection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2027.

The dissent first noted that \"[t]he Establishment Clause [did] not allow Missouri to grant the Church's\n   funding request because the Church uses the Learning Center, including its playground, in conjunction with its religious mission.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2028 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). The dissent declined to accept the parties' agreement that the Establishment Clause posed no issue and remarked that \"[c]onstitutional questions are decided by this Court, not the parties' concessions.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The dissent then turned to the Free Exercise Clause and focused in particular on the state's interest in denying the grant in question. Justice Sotomayor \"looked to history for guidance\" and reviewed the \"Nation's early experience with, and eventual rejection of, established religion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2032. The dissent canvassed efforts across the states \"to end the public funding of religion\" and the \"powerful\" reasons for those steps-\"all stemming from the basic premise that the practice harmed both civil government and religion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2033-35. The dissent concluded that, \"as in\n   <em>\n    Locke\n   </em>\n   , Missouri's Article I, \u00a7 7, is closely tied to the state interests it protects.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2038. The dissent found those interests \"weighty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2041.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Justice Sotomayor disagreed with the Court's decision to use strict scrutiny to evaluate Missouri's program, as well as the Court's application of the test.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2038-41. The dissent also questioned whether Missouri's Scrap Tire Program, which Justice Sotomayor described as \"a selective benefit for a few recipients each year,\" was a \"generally available benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2040.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   's scope is important because the facts of this case extend well beyond playground resurfacing. Indeed, the public funds awarded in this case actually went toward \"religious uses.\" It is clear from the stipulated facts in the record that the Churches all \"have active congregations that regularly worship, or participate in other religious activities,\" and all hold \"regular worship services in one or more of the structures that they have used, or will use,\" taxpayer-funded grants to repair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   In addition to the stipulation, a number of the applications expressly stated that churches sought funding for repairs to continue to conduct worship services. As noted earlier, The Presbyterian Church in Morristown, for example, sought and received a grant to \"historically preserve the building\n   <em>\n    allowing its continued use by our congregation for worship services\n   </em>\n   as well as by the community and many other outside organizations that use it on a regular basis.\" (emphasis added). The Church of the Redeemer sought and received funding to repair the slate roof-\"a key structural element that has failed\"-to \"\n   <em>\n    assist in assuring that the building can continue in its existing use as a church\n   </em>\n   and as an important building in Morristown.\" (emphasis added). Saint Peter's Episcopal Church of\n   Morristown similarly requested and received funds to repair the interior of the church tower to \"\n   <em>\n    ensure continued safe public access to the church for worship, periods of solitude and meditation\n   </em>\n   during the week, and several concerts throughout the year, as well as the treasures the church and tower contain.\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In certain cases, public funds were used to repair stained glass windows. The First Presbyterian Church of Boonton sought and received grant monies to repair religious imagery above the church altar-a stained glass window that depicts Jesus and two disciples on their walk from Jerusalem to Emmaus. The Church also received funds to repair a second stained glass window above the entry door to the Church.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The First Baptist Church of Ledgewood received funds to develop a preservation plan for several areas of the church building-both exterior and interior space-including the \"tower, heating system, and the original stained glass windows,\" which \"increase the beauty and the ambiance of the structure, as viewed from inside and outside.\" The application noted that a preservation grant \"will enable the congregation to continue to provide religious and community activities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   As that grant reveals, restoration awards were not limited to repairs to the exterior of church structures but also to finance\n   repairs to interior space where prayer services were held. Saint Peter's Episcopal Church of Morristown, for example, also received funds for interior work to its ventilation system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   In light of the record in this case,\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   's analysis of\n   <em>\n    Locke\n   </em>\n   is particularly instructive. Once again, as the Court noted, \"Davey was not denied a scholarship because of who he\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   ; he was denied a scholarship because of what he proposed\n   <em>\n    to do\n   </em>\n   -use the funds to prepare for the ministry.\"\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605129\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2012/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 2023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same construct applies here: the Churches are not being denied grant funds because they are religious institutions; they are being denied public funds because of what they plan to do-and in many cases have done: use public funds to repair church buildings so that religious worship services can be held there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   This case does not involve the expenditure of taxpayer money for non-religious uses, such as the playground resurfacing in\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   . The appeal instead relates to grants that sustain the continued use of active houses of worship for religious services and finance repairs to religious imagery. In our judgment, those grants constitute an impermissible religious use of public funds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Comm. for Pub. Educ. &amp; Religious Liberty v.

In efforts to force loyalty to whatever religious group happened to be on top and in league with the government of a particular time and place, men and women had been fined, cast in jail, cruelly tortured, and killed.

In\n   <em>\n    Locke\n   </em>\n   , the Court found that the state's decision not to fund devotional degrees was constitutional given the state's antiestablishment interest.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897994\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/712/#p723\">\n    540 U.S. at 722-23, 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897994\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/712/#p723\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Court made clear in\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   that a state's reliance on antiestablishment principles, even those grounded in the state's constitution, is not without limits.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605129\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2012/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 2024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, an antiestablishment interest cannot justify the categorical ban of a religious institution from a public benefit based solely on its religious character.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605129\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2012/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, New Jersey's interest in historic preservation,\n   <em>\n    N.J. Const.\n   </em>\n   art. VIII, \u00a7 II, \u00b6 7, counters its antiestablishment interest expressed in the Religious Aid Clause. I believe, therefore, that New Jersey's antiestablishment interest is less compelling than was the state's interest in\n   <em>\n    Locke\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   The majority concludes that the present case exceeds the scope of\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   since Morris County's taxpayer-funded grants \"went toward 'religious uses.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 573, 181 A.3d at 1009. In reaching this conclusion, the majority refers for support to Footnote 3 of the\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran\n   </em>\n   decision,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605129\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2012/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2024 n.3. However, that conclusion ignores New Jersey's separate and substantial government interest at stake in this case-historical preservation. I believe that had Morris County's program been applied in a fundamentally neutral manner, the Religious Aid Clause could not bar funding to an otherwise qualified religious institution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Nevertheless, I am constrained to concur with the majority because as the majority points out: there will be a protracted relationship between Morris County and defendant religious institutions; 41.7 percent of the grant money was awarded to twelve churches which, in some instances, sought funding to continue religious services; and the program's Rules and Regulations explicitly name religious institutions as eligible applicants. Therefore, the grant program at issue here is neither facially neutral nor neutral in its application.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    However, not all government action that intersects with a citizen's religious beliefs is contrary to the Free Exercise Clause.
