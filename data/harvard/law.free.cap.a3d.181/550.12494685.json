On appeal, the plaintiff claims that (1) the thirty day deadline provided by Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 is mandatory and that, therefore, the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court was required to exercise discretion in deciding whether to entertain the defendant's untimely motion, and (2) even if the trial court had discretion to entertain an untimely motion for attorney's fees, the defendant's motion in the present case was barred as a matter of law. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Appellate Court's opinion sets forth the following undisputed facts and procedural history relevant to our consideration of the issues presented in this appeal. \"The plaintiff ... brought an action against the defendant based on contract and promissory estoppel relating to its care of the defendant's mother. The admission agreement executed by the plaintiff and the defendant, as a responsible party, contained a clause providing for the responsible party to pay the cost of collection, including reasonable attorney's fees, in the event an overdue account is referred to an agency or attorney for collection. Following a trial to the court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Robert J. Hale\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, judgment was rendered for the plaintiff in the sum of $47,561.15 with attorney's fees to be decided postjudgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"On appeal, however, [the Appellate Court] reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment in favor of the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Meadowbrook Center, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Buchman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414901\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/149/177/#p212\">\n    149 Conn.

The order from [the Appellate Court] was dated April 8, 2014. Thereafter, on April 30, 2014, the court,\n   <em>\n    Robaina, J.\n   </em>\n   , rendered judgment\n   for the defendant. The defendant then submitted a bill of costs on May 16, 2014, and, on June 4, 2014, the thirty-fifth day after judgment, the defendant filed a motion for attorney's fees and costs. On January 29, 2015, the court,\n   <em>\n    Wahla, J.\n   </em>\n   , conducted a hearing on the defendant's motion in which he claimed attorney's fees of $74,918.70 and costs of $1337.38. On April 7, 2015, the court issued its decision denying the defendant's motion for attorney's fees on the basis that the motion was not timely. Rejecting the defendant's argument that attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb are a component of damages and, therefore, not subject to the time limits of Practice Book \u00a7 11-21, the court stated: 'Because I conclude that attorney's fees were not a component of damages, the defendant's motion for attorney's fees and costs [is] not timely, hence I am constrained to agree with the plaintiff. The defendant's motion is hereby denied.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Following the court's ruling, the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration and reargument on April 17, 2015. In this motion, the defendant argued, inter alia, that\n   the court incorrectly had failed to rule whether the time limit set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 is mandatory or directory. The defendant alleged that he had raised this issue in his memorandum of law in support of attorney's fees and at the hearing on his motion. In response, the plaintiff urged the court [not to] consider the defendant's motion as 'the defendant wants to rehash the same arguments that he already made which were unpersuasive.' By order dated May 12, 2015, Judge Wahla denied the defendant's motion for reconsideration and reargument without comment.\"\n   <em>\n    Meadowbrook Center, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Buchman\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488753\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/404/#p529\">\n    169 Conn.

With respect to the first two excusable neglect factors, the plaintiff has made no claim of prejudice, and the five day delay in filing was relatively minor. Similarly, there is no claim of bad faith. With respect to the reason for the delay, as was discussed extensively at oral argument before this court, the record reveals that the parties-at least counsel for the defendant-experienced some confusion following the Appellate Court's April 8, 2014 order in\n   <em>\n    Meadowbrook Center, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Buchman\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414901\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/149/177/#p212\">\n    149 Conn.

As counsel for the defendant represented at oral argument, some of this confusion may have been occasioned by the infirmity and ultimate passing of Judge Hale, the original trial judge, in the spring and summer of 2014, after the directed judgment in the present case. Indeed, on April 17, 2014, the trial court's civil caseflow office issued an order, at the direction of Judge Robaina, directing the parties to appear for a status conference on May 22, 2014. At the request of the\n   plaintiff, and with the consent of the defendant, that conference was continued to June 10, 2014. Despite the pending status conference, Judge Robaina issued an order rendering the judgment directed by the Appellate Court on April 30, 2014. Nevertheless, on June 3, 2014, the defendant filed a proposed judgment file to that effect for Judge Hale to sign, followed by his motion for attorney's fees on June 4, 2014. Given these facts, we conclude that a trial court reasonably might exercise its discretion to grant permission to file an untimely motion-at least in part with respect to trial attorney's fees-where there was some confusion as to the operative judgment date and no apparent prejudice to the nonmoving party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, remand to the trial court remains appropriate for the exercise of its discretion in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We, therefore, agree with the Appellate Court that remanding the present case for a hearing on the defendant's motion is appropriate because the trial court improperly failed \"to exercise its discretion to determine whether strict adherence to the [thirty day deadline set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 ] would 'work surprise or injustice.'
