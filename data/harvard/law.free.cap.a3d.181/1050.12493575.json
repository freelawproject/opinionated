We affirm the trial judge's decision entering judgment for the Bank, in part, because the duties of the indenture trustee were properly limited to those enumerated in the trust agreement. We also affirm the judge's post-judgment August 25, 2015 order denying the Bank's application for $360,335.85 in attorney fees and $45,707.56 in costs. The indenture agreement did not obligate New Gold to reimburse the bank for the legal expenses it incurred defending against its own negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   New Gold acquired the property in 1990 from Old Gold Associates (Old Gold),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which had purchased it on December 22, 1982,\n   from defendant Jaffe Spindler Company, LLC (Jaffe). The transaction was financed through a thirty-year commercial bond agreement, secured by a mortgage against the property, issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The yearly interest rate on the bond was fixed at 13%. New Gold was required to actually pay, however, monthly interest ranging at a reduced 6.29% to 7.62%. The difference between the base rate and the monthly interest, described in the loan documents as \"deferred interest,\" accrued but was not due if the principal balance was paid at any time during the first eleven months of the last year of the loan-between December 23, 2011, and November 22, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In other words, New Gold would not have to pay $3,714,864 in accrued but deferred interest if the principal was satisfied on or before November 22, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   New Gold did not exercise this option, thus the bond's principal balance of $2,100,000 together with the deferred interest all became\n   due at the loan maturity date on December 22, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2010, the Bank became the indenture trustee, assuming the role from a series of predecessor entities. Marco Medina, a Bank employee, administered the bond from 2010 to the maturity date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   New Gold employed BLDG Management Company, Inc. (BLDG), as the property manager. Senen Bacalan was the BLDG employee responsible for the administrative tasks relative to the mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 12, 2012, forty days before maturity and ten days before the prepayment option expired, Bacalan sent an email to Medina requesting a payoff figure at the maturity date, December 22, 2012: the \"usual status letter indicating the principal balance and per diem interest.\" Medina, who was entirely unaware of the\n   deferred interest provision, did not respond until November 27, 2012, fifteen days later. He forwarded a payoff statement that read: \"[t]his letter will serve as notice that on December 22, 2012, the [bond] issued in the amount of $2,100,000 shall be due and payable. Also due at this time is interest in the amount of $13,334.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After Bacalan pointed out that the payoff figures did not include a smaller subordinate bond, Medina sent Bacalan a corrected payoff reflecting an accurate total principal balance due of $2,330,000. Bacalan identified another error in that second payoff statement, the omission of the interest that had accrued on the subordinate bond. On December 18, 2012, Medina responded with a third corrected payoff, stating that an additional $16,017.34 in interest was due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While preparing the payoff statements prior to the December 22, 2012 maturity date, Medina did not review the bond documents. Thus none of the payoff statements included any mention of the additional deferred interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 19, New Gold paid the December 18, 2012 payoff statement amounts. After the payment, Medina learned about the deferred interest clause, reviewed the terms of the bond for the first time, and notified New Gold of the additional interest due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Bacalan, who was also unaware of the deferred interest clause, had inherited handwritten notes and calculations regarding the bond obligation from his predecessor, Patrick Knowles. Knowles, who began working at BLDG in 1990 and retired in 2011, had written \"deferred int. $1,000,827.46\" on a page of the mortgage schedule. Bacalan, although he had those materials, had never asked anyone about the notations, nor had he read the actual bond documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 13, 2013, Jaffe sent NJEDA a letter demanding payment of the $3,714,864 deferred interest and threatening to foreclose on the mortgage if it was not made. A parallel foreclosure proceeding was thereafter filed by Jaffe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The indenture agreement entered into between Jaffe, New Gold's predecessor in interest Old Gold, and the NJEDA, states that the Bank's predecessor is appointed a trustee so as to \"receiv[e] and apply[ ] all payments ... as hereinafter provided.\" The Bank's duties were expressly limited to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Section 6\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Duties of Trustee with Respect to Bond Agreement\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A. The Trustee agrees to receive all payments and deposits required to be paid under the Authority Agreement and to make all payments required to be made under the Bond and Mortgage (or\n   under the Authority Agreement in the event the same is assigned to the holder of the Bond and Mortgage pursuant to the terms of Section \"4.06\" of the Bond Agreement) as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   i) make payments to the holder of the Existing Mortgage, or withhold such payments upon receipt of reasonable evidence that such payments have been made;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ii) pay taxes and insurance premiums;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   iii) transmit the net amount due to the holder of the Mortgage and the obligee of the Bond.

The requirements for this deposit shall be waived for three (3) months for each quarterly tax payment theretofore made directly by the obligor required to pay such taxes provided that evidence of the payment is furnished to the holder of the Mortgage and the Trustee. In the alternative, the obligor required to pay such taxes may require the Trustee to prepay taxes out of excess tax escrow funds, if any, on deposit with the Trustee;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   C. Any payments made to the Trustee on account of insurance premiums shall be held, in escrow in an interest-bearing account, if permissible, and shall be applied to the payment of such premiums.

New Gold also sought judgment discharging the mortgages, liens, and encumbrances on the property, as well as damages. Jaffe counterclaimed in foreclosure and for possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Summary judgment motions and cross-motions were filed by the parties in both this action and Jaffe's separate foreclosure action. On August 28, 2013, among other relief, Judge Hector Velazquez granted Jaffe summary judgment in this case, and partial summary judgment in the parallel foreclosure proceeding. The judge concluded that as a matter of law the deferred interest provision was not a penalty because it was \"simply due at maturity[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Jaffe Spindler Co., LLC v. New Jersey Econ. Dev. Off.\n   </em>\n   , No. A-5718-13 (App. Div. July 8, 2016) (slip op. at 4),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203636578\">\n    2016 WL 3636578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    cert. denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304906\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/228/266/\">\n    228 N.J. 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304906,12304884,12304895\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/156/179/\">\n    156 A.3d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On the appeal taken in the foreclosure proceeding, we affirmed the judge's grant of partial summary judgment to Jaffe despite the fact it issued prior to the completion of discovery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. We also affirmed the judge's holding that the deferred interest provision was not an illegal penalty.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Subsequent to that decision,\n   New Gold proceeded solely against the Bank in this litigation and Jaffe foreclosed on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The judge denied summary judgment to the Bank because disputed issues of material fact existed as to whether the Bank had actually assumed a duty when it provided the payoff statement, or could be found negligent in the manner it responded. In order to prevail, then, New Gold would have to establish that the Bank was the proximate cause of the harm, defined as full payment of the deferred interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   During the bench trial, both New Gold and the Bank presented expert witnesses as to whether an industry standard existed for response times to payoff requests made to indenture trustees. Bacalan also testified regarding his records, his knowledge of New Gold's financial obligations under the bond, and communications with Medina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Relying upon federal law and out-of-state precedent, the judge reiterated his opinion first enunciated in the summary judgment decision, stating that the duties of the Bank as an indenture trustee were solely governed by the terms of the indenture, the trust agreement. The judge also found that responses to the payoff requests were not merely ministerial in nature. Rather, because the Bank \"voluntarily or gratuitously\" provided the payoff figures, it assumed the obligation and was thus required to perform the service in a reasonably careful manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The judge rejected New Gold's expert testimony to the effect that the industry standard required the Bank to provide a payoff figure within three days. Instead, he credited the Bank's expert, who testified that although the Bank had a responsibility to respond, there was no industry standard for the time frame in which to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The judge opined that the acts of negligence committed by the Bank did not relate to the response time. The negligence occurred when Medina failed to review the trustee agreement, and failed to\n   maintain accurate records concerning the payments to be made under the bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The judge therefore concluded that New Gold had not proven proximate cause. The Bank could not have foreseen the harm to New Gold, nor did the Bank's negligence ultimately lead to New Gold's injury. Given Bacalan's wording of the request for a payoff, the Bank had the right to rely on\n   New Gold's representations that it intended to pay the bond at maturity and not earlier. Since the Bank could not have foreseen that New Gold would not have known of the deferred interest, it was not the proximate cause of the harm. New Gold never blindly relied upon Medina's payoff responses, actually comparing them to its own records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ultimately, New Gold was negligent to an extent far greater than the Bank. If New Gold was unaware of the deferred interest provision, it was as a result of its own failure to review the bond documents and thereby become familiar with its rights and obligations. Hence, the judge held New Gold's contributory negligence was the primary cause of the harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Furthermore, New Gold's management company, BLDG, had prior knowledge of the prepayment and deferred interest provision, established through the scheduled payment records and Knowles's handwritten notations. BLDG failed to \"create a system or methodology that would ensure the proper and timely exercise of the options.\" Thus, the court entered judgment for the Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Two months after the trial, on August 25, 2015, Judge Velasquez denied the Bank's motion for $360,335.85 in counsel fees and $45,707.56 in costs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The lack of an express provision obligating New Gold to indemnify [the Bank] against allegation of [the Bank's] own negligence means that the\n   <em>\n    Central Motor\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"default rule\" applies and permits the court to supply the missing terms.

The excuses defy common sense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In addition to New Gold's obligation to be familiar with documents involving millions of dollars, BLDG's own file should have red-flagged the option. Knowles, BLDG's chief financial officer in August 1990 when New Gold became an obligor on the bond, identified his handwriting at deposition on the bond payment schedules turned over to Bacalan. The notation he made said \"deferred int.\" Bacalan acknowledged at trial that the schedules also contained actual calculations totaling the deferred interest obligation. Although he used the document every month to assist him in tracking payments that were due, he never asked anyone about the implications of the \"deferred int.\" words, nor the deferred interest numbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   New Gold asserts that because the Bank is a professional bond trustee, it must be held to be more than fifty percent liable for the harm that resulted from its lack of familiarity with the deferred interest terms. But a professional bond trustee has different responsibilities from an indenture trustee. An indenture trustee's duties are limited to those imposed by the trust agreement, and the duty to perform ministerial nondiscretionary tasks. The trust agreement did not impose the duty of providing a payoff statement, much less make any mention of the deferred interest provision. New Gold's own negligence was the primary cause of the harm, in excess of fifty percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   New Gold also contends that the relationship it had with the Bank was professional- and client-based, making the Comparative Negligence Act, N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.1 to -5.8, inapplicable. New Gold reasons that since the Bank is a \"professional bond administrator\" hired by New Gold \"to serve as the professional trustee for\n   the [b]ond, with primary responsibility for receiving and making all required payments owed under the bond,\" the Comparative Negligence Act should not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In New Jersey, \"professionals may not diminish their liability under the\n   Comparative Negligence Act when the alleged negligence of the client relates to the task for which the professional was hired.\"\n   <em>\n    Aden v.
