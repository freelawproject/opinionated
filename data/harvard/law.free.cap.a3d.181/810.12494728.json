It has such power that it can retain interest as it conveys emotions and moods that no other art form can hope to tackle.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   Stanley Kubrick (1970).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Does this \"magic medium\" by its very nature convey such overpowering emotion to warrant a permanent ban from the courtroom? Does the \"magic medium\" in the form of a victim impact video with background music constitute \"irrelevant information or inflammatory rhetoric\" that would \"stir strong emotions that might overcome the restraints of reason\" of the sentencing judge? These questions underscore the two opposing interests in this appeal: first, a criminal defendant's interest in a fair sentencing proceeding in which the sentencing judge is not diverted from his or her objective role; and second, a victim's interest in conveying the impacts of the defendant's crimes to the sentencing judge. This Court is once again called upon to balance these opposing interests in light of the law. In this instance, this Court must also strike a balance in light of this \"magic medium\" of technology that has become ever-present in Maryland courtrooms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In short, we are asked to determine whether victim impact evidence in the form of a video, displaying more than one hundred photographs of the victims, with accompanying music (\"the video\" or \"victim impact video\") is impermissible at a sentencing hearing. Specifically, this Court must decide if such victim impact evidence violates any of the following statutory or constitutional provisions: \u00a7 11-402 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\"CP\") of the Maryland Code, which governs victim impact statements; a defendant's Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment; or a defendant's due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we first conclude that a sentencing judge has discretion to permit any additional form of victim impact evidence outside the constraints of CP \u00a7 11-402, governing written victim impact statements, and CP \u00a7 11-403, governing victim impact testimony. We also hold that all prepared victim impact evidence, not including victim impact testimony, must be limited to the content prescribed under CP \u00a7 11-402(e), listing the subject matters permitted in victim impact statements. This Court further holds that the Eighth Amendment does not prohibit a sentencing judge from considering victim impact evidence at a defendant's noncapital sentencing proceeding. Lastly, we hold that the defendant's Fourteenth Amendment due process rights were not violated in this case because the disputed victim impact evidence did not inflame the passions of the sentencing judge more than the facts of the crime. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A grand jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County indicted the Petitioner, Curtis Maurice Lopez (\"Mr. Lopez\"), with two counts of first degree murder, one count of kidnapping, one count of child kidnapping, and one count of robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On\n   January 4, 2013, Mr. Lopez entered an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   as to both first degree murder counts, the robbery count, and one merged count of child kidnapping.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the plea hearing, the parties presented the court with an agreement that both the State and Mr. Lopez would be free to argue the appropriate\n   sentence at a separate hearing. The State reminded the court that it intended to request a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. After accepting the agreement as to sentencing, the circuit court questioned Mr. Lopez about his rights, his understanding of the elements of the charged crimes, and his understanding of the plea. The court found that Mr. Lopez was proceeding by way of an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea freely, voluntarily, and intelligently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In support of the plea, the State presented the following proffer of facts\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in connection with the murders of Jane McQuain (\"Jane\") and William McQuain (\"William\"). Mr. Lopez and Jane were married on April 23, 1988, in a Pennsylvania prison while Mr. Lopez was serving a sentence for attempted murder in a separate case. Though Jane and Mr. Lopez kept in contact and visited occasionally, the two did not live as husband and wife. Jane gave birth to a non-marital son, William, while Mr. Lopez was still serving his sentence in prison. Jane and William lived in Germantown, Maryland, and Jane worked as a receptionist at an accounting firm in Gaithersburg. When he was released from prison, Mr. Lopez moved to North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In September 2011, Jane used inherited money from her deceased uncle to purchase a new car and a flat-screen television. After learning of the inheritance, Mr. Lopez contacted Jane and informed her of his plans to visit on September 16, 2011. Mr. Lopez stayed with Jane and William in their condominium on Briarcliff Terrace during his visit. On Friday, September 30, 2011, Jane took William to his friend's residence for a sleepover. That night, Mr. Lopez bludgeoned Jane with a thirty-pound weight and stabbed her multiple times, leaving her body wrapped in blankets in her condominium. On the morning of Saturday, October 1, 2011, Mr. Lopez used Jane's cell phone to text William that he should come downstairs to be picked up from the sleepover. Mr. Lopez drove William from the sleepover to a storage facility, where Mr.\n   Lopez retrieved a baseball bat among other items. After driving William around for four to five hours, making multiple trips to and from the storage facility, Mr. Lopez proceeded to drive to the woods off of Clarksburg Road. Mr. Lopez then killed William by swinging the baseball bat at William's head at least four times, splitting William's skull into thirty-six pieces. Mr. Lopez then discarded William's body slightly off the road. Mr. Lopez drove Jane's new car back to North Carolina with several of Jane's and William's belongings, including the flat-screen television. Based on this sequence of events, the Montgomery County police obtained an arrest warrant for Mr. Lopez. Police located Mr. Lopez at an Econo\n   Lodge in North Carolina, found Jane's new car parked outside of the Econo Lodge, and retrieved Jane's bank card in the hotel room. After the State's proffer, the circuit court concluded that the State had set forth sufficient facts to sustain a guilty finding as to all counts in the plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 10, 2013, the court held a sentencing hearing, during which Mr. Lopez requested that the court impose concurrent life sentences, concurrent term-of-year sentences, and the possibility of parole. Preliminarily, Mr. Lopez moved to exclude a video with photographs of the two victims set to background music, which the victims' representative, Mr. William McQuain (\"Mr. McQuain\"), Jane's brother, intended to play at sentencing. Mr. Lopez contended that the video did not constitute permissible victim impact evidence and violated Mr. Lopez's constitutional rights. The defense also argued that another judge should conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the video to determine whether it should be excluded or redacted. The State countered that the sentencing judge has discretion to allow victim impact evidence, and that all judges are able to rule on evidentiary matters and proceed to consider only the permitted evidence. Counsel for Mr. McQuain argued that the video was completely appropriate for sentencing because it showed the identity and characteristics of the victims. Ultimately, the sentencing judge denied Mr. Lopez's request for another judge to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review as well as his motion to exclude the video. The sentencing judge concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I have discretion to allow whatever I like or whatever is appropriate in this kind of sentencing proceeding. I'm told that it is just pictures, that it is six minutes. This is their one-the victims' family's one opportunity to show me, or anyone else, the extent of the impact upon them. And so I know you don't like it but this is what they would like to do and in some respects it would be cathartic to, for the last time, be able to fully discuss their sister and their nephew. So I'm going to allow the video to be played.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The State summarized the facts of the crime, showed a PowerPoint depicting pictures of the crime scenes, submitted written victim impact statements, and presented nine witnesses who gave victim impact testimony. Mr. McQuain, the victims' representative, testified about his sister, Jane, and his nephew, William, as well as the struggles he faces as a result of the death of his family members. At the end of his testimony, Mr. McQuain requested that he be able to play the video of photographs of the two victims. The video begins with the title, \"The Story of Jane and William,\" which appears on the screen while church bells are playing in the background. The video footage then displays childhood photographs of Jane set to the song \"Sort of (Instrumental)\" by Ingrid Michaelson, which is fittingly characterized as instrumental music. As the song slows down, photographs of Jane during her adult life are shown while the angle zooms in on Jane's image. After approximately one minute, the video displays photographs of Jane holding William as a baby while the instrumental music continues. The video then depicts two-and-one-half minutes of photographs of Jane and William spending time together as well as photos of William engaging in childhood activities, during which the same instrumental music plays in the background. When the first song ends, the song \"Yeah, Yeah\" by Sam Means plays for approximately two minutes of additional family photos and childhood photographs of William. The last photograph of Jane and William embracing is shown for approximately twenty seconds while the sound of church bells again plays in the background. The video then shows a list of credits for people who shared photographs, the music, and the\n   video production.\n   The credits are set to the sound of the first song, \"Sort of (Instrumental)\" by Ingrid Michaelson. The footage ends with a graphic displaying the words \"All Memories By Jane &amp; William\" as the instrumental music fades out. The video lasts a total of six minutes and twelve seconds, contains approximately 115 photographs, and includes two songs along with the sound of church bells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the video was played, defense counsel moved to have the sentencing judge recused because of the video's prejudicial nature. Specifically, counsel for Mr. Lopez stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Your Honor, we've [ ] previously objected to this video being shown. Certainly the State has a right to put on its presentation, but this is so unduly prejudicial [ ] in this matter, that Your Honor we would ask the [c]ourt to possibly recuse[.] I mean, this obviously just appeals to emotions, which something like this goes [to], but this is just, this is over the top.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The sentencing judge denied the motion to recuse, concluding that the victims' representative was entitled to show photographs. The defense then requested that the court make a copy of the video for the appellate record, which the sentencing judge granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the sentencing judge gave her oral ruling:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   There's not much more I can say other than the eloquent words we have heard from all of the victims here today and in their victim impact statements, which were submitted to the [c]ourt last week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [T]he monstrous nature of this crime cannot convert this case into concurrent time or any prospect of parole. You stabbed Jane McQuain and crushed her skull with a 30-pound dumbbell. You took William from a sleepover, got a baseball bat out, took him into the woods, and crushed his skull into many pieces, and this was a person who called you \"Dad.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Frankly, it is too bad the death penalty is no longer available, as the circumstances of this case and your criminal history truly would warrant that penalty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ultimately, the court sentenced Mr. Lopez to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the first degree murder of Jane, a consecutive term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the first degree murder of William, a consecutive term of thirty years for child kidnapping, and a concurrent term of twelve years for robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mr. Lopez filed an application for leave to appeal on July 9, 2013, asserting that the video was inadmissible at sentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court of Special Appeals granted the leave to appeal on December 22, 2014. In a reported opinion filed on February 2, 2017, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the sentencing judge, holding that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the video at sentencing and the video did not violate Mr. Lopez's constitutional rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

In 1982, the Maryland General Assembly enacted the primary statute in pursuit of that public policy goal: Maryland's first victim impact evidence statute. 1982 Md. Laws, ch. 494. This victim impact legislation required a presentence investigation report to include a victim impact statement if the defendant committed certain crimes that caused injuries to a victim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314403,12489703,12489704,12489705,12489706,12314396,12314399\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/546/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The original statute also allowed the State's Attorney to submit a victim impact statement in the event a presentence investigation was not requested.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314403,12489703,12489704,12489705,12489706,12314396,12314399\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/546/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The sponsor of this legislation, Senator John J.

In addition, a sentencing judge will err as a matter of law when he or she admits victim impact evidence that violates any of the victim impact statutes: CP \u00a7\u00a7 11-402 &amp; 11-403.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4423977,1993606\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/648/1025/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Maryland victim impact statutes, codified at CP \u00a7\u00a7 11-402 and 11-403, discuss two types of victim impact evidence: victim impact statements and victim impact testimony. The former requires the court to \"consider the victim impact statement in determining the appropriate sentence[.]\" CP \u00a7 11-402(d). The latter statute mandates that the sentencing judge, \"if practicable, shall allow the victim or the victim's representative to address the court under oath before the imposition of sentence or other disposition[.]\" CP \u00a7 11-403(b). Neither provision of the Maryland Code governs additional forms of victim impact evidence, such as the video disputed in this appeal. However, Mr. Lopez asks this Court to apply the requirements\n   listed under CP \u00a7 11-402(e) to the victim impact video submitted at the sentencing. This section of the statute reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [a] victim impact statement for a crime or delinquent act shall:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (1) identify the victim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (2) itemize any economic loss suffered by the victim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (3) identify any physical injury suffered by the victim and describe the seriousness and any permanent effects of the injury;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (4) describe any change in the victim's personal welfare or familial relationships;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (5) identify any request for psychological services initiated by the victim or the victim's family;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (6) identify any request by the victim to prohibit the defendant or child respondent from having contact with the victim as a condition of probation, parole, mandatory supervision, work release, or any other judicial or administrative release of the defendant or child respondent, including a request for electronic monitoring or electronic monitoring with victim stay-away alert technology; and\n   (7) contain any other information related to the impact on the victim or the victim's family that the court requires.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   CP \u00a7 11-402(e). Mr. Lopez contends that the victim impact video is more comparable to victim impact statements than oral victim impact testimony. For justification, Mr. Lopez asserts that applying the restrictions listed under CP \u00a7 11-402(e) to all prepared victim impact evidence would prevent the sentencing judge from impermissibly considering irrelevant content when imposing a sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In contrast, the State asserts that the video was properly considered during the sentencing hearing because only victim impact statements and victim impact testimony are limited by \u00a7\u00a7 11-402 and 11-403 of the Criminal Procedure Article ; any victim impact evidence outside of those statutes lies within the sound discretion of the sentencing judge. The State suggests that the sentencing judge did not abuse her discretion because the video depicts the true impact of the crime on the family. In a similar vein, the victims' representative contends that the video was properly admitted as part of the victim impact testimony. The victims' representative points out that Maryland jurisprudence does not apply the limitations under CP \u00a7 11-402(e) to the victims' rights to be heard at sentencing. Therefore, the victims' representative urges this Court to find that the sentencing judge did not abuse her broad discretion in permitting the video as part of the victim impact testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Maryland appellate courts have not yet addressed the specific issue of whether victim impact evidence outside of a victim impact statement or victim impact testimony should be limited in content or form. However, there are Maryland cases instructive to this question. In 1985, this Court reviewed a sentencing hearing in which the court sentenced the defendant, Gregory Reid, to life imprisonment for first degree rape with a consecutive twenty-year sentence for first degree sexual offense and a ten-year consecutive sentence for robbery.\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   , 302 Md. at 814,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1976055\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/302/811/#p816\">\n    490 A.2d 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Law, Ch. 494.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reid argued that the additional victim impact statement violated the statute because the State's Attorney may only submit a statement if a presentence investigation is specifically not ordered.\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   , 302 Md. at 815-16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1976055\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/302/811/#p816\">\n    490 A.2d 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State argued that the victim impact statement submitted separately from the presentence investigation \"was merely additional information [that] should be left to the sentencing judge's discretion whether to consider [because the statute] does not limit the extent of the court's inquiry but rather ensures that at least a minimum of information on victim impact is provided and will be considered by the court at sentencing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1976055\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/302/811/#p816\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1976055\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/302/811/#p816\">\n    at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1976055\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/302/811/#p816\">\n    490 A.2d 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In response, this Court first determined that the \"legislative history suggests an intent to establish minimum standards for the information to be provided to judges and to make this information available in as many cases as fiscal constraints allowed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1976055\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/302/811/#p816\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1976055\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/302/811/#p816\">\n    at 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1976055\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/302/811/#p816\">\n    490 A.2d 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As such, Judge Bell recognized that victim impact evidence can extend to any form that is probative and relevant, but cautioned future courts that victim impact evidence should not \"be the decisive factor in determining\" a sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2031254\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/340/30/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Bell, J., concurring and dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   A few years later in\n   <em>\n    Ball v.

This Court rejected that argument by noting that the statute \"pertains only to written victim impact statements\" and \"does not, by its express terms, extend to oral victim impact testimony[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024303\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/347/156/#p197\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024303\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/347/156/#p197\">\n    at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024303\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/347/156/#p197\">\n    699 A.2d 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In distinguishing victim impact statements from victim impact testimony, the\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   Court explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [I]t would be difficult to conform oral testimony to the requirements of this statute. Because written victim impact statements are prepared and reviewed prior to the commencement of the sentencing proceeding, their content can be effectively delineated by statute. Oral victim impact testimony, in contrast, cannot be controlled with such precision. Victim impact witnesses testify under great emotional strain and, in venting their pain and frustration, may make an occasional reference to the impact of the crime on individuals beyond the victim's family.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024303\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/347/156/#p197\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After analyzing the inherent differences between victim impact statements and victim impact testimony, this Court reasoned that the permissible content list under \u00a7 11-402(e)\"may provide guidance as to appropriate matters for victim impact witnesses to address orally at sentencing, [but] it should not be viewed as establishing the outer limits of that testimony such that any deviation warrants automatic reversal of the sentence imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024303\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/347/156/#p197\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is evident, therefore, that this Court previously considered that the statutory content requirements for victim impact statements serve as guidance for other types of victim impact evidence, but do not constitute strict limitations on such evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Overall, these precedents establish three guiding principles for purposes of victim impact evidence in Maryland. First, any victim impact evidence not strictly permitted by statute is within the sentencing judge's discretion to consider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   , 302 Md. at 821,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1976055\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/302/811/#p816\">\n    490 A.2d 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, videos can be relevant and probative at a sentencing hearing for purposes such as showing the personal characteristics and unique identity of the victim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whittlesey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2031254\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/340/30/\">\n    340 Md. at 86-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2031254\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/340/30/\">\n    665 A.2d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, this Court acknowledged that there can and should be limitations on victim impact evidence, especially when that evidence is \"prepared and reviewed\" before the sentencing hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024303\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/347/156/#p197\">\n    347 Md. at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024303\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/347/156/#p197\">\n    699 A.2d 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given that these Maryland cases provided no instruction as to what specific limitations should apply to discretionary victim impact evidence, Mr. Lopez implores this Court to take note of\n   other jurisdictions that considered similar questions regarding victim impact evidence at sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The federal and state cases cited by Mr. Lopez address significant questions related to victim impact evidence; however, none of the cases analyzed the first issue in this appeal. Several of the cases cited by Mr. Lopez analyzed whether a victim impact video should be excluded at a sentencing hearing because such evidence is more prejudicial than probative.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sampson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9192080\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/335/166/#p187\">\n    335 F.Supp.2d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 187 (D.

App. 2002). Other jurisdictions addressed whether a victim impact video played at sentencing violates a defendant's constitutional rights and whether counsel's failure to object to such a video constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Though the Court of Special Appeals relied on\n   <em>\n    State v. Leon\n   </em>\n   as persuasive authority on whether a video is permissible at a sentencing hearing, the Court of Appeals of Idaho analyzed a slightly different question.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676694\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/142/705/\">\n    142 Idaho 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676694\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/142/705/\">\n    132 P.3d 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 462-67 (App. 2006). Namely, the\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   Court determined that a victim impact video montage of photographs set to music was a permissible form of the victim's right \"to be 'heard' \" as permitted by Idaho's statute and Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676694\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/142/705/\">\n    132 P.3d at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this appeal, we must decide whether victim impact evidence should be limited in content and whether the video in this case conveyed appropriate content for purposes of the sentencing judge's decision. Therefore, this Court will not exclusively rely on the analysis of any of the federal or sister state cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In addition to varying questions presented, these federal cases are also distinct in another significant way: the sentencing bodies considering the victim impact evidence consisted of sentencing juries rather than sentencing judges.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9318506\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/90/330/#p331\">\n    90 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   331-36 ;\n   <em>\n    Sampson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9192080\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/335/166/#p187\">\n    335 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   187 ;\n   <em>\n    Prince\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20543\">\n    57 Cal.Rptr.3d 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20P.3d%201015\">\n    156 P.3d at 1091-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676694\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/142/705/\">\n    132 P.3d at 462-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals of Idaho specifically stressed the fact that when a sentencing body\n   consists of a judge, the sentencing judge is \"presumably able to ascertain the relevancy and reliability of the broad range of information and material which may be presented to it during the sentencing process and to disregard the irrelevant and unreliable.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676694\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/142/705/\">\n    132 P.3d at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Similarly, Maryland Courts have also stressed that we have \"confidence in a trial judge's ability to rule on questions of admissibility of evidence and to then assume the role of trier of fact without having carried over to [the judge's] factual deliberations a prejudice on the matters contained in the evidence which [the judge] may have excluded.\"\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024303\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/347/156/#p197\">\n    347 Md. at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024303\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/347/156/#p197\">\n    699 A.2d 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

This Court has equal confidence that a sentencing judge has the experience and ability to analyze the evidence, consider its permissibility, as well as place the appropriate weight on the evidence. Therefore, the federal cases cited by Mr. Lopez can also be distinguished from the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   in that the victim impact evidence was presented to an experienced judge, not an inexperienced jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Because the federal and sister state cases cited by Mr. Lopez cannot serve as guidance for our decision here, this Court must thoroughly analyze our leading precedent. In\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   , this Court reasoned that the content requirements for victim impact statements, as enumerated by CP \u00a7 11-402(e), could serve as guidance for victim impact evidence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024303\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/347/156/#p197\">\n    347 Md. at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024303\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/347/156/#p197\">\n    699 A.2d 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, we are cognizant that this jurisprudence also demonstrates a need for some type of limitation on prepared victim impact evidence in order to prevent impermissible considerations by the sentencing body.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024303\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/347/156/#p197\">\n    347 Md. at 197-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024303\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/347/156/#p197\">\n    699 A.2d 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The list provided under CP \u00a7 11-402(e) is a proper restriction on prepared victim impact evidence content because this still allows victims to present evidence in a variety of forms to convey the identity of the victim as well as the impact of the crime on the victim and the victim's family.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CP \u00a7 11-402(e)(1) &amp; (e)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As such, this Court holds that a sentencing judge has broad discretion to admit and consider victim impact evidence in forms outside of the bounds of victim impact statements and victim impact testimony. We further hold that all prepared victim impact evidence submitted at sentencing, including victim impact videos, needs to meet at least one of the very broad content requirements listed under CP \u00a7 11-402(e). Limiting any prepared victim impact evidence to matters deemed probative by the legislature will prevent sentencing bodies from undertaking impermissible considerations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   , 302 Md. at 820,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1976055\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/302/811/#p816\">\n    490 A.2d 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, the holding we make today does not prevent or discourage sentencing judges from considering whether victim impact evidence is cumulative, whether the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, or whether the admission of victim impact evidence would be so unduly prejudicial that it would violate the defendant's due process rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whittlesey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2031254\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/340/30/\">\n    340 Md. at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2031254\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/340/30/\">\n    665 A.2d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (analyzing whether victim impact evidence was cumulative);\n   <em>\n    Evans v.

In doing so, this Court declines to separately evaluate elements of the video or specific photographs in the montage when applying this holding to the victim impact video submitted by Mr. McQuain as the victims' representative, as Mr. Lopez requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whittlesey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2031254\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/340/30/\">\n    340 Md. at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2031254\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/340/30/\">\n    665 A.2d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, we review the victim impact evidence in its entirety to decide if the video conveys information deemed probative by the legislature, just as a sentencing judge would consider the entire video before admitting such evidence. Upon a review of the video submitted by Mr. McQuain, we conclude that this piece of victim impact evidence clearly identified both of the victims for the sentencing judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CP \u00a7 11-402(e)(1). The six-minute-and-twelve-second video portrayed 115 photographs of the two victims, including photos of the individual victims and the victims as a family. The video depicted the victims throughout various stages of their lives, engaging in activities, as well as spending time together as a mother and son. The identity of the victims is one of the permissible contents listed under CP \u00a7 11-402(e)(1), which we have adopted and applied to all prepared victim impact evidence. As such, we conclude that the video played at Mr. Lopez's sentencing hearing satisfied the content restrictions under the adopted statute. Therefore, we conclude that the sentencing judge did not err as a matter of law in admitting this video at the sentencing hearing. Moreover, we determine that the judge's decision to admit the victim impact video was not so far \"removed from the center mark\" because the video was not irrelevant or overly prejudicial; as such, the sentencing judge did not abuse her discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sumpter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4056671\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/436/74/#p85\">\n    436 Md. at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4056950,4056671\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/80/1045/\">\n    80 A.3d 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Mr. Lopez asserts that his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment was violated when the sentencing judge admitted the victim impact video because it introduced an arbitrary factor into the sentencing proceeding.

Moreover, the Supreme Court considers specifically whether showing victim impact evidence to a sentencing jury, as opposed to a sentencing judge, violates a defendant's Eighth Amendment rights. Therefore, these Supreme Court precedents are not dispositive to our analysis of whether victim impact evidence violates a noncapital defendant's Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Mr. Lopez did not cite to any case law, and this Court has found none, that involve a noncapital defendant successfully arguing that the presentation of victim impact evidence to a sentencing judge violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment. Therefore, it becomes significant that the issue before us is distinct from the questions addressed in\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   . In Mr. Lopez's case, there was no possibility that the sentencing judge could arbitrarily impose the death penalty. The State in this case sought only a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. As this Court made clear in\n   <em>\n    Woods v. State\n   </em>\n   : \"We do not agree with the notion that a life sentence without the possibility of parole is, even relatively, the equivalent of death itself. The death penalty cases cited by [the Petitioner] to support this view are simply inapposite.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2035480\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/315/591/#p606\">\n    315 Md. 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 606-07,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2035480\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/315/591/#p606\">\n    556 A.2d 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989).

In response, the State contends that the Court of Special Appeals was correct in holding that the victim impact video was not so unduly prejudicial for two reasons: the sentencing body in this case was a judge as opposed to a jury; and, the video was not lengthy or highly emotional.

As such, we will also apply Justice O'Connor's test to determine whether showing victim impact evidence to a sentencing judge violated a noncapital defendant's due process rights. In the instant case, we apply this test to analyze whether admitting the victim impact video during the sentencing hearing violated Mr. Lopez's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   At Mr. Lopez's sentencing hearing, the State first indicated to the court that it intended to \"present a slide show or PowerPoint that shows some of the history of the defendant along with the victims in this case. I've already told people here, but there's going to be some very difficult pictures presented. This is a very horrific crime and some of these pictures that are going to be shown are going to be such.\" (Cleaned up). After briefly introducing the victims and the\n   defendant's criminal history\n   with the supporting PowerPoint, the State presented a synopsis of the facts of the case. Specifically, the State summarized that \"the defendant planned to murder Jane and William McQuain before he even traveled to Maryland. He came and he stayed in Maryland with them for two weeks, knowing the entire time that he planned to kill them.\" Detailing each movement the defendant took in planning the murders, the State ultimately discussed how the defendant murdered Jane McQuain.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   At some point during the middle of the night and the early morning hours of October 1st, 2011, the defendant murdered Jane McQuain in her bed. The photographs we're going to present are from the crime scene. The defendant used a 30-pound metal weight, which you can see in this picture, your honor, to your right that he brought from North Carolina....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   The defendant takes that 30-pound weight, he sneaks up on Jane McQuain while she's lying in her bed, he smashed the weight into the back of her head at least two times. Jane was suffering from massive head trauma but was still alive. The defendant threw extra blankets over Jane at that point. The defendant then went and got a large butcher knife. He stabbed Jane through all three comforters, twice in her back. One of those puncture wounds injured her rib and punctured her lung.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   This is how officers found Jane McQuain when they broke into her house on October 12th. The defendant had stabbed Jane McQuain so hard that the knife was actually bent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The sentencing judge, therefore, heard the gruesome description of the murder of Jane as she slept and saw pictures of the murder victim as the police found her, beaten and stabbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The State continued to describe the method in which the defendant murdered his second victim, William.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   The defendant waited around the entire morning to pick up William after he went to the bank. He drove around with William for hours, from 9:30 until 1:30 p.m., hours, knowing what he was going to do, just looking for a place to murder\n   William and dump his body. The defendant continues making phone calls throughout that time to his girlfriend. The only time there's no phone use from the defendant is 1:30 to 1:51 p.m. when he was murdering William McQuain. That's a shot of where the Liberty gas station is and where William's body was later found.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   These photos are also graphic from the crime scene. When William was found on October 18th, this is how William was found: with some debris covering him; once the debris is removed; the baseball bat that was found feet away from William McQuain's body.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   The defendant struck William McQuain at least four times in the head, shattering his skull into pieces, 36 pieces to be exact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Jane and William McQuain loved and trusted the defendant, and he used that love and trust to murder both of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   While recounting the horrific details of how the defendant murdered William, the State showed the sentencing judge pictures of the young victim's body left in the woods. After the State described and showed the crimes in detail, the State asked the court to hear testimony from various friends and family of the murder victims. Mr. McQuain, the victims' representative and Jane's brother, testified last, after which he asked the court to view the victim impact video. As such, the sentencing\n   court heard the detailed facts of the murders before viewing the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   This Court does not deny that the victim impact video is capable of evoking emotions. However, we conclude that the video did not inflame the passions of the sentencing judge more than the facts of the crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108176\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/808/\">\n    501 U.S. at 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108176\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/808/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The sentencing judge in this case was presented detailed evidence about the methods the defendant employed in killing his wife and her son. The sentencing judge heard evidence that the defendant used a thirty-pound metal weight to smash into his wife's head while she was sleeping\n   and then continued to stab her twice in order to ensure that she was dead. The State also emphasized how the defendant struck William's head with a baseball bat four times, splitting his skull into thirty-six pieces. Significantly, the State described these horrible murders while showing the sentencing judge gruesome pictures of the crime scene, depicting the victims just after they were murdered. Additionally, the sentencing judge heard again and again how Mr. Lopez manipulated his wife and a boy who called him \"Dad\" in order to murder them and steal their possessions. The facts of this crime are irrefutably shocking, horrific, and emotional. Applying the standard announced by Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the victim impact video, displaying the victims as they lived, did not inflame the passion of the sentencing judge more than the facts of the crime.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108176\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/808/\">\n    501 U.S. at 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108176\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/808/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (O'Connor, J., concurring);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2023747\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/333/660/#p688\">\n    333 Md. at 688-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2023747\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/333/660/#p688\">\n    637 A.2d 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This limitation in content does not, however, apply to victim impact testimony due to the emotional and spontaneous nature of live testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   , 347 Md. at 197,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024303\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/347/156/#p197\">\n    699 A.2d 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, we conclude that the sentencing judge did not err in admitting the victim impact video for two reasons: first, judges have discretion to admit any form of victim impact evidence beyond CP \u00a7 11-402 and \u00a7 11-403 at sentencing hearings; and\n   second, the video in question identified the victims, which is one of the permissible contents under CP \u00a7 11-402(e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   We also hold that a defendant's Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment is not violated when victim impact evidence is presented at a noncapital sentencing proceeding. As the State requested a sentence of life imprisonment without parole, Mr. Lopez is not a capital defendant. As such, Mr. Lopez's Eighth Amendment rights were not violated when the sentencing judge admitted the victim impact video at the sentencing proceeding. Finally, in applying Justice O'Connor's test from her concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the victim impact video did not inflame the passions of the sentencing judge more so than the facts of the crime. As such, we hold that showing the video at the sentencing hearing did not violate Mr. Lopez's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

After speeding and running a red light, a driver crashed into Alex's car, causing Alex serious body and brain damage; thus, Alex was unable to speak for himself as a victim. Alex's mother was responsible for caring for Alex after the car crash. However, Alex eventually passed away as a result of his injuries. Alex's mother appeared before the district court for the driver's disposition hearing. Alex's mother asked the court if she could read a victim impact statement; however, the district court judge denied her request. In response to the events involving Alex and his mother, as well as similar experiences statewide, the Maryland General Assembly enacted Alex's Law to require courts, if practicable, to consider a request from victims or a victim's representative to address the court before the imposition of a sentence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Hearing on House Bill 1382 Before the Judiciary Comm. of the H.D., 2013 Leg., 438th Sess.
