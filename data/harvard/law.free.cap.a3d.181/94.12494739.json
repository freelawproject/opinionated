Geci.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant claims that (1) the court erred by finding that, upon the death of the decedent, William F. Klee, the plaintiff became the sole owner of joint bank accounts held by the decedent and the plaintiff, and, thus, they were not part of his estate, and (2) the court abused its discretion by reinstating the plaintiff as the executrix of the decedent's estate. We disagree\n   with the defendant and, therefore, affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We begin by setting forth the relevant facts and procedural history. On July 12, 2015, the Probate Court for the district of Ellington issued a decision in which it\n   found that the decedent and the plaintiff held funds in joint accounts for convenience purposes only, that the decedent did not intend for the plaintiff to become the sole owner of the funds in the joint accounts upon his death, that the plaintiff undervalued assets in the inventory of the estate, and that money given to the plaintiff by the decedent to purchase a new car must be reported as estate inventory. On the basis of those findings, the Probate Court ordered that a constructive trust for the benefit of the defendant be placed on the undervalued assets and the funds in the joint accounts or, in the alternative, that a constructive trust be imposed on the remainder of the proceeds in the decedent's estate. The Probate Court also ordered that the money the plaintiff used to purchase the car must be reported as an advanced distribution in the final accounting of the decedent's estate. Later, on August 17, 2015, the Probate Court removed the plaintiff as executrix of the decedent's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-186 (a), the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court from the Probate Court's orders involving the joint bank accounts and its decision to remove her as executrix of the decedent's estate. The Superior Court consolidated the plaintiff's appeals and conducted a de novo hearing focused on two issues-whether the jointly held bank accounts in question were part of the decedent's estate and whether the plaintiff should be reinstated as the executrix. The court, after conducting a three day bench trial, found that the plaintiff became the sole owner of the joint bank accounts upon the decedent's death. The court also reinstated the plaintiff as the executrix of the decedent's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court set forth the following facts in its memorandum of decision: \"[The decedent] ... died on September 19, 2013 [and was] predeceased [by his spouse, Gloria R. Klee. The decedent and Gloria Klee]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   had three children ... the plaintiff, Marjorie K. Heintz and Frederick G. Klee. All three of these children ... survived the decedent.... [The decedent] was, by all reports, known to be a hard-working, self-employed farmer throughout his life, who, in partnership with ... Gloria Klee ... was able to maintain a farming business in the town of Ellington, Connecticut, for many years. Both the decedent and [Gloria Klee] did physical work on the farm. However, while it was the decedent who was primarily involved in the actual physical operation of the farming business, it was [Gloria] Klee who did all the household chores and bookkeeping ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Notwithstanding the fact that the decedent did not routinely write out checks to pay family household or business related bills, the decedent was nonetheless a competent and savvy businessman/farmer.... [According to the] plaintiff's expert witness, Attorney Atherton B. Ryan, the decedent was more than capable of managing and conducting his own affairs.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Ryan's professional relationship with the decedent began in 2006 when the decedent hired Ryan to collect a debt from the decedent's daughter, Marjorie Heintz. During the litigation regarding the contested debt, Ryan advised the decedent to amend his will. The decedent directed Ryan to draft a new will\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in order to \"remove Marjorie from\n   the will and to give Marjorie's one-third share to Marjorie's children, the defendant, David Boor, (a 2/9ths share) and [the defendant's] sister, Melissa Mascalla, (a 1/9th share).\" The decedent signed this will on June 13, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Gloria Klee was diagnosed with cancer in 2005. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff \"assumed not only the role of caregiver for her mother during the period of her mother's final illness but also her mother's duties\n   at the farm. This included not only doing the bookkeeping and bill-paying for the family household, but more importantly, assuming the responsibility for [the decedent's] well-being after Gloria [Klee] had died. With this in mind, the decedent and [Gloria Klee] made a conscious decision during the period of [her] last illness to apprise the plaintiff of their financial affairs.... [Gloria Klee] showed the plaintiff all of the financial and bookkeeping documents ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The decedent, Gloria Klee, and the plaintiff opened joint checking and savings accounts on April 5, 2006, in person at Bank of America.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 11, 2006, the decedent and Gloria Klee also made the plaintiff a joint owner with a right of survivorship on three certificate of deposit accounts at Rockville Bank. Gloria Klee died shortly after adding the plaintiff onto those accounts. The decedent closed all of the accounts at Bank of America and Rockville Bank on March 12, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The decedent once again created a new will on January 11, 2012, to replace the June 13, 2006 will. The new \"will provided a few specific bequests with the residuary of the decedent's estate to be divided equally between the plaintiff and the defendant .... No provision was made for the decedent's daughter, Marjorie, or the decedent's son, Frederick [Klee]\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   .... [This will was] admitted to probate after the decedent's death ... and the plaintiff was appointed executrix of the estate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although not explicitly set forth in the court's memorandum of decision, the following additional facts are\n   not disputed by the parties and are consistent with the court's other findings. The plaintiff and decedent opened joint accounts with a right of survivorship at Rockville Bank, which is now known as United Bank. At the time of the decedent's death, the decedent and the plaintiff were signatories on a joint checking account, a joint savings account, and four joint certificate of deposit accounts at United Bank. The plaintiff did not probate the funds, totaling approximately $400,000, in the bank accounts. Additional facts will be set forth as needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant claims that the court erred by finding that the plaintiff became the sole owner of joint bank accounts held by the decedent and the plaintiff upon the decedent's death. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We begin by setting forth the relevant law pertaining to the ownership of joint bank accounts after the death of one account holder, as well as the standard that governs our review of the court's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Joint survivorship bank accounts are governed by General Statutes \u00a7 36a-290.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Case law interprets \u00a7 36a-290 (b) as\n   giving rise to a rebuttable presumption that \"the creation of a joint account is evidence of the intent of the person creating the account to have the proceeds go, upon his or her death, to the other joint account holder.\"\n   <em>\n    Bunting\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bunting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1160054\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/60/665/#p679\">\n    60 Conn.

The defendant first argues that the court should have found that the plaintiff and the decedent were in a confidential relationship, shifting the burden of proof with regard to ownership of the accounts to the plaintiff. The defendant's second argument is that the present case is factually similar to\n   <em>\n    Garrigus\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Viarengo\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061104\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/112/655/#p662\">\n    112 Conn.

The record, however, reveals a basis to conclude that this was not the case. First, the plaintiff's relationship with the decedent did not reflect the paradigms of a confidential relationship. Second, the record demonstrates that the decedent may not have been as susceptible as the defendant contends; the decedent was capable of managing his financial affairs and there is evidence that the decedent understood the survivorship rights on joint accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Determining whether a confidential relationship exists is a factual inquiry.\n   <em>\n    Albuquerque\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Albuquerque\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"127337\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/42/284/#p287\">\n    42 Conn.

The defendant referred to this in his testimony by stating that the decedent \"would accuse ...

The plaintiff recalled that the decedent was aware of how much money the accounts contained\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and scrutinized how the money was being spent, frequently questioning payments to parties he did not recognize.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, there was evidence that the decedent made the ultimate determination in the management of his financial affairs.

Each of you intends that when you die the balance in the account (subject to any previous pledge to which we have agreed) will belong to the survivor(s).\" The decedent should have received this information when he opened the accounts with the plaintiff.

The plaintiff's alleged concealment of the survivorship rights of the accounts from her daughter is not material to the outcome of this case.

Whether the plaintiff informed her daughter about the survivorship nature of the accounts neither provides insight as to the decedent's intent, nor reveals anything about the relationship between the decedent and the plaintiff. The defendant does not proffer a reason why a finding that the plaintiff concealed her right of survivorship from her daughter would be material to the case. Further, the defendant needed to explain that failing to make such a finding would be impactful in light of the fact that the defendant needed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that equity required divesting the plaintiff of the accounts.

The record contains contradictory testimony regarding whether the plaintiff had an opportunity to conceal the survivorship rights from Ryan and whether the decedent knew about the survivorship rights. \"Where there is conflicting testimony, we do not retry the facts or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses....

The defendant alleges that the plaintiff concealed the survivorship nature when she brought the decedent to Ryan's office to amend his will in 2012. Ryan testified that the plaintiff sat in on the conference when the decedent discussed how he wanted to amend his will, but that the plaintiff did not actively participate in the conversation. Ryan stated that, aside from exchanging brief pleasantries, the plaintiff said little at the meeting\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that although there was a terse discussion of the decedent's assets, the decedent brought the conversation to an abrupt end. The plaintiff testified that she was asked to leave the room after briefly greeting Ryan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court was left to evaluate contradictory testimony that the plaintiff did not attend the meeting against evidence that she was not an active participant. The court was free to assign credibility to either account. Therefore, it was not clearly erroneous for the court to fail to find that the plaintiff concealed the right of survivorship from Ryan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The defendant relies on his own testimony to argue\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the plaintiff concealed the right of survivorship from the decedent. The defendant testified that the decedent was confused as to why the plaintiff's name was on the accounts and that despite arguments between the plaintiff and the decedent regarding finances, the decedent never took the plaintiff's name off the accounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff testified that her name was on the accounts as a joint owner because her parents wanted her to have the money in the accounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, the court was left to evaluate contradictory testimony. The plaintiff's testimony provided evidence that she did not conceal the survivorship rights from the decedent, and the court was free to credit that testimony. Therefore, it was not clearly erroneous for the court to fail to find that she concealed the survivorship rights on the accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The defendant's final argument is that the court failed to give proper weight to evidence concerning the decedent's intent. As previously explained, the existence of a joint account creates a presumption that the decedent intended the joint account to become the property of the surviving account holder(s). This presumption can be overcome only with clear and convincing evidence.\n   <em>\n    Garrigus\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Viarengo\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061104\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/112/655/#p662\">\n    112 Conn.

Nothing in the court's decision suggests that the court failed to consider whether the presumption was overcome or any of the relevant evidence on the issue. The court noted that \"[i]t is true that the state of the evidence in this case is a bit contradictory. On the one hand, we have the incontrovertible evidence that the decedent created these joint accounts with himself and [the plaintiff]. Examined in a vacuum, this seems to clearly show that he intended to have ownership of the totality of the $400,000 vest in [the plaintiff] upon his death (after all, that is the general meaning of a joint account). On the other hand, there is the clearly contradictory stated intent in his last will and testament-that the residuary of [the decedent's] estate is to be equally divided between [the plaintiff and the defendant].\" Therefore, the court weighed the evidence concerning the decedent's\n   intent and decided that it did not clearly and convincingly overcome the presumption set forth in \u00a7 36a-290 (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The defendant also claims that the court abused its discretion by reinstating the plaintiff as the executrix of the decedent's estate. The defendant argues that, by undervaluing certain assets in the inventory of the decedent's estate, the plaintiff failed to perform adequately her duties as executrix. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The property at issue was a tractor and two vehicles-an automobile and a dump truck. The defendant supports this claim by arguing that his own testimony contradicts the plaintiff's valuations and that the plaintiff, by her own admission, initially confused the value of the two vehicles. The court observed that \"[d]espite there being some allegations that the plaintiff did not perform her job properly, this court cannot find that the decisions she made as executrix, the valuations she placed upon the property in the inventories, were unsupported by evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Removal of an executrix is left to the sound discretion of the Probate Court.\n   <em>\n    Ramsdell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Union Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498009\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/202/57/#p65\">\n    202 Conn. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 65,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=519%20A.2d%201185\">\n    519 A.2d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). \"On appeal from probate, the trial court may exercise the same discretion de novo, reviewing the facts relating to the propriety of removal without regard to the Probate Court's decision.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=519%20A.2d%201185\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   That leaves this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court amounts to an abuse of discretion. \"Under the abuse of discretion standard of review, [w]e will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court's ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion ....

The plaintiff valued the tractor at $12,000, the automobile at $4000, and the dump truck at $8000. The defendant, \"a person who deals in automotive transactions,\" appraised the automobile at $12,088. The defendant estimated, on the basis of the National Auto Dealers Association blue book, that the dump truck was worth $15,413. Scott Stanton, the tractor dealer who sold and repaired the decedent's tractor, estimated that the tractor was worth $25,000 at the time of the decedent's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The defendant is essentially requesting that this court conclude that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to reinstate the plaintiff because of the higher estimated values of the assets that he, an interested party, and Stanton presented. Even though there was a difference between the defendant's appraisals and the plaintiff's valuations, the court acted within its discretion by reinstating the plaintiff as executrix. The values utilized by the plaintiff equal, or are close in value to, the town of Ellington's tax assessments on the assets, which were admitted as evidence. Therefore, after reviewing the record, we conclude that the court's decision to reinstate the plaintiff as the executrix was reasonable, supported by the record, and not an abuse of its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The judgments are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Geci brought this appeal from probate both individually and in her representative capacity as executrix of the estate of the decedent, William F.

Upon the death of one joint account holder, the surviving holder becomes the sole owner of the money.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Ryan testified that \"[a]pparently,\" the decedent was aware of the survivorship nature of joint bank accounts in March, 2007.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Ryan testified: \"My recollection is that [the plaintiff] had brought [the decedent] to the office. She did sit [in] on the conference [to discuss amending the decedent's will]. I don't remember her contributing to the conference or the discussion at all other than to say hi, the normal greeting kind of discussion. Specifically, I do not believe she contributed or commented upon [the decedent's] expressed desire.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The plaintiff testified: \"[The decedent] said he wanted to change the will, and ... Ryan sat down with him, and [Ryan] asked me to walk out of the room so he could talk to [the decedent], and I sat in the lobby.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The defendant also refers to the lack of anyone from Rockville Bank testifying about the decedent opening the accounts with the plaintiff in support of a finding that the plaintiff concealed the right of survivorship. This is a speculative proposition and ignores the possibility that the bank employees cannot accurately recall every patron who opens a new account.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    In arguing that the plaintiff concealed the right of survivorship on the accounts from the decedent, the defendant relies on his own testimony, which, rather than supporting his claim that the plaintiff concealed the survivorship rights from the decedent, reveals the opposite, mainly that the decedent was aware that the plaintiff's name was on the accounts. The defendant testified that the decedent was aware the plaintiff was listed on the account and contemplated removing her, but never did so. The defendant testified that \"[a]ll [the plaintiff] would say [to the decedent] is, go to the bank and take my name off.\" \"One time after ... [the plaintiff and the decedent] had an argument about [the accounts], he asked me to take him to the bank to find out why her name was on it, whose money it was, and I flat out refused.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    During the plaintiff's direct examination, the following colloquy occurred:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n    \"[The Plaintiff's Counsel]: And whose money was it [in the accounts] ... upon [the decedent's] passing?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n    \"[The Plaintiff]: Mine.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n    \"[The Plaintiff's Counsel]: And why you do you say that ...?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n    \"[The Plaintiff]: Because that's what my mom and dad wanted-was for me to have the money [in the accounts] upon their death.\"\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
