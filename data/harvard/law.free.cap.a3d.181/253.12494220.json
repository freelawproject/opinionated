The Court notes that the \"Notice of Emergency Removal\" form is just that - a notice provided to a parent by the Division of Child Protection and Permanency that a child has been removed from the home. The Court's affirmance of the finding of abuse or neglect does not rely on A.B.'s refusal to sigh that form.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
