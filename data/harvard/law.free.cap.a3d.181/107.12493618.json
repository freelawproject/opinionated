We are not persuaded and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties do not dispute the following facts. On January 19, 2013, the mother of the defendant's children made a complaint to the Newtown Police Department that her husband, the defendant, had physically and sexually abused two of her children, who were six and eight years old. The following day, the mother reported to the police department that one of the two children had recanted the allegation and that she had misunderstood the other child, whom she thought had reported\n   sexual abuse to her. The police department then conducted an investigation that included a forensic interview of the children by a multi-disciplinary team.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 27, 2013, the defendant was arrested pursuant to a warrant and charged with sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a, risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21(a)(1), and risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21(a)(2). The court issued two protective orders prohibiting the defendant, among other things, from having any contact with the two children. Subsequently, the court also appointed a guardian ad litem for the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 5, 2014, the defendant filed a motion seeking a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   evidentiary hearing regarding the veracity of information contained in the affidavit accompanying the state's application for the arrest warrant. See\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Delaware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    438 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). In that motion, the defendant asserted that the investigating officer intentionally or recklessly had misrepresented the content of statements made by the children during the forensic interview of the children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following a review of various submissions by the state and the defendant, the court,\n   <em>\n    Eschuk, J.\n   </em>\n   , concluded in a memorandum of decision that the affidavit inaccurately described some of the statements made by the children during the forensic interview and that the inaccurate descriptions were made with reckless disregard for their truth. The court nevertheless declined to dismiss the charges against the defendant because, even if the inaccurate portions of the affidavit were not considered, other information set forth in the\n   warrant application was sufficient to demonstrate probable cause for the defendant's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 26, 2016, the state and the defendant appeared before the court,\n   <em>\n    Russo, J.\n   </em>\n   The state entered a nolle prosequi, stating, \"[w]itness is unavailable.\" The state asked permission to place on the record its reasons for entering a nolle. The state explained that the children and their mother had moved to London, England, and that the children's mother had sent a letter on May 23, 2016, in which she indicated that she and the children would not be returning to the United States and requested that the state not contact her further. After making these representations, Stephen J. Sedensky III, the state's attorney for the judicial district of Danbury, stated: \"So, both [she] ... and the children are unavailable, Your Honor, and they are ... outside the United States and not subject to interstate ... subpoena issues, and so for those reasons ... the unavailability of three key witnesses in the case, the state is entering a nolle.\" Following this representation, the court noted the nolle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant then moved for a dismissal of the charges against him. In support of his motion, the defendant offered, and the court admitted over the state's objection, a copy of the May 23, 2016 letter from the children's mother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the conclusion of the hearing,\n   the court indicated that a nolle had entered that day and that, after giving the parties an opportunity to file briefs, it would issue a decision on whether the case should be dismissed on the next court date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following additional argument on June 15, 2016, the court issued an oral decision granting the defendant's motion to dismiss. The court indicated that the state had not sufficiently represented that a material witness had died, disappeared, or become disabled within the meaning of \u00a7 54-56b and Practice Book \u00a7 39-30, and, as a result, the defendant was entitled to a dismissal. In the court's view, the material witnesses were not \"unavailable,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   but instead were simply unwilling to assist the state. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, the state claims that, under the circumstances of this case, in which the mother relocated with the two children to another country beyond the reach of the state's power to compel their attendance at trial and refuses to return with them voluntarily to the United States, the court improperly entered a judgment of dismissal for two reasons. First, it contends that the children \"had become disabled\" within the meaning of \u00a7 54-56b. Alternatively, the state asserts that the children had \"disappeared\" within the meaning of \u00a7 54-56b. We disagree with both of these arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We begin our analysis with a general discussion regarding the law as it pertains to a nolle prosequi and the appropriate standard of review for the state's claims on appeal. A nolle prosequi is \"a declaration of the prosecuting officer that he will not prosecute the suit further at that time.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Winer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3961119\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/286/666/#p685\">\n    286 Conn. 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 685,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=945%20A.2d%20430\">\n    945 A.2d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), quoting\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ackerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765794\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-supp/27/209/#p211\">\n    27 Conn.

As our Supreme Court has explained, \"[t]he effect of a nolle is to terminate the particular prosecution of the defendant without an acquittal and without placing him in jeopardy.... Therefore, the nolle places the criminal matter in the same position it held prior to the filing of the information. Indeed, no criminal matter exists until, and if, the prosecution issues a new information against the defendant....

The principles that today govern the entry of a nolle prosequi place some restrictions on the prosecuting attorney's formerly unfettered discretion. Although the decision to initiate a nolle prosequi still rests with the state's attorney, the statute and the rules now permit the defendant to object to a nolle prosequi and to demand either a trial or a dismissal except upon a representation to the court by the prosecuting official that a material witness has died, disappeared or become disabled or that material evidence has disappeared or been destroyed and that a further\n   investigation is therefore necessary.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lloyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"534560\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/185/199/#p201\">\n    185 Conn. 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 201-202,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20A.2d%20867\">\n    440 A.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In determining whether to accept the state's representation and to decline to enter a dismissal, \"the trial court need not receive evidence, and thus makes no findings of fact, to determine the accuracy of the state's representations.\" Id., at 204,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20A.2d%20867\">\n    440 A.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our Supreme Court also has made clear that, at least in circumstances in which the meaning of \u00a7 54-56b is not in dispute, \"[t]he proper test is whether there\n   has been a manifest abuse of prosecutorial discretion. The court must accept the entry of the nolle prosequi for the record unless it is persuaded that the prosecutor's exercise of discretion is clearly contrary to manifest public interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20A.2d%20867\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5764893\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/426/#p430\">\n    291 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   429 n.4,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20A.2d%20166\">\n    969 A.2d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the present case, however, the state concedes that the resolution of its appeal does not turn on the factual sufficiency of the representation made by the prosecutor but instead on the meaning of the language employed by the legislature in \u00a7 54-56b.

In advancing this assertion, the state argues that the phrase \"has ... become disabled\" should be construed to be synonymous with \"has ... become\n   unavailable,\" as that term is typically used in related contexts regarding witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We begin with the words of \u00a7 54-56b, which provides in relevant part: \"A nolle prosequi may not be entered as to any count in a complaint or information if the accused objects to the nolle prosequi and demands either a trial or dismissal, except with respect to prosecutions in which a nolle prosequi is entered upon a representation to the court by the prosecuting official that a material witness has died, disappeared or become disabled ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The state concedes, as it must, that the legislature did not choose to employ the expansive term \"unavailable\" in \u00a7 54-56b. The phrase \"unavailable\" is a term of art when used with respect to witnesses, although its meaning often varies depending on the circumstances in which it is used. See, e.g., Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6, commentary (\"At common law, the definition of unavailability varied with the individual hearsay exception. ... Section 8-6 eschews a uniform definition of unavailability.\" [Citations omitted.] ); Practice Book \u00a7 43-40(2) (for purposes of calculating speedy trial deadline, \"any essential witness shall be considered unavailable whenever such person's whereabouts are known but his or her presence for trial cannot be obtained by due diligence or he or she resists appearing\n   at or being returned\n   for trial\"); Practice Book \u00a7 23-39 ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   see also Practice Book \u00a7 40-56 ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fed.

For example, in General Statutes \u00a7 52-160, the legislature provided that \"[i]f any witness in a civil action is beyond the reach of the process of the courts of this state, or cannot be found ... [a transcript of his or her recorded testimony in] a former trial of the action ... shall be admissible in evidence, in the discretion of the court ....\" Presumably, the legislature chose not to employ the same or similar language in \u00a7 54-56b, thereby indicating an intent that \u00a7 54-56b sweep less broadly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The state relies on\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3963702\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/289/598/\">\n    289 Conn. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=960%20A.2d%20993\">\n    960 A.2d 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), in support of its assertion that \u00a7 54-56b should be interpreted to apply in circumstances where a material witness is \"unavailable.\" Specifically, the state relies on the following statement by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   : \"Section 54-56b allows the entry of a nolle prosequi upon a representation to the court by the prosecuting official that a material witness is unavailable to testify.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

The court in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   never analyzed the relevant language in the statute and rules of practice but merely assumed without deciding that the witness' \"unavailability\" fell within the language of these provisions. Accordingly, the decision in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   does not advance the state's construction of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For these reasons, we decline to accept the state's invitation to import a broad exception for \"unavailable\" witnesses into \u00a7 54-56b. We must presume from the legislature's use of the term \"unavailable\" in other sections of the General Statutes that the legislature intended to sweep less broadly when it chose not to include the term \"unavailable\" in \u00a7 54-56b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We turn then to the narrower question of whether the statutory phrase \"has ... become disabled\" should be interpreted, as the state contends, to include circumstances in which a witness cannot be compelled to testify for reasons that extend beyond any physical or mental disability of the witness. In this regard, the state argues that because the legislature did not define the phrase \"become disabled,\" we should \"look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Agron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487868\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1052/#p635\">\n    323 Conn. 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 635,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487868\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1052/#p635\">\n    148 A.3d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Unsurprisingly, resort to dictionary definitions does not yield an easy or uniform answer.

The second definition provided, however, defines \"disable\" to mean \"to make legally incapable.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487868\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1052/#p635\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Black's Law Dictionary defines \"disable\" to mean: \"to take away the ability of, to render incapable of proper and effective action.\" Black's Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979) p. 416. Both the defendant and the state attempt to \"cherry-pick\" dictionary definitions that they contend support their respective positions, but, in our view, resort to dictionary definitions does not yield a clear or obvious answer, and the meaning of \"disabled\" often varies significantly depending on the context in which it is used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The essence of the state's argument is that, by employing the phrase, \"has ... become disabled,\" the legislature intended that the defendant not be entitled to a dismissal following the entry of a nolle prosequi in any instance in which a material witness in the case cannot be compelled by the state to testify. Such an expansive definition of that phrase, however, risks swallowing up and rendering superfluous the other two exceptions included by the legislature: death and disappearance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Certainly, if a witness has died or disappeared, the state will be unable to compel his or her testimony because it will be unable to serve a subpoena on that witness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moreover, the state's proffered definition of the phrase \"has ... become disabled\" simply is, in our view, an alternative argument why it should be construed to mean \"has ... become unavailable\" as that phrase is often used with respect to witnesses. For the reasons we previously have stated, however, we find it significant that the legislature has used the term \"unavailable\" in other statutes but has not chosen to use it in \u00a7 54-56b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We also find significant that the legislature used the passive phrase \"has ... become disabled\" in \u00a7 54-56b. In our view, this language suggests that the process by which the witness became disabled was one in which an event or condition beyond the voluntary choice of the witness or his guardian not to cooperate with the state now prevents that witness from being able to testify in the matter. Stated another way, the language is not suggestive of a\n   process in which an event or condition has stripped the state of its ability to compel the witness' attendance at trial. In this case, the children (through their mother) have decided not to cooperate in the prosecution of this matter by voluntarily placing themselves beyond the reach of the state's ability to compel their attendance at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state's assertion that the legislature intended to include such a factual circumstance within the statutory exception by employing the phrase \"has ... become disabled\" is simply not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, the state's reliance on\n   <em>\n    New Milford Savings Bank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jajer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"237002\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/52/69/\">\n    52 Conn.

In\n   <em>\n    New Milford Savings Bank\n   </em>\n   , a foreclosure action, this court was tasked with construing General Statutes \u00a7 52-235b, which provides: \"If, prior to judgment, an attorney for any reason ceases to be a member of the bar or becomes physically or mentally incapacitated\n   <em>\n    or otherwise disabled\n   </em>\n   so as to prevent him from appearing in court in an action in which he has appeared for a client, further proceedings shall not be taken in the action against the client, without leave of the court, until thirty days after notice to appear in person or by another attorney has been served upon the client either personally or in such manner as the court directs.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The defendant argued in\n   <em>\n    New Milford Savings Bank\n   </em>\n   that the trial court should not have rendered a judgment of foreclosure in that case. There, the defendant's attorney was unable to attend the trial in the foreclosure matter because he was obligated to appear at a hearing before another Superior Court that was considering whether to suspend him from the practice of law after he pleaded guilty to a felony charge in federal court.\n   <em>\n    New Milford Savings Bank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jajer\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"237002\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/52/69/\">\n    52 Conn.

Under those circumstances, the defendant in the foreclosure matter argued that his lawyer had been \" 'otherwise disabled' \" within the meaning of \u00a7 52-235b ; id., at 77,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=726%20A.2d%20604\">\n    726 A.2d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and therefore the trial should have been stayed.

This court agreed, concluding that the statute applied to circumstances beyond the physical or mental disability of an attorney to include a circumstance in which the attorney was obligated to attend his own suspension hearing.

The language of \u00a7 52-235b is fundamentally different from that of \u00a7 54-56b because it includes\n   by direct reference a \"physical or mental\" incapacity and then explicitly adds language, not present in \u00a7 54-56b, that extends its reach beyond physical or mental infirmities to include other forms of disability. Indeed, the decision in\n   <em>\n    New Milford Savings Bank\n   </em>\n   supports the defendant's arguments in this case because it provides yet another example of a situation in which the legislature has expressed an intent to expand the coverage of a statute to circumstances beyond those involving only a physical or mental disability. The legislature did not do so in \u00a7 54-56b.\n   In sum, we conclude that the statutory phrase \"has ... become disabled\" in \u00a7 54-56b was not intended to extend to instances in which the state lacks the ability to compel a witness to testify at trial. Accordingly, we are not persuaded by the state's first claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We next address the state's claim that the defendant was not entitled to a dismissal of the prosecution because it had sufficiently represented that material witnesses (the children) had \"disappeared\" within the meaning of \u00a7 54-56b. Specifically, the state argues that the term \"disappeared\" must be construed to include circumstances in which the state knows the location of a witness but the witness is beyond the reach of legal process to compel his or her attendance at trial, and he or she is not expected to return to the jurisdiction. This claim does not warrant much discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In pressing this claim, the state concedes that it knows the precise location of the witnesses. Despite this concession, the state argues in a contradictory fashion that the \"witnesses have passed out of sight and vanished from the state.\" It also concedes that in ordinary parlance and pursuant to standard dictionary definitions, \"disappeared\" means \"to pass out of sight either\n   suddenly or gradually; vanish.\" American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (New College Edition 1981) p. 374; see also Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th Ed. 2012) p. 355 (\"to pass from view\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Despite its concessions, the state argues that two cases support its construction of the term \"disappeared.\" First, it relies on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maiocco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12254218\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/5/347/\">\n    5 Conn.

First, the state concedes that this statement was dictum, because the issue in that case was whether the trial court properly dismissed the case due to the state's failure to be prepared for trial. Second, the single sentence relied on by the state is unclear and ambiguous because it is impossible to determine from that sentence whether, in finding that the witness had not \"disappeared,\" the court relied on the fact that (1) the witness' location was known, (2) the witness was expected to return, or (3) a combination of those two facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We are also unpersuaded by the state's citation to an out-of-state case,\n   <em>\n    Swindler\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

Section 804 (a) of those rules provides in relevant part: \"A declarant is considered to be unavailable as a witness if the declarant: (1) is exempted from testifying about the subject matter of the declarant's statement because the court rules that a privilege applies; (2) refuses to testify about the subject matter despite a court order to do so; (3) testifies to not remembering the subject matter; (4) cannot be present or testify at the trial or hearing because of death or a then-existing infirmity, physical illness, or mental illness; or (5) is absent from the trial or hearing and the statement's proponent has not been able, by process or other reasonable means, to procure ...

Thus, the state's argument does not truly turn on the fact that the children lack the legal ability to decide to return to the United States and testify in this matter. Moreover, there is nothing in this record, including any representation by the state, that the children wish to testify in this case and that their mother is the sole impediment to obtaining their testimony.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
