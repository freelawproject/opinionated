Defendant Philip Tetreault appeals his convictions for heroin trafficking and conspiracy to sell or deliver a regulated drug. He argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence gathered from his vehicle during a traffic stop. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. The trial court made the following findings in its decision denying defendant's motion to suppress. On October 21, 2014 at 10:04 a.m., a Vermont State Police trooper was parked facing the southbound lane of Interstate 91 in Guilford, Vermont, when he saw a vehicle travel past him at eighty miles per hour in a sixty-five-mile-per-hour zone. He pulled out to stop the vehicle. The car stopped very abruptly on the highway shoulder, and the reverse lights flashed on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. The trooper saw the driver's head move to the right of his seat and disappear from view at least twice. The trooper became concerned that the driver was attempting to conceal contraband or get a weapon. He approached the vehicle on the passenger side and spoke to defendant, who was the sole occupant of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. Defendant's hands were shaking as he handed over a plastic case containing his registration and insurance documents. The trooper handed the case back to defendant and asked him to remove the relevant documents. As defendant did so, his hands continued to tremble. The trooper noticed a GPS unit, a cellular telephone\n   that he believed was a TracFone, and an air freshener in the vehicle. The trooper testified that many individuals involved in drug trafficking use prepaid TracFones because they are easy to dispose of and that air fresheners are often used to mask the odor of drugs in a vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5. The trooper asked defendant where he was headed. Defendant said he was driving to Waterbury, Connecticut, from his home in Lowell, Vermont, to buy an engagement ring. The trooper found defendant \"overly nervous for a routine traffic stop.\" After checking defendant's license status, he gave defendant a written warning and told him to slow down. Defendant's hands were still shaking when the interaction with the trooper ended. The trooper testified that drivers who are nervous during a traffic stop usually calm down significantly by the end of the interaction, but defendant remained excessively nervous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6. After the stop, the trooper called a Newport City police officer who knew defendant. The Newport officer told the trooper that about eight months earlier, a confidential source had told him that defendant was involved in selling pills and heroin, and would travel to Massachusetts or Connecticut to pick up drugs. The trooper used an Internet-based mapping program to determine that it would take approximately one hour and forty-seven minutes to travel from Brattleboro to Waterbury, Connecticut. It would take forty-five to forty-eight minutes to travel from Brattleboro to Holyoke, Massachusetts, which is a known source of drugs entering Vermont.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7. Later the same day, the trooper was parked alongside the northbound lane of Interstate 91 in Guilford. At 12:52 p.m., he observed defendant's vehicle travel past him. He followed defendant and paced defendant's vehicle, determining it was traveling between seventy and seventy-five miles per hour, or five to ten miles over the speed limit. The trooper pulled defendant over. He saw defendant lean over toward the passenger side of the car. Before he stopped defendant's car, the trooper radioed for a K-9 unit to come to the scene, as he was now suspicious that defendant was involved in drug-related activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8. As the trooper approached the vehicle, he again observed the driver moving around as if he was hiding or accessing something. Defendant was alone in the vehicle. The TracFone, air freshener, and GPS unit were still in place. The trooper again requested defendant's documentation, and told defendant that he stopped defendant for speeding. The trooper asked if defendant had made it to Waterbury. Defendant told the trooper that he had not gone to Waterbury, but had gone to the Holyoke Mall instead. The trooper asked defendant if he had purchased the engagement ring. Defendant answered that he had not, because it was more expensive than he anticipated. While speaking to defendant, the trooper noticed what he believed to be marijuana \"shake\" around the center console. He did not take the suspected marijuana into evidence. At the suppression hearing, defendant introduced a photo that appeared to show signs of chewing tobacco use in the vehicle, as well as a can of chewing tobacco and a spit can.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9. The trooper told defendant that he would write defendant another warning for speeding, and asked if defendant would mind exiting the vehicle and coming to his cruiser while he did so. The trooper told defendant he did not have to if he did not want to. Defendant exited the vehicle, and with defendant's consent, the trooper patted down his exterior clothing before both men sat in the front seats of the cruiser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 10. The trooper asked defendant about his trip while writing the warning. The trooper noted that defendant was nervous, uncertain, and had a quivering voice. Defendant identified two stores that he visited at the Holyoke Mall. He told the trooper that he had learned that his daughter was ill, so he could not go all the way to Waterbury as planned. When asked by the trooper whether he had gone to Holyoke to pick up drugs, defendant responded, \"No, I swear on my daughter's life.\" The trooper asked defendant to roll up his sleeves and tip his head back so the trooper could look for signs of drug use. Defendant complied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 11. The trooper then asked defendant, \"Do you have any objections to me searching the car? Would that be all right with you?\" Defendant responded, \"Yeah, you can.\" The trooper said, \"That's okay?\" Defendant replied, \"Is there probable cause, I mean-\" and the trooper said, \"No.\" Defendant said that he didn't understand why the trooper wanted to search the car. The trooper told him that his story was \"shaky in the beginning.\" Defendant said, \"I know my rights and I would prefer if you would get a warrant if you're gonna search.\" Defendant offered to open the glove box for the trooper. The trooper said he was interested in searching \"the whole shooting match.\" Defendant then talked about participating in the search of the car and the trooper said, \"I mean me search, not us. Is that okay?\" Defendant responded, \"Yeah.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 12. The trooper then presented defendant with a consent card. He told defendant that he would read it to defendant and allow defendant to read it himself, and then defendant could decide whether to allow the search. Defendant responded, \"Okay.\" The trooper read the entire card to defendant, then gave the card to defendant and asked him to read it, and if he agreed, to sign the card. Defendant signed the consent card without asking any questions. The card stated that defendant \"freely\" gave his permission to the trooper \"to conduct a complete search\" of the vehicle and its contents, and stated \"I understand I do not have to allow this. No threats or promises have forced this consent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 13. During this exchange, the K-9 unit requested by the trooper had arrived. The trooper and defendant exited the cruiser, and the trooper began searching defendant's vehicle. He found a pill bottle containing marijuana and a smoking pipe. The trooper decided to have the dog sniff the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 14. The trooper asked defendant, \"You all right with us running the dog through?\" Defendant responded, \"I don't see the need.\" The trooper told him, \"Sometimes I miss things.\" Defendant said, \"I'd rather just go home. ... Why can't we do that?\" The trooper said, \"We can. I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Is that okay if the dog goes through?\" Defendant responded, \"Yeah. Run her though.\" Defendant asked if he could sit in his car, and the trooper said he could not do so while the dog was inspecting the car. Defendant then said that he thought the trooper needed a warrant for the dog to go through the car. The trooper said he did not, because it was just like the trooper going through the car. Defendant responded, \"I thought it was different.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 15. The K-9 officer had the dog sniff the car. The dog alerted at the front console area and on a purse in the vehicle. Within the purse were 420 bags of a substance that tests indicated to be heroin. There was also some dog food in the purse. The K-9 officer testified that a drug dog's reaction to smelling dog food is different than its reaction to illegal drugs. More heroin was found in separate bags, for a\n   total of 14.4 grams including packaging. Defendant was arrested and charged with heroin trafficking and conspiracy to sell or deliver a regulated substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 16. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence gathered as a result of the stop. The trial court denied the motion in a written decision. It concluded based on the above findings that: (1) defendant voluntarily exited his vehicle and was not coerced or threatened into doing so; (2) even if his exit had not been voluntary, the trooper had a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to justify an exit order; (3) defendant's consent to search the vehicle was voluntary; (4) defendant was not in custody for\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   purposes when he was speaking to the trooper in the cruiser; (5) defendant did not withdraw consent to search his vehicle; and (6) the search did not exceed the scope of consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 17. Defendant filed a motion to reconsider, arguing that the court failed to address his argument that the police may not expand a traffic stop into a drug investigation without reasonable suspicion. He also argued that the dog's alert was insufficient to establish probable cause for a further search of the vehicle because the K-9 officer testified that the dog, when alerting, could not distinguish between drugs currently in the vehicle and drugs which were previously in the vehicle, or between small and large amounts of marijuana. The court ruled that the trooper had reasonable suspicion of drug activity to expand the scope of the traffic stop. The court further held that because defendant consented to the search of his vehicle, it was irrelevant whether the dog's alert created probable cause to search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 18. Defendant waived his right to a jury, and the court held a trial in April 2016. The court found defendant guilty of both charges, and imposed a sentence of two to ten years. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 19.

An investigative traffic stop may be extended if an officer has a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to justify the post-stop investigative expansion. See\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3691416\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/183/401/\">\n    2008 VT 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3691416\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/183/401/\">\n    183 Vt. 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3691416\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/183/401/\">\n    954 A.2d 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that expansion is additional seizure and therefore must-like initial stop-be supported by reasonable, articulable suspicion of wrongdoing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 21. Defendant does not dispute that the trooper had reasonable suspicion to stop him for speeding in both instances. He contends, however, that the trooper\n   impermissibly expanded a traffic stop into a drug investigation and ordered him to exit his vehicle without reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed; subjected him to overly intrusive interrogation in the cruiser, thus rendering his consent to search the vehicle ineffective; and unlawfully continued to search his vehicle after he withdrew consent. He further argues that the trial court erred by refusing to reconsider his motion to suppress at trial and denying his motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 22. We first consider defendant's argument that the trooper lacked justification to ask him to exit the car. The Fourth Amendment permits a police officer to order the driver of a lawfully stopped vehicle to exit the vehicle as a matter of course; no further justification is necessary. See\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v. Mimms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180104\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/106/#p111\">\n    434 U.S. 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 111,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180104\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/106/#p111\">\n    98 S.Ct. 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180104\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/106/#p111\">\n    54 L.Ed.2d 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977). However, we have adopted a more stringent test under the Vermont Constitution. Under Article Eleven, an exit order is justified only when \"the objective facts and circumstances would support a reasonable suspicion that the safety of the officer, or of others, was at risk or that a crime has been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Sprague\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196250\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/123/\">\n    2003 VT 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196250\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/123/\">\n    175 Vt. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196250\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/123/\">\n    824 A.2d 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 23. In\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was stopped for speeding while driving on the interstate highway. After requesting the defendant's license and registration and asking several questions related to the reason for the stop, the officer said, \"you mind having a seat in my car while I check your license, please?\" In response, the defendant exited the vehicle. At the officer's request, the defendant emptied his pockets, revealing a small packet which he admitted contained marijuana. The officer subsequently searched defendant's car, and then his house, where several marijuana plants were found. The trial court denied the defendant's motion to suppress the evidence, ruling that the defendant voluntarily exited the car and consented to the searches.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 2-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 24. We reversed, holding that there was no evidence that the officer had a reasonable, objective basis for his exit request.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 21. The officer did not claim that he had a specific safety concern, or that there was anything unusual about the location, time of day, or traffic that would justify a request to exit the vehicle. He acknowledged that the defendant did not appear to be armed and dangerous.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . There was also no evidence that the defendant was engaged in any criminal offense requiring further investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 25. We rejected the State's argument that the defendant voluntarily exited the vehicle, holding that \"[t]he critical inquiry is 'whether a reasonable person would feel free to decline the officers' requests or otherwise terminate the encounter.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 26 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Florida v. Bostick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p436\">\n    501 U.S. 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 436,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p436\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p436\">\n    115 L.Ed.2d 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) ). Our conclusion that defendant did not voluntarily exit the car was based on several factors. First, the setting was \"inherently coercive\" because the defendant \"had already been seized by virtue of the initial motor vehicle detention and the officer's show of authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 28. Second, the officer asked the defendant to exit the vehicle almost immediately after he asked for his license and registration, and \"[t]he latter request plainly communicated no more choice to defendant than the former.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 29. Finally, the officer did not inform the defendant that he could refuse to exit the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Because the exit order was not justified by safety concerns or reasonable suspicion, and the defendant did not voluntarily exit the car, we determined that the defendant's subsequent consents to the search of his person, car\n   and home were tainted and ineffective, and the evidence gathered ought to have been suppressed.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 26. The circumstances here differ significantly from those in\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   . First, the record supports the trial court's conclusion that defendant voluntarily exited the vehicle. While defendant was faced with the same situation as the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   , a traffic stop by a police officer, there the similarity ends. Here, the trooper's request to exit the car did not immediately follow his request for defendant's license and registration, as it did in\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   . Instead, the trooper and defendant discussed defendant's trip to Massachusetts and his search for an engagement ring, as well as the possibility that defendant's speedometer was malfunctioning. The video shows that the trooper's demeanor was relaxed and friendly during this discussion. The timing and tone of the request was separated from the obligatory \"request\" for defendant's license and registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 27. Moreover, in this case the trooper expressly told defendant that he could refuse to leave the vehicle, saying, \"Phil, you don't have to if you don't want to, it's just-it would be easier if you came on back real quick. I'll write you a warning again.\" Defendant replied, \"Okay,\" and exited the vehicle. As we explained in a previous case, \"the giving of such advice supports the conclusion that the consent was voluntary.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Weisler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701791\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/344/\">\n    2011 VT 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701791\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/344/\">\n    190 Vt. 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701791\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/344/\">\n    35 A.3d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude that a reasonable person in defendant's circumstances would have felt free to refuse the officer's request when the officer told him he did not have to agree to get out of his car, making his decision to exit the car voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 28. This case also differs from\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   in another significant respect. In\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   we noted that there was no indication defendant was engaged in any criminal offense beyond the traffic violation. However, here, the trooper had a reasonable and objective basis to suspect that an additional drug-related crime was being committed. See\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196250\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/123/\">\n    2003 VT 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 16, 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196250\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/123/\">\n    175 Vt. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196250\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/123/\">\n    824 A.2d 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendant correctly argues that the information provided to the trooper by the Newport police officer about his alleged drug activity, which the Newport officer received from an unnamed source eight months earlier, was, by itself, insufficiently probative to support a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing. See\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3691416\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/183/401/\">\n    2008 VT 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3691416\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/183/401/\">\n    183 Vt. 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3691416\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/183/401/\">\n    954 A.2d 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that uncorroborated information in CAD system from unnamed sources that defendant had prior involvement with drugs was insufficient to provide reasonable suspicion of drug activity). In\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   , the information from the CAD system was the only indication of any involvement with drugs by defendant Cunningham. As we subsequently noted in\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]t is clear that the officers in\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   ... were acting on little more than a hunch.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461444\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/423/\">\n    2015 VT 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461444\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/423/\">\n    200 Vt. 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461444\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/423/\">\n    132 A.3d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, on the other hand, defendant's unusual reason for travel, actions inconsistent with his stated itinerary, travel to and from a drug source city, excessive nervousness and furtive\n   movements, and the presence of marijuana and drug courier paraphernalia in the car, viewed by a trooper familiar with drug trafficking practices, provide a sufficient basis for a reasonable suspicion of drug activity. The information provided by the Newport officer was just part of the other factors supporting the trooper's reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in drug-related activity. It was therefore permissible for the trooper to extend the stop to investigate this suspicion. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant next claims that the trooper impermissibly extended the bounds of an investigative stop by subjecting him to overly intrusive interrogation within the cruiser, thereby rendering his subsequent consents to search the car tainted and ineffective. When an officer detains a person based on a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, the detention must take no longer than necessary and \"the investigative methods employed should be the least intrusive means reasonably available to verify or dispel the officer's suspicion in a short period of time.\"\n   <em>\n    Florida v.

Defendant appears to argue that both the length and form of the detention were impermissibly intrusive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 39. We disagree that the detention in the cruiser was overly long or intrusive. The cruiser video shows that approximately five minutes elapsed from the time that defendant entered the cruiser to the time that he gave consent to search his vehicle. Defendant sat in the front passenger seat of the cruiser. While the trooper wrote him a warning, defendant and the trooper talked about the engagement rings defendant had seen, his price range, his hope that his girlfriend was \"the one,\" his daughter, his relationship with his daughter's mother, the possibility of traveling to Canada to look for a ring, whether one needs a passport to travel to Canada, defendant's job, and a work-related injury. Four minutes after defendant entered the cruiser, there was the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Trooper: Do you use any drugs at all?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant: Nothing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Trooper: Would you mind rolling up your sleeves for me? Show me your arms? Okay. Not snorting anything?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendant: Nothing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Trooper: Can you tilt your head back for me? Did you go down to Holyoke to pick up any dope?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant: No, I swear on my daughter.

This exchange took about twenty seconds. The trooper then asked if defendant would allow him to search defendant's vehicle, and defendant consented. At this point, defendant had been detained for a total of less than eight minutes. This was not an unreasonable amount of time for the trooper to investigate his reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in drug-related activity. Indeed, the questioning did not measurably prolong the traffic stop for speeding. See\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

We find no such unequivocal act or statement of withdrawal here. Defendant's initial reluctance to have the dog search the car was not a clear revocation of consent.

Even if defendant's statements that he \"[did]n't see the need\" and that \"[he]'d rather just go home\" could\n   be construed as a revocation of consent, he subsequently renewed his consent when the trooper specifically asked him if they could run the dog through the car, and he responded that they could.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 43. For this reason, we also reject defendant's argument that the search by the K-9 officer exceeded the scope of the consent form he signed. There was no doubt at the point that defendant renewed his consent that another officer besides the trooper would be conducting the dog sniff. Defendant made no indication that he did not want another officer to go through his car.

Finally, defendant claims that the trial court erred by denying his renewed motion to suppress prior to trial without permitting him to present additional evidence, namely, that his cell phone was not a prepaid TracFone. Defendant never mentioned any new evidence to the trial court, either at trial or in its post-trial motion for a new trial. We accordingly decline to address this argument on appeal.

Although the officer in this case had reasonable suspicion that defendant was involved in some form of drug-related activity-likely trafficking-there was no specific indication that any evidence would be found in defendant's nose. However, because the evidence challenged in this case did not result from the officer's request, the request does not affect our ultimate conclusion that the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
