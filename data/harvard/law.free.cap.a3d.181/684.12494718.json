CASE HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the motion court's order,\n   <em>\n    State v. Nadeau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7287159\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/1/445/\">\n    2010 ME 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7287159\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/1/445/\">\n    1 A.3d 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the record supports the following facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 3] Between December 2014 and January 2015, officers with the Maine State Police Computer Crimes Unit downloaded files containing child pornography from an IP address associated with a networking device at a residence in Augusta. On January 16, 2015, three officers, wearing plain clothes and driving unmarked vehicles, arrived at the residence. The lead investigator walked up the front steps and knocked on the door of an enclosed porch. Marquis answered the knock and opened the door. The lead investigator identified himself as a State Police officer, verified the address, and stated that he was looking for the homeowner. Marquis stated that he was the homeowner's son, to which the investigator replied, \"Oh, you're his son? Ok, well, maybe you can help me out.\" The investigator then entered the enclosed porch and the entrance door closed. The exchange lasted approximately twenty-five seconds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] After entering the porch, the investigator asked Marquis and Marquis's mother and father, who had joined them, whether the taxi business operating out of the home had experienced any problems on Christmas Day. When they indicated that they were not aware of any problems, the investigator told them that there was \"something else\" with which he would like their help. He stated that the police, while monitoring internet traffic, had observed child pornographic files coming through the network associated with the address and asked if they knew anything about that. Marquis readily responded, \"Yeah, I know what you're talking about.\" Marquis stated that he had received \"a few\" of the files while using a peer-to-peer file sharing network but that he immediately deleted them upon receipt. Marquis added that no one else used the computer besides him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5] The investigator asked whether he could look at Marquis's computer. Marquis replied, \"Yeah.\" The investigator explained that he did not have a search warrant-and that Marquis did not have to consent to a search of his computer-but that he would like to check the accuracy of what Marquis told him by using a \"search tool.\" Marquis responded with \"yeah ok\" and \"I have no problem with that.\" Marquis then directed the lead investigator to the computer, which was located on the enclosed porch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6] While the search of the computer was being performed, Marquis answered all of the investigator's questions and provided biographical and household information. The investigator also spoke with Marquis's wife, who had come onto the porch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 7] After the search was complete, the investigator showed Marquis the results, which he told Marquis revealed \"hits on tons and tons of pictures.\" The investigator told Marquis that, if Marquis gave consent, he would like to \"take it back to the laboratory and do a more thorough search for illegal files.\" The investigator asked Marquis if he could also take the \"SD\" card. Marquis muttered his assent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 8] While speaking with Marquis and his father, the investigator gave Marquis a consent-to-search form and told him that by signing the form he was consenting to a search of the computer and the SD card for illegal contraband, specifically child pornography, and that he did not have to give consent. Marquis signed the form, asking for the date. Before speaking with another adult member of the household, the investigator asked Marquis if he had any questions. Marquis replied, \"Nope, I'm good.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 9] The interview lasted approximately thirty-seven minutes, during which the two officers who had accompanied the lead investigator to the residence entered the\n   porch but remained largely out of Marquis's view. At the end of the interview, the lead investigator and the other officers left the residence. After conferring near their vehicles, however, the officers decided to arrest Marquis because of the presence of young children in the home. The officers returned to the residence and arrested Marquis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 10] In May 2015, Marquis was indicted on three counts of possession of sexually explicit material (Class C), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 284(1)(C). Numerous motions were filed, mostly related to discovery issues, and the dispositional conference was continued several times until it was held in December 2015. Seven months later, Marquis filed a motion to suppress. In his motion, Marquis argued that (1) he had not consented to the officers entering his home, (2) any consent given was not voluntary because the officers used deception to gain entry, (3) he did not consent to the search and seizure of his computer, and (4) the officers had subjected him to custodial interrogation without providing\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 11] In October 2016, the court held a hearing on the motion. The court heard testimony from the lead investigator, the other two officers, and Marquis, and admitted several exhibits, including an audio recording of the interview, photographs of the porch, and the consent-to-search form signed by Marquis. Because the court could not determine from the record when the police entered the home, the parties filed a written stipulation agreeing that the police entered the home between 2:05 and 2:30 minutes into the audio recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 12] In January 2017, the court denied the motion to suppress. The court found that the lead investigator did not expressly ask whether he could enter, but that Marquis \"assisted and cooperated with [the investigator] through his conduct when he freely let [the investigator] enter his residence after identifying himself as a law enforcement officer.\" The court further found that the investigator's statements about the taxi business were fleeting, occurred after he entered the residence, and did not affect Marquis's decision to consent to the search and seizure of his computer. Based on its finding, the court determined that Marquis consented to the officers' entry into his residence and consented to the search and seizure of his computer several times, both orally and in writing. The court further found that Marquis was not in custody for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   when the police interviewed him at his home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 13] The court (\n   <em>\n    Stewart, J.\n   </em>\n   ) held a jury trial on March 22-23, 2017. The jury found Marquis guilty of all three counts. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment with all but six months suspended and two years' probation. Marquis timely filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 14] Marquis argues that the court erred in finding that he consented to the officers' entry into his home, which resulted in the search and seizure of his computer, when he merely acquiesced to the officers' entry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 15] When reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we review the court's factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Responding to a knock on the door, Marquis voluntarily opened the door and engaged in a conversation with the lead investigator. Marquis answered the investigator's questions without hesitation and the conversation had a friendly tone. After talking for about half of a minute-while the door was being held open in the winter in Maine-the investigator suggested that Marquis may be able to assist him with an issue that he had not yet identified. The conversation continued without interruption into the porch, and the door closed behind them. After the officers entered the porch, Marquis was cooperative. He did not ask the officers to leave or indicate that the officers' presence was unwelcome.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Seamen's Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11919429\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/691/1248/\">\n    1997 ME 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11919429\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/691/1248/\">\n    691 A.2d 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 19] Although there was no testimony that Marquis made a specific gesture-such as waving the officers in or stepping aside to let them pass-and it is not possible to determine from the audio recording whether such a gesture occurred, based on the totality of the circumstances, there is sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that Marquis consented to the officers' entry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cress\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7391331\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/576/1366/#p1367\">\n    576 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1367 ;\n   <em>\n    McLain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=367%20A.2d%20213\">\n    367 A.2d at 216-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Marquis also challenges (1) the court's determination that it was \"not possible to make a finding in regard to how many officers were present on the steps at the moment entry was made,\" (2) the court's conclusion that he voluntarily consented to the officers' entry into his home when they did not state the purpose of their visit until after they entered, and (3) the court's conclusion that he was not in custody when the police interrogated him.
