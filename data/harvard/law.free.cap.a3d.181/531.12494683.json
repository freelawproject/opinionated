Turning to the merits, the plaintiff also claims that the trial court's finding with respect to the width of Brockway Ferry Road was clearly erroneous. We disagree with the plaintiff's claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. Brockway Ferry Road is a highway\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   located\n   near the shore of the Connecticut River in the town. It extends in a southwest direction from Joshuatown Road toward its terminus near the shore of the Connecticut River, where it historically had provided access to a ferry that had operated from 1725 until 1884. The highway's western end is not improved and is partially encumbered by vegetation and other obstacles. Portions of that area run below the high water mark and are intermittently submerged. \"The plaintiff owns real property, improved with a single family residence, on [the highway]. In 2006, several other proprietors of real property abutting [the highway] filed a petition, pursuant to ... \u00a7 13a-39, requesting that the board define the boundaries of [the highway], particularly at its western end, in the area of the plaintiff's property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The board considered documentary and testimonial evidence and held hearings related to the petition. In October, 2006, the board published notice of its memorandum of decision in which it made a determination of the boundary and terminus of [the highway] at its western end as it runs along and into the Connecticut River. Essentially, the board concluded that [the highway] extended through and across the plaintiff's property, past the then existing western terminus of the highway.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Footnote\n   added; internal\n   quotation marks omitted.)

The plaintiff asserted that the board's decision introduced a public highway through and across her property, lessened the value of her property and negatively affected her use and enjoyment of her property. The plaintiff raised several claims related to the board's jurisdiction. Additionally, the plaintiff claimed that the board had acted illegally, arbitrarily and in abuse of its discretion. The gist of the complaint was that, rather than defining the width of an existing public highway, the board extended the length of [the] highway at its western terminus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"In June, 2007, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment. The defendants opposed the motion arguing, in part, that the plaintiff was not entitled to move for summary judgment in an administrative appeal. In its May 20, 2008 memorandum of decision, [the court,\n   <em>\n    Abrams, J.\n   </em>\n   ] granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The court concluded that it was entitled to consider the appeal in a trial de novo and, therefore, that the motion for summary judgment procedurally was appropriate. Thereafter, the court concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment, as a matter of law, because the board exceeded the scope of its statutory authority by determining the length of [the highway] rather than its width.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Joseph Q. Koletsky\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   conducted\n   a three day court trial. At that trial, the court received numerous exhibits, including a variety of surveys and historical maps, and heard expert testimony from two surveyors, Richard Strouse and Gerald Stefon, whom the board had retained in connection with the proceedings under \u00a7 13a-39 to conduct historical research and survey the lines and bounds of the westerly end of the highway. The court also heard testimony from several adjoining proprietors; see footnote 3 of this opinion; including Robert H. Sutton, Eleanor B. Sutton, Leslie V. Shaffer, Richard W. Sutton, and Curtis D. Deane, about the public's use of the westerly end of the highway for access to the river for recreational purposes such as dog walking, swimming, and boat launching. Parker Lord, the previous owner of the plaintiff's property,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified about his understanding of the highway's boundaries vis-\u00e0-vis the plaintiff's property, along with the public's use of the highway for river access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the close of the evidence, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the trial de novo proceeding on the ground that the case had effectively been prosecuted by the board and the town-which \u00a7 13a-39 required to act as adjudicators rather than advocates-rather than by one of the adjoining proprietors, who would be the real party in interest under \u00a7\u00a7 13a-39 and 13a-40. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that it had subject matter jurisdiction based on remand from this court and the fact that the parties had previously agreed that the defendants would assume the burden of proof at the trial de novo. The trial court further emphasized that, in deciding this case, it did not have jurisdiction to\n   determine the legal status of the highway, such as whether it had been abandoned through nonuse or otherwise discontinued, and that its sole charge was to determine the bounds of the highway. After hearing argument about that evidence, the court rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiff's administrative appeal and \"confirming\" the board's finding with respect to the \"lost or uncertain bounds\" of the highway's western end. See appendix to and footnote 7 of this opinion. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff (1) raises a plethora of challenges to the subject matter jurisdiction of the board and the trial court, and (2) contends that the trial court's determination of the highway's width was clearly erroneous.

In the complaint initiating her appeal pursuant to \u00a7 13a-40, the plaintiff claimed, inter alia, that the board lacked jurisdiction under \u00a7 13a-39 to do the following: (1) \"define the ... lines for [the highway] through and across [her] property due to the fact that [the highway] does not extend through and across [her] property and no portion of [her] property is a highway as defined in ... the General Statutes\"; and (2) \"make a decision defining the bounds for [the highway] through and across [her] property due to the fact that, in the public hearing held before [the board], the plaintiff ... placed in issue (i) whether [the highway] ever extended through and across [her] property and (ii) in the event that [the highway] ever did extend through and across [her] property, whether ... it had been abandoned by a long period of [nonuse].\" The plaintiff also claimed that \"[t]he resolution of ... the status of [the area in dispute] as a municipal highway is a condition precedent to a definition of highway lines pursuant to [\u00a7] 13a-39, and is beyond the jurisdiction of the [board].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In arguments before the trial court concerning the legal status of the highway, counsel for the plaintiff stated that he had \"a difficult time finding the line between abandonment and its present status because if it's abandoned then it has no status.\" In response, counsel for the defendants contended that, \"if the road had been abandoned, the [board] couldn't have set the boundaries\" but nevertheless disagreed with the trial court's suggestion that setting the boundaries required, \"ipso facto,\" a \"finding that the road has not been abandoned.\" Instead, counsel for the defendants emphasized that the issue of abandonment was not before the court in the proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 13a-40, stated that a decision to set the boundaries would not constitute a finding that the highway had not been abandoned, and agreed that the issue of abandonment could be litigated in the future, claiming that the present case \"is not an abandonment case. Abandonment is [addressed by a] declaratory judgment or quiet title [claim].\" Subsequently, the trial court ruled on the merits of the present case and confirmed the finding of the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Whether a determination of a roadway's legal status is a condition precedent to a boundaries definition proceeding under \u00a7 13a-39\"presents a question of statutory construction over which we exercise plenary review....

In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable\n   results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.... When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter ....

First, we conclude that the petition by the adjoining proprietors complied with \u00a7 13a-39 for purposes of properly invoking the board's jurisdiction. As the defendants\n   point out, \u00a7 13a-39 does not prescribe any particular form or content for the petition, other than to require that it be in writing. See footnote 4 of this opinion. We conclude that the petition in the present case adequately invokes the jurisdiction of the board by \"formally request[ing] that [it] take the steps necessary to define the bounds of [the highway] and such other steps deemed necessary to remove any and all uncertainties regarding the road's location as required by [\u00a7] 13a-39,\" and \"further requesting that detailed attention be given to the western end of our\n   road as this is the portion of the highway that has been the subject of much dispute for the past several years.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, with respect to the plaintiff's attack on the board's use of the 2002 map, which Strouse prepared prior to the filing of the \u00a7 13a-39 petition, the record reveals that, in 2001, the board ordered a map and survey from Strouse, a surveyor and engineer with more than forty years of experience, in response to complaints from the adjoining proprietors with respect to their dispute with the plaintiff. See footnote 6 of this opinion. Utilizing the 2002 map to explain his survey, Strouse then testified at the 2006 hearing before the board after the filing of the petition. Subsequently, Strouse prepared the 2006 map, which depicts the changes to the 2002 map required by the board's decision. See appendix to and footnote 7 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In present case, there is no claim that the board's use of the 2002 map, which was prepared by Strouse prior to the petition and hearing, prejudiced the plaintiff, insofar as, at the hearing, she had the opportunity to participate and was aware of the claims made by the adjoining proprietors and the lines as proposed by the board.

See appendix to and footnote 3 of this opinion. The plaintiff emphasizes that, without those signatures, the petition was defective because the map used by the board did not show \"the fences and bounds as actually existing, and the bounds as claimed by adjoining proprietors.\" General Statutes \u00a7 13a-39. The plaintiff then contends that this lack of participation in the petition process resulted in an unconstitutional taking of her property. In response, the defendants rely on Judge Lavine's concurring and dissenting opinion in\n   <em>\n    Marchesi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Selectmen\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4263449\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/131/24/#p26\">\n    131 Conn.

We agree with the defendants and conclude that the fact that the plaintiff and Behrendt did not sign the underlying \u00a7 13a-39 petition did not deprive the board of jurisdiction.\n   In considering whether a jurisdictionally valid petition under \u00a7 13a-39 requires the signatures of every adjoining proprietor, we begin our analysis with the statutory language. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z. An examination of the plain language of \u00a7 13a-39, as set forth in full in footnote 4 of this opinion, is fatal to the plaintiff's claim. Section 13a-39 permits \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the proprietors of land adjoining such highway\" to file the \"written application\" to the board. The statute does not require that all adjoining proprietors be signatories to the petition, but simply requires that the board, in addition to providing printed notice \"in a daily paper having a general circulation in the town in which such highway is located ...\n   <em>\n    shall send a written or printed notice to each known adjoining proprietor on such highway\n   </em>\n   , setting forth the name or location of the highway, a\n   description of the portions to be reestablished, the place and time where such map may be seen, and the time, not less than two weeks from the date of the issue of such notice, when and place\n   <em>\n    where all parties interested\n   </em>\n   may be heard under oath in regard to such reestablishment.\" (Emphasis added.) Section 13a-39 also requires that the board publish notice of its decision and send that notice \"to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   known adjoining proprietors.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   It is well settled that \" '[t]he word \"any\" has a diversity of meanings and may be employed to indicate \"all\" or \"every\" as well as \"some\" or \"one.\" ...

Requiring every adjoining proprietor to sign the petition could well frustrate the purpose of \u00a7 13a-39, as any one proprietor could deprive the board of jurisdiction by refusing to sign the petition, thus letting a land use dispute fester indefinitely. Judge Lavine comprehensively explains the impermissible absurdity of the interpretation of \u00a7 13a-39 suggested by the plaintiff: \" 'The obvious purpose of [ \u00a7 13a-39 ] was to afford proprietors the opportunity to see, from an inspection of the map, the relation the bounds claimed by the adjoining proprietors bore to the actual fences and bounds and the lines of the highway as\n   originally laid out.'\n   <em>\n    Hartford Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    West Hartford\n   </em>\n   , [supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498211\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/84/646/\">\n    84 Conn. at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20A.%20244\">\n    81 A. 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"This point addresses the allegation in the plaintiff's complaint that she did not petition the [board] to determine the bounds of [the highway] adjoining her property. In their petition to the [board], the defendant proprietors of adjoining land claimed that the boundaries of the western terminus of [the highway] had become lost or uncertain. If a highway is public, it is to be available to the public. No property owner should be permitted to ban the public, including neighbors, from traversing a public highway that crosses his or her land because he or she has not asked that the lost or uncertain boundaries be determined pursuant to \u00a7 13a-39.\" (Footnotes omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Marchesi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Selectmen\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4263449\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/131/24/#p26\">\n    131 Conn.

Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the defendants, who had assumed the burden of proof before the trial court, failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the width of the westerly end of the highway, which is depicted on the 2006 map as varying between twenty-one and twenty-seven feet wide. See appendix to and footnote 7 of this opinion. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that the evidence at trial, which included expert testimony by the two surveyors, Strouse and Stefon, along with testimony from several adjoining proprietors and Parker Lord, the former owner of the plaintiff's property, confirmed that there was no physical or historical evidence of the highway's width, rendering any finding as to width pure conjecture. In response, the defendants point to other documentary evidence, including an eighteenth century public record from the Colony of Connecticut, along with surveys, maps, town meeting minutes, photographs, and testimony from Lord and certain adjoining proprietors about recreational use of the highway's western end. The defendants also contend that the trial court reasonably could have credited the testimony of Stefon, a historian of Connecticut's roads, in finding that the highway had a width that varied between twenty-one and twenty-seven feet. We agree with the defendants and, accordingly, conclude that the trial court's finding as to the width of the highway was not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As the parties agree, the trial court's determination of the roadway's boundaries in a de novo appeal under \u00a7 13a-40 constitutes a finding of fact. Accordingly, \"our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Stratford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jacobelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20863\">\n    317 Conn. 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 869,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%20500\">\n    120 A.3d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). \"Under this deferential standard, [w]e do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached.

Specifically, at the request of the board and Ralph Eno, the town's first selectman at that time, Strouse created the\n   2002 map. After the board's hearing pursuant to \u00a7 13a-39, Strouse created the 2006 map illustrating the board's findings. See appendix to and footnote 7 of this opinion. On the 2002 map, Strouse stated that there was \"no known width\" for the highway, and \"depicted [it] as [one] rod (16.5 [feet] ) wide,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   with a label reading \"approximate location of ancient highway right-of-way from Joshuatown Road to Brockway's ferry.\" Strouse testified at trial that the 2002 map did not show a width for the road and that a width of one rod was chosen \"so we could identify [the area on the map] and [it] would stand out.... There's [was] nothing that would indicate the width of the road on any of the research or any of the maps we had.\" Strouse testified that his observations of the area did not lead him to a conclusion with respect to the roadway's width. Strouse also testified that the width as ultimately found by the board and depicted on the 2006 map was approximately five or six feet wider than that shown on the 2002 map.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Stefon testified that, in addition to being a licensed surveyor, he is a historian of road creation and location in Connecticut.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2005, William Koch, who had since become the town's first selectman, retained Stefon's firm to provide a research report\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the board regarding the western end of the highway. In doing his research, Stefon had the opportunity to examine the 2002 map, as well as other historical maps and materials that Strouse had considered, along with the history of\n   Brockway's ferry itself dating back to the eighteenth century. Stefon testified that, although he believed Strouse's map was \"accurate,\" he nevertheless \"question[ed] the width [Strouse] had ascribed to it and felt there was a chance that the road was wider than ... Strouse was showing.\" Although Stefon stated during cross-examination that there was no physical evidence of a roadbed \"carved out for purposes of either vehicular or pedestrian traffic,\" he explained he had \"grave reservation that [the highway] was only one rod wide [because] I have never encountered a public right-of-way that was only one rod wide so I doubted that width would be accurate.\" Stefon opined that, on the basis of his experience, the highway would \"not be less\n   than [one] and [one-half rods] but more likely ... two rods\" in width. Stefon explained that his \"experience is that public roads were never created at one rod wide, whether it's [the highway] or any other road. Most counties were creating two rod roads; could have been wider, but at [the] very least what I have found is a road which would be [one] and [one-half rods] wide.\" Stefon acknowledged that there was no documentary or \"physical evidence in the field ... that would allow us to define ... the width\" of the highway's disputed portion, and stated that the basis of his testimony to the board that the road was two rods wide was because that was the \"most common\" width.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the fact that the trial court's task in the present case was to determine boundaries that were, by definition, \"lost or uncertain\"; General Statutes \u00a7 13a-39 ; we conclude that its decision to confirm the board's finding that the highway varied between twenty-one and twenty-seven feet in width was supported by Stefon's expert testimony as to the most common widths of roadways, and hewed closely to Stefon's observed typical minimum size of one and one-half rods, or approximately twenty-five feet. See footnote 22 of this opinion. Particularly in the absence of any direct historical or physical evidence to the contrary, a holding deeming the trial court's conclusion-otherwise squarely supported by expert testimony presented to it as the sole arbiter of evidence-improperly speculative would tie the hands of future fact finders in cases in which the boundaries of a highway are irretrievably lost. Such a holding would undermine the purpose of \u00a7 13a-39 entirely.

Likewise, counsel for the plaintiff acknowledged the difficulty of finding the length and width of the road given the alterations to the river's shore by erosion since the end of ferry service in 1884, and argued during summation that the court \"doesn't sit as some sort of historical tribunal. Its finding has to relate to the present. You're not being asked to determine something as it existed in 1784 or 1922. You're [being] asked to determine the bounds of a highway as of this day.\" Although the plaintiff's argument focused on the decades of nonuse of the highway, and its current lack of use, counsel for the plaintiff also asked, \"how do you find based on the evidence how wide this thing is? How do you find based on the monuments in the field which are critical to where that roadway is? How do we find that roadway?\" The court posited that the width, like that of an easement, could be \"determined by historical uses.\" The plaintiff argued that, with respect to widths, \"[a]t some point it becomes speculation, at some point, the court is required to speculate\" given the lack of \"complete monumentation,\" although she acknowledged that there was \"ample evidence\" as to length.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
