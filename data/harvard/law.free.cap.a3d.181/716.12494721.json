Turner (\"Judge Turner\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   decertified. Appellant alleged that Judge Turner had never practiced law in Maryland, and was, therefore, constitutionally\n   unqualified for judicial office. Appellant named as defendants the Maryland State Board of Elections, State Administrator of Elections Linda Lamone, Governor Lawrence J. Hogan, Jr., and Judge Turner (together, \"Appellees\"). In the petition, Appellant sought a writ of mandamus ordering the Governor to rescind\n   the commission that he had issued\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to Judge Turner, and an order decertifying both Judge Turner's candidacy and the election results. On May 22, 2017, Appellant filed an amended petition, raising the same allegations and seeking the same relief. Before any response from Appellees, Appellant filed a motion for summary judgment and a memorandum of law, contending that she was entitled to the position of judge of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thereafter, Appellees filed a motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing, in relevant part, that the election claims were untimely under EL \u00a7 12-202(b) and barred by the doctrine of laches. On September 8, 2017, the circuit court conducted a hearing, and granted the motion to dismiss. The circuit court ruled, in pertinent part, that the petition was untimely filed under EL \u00a7 12-202(b), and that the doctrine of laches barred the election claims. On the same day, Appellant filed a notice of appeal to this Court pursuant to EL \u00a7 12-203.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 12, 2017, consistent with its oral ruling, the circuit court issued an order granting the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In this direct appeal, we consider whether the circuit court properly granted the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the petition was untimely filed under EL \u00a7 12-202(b) and\n   barred by the doctrine of laches. We hold that the circuit court was correct on both counts. The petition was untimely filed under EL \u00a7 12-202(b) because Appellant did not file the petition in the circuit court until May 9, 2017, more than six months after the 2016 general election, and more than one year after Appellant admittedly became aware of the facts that served as the basis for the election claims and at least several months after the election results were certified. And, we determine that there is no basis on which to toll the statute of limitations. Additionally, independent of the statutory limitations period set forth in EL \u00a7 12-202(b), the petition is barred by the doctrine of laches because, in filing the petition in the circuit court more than six months after the 2016 general election, Appellant unreasonably delayed in asserting her rights, and that delay prejudiced Appellees. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court. Because we hold that the circuit court correctly granted the motion to dismiss, we need not address the three other questions presented\n   on brief by Appellant that concern the merits of the election claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    2016 General Election and Judicial Disabilities Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2016, Appellant was a candidate for judge of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County in the primary and general elections. In the general election, the candidates included three incumbent judges of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as two lawyers, Appellant and Judge Turner. On November 8, 2016, in the general election, Judge Turner and the three incumbent judges received sufficient votes to win the election; Appellant finished last. After the election results were certified, Governor Hogan issued commissions to the successful candidates, including Judge Turner, who subsequently took the oath that is prescribed by the Constitution of Maryland, and assumed the office of judge of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Now, we briefly describe events that occurred before the 2016 general election. On April 14, 2016, before both the 2016 primary election on April 26, 2016, and the general election, Appellant filed with the Commission on Judicial Disabilities (\"the Commission\") a complaint against Judge Turner, alleging that Judge Turner had committed various\n   ethical violations during the election campaign by engaging in prohibited political activities, including endorsing numerous politicians.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the ethics complaint, Appellant alleged that Judge Turner had made a quid pro quo agreement with Maryland Delegate Joseline Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk that Judge Turner would drop out of a congressional race in which Judge Turner had initially been a candidate, run for judge of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County, and endorse Delegate Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk for the congressional seat; and, in turn, Delegate Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk would endorse Judge Turner for the judgeship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the ethics complaint was pending before the Commission, on April 21, 2016, a few days before the 2016 primary election, The Washington Post published an article, which included, in relevant part, the following information about Judge Turner:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The other challenger is veteran politician [ ] Turner, who dropped out of a crowded congressional race to compete for a judgeship, hoping to capitalize on her experience as a military lawyer and former member of the [Prince George's C]ounty [C]ouncil.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Turner, a former Prince George's County Council member, wants to reform the judicial system. \"We need an eye toward rehabilitation and becoming more of a problem-solving court,\" she said.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Turner, 52, was running for Congress when she learned about the court opening.

Specifically, in a letter dated April 26, 2017, the Commission stated that the ethics complaint against Judge Turner had been \"reviewed and discussed by the Judicial Inquiry Board\" and the Commission, and,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   after the full and complete review of the materials and discussion by the Board and Commission, the Commission\n   concluded that the evidence failed to show that Judge Turner committed sanctionable conduct, as defined [by] Maryland Rule 18-401( [j] ). As a result, the Commission dismissed the complaint, as required by Maryland Rule 18-406(a)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Proceedings in the Circuit Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On May 9, 2017, almost two weeks after the date of the Commission's letter, and more than six months after the 2016 general election, Appellant filed in the circuit court a \"Petition for Writ of Mandamus and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" against Appellees, contending that Judge Turner was constitutionally unqualified for office because she allegedly had never practiced law in Maryland. Appellant requested that the circuit court issue a writ of mandamus ordering Governor Hogan to rescind Judge Turner's commission, as well as an order decertifying both Judge Turner's candidacy and the\n   election results. In the petition, Appellant alleged that Judge Turner, as a military lawyer, had not practiced law in Maryland, and, accordingly, was not qualified to be a Maryland judge. In the petition, Appellant also contended that there was no prejudice or unreasonable delay in the timing of the filing of the petition. On May 22, 2017, Appellant filed an amended petition, raising the same allegations and seeking the same relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Before any response by Appellees to the petition or the amended petition, on July 9, 2017, Appellant filed a motion for summary judgment and a memorandum of law. In the memorandum, Appellant contended that Judge Turner was constitutionally unqualified to be a judge in Maryland because she allegedly had not practiced law in Maryland, and argued that she (Appellant) was entitled to the commission for judgeship in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County. Appellant asserted that the statute of limitations, EL \u00a7 12-202(b), was inapplicable, or, in the alternative, must be tolled. Appellant maintained that Judge Turner had committed fraud upon Maryland taxpayers to secure her salary as a judge, and that such fraud warranted tolling the statute of limitations. According\n   to Appellant, she \"was entirely justified in pursuing and awaiting disposition of her claims with [the Commission] because [Judge] Turner's lack of qualifications and prohibited political activity during the 2016 election cycle [were] so prejudicial to the administration of justice that it could have resulted in [Judge Turner's] removal.\" In the memorandum, Appellant contended that the doctrine of laches did not apply because there was neither prejudice nor inexcusable delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In an \"Affidavit in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment,\" Appellant averred, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [ ] I had no knowledge of [Judge] Turner's legal practice history until [T]he Washington Post['s] article[ ] dated April 21, 2016 had been published[,] and [the Commission] was invest[igat]ing [Judge] Turner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [ ] On April 29, 2017, I received notice from the [Commission] that my complaint against [Judge] Turner went through the full process[,] but the [Commission] decided not to take action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [ ] After receiving notice of disposition from [the Commission], I immediately verified [Judge] Turner's online official Maryland biographies and commenced this suit[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Record citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On July 21, 2017, Appellees filed a \"Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and Opposition to [Appellant]'s Motion for Summary Judgment,\" contending that the election claims were barred in their \"entirety by limitations and [the doctrine of] laches,\" and, that the claims, \"as a matter of law,\" lacked merit. Appellees requested that the circuit court dismiss the amended petition, or, in the alternative, issue a declaratory judgment in their favor. In the motion to dismiss, in relevant part, Appellees argued that Appellant's claims, in which she challenged Judge Turner's qualifications as a candidate for judge of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County, were election claims that were not filed within the statutory limitations period that was prescribed by EL \u00a7 12-202(b), and, as such, were barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Appellees pointed out that Appellant waited to bring the election claims until more than a year after the 2016 primary election, and more than six months after the 2016 general election, which, \"on its face,\" demonstrated that the claims were untimely under EL \u00a7 12-202(b). Appellees also asserted that, in the affidavit in support of the motion for summary judgment,\n   Appellant acknowledged seeing The Washington Post's article in April 2016, and, accordingly, Appellant \"admittedly had knowledge of the alleged deficiency in qualifications by April 2016[.]\" Appellees contended that filing the ethics complaint with the Commission concerning a judicial candidate's campaign conduct did not toll EL \u00a7 12-202(b) with respect to an election claim concerning a judicial candidate's qualifications. Appellees asserted that Appellant failed to demonstrate any ground on which to toll the statute of limitations because Appellant had not alleged \"that she was somehow tricked or deceived into missing the deadline[, or] that the failure to meet the deadline was beyond her control.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Appellees also contended that the election claims were barred by the doctrine of laches, and that claims challenging the qualifications of a judicial candidate must be promptly brought so that such claims can be resolved prior to an election. Appellees argued that the delay in bringing the election claims-more than six months after the general election-was inexcusable, and that the delay prejudiced Judge Turner, the State Board of Elections, the voters of Prince George's County, and the circuit court. Appellees asserted that, if Appellant were successful in bringing the election claims, and Judge Turner were disqualified and removed, voters who had voted for Judge Turner would be prejudiced by having their votes invalidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On July 23, 2017, Appellant filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, requesting that the circuit court grant summary judgment in her favor, declare the commission that Governor Hogan issued to Judge Turner to be void, and order Governor Hogan to issue the commission for judgeship in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County to Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On September 8, 2017, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the motion for summary judgment and the motion to dismiss. During the hearing, as to The Washington Post's article, Appellant argued as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   I reported to [the] Commission[,] and[,] as soon as I reported my complaint[, it] started investigating. But it was maybe a few days before the primary [election] that [The] Washington Post['s] article came out[,] outlining everyone's qualifications and criticizing [Judge] Turner for her motives [in] switching from the congressional race to the judge race[,] and also criticizing her qualifications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   She has never practiced law. That is actually when I found out that she has never practiced law. And [I] actually started researching her bio[graphie]s on[ ]line, asking some people. No, she has never practiced law in this State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   But[,] at that time[,] I already had the ethics complaint pending.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   When asked by the circuit court why she did not file a complaint in the circuit court concerning Judge Turner's alleged lack of qualifications, in addition to the ethics complaint filed with the Commission, Appellant responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Well, I thought [that] it was best for the [ ] Commission to handle it. I mean, you know, as I said[,] it was [Judge Turner's] lack of qualifications on top of the rules that she had breached, I thought bolster[ed] the ethics complaint. It made it more appropriate for the [ ] Commission to investigate and to take action than myself. It made more sense to me to wait for [the Commission] to do what the[ ] Constitution specially created [it] to do. So, I thought [that] it made sense to allow the [ ] Commission to act first.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Appellant acknowledged that she \"could have\" pursued both actions simultaneously, but maintained that, \"[i]f [she had] filed an ethics complaint against [Judge Turner,] and [Judge Turner] could have been disqualified\n   at any point in time by the [ ] Commission, [Judge Turner] was on notice that that could have happened.\"\n   After hearing argument from the parties on the motion to dismiss, the circuit court orally granted the motion to dismiss, explaining that the petition was untimely filed under EL \u00a7 12-202(b) and that the doctrine of laches barred the election claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   And[,] in this case[,] I can't get around the fact that[,] while you filed the ethics complaint ... with [the Commission,] the Election Law Article clearly provided that you had to file within 10 days after the act or omission[,] or within seven days after the election results were certified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   And[,] even in the light most favorable to [Appellant], in the complaint, [she stated that she] didn't do it until six months later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The question becomes [whether] equitable tolling [would] apply. And I have not seen a case or a statute [that] would allow the [c]ourt to reach the equitable tolling argument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   There is nothing to indicate in the pleadings that [Appellant was] misled. There is nothing to indicate that there was [an] inability to file.

It[ is] highly unethical for the Attorney General to spend tax[ ]pay[e]r dollars to assist one candidate over the other to win a judicial election.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   (Citation omitted). Thus, according to Appellant, the Attorney General should be disqualified from representing Judge Turner, and Judge Turner should be held in default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On November 28, 2017, Appellees filed an opposition to the motion to disqualify, contending that the motion to disqualify should be denied for three reasons. First, Appellees correctly point out that Appellant failed to raise any issue concerning disqualification of the Attorney General until on appeal in this Court, and Appellees argue that, accordingly, the motion is untimely, and any issue of disqualification has been waived. Second, Appellees assert that, even if this Court were to consider the merits, the motion to disqualify fails to identify\n   any violation or potential violation of the Maryland Attorneys' Rules of Professional Conduct by the Office of the Attorney General or its attorneys. Appellees maintain that the Attorney General's representation of Judge Turner is appropriate because Judge Turner is a duly elected and sworn State official, and, when the Office of the Attorney General began representing Judge Turner, neither Appellant nor Judge Turner was a candidate for judicial office, as the election was over, and the results certified. Finally, Appellees contend that the concept of \"default\" has no application here, that granting the motion to disqualify would merely permit Judge Turner to obtain other counsel, and that the Attorney General would continue representing the State officers and State Board of Elections.\n   On November 29, 2017, Appellant filed a reply to the opposition to the motion to disqualify, contending that: (1) the Attorney General has engaged in an \"unethical pursuit\" favoring Judge Turner over Appellant for the position of judge of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County; (2) there is a conflict of interest that cannot be waived; and (3) Judge Turner may be held in default on appeal, and, if held in default, Judge Turner is not entitled to additional time to seek new counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On the same day, November 29, 2017, this Court issued an order deferring action on the motion to disqualify pending oral argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   We now address the motion to disqualify, and deny the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   It is undisputed that, until the filing of the motion to disqualify in this Court, Appellant had not raised, either in the circuit court or this Court, any issue as to disqualification of the Office of the Attorney General in representing Judge Turner. This circumstance raises an issue of waiver. In\n   <em>\n    Balt. Cty. v.

Timely service of a motion to disqualify helps to curb the potential use of the motion as a litigation tactic or to harass the opposing party. Courts analyze a number of factors when considering whether the motion was timely made, including:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   when the movant learned of the conflict; whether the movant was represented by counsel during the delay; why the delay occurred, and, in particular, whether the motion was delayed for tactical reasons; and whether disqualification would result in prejudice to the nonmoving party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   (Cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Although this case arises in a different context, the factors that were discussed by the Court of Special Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Barnhart\n   </em>\n   with respect to waiver of the ability to request disqualification of an attorney apply with equal force here. Applying those factors, we conclude that Appellant has waived any right to move for disqualification of the Attorney General. As to the first factor-when Appellant learned of the alleged conflict-on June 26, 2017, after Appellees were served with Appellant's petition, an Assistant Attorney General filed in the circuit court a consent motion to extend the time for Appellees to file a response to the petition. In the consent motion, the Assistant Attorney General stated that service on Judge Turner was ineffective because it was not made by serving the Attorney General. It would have been readily apparent from the consent motion that the Attorney General was representing Judge Turner. Yet, Appellant never filed in the circuit court a motion to disqualify. Indeed, it was not until November 27, 2017, over five months after being made aware that the Attorney General\n   was\n   representing Judge Turner, that Appellant filed in this Court the motion to disqualify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As to the second factor-whether Appellant was represented by counsel during the delay-although Appellant represents herself, Appellant is an attorney who, according to the amended petition, has been both licensed to practice law in Maryland, and has owned and operated a solo practice, for approximately nine years at the time of the filing. As to the third factor-why the delay occurred, and whether the motion to disqualify was delayed for tactical reasons-Appellant fails to provide any explanation in either the motion to disqualify or the reply as to why she waited over five months to file a motion to disqualify, or why she did not move to disqualify the Attorney General in the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, as to the fourth factor-whether disqualification would prejudice Judge Turner, the nonmoving party-obviously, had the Attorney General been disqualified from representing Judge Turner before the completion of briefing and oral argument in this Court, Judge Turner would have been prejudiced, as Judge Turner would have needed to either seek new counsel or represent herself. Plainly, consideration of the above factors leads to the conclusion that, through Appellant's inaction, despite knowing of the Attorney General's representation of Judge Turner as early as June 2017, Appellant has waived the right to request the Attorney General's disqualification. The motion to disqualify is denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Having denied the motion to disqualify, we now address the dismissal of Appellant's petition on the grounds that the petition was untimely filed under EL \u00a7 12-202(b) and barred by the doctrine of the laches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    The Parties' Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Appellant contends that neither EL \u00a7 12-202(b)'s statutory limitations period nor the doctrine of laches applies in this case. Appellant argues that Art. IV, \u00a7 5 of the Constitution of Maryland requires that \"Judge Turner's qualifications be verified[,]\" and that applying EL \u00a7 12-202(b)'s statutory limitations period would conflict with that constitutional requirement. (Bolding omitted). Alternatively, Appellant asserts that Judge Turner's alleged \"inequitable conduct\" justifies tolling EL \u00a7 12-202(b)'s statutory limitations period. (Bolding omitted). Specifically, Appellant maintains that, in becoming a judge, Judge Turner committed fraud and constructive fraud on the taxpayers. As to this point, Appellant contends, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   [Judge] Turner did not care whether she was qualified, which is shown when she\n   bragged to [T]he [Washington] Post about her ability to beat the odds in her life[ ]time. [Judge] Turner also did not proffer an affidavit to the [circuit] court demonstrating her due diligence to assess her qualifications. Thus[, Judge] Turner's unclean hands created the wrong in which Appellant seeks relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   (Citations omitted). Appellant argues that she \"was entirely justified in\" filing and awaiting resolution of the ethics complaint by the Commission \"because [Judge] Turner's lack of qualifications and prohibited political activity during the 2016 election cycle [were] so prejudicial to the administration of\n   justice that [they] could have resulted in her removal.\" Appellant asserts that the filing of the complaint with the Commission provided notice to Judge Turner of Appellant's claims to disqualify her candidacy; Appellant maintains that this filing satisfied the purpose of the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Appellant contends that the doctrine of laches does not apply because there was no inexcusable delay or prejudice. Appellant asserts that she \"has been diligent in pursuing her claims with the [Commission] and\" in the circuit court. According to Appellant, there is no prejudice to Judge Turner because she has known since the filing of the ethics complaint that Appellant is challenging \"the legitimacy and integrity of her candidacy[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Appellees respond that a registered voter must seek judicial relief in the circuit court within the timeframe that is specified by EL \u00a7 12-202(b), which ensures that an election claim is processed expeditiously and without unreasonable delay. Appellees contend that, here, Appellant waited six months after the election before filing the petition, despite having become aware of the facts that served as the basis for the election claims in April 2016, when The Washington Post's article was published. According to Appellees, under the circumstances, the circuit court correctly ruled that Appellant failed to file the election claims within EL \u00a7 12-202(b)'s statutory limitations period. Appellees argue that Appellant confuses eligibility for judicial office-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , having the requisite qualifications such as residency, age, and bar membership-with the process of qualifying for judicial office, which includes receiving a commission, taking an oath, and posting any applicable bond. Appellees argue that the use of the term \"qualification\" in Art. IV, \u00a7 5 of the Constitution of Maryland refers to the process of qualifying for judicial office, not an individual's eligibility for judicial office, and thus does not provide a basis on which to challenge a candidate's eligibility more than six months after an election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Appellees assert that the filing of the ethics complaint with the Commission concerning Judge Turner's campaign conduct\n   did not toll EL \u00a7 12-202(b)'s statutory limitations period for an election claim concerning Judge Turner's eligibility. Appellees maintain that equitable tolling applies only where a plaintiff has been tricked or induced by a defendant's conduct into not filing a claim within the limitations period-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , there must be some wrongful conduct by the defendant. Appellees contend that, in this case, the circuit court properly concluded that equitable tolling did not apply because Appellant was neither tricked nor induced into delaying in filing the election claims. Appellees argue that, instead, Appellant decided of her own accord to await the outcome of the ethics complaint with the Commission before filing the petition in the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Appellees also assert that the election claims, which were filed more than six months after the election, are barred by the doctrine of laches. Appellees maintain that Appellant knowingly failed to file the election claims expeditiously, and that the\n   delay prejudiced Judge Turner, who relied upon the initial certification of her candidacy and later on the certification of the election results. Appellees argue that the delay may also prejudice the voters of Prince George's County, and in particular those who voted for Judge Turner, because they may have their votes invalidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State Ctr., LLC v.

Similarly, where a trial court considers materials outside of the pleadings, such as an affidavit, it is appropriate to treat the trial court's grant of a motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment, and \"[w]e review all questions of law, including whether summary judgment was properly granted, without deference.\"\n   <em>\n    Vito v.

Further, there is no basis on which to toll the statute of limitations. We hold that, independent of the statutory limitations period set forth in EL \u00a7 12-202(b), the petition is barred by the doctrine of laches because, in filing the petition in the circuit court more than six months after the 2016 general election, Appellant unreasonably delayed in asserting her rights, and that delay prejudiced Appellees. We turn first to EL \u00a7 12-202. As an initial matter, it is evident that the election claims-concerning Judge Turner's alleged ineligibility,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , lack of qualifications, for office of judge of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County-constitute a challenge to the qualifications,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , eligibility, of a candidate seeking election and, thus, fall within the purview of EL \u00a7 12-202(a). In other words, EL \u00a7 12-202 applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Appellant was required to file the petition in the circuit court within the statutory limitations period specified in EL \u00a7 12-202(b) -namely, \"within the earlier of: (1) 10 days after the act or omission or the date the act or omission became known to [Appellant]; or (2) 7 days after the election results [were] certified[.]\" (Paragraph breaks omitted). For purposes of EL \u00a7 12-202(b)(1), we must examine the date on which the act or omission became known to Appellant,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the date on which Appellant became aware of the facts that served as the basis for the election claims. A review of the record leads to the conclusion that Appellant became aware of Judge Turner's\n   alleged ineligibility, or lack of qualifications, to be a judge when or shortly after The Washington Post published its article about the contested judicial election, setting forth information about Judge Turner's legal practice background. The record demonstrates that, on April 21, 2016, prior to the 2016 primary election, The Washington Post published an article containing information about Judge Turner, including the circumstances that Judge Turner had been a military lawyer and a member of the Prince George's County Council, and that Judge Turner apparently had \"little experience in local courts.\" Significantly, in an affidavit that she filed in support of the motion for summary judgment, Appellant averred that she \"had no knowledge of [Judge] Turner's legal practice history until [T]he Washington Post['s] article[ ] dated April 21, 2016 had been published[,] and [the Commission] was invest[igat]ing [Judge] Turner.\" During the hearing in the circuit court, Appellant argued that, a few days before the 2016 primary election, The Washington Post's \"article came out[,] outlining everyone's qualifications and criticizing [Judge] Turner for her motives [in] switching [from] the congressional race to the judge race[,] and also criticizing her qualifications.\" Appellant explained that, upon seeing the article, \"[t]hat is actually when\n   [she] found out that [Judge Turner] ha[d] never practiced law. And [Appellant] actually started researching her bio[graphie]s on[ ]line, asking some people. No, [Judge Turner] has never practiced law in this State.\" At oral argument, Appellant asserted that she did not discover that Judge Turner \"did not meet the constitutional qualifications\" until after Judge Turner won the 2016 primary election. At oral argument, Appellant stated that she did not \"figure[ ] out\" that Judge Turner was ineligible until after she had filed the ethics complaint with the Commission, and Appellant advised this Court that she supplemented the ethics complaint with information about the eligibility issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In our view, despite Appellant's attempt to give a different impression, her statements at oral argument are wholly consistent with the conclusion that she became aware of The Washington Post's article and Judge Turner's alleged ineligibility\n   for judicial office in late April 2016 or shortly thereafter. The record reveals the following straightforward sequence of events: (1) on April 14, 2016, Appellant filed the ethics complaint with the Commission; (2) on April 21, 2016, The Washington Post's article was published; and (3) on April 26, 2016, the 2016 primary election occurred. In other words, as of the dates of The Washington Post's article and the 2016 primary election, the ethics complaint was pending with the Commission. In the circuit court, Appellant was clear that she saw The Washington Post's article when it was published, and, as a result, became aware of Judge Turner's legal practice background. In other words, in the circuit court, Appellant did not allege that she saw The Washington Post's article only shortly before filing the petition on May 9, 2017, or that she had only recently become aware of Judge Turner's legal practice background; indeed, nothing in the record supports the inference that Appellant became aware of the facts underlying the election claims at some point other than in April 2016 or shortly thereafter. And, both of Appellant's statements at oral argument in this Court-that she did not discover Judge Turner's ineligibility for judicial office until after the 2016 primary election, and that she did not \"figure[ ] out\" that Judge Turner was ineligible until after the filing of the ethics complaint-refer to events that occurred in April 2016,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the primary election on April 26, 2016, and the filing of the ethics complaint on April 14, 2016. Appellant advised this Court that she raised the eligibility issue with the Commission by providing supplements to it after the ethics complaint had been filed. Simply put, Appellant's statements at oral argument confirm, rather than contradict, the conclusion that Appellant became aware of the basis for the election claims after reading The Washington Post's article when or shortly after it was published on April 21, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Interestingly, on brief, in a section labeled \"Statement of the Case,\" Appellant states, without any citation to the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Prior to filing the action[,] and upon learning of [Judge] Turner being sworn, on January 9, 2017, [Appellant] gave notice to the Attorney General that she was awaiting a\n   decision on the disqualification of [Judge] Turner from [the Commission], and [Appellant] would be seeking judicial intervention, if necessary, to declare her the qualified winner of the election.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   At oral argument, however, Appellees' counsel advised the Court that Appellees did not have a copy of such notice, and that no such notice was contained in the record. Appellees' counsel advised that she had received various e-mails from Appellant, in which Appellant asserted her right to Judge Turner's judgeship, but that she had not received the notice to which Appellant referred on brief. Appellees' counsel\n   stated that she was unaware of any type of \"official notice\" that Appellant gave concerning her intent to file an action. Notwithstanding that Appellees' counsel did not receive the notice to which Appellant referred, Appellant's statements on brief demonstrate that, at a minimum, Appellant knew of any issue related to Judge Turner's eligibility for judicial office by January 9, 2017, the date on which she claims to have provided notice to Appellees' counsel of her intent to await the outcome of the ethics complaint before filing a complaint in the circuit court. In other words, Appellant's own words in her brief confirm that she knew of the eligibility issue pertaining to Judge Turner by January 9, 2017 at the latest, yet Appellant still waited four months before filing the petition in the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In addition to the record demonstrating that Appellant gained knowledge of Judge Turner's legal background when or shortly after The Washington Post's article was published, the issue of whether Judge Turner had been admitted to the Bar of Maryland or had practiced law in Maryland,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Judge Turner's legal practice background, is something that would have been easily ascertainable by Appellant through minimal investigation;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , these are facts that would have been readily discernible in today's digital age. Indeed, after Judge Turner filed a certificate of candidacy, and even prior to the 2016 primary election, anyone could have easily investigated Judge Turner's background and found out whether she had been admitted to the Bar of Maryland, and whether she had\n   practiced law in Maryland. For example, in the affidavit in support of the motion for summary judgment, Appellant averred that, on April 29, 2017, upon receiving notice of the disposition of the ethics complaint from the Commission, she \"immediately verified [Judge] Turner's online official Maryland biographies[.]\" Clearly, Appellant had the ability to access information about Judge Turner's professional background through minimal investigation, and there was no need to delay filing the petition in the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In short, we determine that the record supports the conclusion that Appellant became aware of Judge Turner's alleged ineligibility, or lack of qualifications, to be a judge when or shortly after The Washington Post published its article on April 21, 2016, and Appellant had the ability to uncover information about Judge Turner's legal background regardless of the publication of The Washington Post's article. The date on which Appellant actually became aware of the alleged act or omission underlying the election claims-on or shortly after April 21, 2016-is far earlier than the date on which the election results were certified, which occurred after November 8, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under EL \u00a7 12-202(b)(1), Appellant was required to file the petition in the circuit court within ten days after the act or omission became known to her, which she failed to do; instead,\n   Appellant waited until May 9, 2017, to file the petition in the circuit court. And, even if Appellant were\n   unaware of the facts giving rise to the election claims until January 9, 2017-the date on which she states she notified the Attorney General that she was awaiting the Commission's decision on the ethics complaint before filing a complaint in the circuit court-it is undisputed that Appellant did not file the petition within ten days of that date either. Even were we to consider EL \u00a7 12-202(b)(2), instead of EL \u00a7 12-202(b)(1), as providing the relevant statutory limitations period, undisputedly, Appellant filed the petition in the circuit court on May 9, 2017, more than six months after the 2016 general election, and long after the 2016 general election results had been certified. Under either deadline set forth in EL \u00a7 12-202(b), Appellant's filing of the petition more than six months after the 2016 general election was untimely, and, accordingly, EL \u00a7 12-202(b) bars the election claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Contrary to Appellant's assertion, we are unconvinced that Art. IV, \u00a7 5 of the Constitution of Maryland offers any support for the notion that the \"qualification\" of a judicial officer may be challenged after the timeframe set forth in EL \u00a7 12-202(b). Art. IV, \u00a7 5 simply does not provide a basis on which to dispute a candidate's eligibility for judicial office months after an election occurs, and months after the candidate becomes a judge. Indeed, as Appellees contend, it appears that Appellant fails to appreciate the distinction between a candidate's eligibility for judicial office-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , circumstances such as residency, age, and bar membership-and the process of qualifying for office-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , receiving a commission, taking an oath, and posting any applicable bond. Art. IV, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution of Maryland, concerning judicial qualifications, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   The Judges of all of the said Courts shall be citizens of the State of Maryland, and qualified voters under this Constitution, and shall have resided therein not less than five years, and not less than six months next preceding their election, or appointment, as the case may be, in the city, county, district, judicial circuit, intermediate appellate judicial circuit[,] or appellate judicial circuit for which they may be, respectively, elected or appointed. They shall be not less\n   than thirty years of age at the time of their election or appointment, and shall be selected from those who have been admitted to practice Law in this State, and who are most distinguished for integrity, wisdom[,] and sound legal knowledge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   In other words, Art. IV, \u00a7 2 sets forth certain requirements that a candidate must meet to be eligible to be a judge in this State, including requirements as to residency, age, and membership in the Bar of Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   By contrast, to qualify for office,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the process of assuming office, Art. I, \u00a7 10 of the Constitution of Maryland provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   Any officer elected or appointed in pursuance of the provisions of this Constitution, may qualify, either according to the existing provisions of law, in relation to officers under the present Constitution, or before the Governor of the State, or before any Clerk of any Court of Record in any part of the State; but in case an officer shall qualify out of the County in which he [or she] resides, an official copy of his [or her] oath shall be filed and recorded in the Clerk's office of the Circuit Court of the County in which he [or she] may reside, or in the Clerk's office of the Superior Court of the City of Baltimore, if he [or she] shall reside therein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Art. I, \u00a7 10 expressly authorizes the Governor or the clerk to qualify an officer by\n   administering the necessary oath. Thus, Art. I, \u00a7 10 refers to an officer qualifying for office,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , taking the oath of office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Art. IV, \u00a7 5 of the Constitution of Maryland -the provision on which Appellant relies-concerns a vacancy in the office of a circuit court judge, and provides that, upon the occurrence of a such a vacancy, \"the Governor shall appoint a person duly qualified to fill said office, who shall hold the same until the election and qualification of his successor.\" Obviously, Art. IV, \u00a7 5's use of the phrase \"duly qualified\" refers to the individual's eligibility for judicial office and whether that individual satisfies the requirements set forth in Art. IV, \u00a7 2, whereas Art. IV, \u00a7 5's use of the word \"qualification\" means\n   taking the oath of office, and does not mean determining whether the individual meets the applicable eligibility requirements. In any event, significantly, Art. IV, \u00a7 5 does not provide a basis or mechanism through which a registered voter may challenge a candidate's eligibility,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , qualifications, to seek judicial office; rather, as stated, EL \u00a7 12-202 provides such a mechanism by permitting a judicial challenge within the statutory limitations period specified in EL \u00a7 12-202(b). Contrary to Appellant's assertion, we discern no conflict between Art. IV, \u00a7 5 and EL \u00a7 12-202, such that EL \u00a7 12-202(b)'s statutory limitations period is unconstitutional or otherwise inapplicable under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Likewise, we reject Appellant's contention that EL \u00a7 12-202(b) is tolled either due to wrongdoing on Judge Turner's part, or because Appellant filed the ethics complaint with the Commission. Setting aside the issue of whether the General Assembly has expressly permitted an exception to the statute of limitations set forth in EL \u00a7 12-202(b),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Booth Glass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2057584\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/304/615/#p623\">\n    304 Md. at 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2057584\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/304/615/#p623\">\n    500 A.2d at 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]here the [General Assembly] has not expressly provided for an exception in a statute of limitations, the court will not allow any implied or equitable exception to be engrafted upon it.\" (Citations omitted) ), we fail to discern any basis on which to toll the statute of limitations. There is nothing in the record that indicates that Appellant was \"induced or tricked by [Judge Turner] into allowing the filing deadline to pass.\"\n   <em>\n    Adedje\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677516\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/214/1/#p13\">\n    214 Md.

Appellant's bare allegations that Judge Turner committed fraud on the taxpayers to secure her position as a judge and that Judge Turner has unclean hands are insufficient to establish that Judge Turner engaged in wrongful conduct that prevented Appellant from asserting the election claims. Rather, as the record demonstrates, on or shortly after April 21, 2016, Appellant became aware of Judge Turner's candidacy and eligibility for office,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , of the basis for the election claims, and Appellant was neither tricked nor induced into delaying filing the petition in the circuit court until May 9, 2017, over a year later. Instead, according to Appellant herself, she elected to await the outcome\n   of the ethics complaint with the Commission before filing the petition in the circuit court. We are unable to identify any wrongful conduct on Judge Turner's part that resulted in Appellant's delay in filing the petition in the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   We are unpersuaded that the filing of the ethics complaint with the Commission tolls the statute of limitations for the election claims filed in the circuit court. Indeed, the ethics complaint that Appellant filed with the Commission concerned Judge Turner's conduct as a judicial candidate during a campaign, and alleged that Judge Turner had committed various ethical violations during the campaign by engaging in prohibited political activities. By contrast, the petition filed in the circuit court concerned Judge Turner's\n   eligibility as a judicial candidate, not alleged campaign misconduct. Plainly put, the substance of the ethics complaint was distinct from that of the petition. And, even if Appellant had supplemented the ethics complaint with the issue of Judge Turner's eligibility for judicial office, the Commission would have been unable to address that issue because the responsibility for determining a candidate's eligibility to run for office rests with the courts through an action under EL \u00a7 12-202. The filing of the ethics complaint with the Commission does not support tolling of EL \u00a7 12-202(b)'s statutory limitations period, and does not excuse Appellant's failure to timely challenge Judge Turner's eligibility for office under EL \u00a7 12-202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Independent of our holding that the election claims are barred by EL \u00a7 12-202(b) due to the untimely filing of the petition in the circuit court, we hold that the doctrine of laches bars the election claims. In filing the petition in the circuit court more than six months after the 2016 general election, there was an unreasonable delay in Appellant's assertion of the election claims, and that delay resulted in prejudice to Appellees. Appellant's filing of the petition in the circuit court on May 9, 2017, more than six months after the 2016 general election, and over a year after Appellant became aware of the facts that formed the basis for the election claims, constitutes\n   a clear-cut example of unreasonable delay for purposes of the doctrine of laches. As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Schlakman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314880,12489024\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/451/468/\">\n    451 Md. at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489024,12489025,12314872,12314880\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/144/\">\n    153 A.3d at 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the statutory limitations period set forth in EL \u00a7 12-202(b)\"provides a benchmark for the application of [the doctrine of] laches ... against which this Court can assess whether [Appellant's] delay in filing in the [c]ircuit [c]ourt was unreasonable[.]\" Under EL \u00a7 12-202(b)(1) or (2), Appellant was required to file the petition in the circuit court within ten days after she became aware of The Washington Post's article published on April 21, 2016, or within seven days after the 2016 general election results were certified. These dates-on or shortly after April 21, 2016, or shortly after the November 8, 2016 general election-provide a benchmark from which we may measure Appellant's delay in filing the petition. When compared to either date, Appellant's filing of the petition on May 9, 2017, is simply unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   It is evident that Appellant failed to act with the expediency that is required of election claims. As in\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"583483\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/387/649/\">\n    387 Md. at 672-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"583483\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/387/649/\">\n    876 A.2d at 705-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Appellant's \"wait and see\" strategy, waiting until more than six months after the general election and almost two weeks after the date of the letter in which the Commission notified Appellant of the outcome of the ethics complaint concerning matters other than those raised in the election claims, was an unjustifiable, intentional delay in the assertion of her rights. What we stated in\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"583483\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/387/649/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"583483\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/387/649/\">\n    at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"583483\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/387/649/\">\n    876 A.2d at 705-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , applies with equal force here-\"a candidate ... should not be allowed to ambush an adversary or subvert the election process by intentionally delaying a request for remedial action to see first whether [he or she] will be successful at the polls.\" (Cleaned up).

Appellant's explanation and acknowledgement demonstrate that Appellant knew of her rights, yet deliberately delayed and failed to expeditiously pursue the election claims, thereby unreasonably delaying in pursuing the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In short, waiting until more than six months after the election to challenge a candidate's eligibility for judicial office was unreasonable, and provided no opportunity whatsoever for either the circuit court or this Court to assess the election claims before the 2016 general election.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liddy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3852563\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/398/233/#p245\">\n    398 Md. at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3852563\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/398/233/#p245\">\n    919 A.2d at 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (This Court observed that, despite the circumstance that the plaintiff's complaint was filed within the timeframe specified by the Election Law Article, the plaintiff's \"failure diligently to pursue his challenge left this Court, as well as the [trial] court [ ], a very brief time in which to consider and decide th[e] matter[,]\" specifically, leaving only five days between the date of oral argument and the general\n   election.). Obviously, in this case, by the time that Appellant filed the petition, the election results were certified, and Judge Turner had assumed the office of judge of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County, and was an active judge in this State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Appellant's unreasonable delay in bringing the election claims in the circuit court prejudiced Appellees.

We discern no basis on which to toll the statute of limitations. Additionally, we determine that, apart from EL \u00a7 12-202(b)'s statutory limitations period, the petition is barred by the doctrine of laches because, in filing the petition in the circuit court more than six months after the 2016 general election, Appellant engaged in unreasonable delay, and that delay resulted in prejudice to Appellees.

Whether [Judge Turner], in this case, committed the crime of misconduct while in office or violated public ethics laws through using the Attorney General to defend a judicial challenge to her constitutional qualifications to appear on the election ballot and campaign misconduct[.]\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n    3. Whether a member of the Maryland bar, whose only experience with the practice of law is military law as an active member of the U.S. Navy[,] meets the qualifications of Art. IV \u00a7[ ]2 of the Maryland Constitution to serve as a Circuit Court Judge[.]\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n    4. Upon an attorney candidate's disqualification after winning a judicial election, whether Art. IV \u00a7[ ]5 grants the commission to a qualified candidate[,] who also ran in the judicial election[.]\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    In any event, with respect to the third question presented, to the extent that Appellant raises a claim that Judge Turner has never practiced law in Maryland and is, therefore, not eligible for judicial office, she is mistaken. Art. IV, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution of Maryland provides that judges in this State \"shall be not less than thirty years of age at the time of their election or appointment, and shall be selected from those who have been admitted to practice Law in this State, and who are most distinguished for integrity, wisdom and sound legal knowledge.\" The plain language of Art. IV, \u00a7 2 requires simply that a judicial candidate be \"admitted to practice Law in this State[,]\" which means that a judicial candidate must be a member of the Bar of Maryland.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Bernstein v. State\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702545\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/36/\">\n     422 Md. 36\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 45 &amp; n.2,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702545\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/36/\">\n     29 A.3d 267\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 272 &amp; n.2 (2011) (This Court noted that Art. IV, \u00a7 2's clause requiring that a judicial candidate be \"admitted to practice Law in this State\" \"is commonly read to require that certain judicial offices be filled by current members of the Maryland Bar[,]\" and that \"it is well established[ ] that having been admitted to practice law in this State is a requirement for selection as a judge[.]\"). In other words, this Court has interpreted the plain language of Art. IV, \u00a7 2 to require only that a judicial candidate be \"admitted to practice Law in this State[,]\"\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , be a member of the Bar of Maryland. In this case, it is undisputed that Judge Turner is a current member of the Bar of Maryland, having been admitted in 1994. Thus, Judge Turner clearly satisfies Art. IV, \u00a7 2's requirement that a judicial candidate be \"admitted to practice Law in this State[.]\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    The incumbent judges were the Honorable Herman C.

Md. Const., Art. IV, \u00a7 4B (a)(1)(i). A judge commits \"sanctionable conduct\" where the judge engages in \"misconduct while in office, the persistent failure by a judge to perform the duties of the judge's office, or conduct prejudicial to the proper administration of justice[,]\" or where the judge violates \"any of the provisions of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct[.]\" Md. R. 18-401(j)(1).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    By contrast, a candidate for judicial office who is an attorney \"shall comply with Rule 19-308.2 of the Maryland Attorneys' Rules of Professional Conduct [ (\"MARPC\") ].\" Md.

In turn, MARPC 8.2(a),\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , Maryland Rule 19-308.2(a), provides, in relevant part, that \"[a]n attorney shall not make a statement that the attorney knows to be false or with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity concerning the qualifications or integrity of ... a candidate for election or appointment to judicial legal office.\" And, MARPC 8.2(b)(3) provides that an attorney who becomes a candidate for judicial office \"shall not knowingly misrepresent his or her identity or qualifications[.]\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    Nevertheless, Maryland Rule 18-104.6(b) provides: \"A successful candidate and a judge who unsuccessfully sought a different judicial office are subject to judicial discipline for campaign conduct. An unsuccessful candidate who is an attorney is subject to attorney discipline for campaign conduct.\" In other words, whether a judge or an attorney, a candidate for judicial office may be subject to discipline for campaign conduct. Which entity has jurisdiction over alleged campaign misconduct, however, depends on whether the individual is a judge or an attorney-if the individual is a judge, then the Commission has jurisdiction, whereas, if the individual is an attorney, then the Attorney Grievance Commission has jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    On December 6, 2017, Appellees filed in this Court a \"Motion to Seal Proceedings,\" requesting that this \"Court enter an order sealing the proceedings in this Court and in the [c]ircuit [c]ourt[.]\" Appellees contended that the proceedings in the case involved the filing of the ethics complaint with the Commission against Judge Turner, a successful candidate for judicial office, and the resolution of the ethics complaint before the filing of any formal charges. Appellees argued that proceedings before the Commission are confidential, and that, because Appellant relied on, and included in her filings, matters pertaining to the ethics complaint, the proceedings in this Court and the circuit court should be sealed. On December 10, 2017, Appellant filed an opposition to the motion to seal. On December 15, 2017, this Court issued an order deferring action on the motion to seal pending oral argument. On January 8, 2018, one day before oral argument in this case, Appellees filed a letter advising that the motion to seal was withdrawn.

According to another exhibit, Judge Turner's biography on princegeorgescourts.org, Judge Turner served as a judge advocate in the United States Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps, achieving the rank of Commander before retiring. And, in a motion to dismiss filed in the circuit court, Appellees stated that Judge Turner \"served as Deputy Legal Counsel at the National Naval Medical Center, in Bethesda, Maryland, from 2001 to 2004.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    As to the merits of the election claims, the circuit court stated that, were it to reach the constitutional challenge, \"it seem[ed] clear to the [c]ourt that the Constitution simply requires [a candidate for judgeship] to be admitted to practice law[, and] there is no requirement that [a candidate for judgeship] actually practice law.\" The circuit court further explained that it would issue a declaratory judgment declaring that Judge Turner was \"a qualified candidate under [ ] Art[.] IV, [\u00a7] 2 [of the Constitution of Maryland,] and also that there is a remedy provided by [EL \u00a7] 12-202.\" In other words, as the circuit court stated, because there was a remedy available under EL \u00a7 12-202, mandamus relief was not available, and \"there [was] a failure to state a claim [for] relief [in the form of] mandamus[,] as there [was] no clear legal right to the office under [ ] Art[.] IV, [\u00a7] 5 [of the Constitution of Maryland].\" (Italics omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    Maryland Rule 8-523(a)(2) provides: \"In the Court of Appeals a party may not submit an appeal for consideration on brief except with permission of the Court.

Later during oral argument, Appellant contended that, by statute, the Attorney General is permitted to represent a State official only in cases related to \"the State's legal business[,]\" and, according to Appellant, running for public office and having a name placed on an election ballot \"is a personal matter[,]\" and not the State's legal business.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    In any event, as to the merits of the motion, we note that, when the petition was filed in the circuit court, Judge Turner was an elected and sworn State official,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Md.

And, because the election was over, and the results certified, when the petition was filed, neither Appellant nor Judge Turner was a candidate for judicial office. As such, contrary to Appellant's contention, the Attorney General's representation of Judge Turner did not \"assist one candidate over the other to win a judicial election.\" (Citation omitted). Rather, the Attorney General represented all of the State defendants, consisting of three State officials and one State agency, in an action that involved a challenge to an election that had occurred more than six months earlier.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    Specifically, Md.
