We reject the defendant's claim that the court relied upon inaccurate information in sentencing him, but conclude that the form of the judgment is improper and, therefore, remand this case with direction to deny the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 17, 2006, the defendant was found guilty of, inter alia, three counts each of sexual assault in the first degree, in violation of \u00a7 53a-70(a)(1) and \u00a7 53a-70(a)(2), in connection with three separate sexual assaults on different dates. Thereafter, following the preparation of a presentence investigation report (PSI), he was sentenced, on the basis of that verdict, as follows: for each violation of \u00a7 53a-70(a)(1), to a mandatory minimum term of five years incarceration followed by five years of special parole, with all three sentences to run consecutively to one another; for each violation of \u00a7 53a-70(a)(2), to a term of five years incarceration followed by five years of special parole, with each such sentence to run concurrently with the sentence imposed for violation of \u00a7 53a-70(a)(1) in connection with the same underlying sexual assaults; for a total effective sentence of fifteen years incarceration, all mandatory, followed by fifteen years of special parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 22, 2015, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Fasano, J\n   </em>\n   ., granted the defendant's first motion to correct an illegal sentence, concluding that the defendant's convictions and sentences under both \u00a7 53a-70(a)(1) and (2) violated his double jeopardy rights because he was sentenced twice for the same offense. Accordingly, the court ordered that the defendant's convictions of the three counts of sexual assault in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-70(a)(2) be dismissed and that the sentences imposed on those convictions be vacated. As a result of the court's order, the defendant's total effective sentence on his three remaining convictions of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70(a)(1), of fifteen years incarceration, all mandatory, followed by fifteen years of special parole, remained unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Thereafter, the defendant filed a second motion to vacate an illegal sentence, asserting that the vacatur of his parallel convictions of and concurrent sentences for sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70(a)(2) required a finding that the trial court's original sentence was imposed in an illegal manner. The defendant argued that his sentence was illegal because the sentencing court relied upon inaccurate information in sentencing him. Specifically, the defendant claims that the court improperly relied, when it imposed the challenged sentences, upon information concerning the guilty verdicts underlying the three convictions\n   that were subsequently vacated, as related to the court in the PSI and the prosecutor's comments at sentencing. He therefore argues that he \"should be allowed a new sentencing hearing and/or be resentenced with accurate information.\" The court,\n   <em>\n    Fasano, J\n   </em>\n   ., dismissed the defendant's second motion to correct on December 9, 2015, reasoning that the original sentencing court did not rely on any of the vacated charges in imposing the defendant's sentence. From that determination, the defendant has filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 43-22 provides that \"[t]he judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner or any other disposition made in an illegal manner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"[A]n illegal sentence is essentially one [that] either exceeds the relevant statutory maximum limits, violates a defendant's right against double jeopardy, is ambiguous, or is internally contradictory.

The substance of the information is the three counts which were later vacated and found to be improper. The [PSI] and the prosecution made repeated use of this information which has been deemed to be inappropriate. The motion to correct an illegal sentence court\n   therefore erred in failing to adequately resentence the defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addressing the defendant's claim that the sentencing court had relied upon his subsequently vacated convictions in imposing his sentence, the court explained: \"In this case, there's absolutely no evidence of explicit reliance on the vacated charges. That's the sex one under [ \u00a7 53a-70 ](a)(2). That's the age and age difference. In fact, the evidence is just the opposite. He gives concurrent time on all the sex one's under [ \u00a7 53a-70 ](a)(2), which is the age issue. He treats the conduct as three separate assaults rather than six. He gives the mandatory minimum on the [ \u00a7 53a-70 ](a)(1)s, which is five years, followed by five years of special parole. That's as little as you can get because it has to add up to ten. And he runs those three incidents consecutive. He then makes all the other charges, the [ \u00a7 53a-70 ](a)(2) charges, the age difference charges, concurrent. And even the state in its own argument asked that you get concurrent time on those second convictions under [ \u00a7 53a-70 ](a)(2).\" On that basis, the court concluded, \"there was absolutely no reliance on the vacated charges.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We agree with the court's conclusion that the defendant's claim is belied by the record. Our review of the August 25, 2006 sentencing transcript reveals that the court explicitly imposed the five year mandatory minimum sentence for each of the three counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The sentencing court clearly considered the convictions under the different subdivisions of the sexual assault statute separately and distinctly, and did not enhance its sentence on any of the defendant's convictions under \u00a7 53a-70(a)(1) based upon any of his convictions under \u00a7 53a-70(a)(2), or the particular conduct upon which they were based. Moreover, the vacatur of the defendant's convictions for sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70(a)(2) on the basis of double jeopardy was not based upon insufficient evidence to support such convictions or any factual or legal findings that would invalidate the jury's guilty verdicts on those charges. Nor does the vacatur of those convictions render the information contained in the PSI or the statements made by the prosecutor regarding the facts underlying the jury's guilty verdicts on the \u00a7 53a-70(a)(2) charges inaccurate. Therefore, the trial court reasonably determined that the sentencing court did not rely upon inaccurate information in sentencing the defendant on his \u00a7 53a-70(a)(1) charges, and thus that the defendant's sentences on those charges were not imposed in an illegal manner. We conclude, on that basis, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We note that the trial court, having properly rejected the arguments raised in the defendant's motion on their merits, technically should have denied rather than dismissed the motion to correct. Only if a defendant fails to state a claim that brings a motion within the purview of Practice Book \u00a7 43-22 should a court dismiss the motion for lack of jurisdiction. A claim that the sentencing court relied upon inaccurate information in imposing its sentence falls squarely within the common-law jurisdiction of the Superior Court\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Charles F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072325\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/133/698/#p702\">\n    133 Conn. App. 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 702-703,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20A.3d%20731\">\n    36 A.3d 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20Conn.%20929\">\n    304 Conn. 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20A.3d%20390\">\n    42 A.3d 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). The defendant's\n   motion did not merely raise a collateral attack on the judgment of conviction but, on its face, attacked the manner in which his sentence was imposed, and the court never made a determination that the motion was jurisdictionally defective. Accordingly, the motion properly invoked the court's jurisdiction,\n   and, thus, the form of the judgment is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The form of the judgment is improper, the judgment dismissing the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment denying the defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    The defendant also claims that his sentence was illegally enhanced following the vacatur of three of his convictions and sentences by eliminating the earned risk reduction credits that he had earned prior to said vacatur and that the elimination of those credits, which he alleges constituted an increase in the length of his sentence, can be attributed to the vindictiveness of the court. The defendant did not raise these arguments in his second motion to correct, and the court therefore did not address them, and they thus are not properly before us now. We note, however, that because the five year sentences on each of the incidents of sexual assault were mandatory minimum sentences for those convictions, the defendant was not entitled to reduce his sentences by earned risk reduction credits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
