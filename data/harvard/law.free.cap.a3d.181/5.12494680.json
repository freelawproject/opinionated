We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 20, 2011, DOT filed a formal declaration of taking (Declaration) pursuant to the Eminent Domain Code (Code),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking to acquire 0.154 acres in fee simple title for the purpose of widening State Route (SR) 124, also known as Mt. Rose Avenue, and 0.127 acres as a temporary construction easement from real estate owned by OPA in Springettsbury Township (Township), York County, which commercially operates as the Eagle's Nest Restaurant (the OPA Property). (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 21a-27a.) DOT filed a plan of condemnation (Plan) with the Declaration that identified the areas subject to the requested taking. In addition to the OPA Property, the Plan also identified a 0.142-acre area that DOT set forth as an existing legal right-of-way. (R.R. at 27a.) OPA did not file preliminary objections to the Declaration. (R.R. at 76a-77a; OPA's Petition for Appointment of Board of Viewers dated 1/6/14, at \u00b6 2.) The matter before us pertains solely to the 0.142-acre area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 6, 2014, two years after DOT filed the Declaration, OPA petitioned for the appointment of a board of viewers to assess damages for DOT's taking of the OPA Property, as well as the additional 0.142-acre area. (R.R. at 76a-77a.) At a two-day hearing held before the board of viewers in September 2014, OPA claimed ownership of the 0.142-acre area that was designated as an existing right-of-way in the Plan. (R.R. at 3a; OPA's Petition for Appointment of Board of Viewers dated 10/30/14, at \u00b6 15.) OPA asserted that it first discovered that the 0.142-acre area was not an existing right-of-way during its preparations for the proceeding before the board of viewers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.) DOT objected to OPA's assertion, arguing that OPA had not properly challenged the Plan's designation of the 0.142-acre area as an existing right-of-way by filing preliminary objections to the Declaration. Ultimately, the board of viewers awarded damages for the OPA Property taken pursuant to the Declaration and depicted on the Plan (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the 0.154-acre and 0.127-acre tracts), but did not award damages with respect to the 0.142-acre area. OPA appealed the board of viewers' decision, requesting a jury trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , and that action remains pending with the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 30, 2014, following the board of viewers' proceeding regarding the formal condemnation, OPA initiated a collateral action and filed the second petition for\n   the appointment of a board of viewers pursuant to Section 502(c) of the Code, and it is that second petition that is now before this Court. (R.R. at 1a-10a.) In its second petition, OPA attacked the Plan through an allegation of inverse condemnation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, OPA argued that DOT never acquired the 0.142-acre area from OPA or otherwise, and that OPA did not receive just compensation for that 0.142-acre area from DOT. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.) Thus, OPA contended DOT inversely condemned that area once construction to expand SR 124 began, and, accordingly, OPA requested additional just compensation under the Code for the 0.142-acre area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 1, 2014, DOT filed preliminary objections to OPA's second petition for appointment of a board of viewers, asserting,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that OPA waived any challenge to the nature and extent of the OPA Property's ownership, including the 0.142-acre area, as represented in the Declaration, because OPA failed to file preliminary objections to the Declaration. (R.R. at 11a-41a; DOT's Preliminary Objections.) DOT further asserted that OPA lacked standing to bring the action because it was not the record owner of the property at the time of the alleged taking when the Township accepted the 0.142-acre area in 1991. On February 22, 2016, the trial court held oral arguments to consider DOT's preliminary objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 23, 2016, the trial court ordered both parties to submit a rendering of the 0.154-acre required right-of-way and the 0.142-acre right-of-way depicted in DOT's Plan. (R.R. 85a-86a; Order Requesting Additional Information.) The trial court also directed the parties to provide a brief narrative regarding title to the 0.142-acre area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response to the trial court's directives regarding the 0.142-acre area, DOT submitted (1) a 1799 deed establishing a 33-foot width right-of-way along the current SR 124 (R.R. at 101a-105a; DOT's Response to Order Requesting Additional Information (Response), at Exhibit 2.);\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) Resolution 90-43 passed by the Township on October 25, 1990, which adopted certain rights-of-way from various properties along SR 124 in the Township (explicitly including the OPA Property) to be used in the expansion of Mt. Rose Avenue (R.R. at 106a-107a; Response, at Exhibit 3.); (3) a deed of transfer dated May 14, 1991, and recorded on May 30, 1991, which conveyed 2.433 acres, including 3,299 square feet of the OPA Property, from the Township to DOT, to be used for a required right-of-way in fee simple along SR 124 (R.R. at 108a-113a; Response, at Exhibit 4.); (4) the plan accepting the dedication of the right-of-way for SR 124, which was recorded following the deed transfer (R.R. at 114a-116a; Response, at Exhibit 5.); (5) the 2005 deed of purchase, evidencing OPA's purchase of the property from Arthur Murphy to OPA and containing a metes and bounds description of the property that falls within the cartway of SR 124 (R.R. at 117a-121a; Response, at Exhibit 6.). (Appellant's brief, at 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 17, 2016, the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine whether a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking occurred. OPA presented the testimony of Pamela Seay, a title abstractor employed by OPA's legal counsel. (R.R. at 153a; Notes of Transcript (N.T.), 8/17/16, at 12.) Ms. Seay testified that, when performing a title search of the OPA Property, she did not locate the 1991 deed of dedication from the Township to DOT in the chain of title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (R.R. at 156a; N.T., 8/17/16, at 18.) The deeds searched by Ms. Seay, which dated back to 1935, all contained metes and bounds descriptions that included a portion of the roadbed of SR 124. (R.R. at 154a-156a; N.T., 8/17/16, at 16-18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 201a-210a; N.T., 8/17/16, at OPA Exhibits 2-7.) OPA also presented the testimony of Arthur Murphy, the predecessor in title to OPA. (R.R. at 160a; N.T., 8/17/16, at 26.) Mr. Murphy testified that, during his ownership of the OPA Property, he did not receive notice that the Township had acquired a right-of-way. (R.R. at 161a; N.T., 8/17/16, at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   DOT presented the testimony of Richard Reisinger, P.E., a professional engineer and the District 8-0 Right-of-Way Administrator. (R.R. at 165a-166a; N.T., 8/17/16, at 37-38.) Mr. Reisinger testified that he had personal knowledge of the chain of title and history of the property. (R.R. at 166a; N.T., 8/17/16, at 38.) He also explained how DOT calculated the 0.142-acre area, and that a portion of that area extends into the roadbed of SR 124. (R.R. at 174a; N.T., 8/17/16, at 54.) Mr. Reisinger further testified that the Plan included all of DOT's documents of title to its legal areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 12, 2016, the trial court issued its opinion and order overruling DOT's preliminary objections and finding a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking. (R.R. at 132a-140a; Opinion and Order Overruling Preliminary Objections of DOT dated December 9, 2016.) In doing so, the trial court considered whether the Township properly obtained the 0.142-acre area that it dedicated to DOT, as well as the fact that the Property owner did not receive notice of DOT's acquisition of the right-of-way because the deed of dedication was allegedly not indexed to each property owner impacted by the dedication and there is no record of the Township taking that 0.142-acre area. DOT timely appealed the trial court's order to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   DOT argues that (1) OPA waived its right to file a separate\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking action, collaterally challenging the nature and extent of its property interest condemned, where it did not file preliminary objections to the declaration of taking; (2) OPA lacks standing to bring a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   claim because it was not the owner of the property allegedly taken at the time of taking; (3) the Board of Property has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction to determine the title of property to which the Commonwealth claims ownership; (4) the trial court's finding of a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking based upon an alleged defect in the indexing of the deed of transfer to DOT was unsupported by substantial evidence; and (5) the trial court erred in its order overruling DOT's preliminary objections by failing to specify the property interest condemned and the date of condemnation as required by Section 502(c) of the Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    OPA's Failure to File Preliminary Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Initially, DOT contends that OPA waived its right to file a separate\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking action, collaterally challenging the nature and extent of the property interest condemned, because it did not file preliminary objections to the Declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   OPA admits that it did not file preliminary objections to the Declaration. However, OPA argues that preliminary objections are not the exclusive method of challenging a taking of a portion of land not condemned in the Declaration, and that filing a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking action is permitted in this case. Specifically, OPA asserts that its right to file a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking action was not waived because DOT failed to include the 0.142-acre right-of-way in its Declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"It is well established that the Code provides the exclusive method and practice governing eminent domain proceedings, including\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   takings.\"\n   <em>\n    Linde Enterprises, Inc. v.

Redevelopment Authority of Allegheny County\n   </em>\n   , 4 Pa.Cmwlth. 533,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=287%20A.2d%20880\">\n    287 A.2d 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 882 (1972). In\n   <em>\n    Nelis\n   </em>\n   , the condemnor filed a declaration of taking, and a board of viewers awarded the condemnee compensation for his property. The condemnee then appealed to the court of common pleas, alleging that the board of viewers' award failed to include compensation related to a portion of the property destroyed prior to the filing of the declaration of taking. However, because the condemnee never filed preliminary objections to the condemnor's declaration of taking, as required by section 306(a) of the Code, we concluded that \"[t]he issue of a\n   <em>\n    [d]e facto\n   </em>\n   taking having occurred prior to the filing of a declaration of taking ... must be raised by preliminary objection to the declaration, and failure to do so constitutes a waiver to thereafter raise the issue.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=287%20A.2d%20880\">\n    287 A.2d at 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In such an event, the condemnor's attempted exercise of that power by the filing of a declaration of taking is in issue, an issue which in our opinion goes to the very heart of its power or right to condemn by formal condemnation proceedings. It is precisely the type of issue which the legislature intended to be preliminarily determined by the court, with evidentiary support if necessary, before the matter proceeded to the amount of just compensation and the property interests entitled thereto.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Nelis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=287%20A.2d%20880\">\n    287 A.2d at 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As explained above, in this case, OPA did not file preliminary objections to\n   DOT's Declaration. DOT argues that OPA's failure to file any preliminary objections prevents it from attacking the taking through the filing of this second petition for the appointment of a board of viewers. OPA counters that it is not precluded from asserting a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking because the at-issue 0.142-acre area was not condemned in the Declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   While our holding in\n   <em>\n    Nelis\n   </em>\n   suggests that the failure to file preliminary objections to a declaration is fatal to a condemnee's ability to later attack a taking, we must consider whether the same holds true if the declaration does not properly identify a portion of the subject property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gitlin v.

In the course of its preparation for the first hearing before the board of viewers, OPA determined that the 0.142-acre\n   area was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an existing right-of-way. The trial court agreed with that determination, finding that DOT's Declaration failed to properly identify the 0.142-acre area. The trial court concluded that the misidentification resulted in DOT's taking of more property than what was condemned in the Declaration. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Szabo\n   </em>\n   , a landowner's failure to file preliminary objections to a declaration of taking does not preclude the landowner from subsequently alleging a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking of a portion of property that was not condemned through a declaration.\n   <em>\n    Szabo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12329784\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/604/\">\n    159 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   608 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Condemnation by the Department of General Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720041\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/1159/#p1162\">\n    714 A.2d 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1162 (Pa.

The trial court disagreed, determining that DOT neither proved that a prior right-of-way existed, nor that the right-of-way was conveyed to DOT:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   There is no evidence that ... Township had acquired a right of way or was the fee simple owner of property that it conveyed to [DOT] by the May 1991 deed. If ... Township did not have a right of way or was not the fee simple owner, that deed did not convey anything. The deed was not indexed against any of the property owners named in the addendum to that deed. There is no evidence that any of those property owners, including [OPA], had notice of ... Township's claim to have acquired any interest in their property. [DOT] did not do its due diligence to determine whether or not ...

Op., 12/12/16, at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We find that the record contains substantial evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that a significant question as to ownership of the 0.142-acre area exists. In support of its finding, the trial court cited evidence of record including Resolution 90-43 and the 1991 deed and the addendum attached thereto. The evidence of record supports the trial court's determination that DOT failed to prove that a previous right-of-way existed over the 0.142-acre area. The Township, in taking that area, did not institute eminent domain proceedings, failed to notify the owner, and failed to index the taking such that it would be found by a subsequent purchaser of the Property. However, because of the uncertainty of ownership, the trial court acted prematurely in considering OPA's\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking claim. Furthermore, until the ownership issue is resolved, it would also be premature for this Court to consider whether OPA had standing to bring its\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   DOT next asserts that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction\n   to determine the title of property to which the Commonwealth claims ownership, as the exclusive jurisdiction to do so lies with the Board of Property.

Because the dispute involves a cloud on the title to property in which both a private owner (OPA) and the Commonwealth (DOT) claim an interest, section 1207 of the Administrative Code mandates that the Board of Property must determine title to the 0.142-acre area before the trial court can properly determine whether a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking or inverse condemnation occurred and whether OPA is entitled to compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Thus, we reverse the trial court's order to the extent it determined that an inverse condemnation occurred in 2011 and that, because DOT took 0.142 acres of property that was not included in the Declaration, it was appropriate to appoint a board of viewers to determine the amount of damages due to OPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The matter shall be remanded to the trial court, with the direction to transfer this matter to the Board of Property to determine proper title to the 0.142-acre area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Because the 0.142-acre area was not properly identified and included in DOT's Declaration, the trial court did not err in finding that OPA did not waive its right to raise the issue of a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking, despite its failure to file preliminary objections to the Declaration. Since the Board of Property has the exclusive jurisdiction to determine title to property in which the Commonwealth holds an interest, the trial court erred in determining that an inverse condemnation occurred in 2011 and that a board of viewers be appointed.
