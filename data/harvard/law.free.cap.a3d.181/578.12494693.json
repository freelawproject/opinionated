Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301b, the appellant, Enrico Vaccaro,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeals from the decision of the Workers' Compensation Review Board (board), which affirmed in part the decision of the Workers' Compensation Commissioner (commissioner), insofar as it determined that the commission has the authority to adjudicate a fee dispute between Vaccaro and the appellee, the law firm of Wofsey, Rosen, Kweskin &amp; Kuriansky, LLP (Wofsey Rosen). On appeal, Vaccaro claims (1) that the commission does not have subject matter jurisdiction to resolve disputes regarding attorney's fees between lawyers who serially represented a claimant and (2) that the commissioner and the board deprived Vaccaro of his constitutional right to have the attendant\n   factual issues resolved by a jury. We disagree with Vaccaro's claims and, accordingly, affirm the decision of the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. Both Vaccaro and Wofsey Rosen represented Edward Frantzen, the claimant, in claims for compensation brought against his employer, Daven-port Electric, for work related injuries sustained in 1994, 1998, and 2003. Wofsey Rosen represented the claimant from March 18, 1998 to April 1, 2005.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Attorney Allan Cane, who is not a party to this appeal, represented the claimant from April 27, 2005 to July 13, 2007. Vaccaro represented the claimant from July 13, 2007 to May 8, 2014. On May 8, 2014, a stipulation was approved by Commissioner Charles F. Senich pursuant to which $850,000 was awarded to the claimant. The\n   commissioner also approved attorney's fees of 20 percent, with instruction for Vaccaro to hold the amount of the fees in escrow until the fee dispute was resolved. On June 13, 2014, Vaccaro filed a brief that challenged the commission's subject matter jurisdiction over the fee dispute and attacked Wofsey Rosen's claim to any portion of the escrowed fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 30, 2014, a hearing was held before Commissioner Michelle D. Truglia on, among other things, Vaccaro's challenge to the commission's subject matter jurisdiction. Vaccaro was given the opportunity to submit evidence of his fee arrangement with the claimant, along with a statement of time and charges attributable to this representation. Vaccaro submitted a copy of his fee agreement but did not provide any evidence of time or charges attributable to this representation. Wofsey Rosen, on the other hand, provided\n   substantial evidence regarding its representation of the claimant. After finding that the commission had subject matter jurisdiction over the fee dispute, the commissioner decided that, because of Vaccaro's failure to document his time and charges, it was impossible to determine the scope and value of his representation of the claimant, and ordered a fifty/fifty split of the escrowed attorney's fees between Vaccaro and Wofsey Rosen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Vaccaro then appealed from the decision to the board, which on February 24, 2016, affirmed the commissioner's decision as to subject matter jurisdiction but reversed as to the division of the fees, and remanded the matter to the commissioner for a full evidentiary hearing on the issue. Vaccaro thereafter appealed to this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Vaccaro claims on appeal that the commission does not have subject matter jurisdiction to resolve disputes regarding attorney's fees between lawyers who serially represent a claimant and that the commissioner and the board deprived him of his constitutional right to have the attendant factual issues resolved by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers' compensation appeals. \"It is well established that [a]lthough not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers' compensation statutes by the commissioner and review board.... A state agency is not entitled, however, to special deference when its determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to\n   judicial scrutiny.... Where ...

The court held that \"[s]ubsection (b) directly follows and modifies subsection (a), and further provides that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   attorney's fees shall be subject to the commissioner's approval. Subsection (b) makes no distinction between fees that are awarded separately and fees that are combined with other compensation. In the absence of a statutory exception, we are not persuaded that a separate award of fees is exempt from the commissioner's approval.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=780%20A.2d%20172\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The precise issue in\n   <em>\n    Prioli\n   </em>\n   , to be sure, did not concern whether any portion of the awarded fees could have\n   been allocated to other lawyers who represented the claimant successively. Vaccaro claims that this court determined in\n   <em>\n    Prioli\n   </em>\n   only that subsection (b) of \u00a7 31-327 modifies subsection (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court quite clearly held, however, that \u00a7 31-327 (b) both modified subsection (a)\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   provided that all attorney's fees are subject to the commissioner's approval.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=780%20A.2d%20172\">\n    Id., at 308-309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=780%20A.2d%20172\">\n    780 A.2d 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Vaccaro's claim is contrary to the plain language of the statute, in that subsection (b) provides that all attorney's fees \"for services\n   <em>\n    under this chapter\n   </em>\n   \" are subject to the commissioner's approval. (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-327 (b). The principles we cited in deciding\n   <em>\n    Prioli\n   </em>\n   would be contravened if we were to read into the unambiguous statute an exception to the word \"all.\" Thus, under a plain reading of \u00a7 31-327 (b), we conclude that the statute unambiguously provides that the division of attorney's fees between successive counsel is subject to the commissioner's approval. Accordingly, the commissioner, and by extension the commission, had the authority to direct the division of the attorney's fees award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This holding is consistent with our Supreme Court precedent. In\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brescome Barton, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%2033\">\n    317 Conn. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 43-44,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20A.3d%201210\">\n    114 A.3d 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), our Supreme Court held that it was within the commissioner's statutory authority to order one insurance company to reimburse another for 50 percent of the claimant's temporary total disability payments, where, in the unique circumstances of that case, either of two independent injuries caused temporary total disability, and thus the commissioner had the authority to order either insurer to make 100\n   percent of the disability payments. The court reasoned that it could \"think of no logical reason why, if the commissioner was authorized under the literal language of the relapse statute\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   to order either of the insurance carriers to make 100 percent of the claimant's temporary total disability payments, he would not also be authorized to order each of the insurance carriers to make, in effect, only 50 percent of such payments.\" (Footnote added.)\n   Id., at 44,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20A.3d%201210\">\n    114 A.3d 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After reviewing each of the ways the commissioner could have resolved the insurance carriers' dispute about their concurrent responsibility, the court concluded that the commissioner's decision \"was a necessary and reasonable interim compromise ....\" Id., at 44-45,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20A.3d%201210\">\n    114 A.3d 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although there was no statutory authority precisely on point for the commissioner's decision, the court held that General Statutes \u00a7 31-278 granted commissioners the powers necessary to perform the duties imposed by law and noted that agencies have implied powers reasonably necessary to carry out powers expressly granted, because the legislature cannot possibly foresee all of the problems and circumstances that may arise in the implementation of the law. Id., at 44,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20A.3d%201210\">\n    114 A.3d 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because the commissioner has the authority to approve attorney's fees regardless of source, it follows that she may decide to allocate the fees between successive counsel according to their actions and involvement in the underlying matter. The commissioner generally is in the best position to evaluate the relative contributions of counsel to the ultimate result, and resolution by the commissioner is likely to be more efficient than a second court proceeding, which likely would subject all parties and attorneys to additional time and aggravation. If the commissioner has the authority to determine that an attorney is not entitled to the full 20 percent, the maximum amount allowed by the guidelines, then\n   it is within the reasonable exercise of that statutory authority for the commissioner to decide that more than one attorney that has performed work on the matter is entitled to some portion of the fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Therefore, we hold that \u00a7 31-327 (b) grants the commission the authority to adjudicate fee disputes between successive counsel concerning their representations of a claimant before the commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Having held that the commission had the statutory authority to decide the issue of the division of the attorney's fees, we briefly address Vaccaro's constitutional claim that his right to a jury trial was violated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The General Assembly enacted the Workmen's Compensation Act in 1913. Two years later, our Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hotel Bond Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1626864\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/89/143/#p146\">\n    89 Conn. 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 146,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20A.%20245\">\n    93 A. 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1915), that the legislature had the power to eliminate traditional tort actions by employees against their employers in return for the relative speed and certainty of the administrative action. The Supreme Court more recently reiterated that the provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act stating that a claim to the commission is the exclusive remedy of a worker against his employer do not violate the constitutional right to redress in the courts; access to the commission is a \"reasonable alternative\" to a common-law cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Mello\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Big Y Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"913288\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/265/21/#p31\">\n    265 Conn. 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31-35,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=826%20A.2d%201117\">\n    826 A.2d 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Once the constitutional validity of the express statutory powers of the commission is recognized, it follows that exercise of its implied powers necessarily\n   passes constitutional muster.
