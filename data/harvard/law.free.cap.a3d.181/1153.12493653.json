Here, however, the orders in question do not affirmatively or negatively declare rights and duties. Rather, in those orders, the Commonwealth Court determined that certain of Appellant's requests for relief exceed the scope of a previous remand order issued by this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinions and Orders dated Jan. 8, 2018, in\n   <em>\n    Pa.

There is no indication, in the Commonwealth Court's orders or in Appellant's jurisdictional statement, of a determination on the merits or that relief on Appellant's claims is otherwise foreclosed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
