By the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>agreement, the parties entered into the grist-mill and kindling-wood business in the city of Newark. Smalley, who was the capitalist, agreed to invest in the undertaking an amount not less than $10,000, and as much more as would be sufficient to secure a working capital of $5000 over and above the cost of the improvements necessary to conduct the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Smalley also agreed to employ Hill in the business, and to pay him $200 per month, together with such sum as would make his total compensation equal to fifty per cent, of the net profits. The following items were to be considered among the expenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">1. Hill\u2019s salary of $2400 per year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">2. A similar sum of $2400 to be drawn by Smalley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">3. ' The rent of the wharf, at $1500 per year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">4. Interest at seven per cent, on the capital invested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">5. Necessary repairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">The business was to commence at once,, and to continue until April 1st, 1875, unless, at the expiration of eighteen months from October 1st, 1871, the business did not pay its own expenses, exclusive of the $2400 to be drawn by Smalley, in which event, Smalley was to have the right to close said business from and after that time. On the 8th of August, 1872, Smalley terminated the agreement by discharging Plill from his employment, which is the breach alleged in the declaration. The damages claimed and recovered, were the plaintiff\u2019s wages and the supposed profits which might have accrued to the plaintiff, if the service had continued. On the trial of the cause, the plaintiff obtained a verdict for $4500.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">By a balance sheet prepared by the plaintiff himself, August 8th, 1872, and offered in evidence in the cause,, the assets of the concern consisted of the following items:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-13\">Cash................................................. $774 24</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-14\">Wood on hand...................................... 1236 33</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-15\">Implements, at cost.............................. 309 18</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-16\">Furniture, at cost................................... 255. 92</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-17\">Barrels ............................................... 67 13</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Teams, at cost...................................... $1493 45</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">Collectable accounts............................... 870 58</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">Entire assets...................................... $5006 83</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">Debts...... .................................. 9988 43</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">Loss to August 8th, 1872 ..................... $4981 60</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">If to this is added interest on the capital invested by'Smalley, and the depreciation in value of the implements, furniture, and teams, it appears that when the plaintiff was discharged, more than $5000 had been lost in the business. The defendant had engaged to furnish only $5000 for working capital, and was, therefore, under no obligation to provide more when that was exhausted ; nor was he holden by any provision of the contract to pledge his \u00bfcredit, after the loss of the $5000. It would be a very unreasonable interpretation of the agreement to require the defendant to continue the business after the entire capital was lost. I think he had a right to withdraw from it as he did, subject to his absolute and unconditional liability to employ Hill until April 1st, 1873. The plaintiff\u2019s right to wages under that employment was clearly and accurately stated by the court at the trial below. In estimating the loss of the entire working capital, Hill\u2019s wages, during the time the improvements necessary to conduct the business were being made, were added to the expenses, but so the contract is written, and the parties must stand upon it. The business was to commence, not when the improvements were completed, but on the 28th of September, 1871, and in computing the loss the only item of expense to be excluded was the $2400 reserved to Smalley.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">The rule to show cause should be made absolute and a new trial granted, unless the plaintiff elects to let the verdict stand for a sum sufficient to cover his stipulated wages from the time of his dismissal by defendant, until April 1st, 1873. If counsel cannot agree upon the amount the court will settle it.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">The Chief Justice and Justices Scuddeb and Woodhull concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
