On <em>demurrer </em>to the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-10\">This action is brought against the defendants, as heirs and \u2022devisees of Samuel Meeker, deceased, under the act entitled, <em>'\u201cAn act for the relief of creditors against heirs and devisees,\u201d </em>passed March 7th, 1797, <em>(Nix.

Halsted (one of the \u2022defendants herein,) then the wife of Oliver S. Halsted, Jr., .a prior owner of the premises, which inchoate right of dower having become complete, by the death of said Oliver S. Hal.sted, Jr., in July, 1871, the said Martha A. Halsted, in an .action of dower, <em>unde nihil habet, </em>commenced in this court, .against the present plaintiffs, recovered, on the 25th day of February, 1873, her seizin of the one-third part of said premises (which was duly delivered to her by the sheriff,) and the .sum of $1366.46, for her damages and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-12\">Four of the defendants, viz.: John H. Meeker, Samuel A. Meeker., Charles H. Meeker, and the said Martha A. Halsted, are .children and heirs of said Samuel Meeker, deceased. All .the defendants are his devisees, excepting two, who are husbands respectively of two of the devisees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-13\">The defendants, who are heirs-at-law, have filed <em>demurrers </em>.to the declaration, and the plaintiffs have filed <em>&amp; joinder.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>For the demurrants, <em>L.

Meeker and others, heirs and devisees of Samuel Meeker, deceased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-6\">The demurrer is for John H., Samuel A. and Charles II. Meeker.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-7\">The action is founded on the statute entitled, \u201cAn act for the relief of creditors against heirs and devisees.\u201d <em>Nix. Dig. </em>380.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-8\">The question here is not whether the devisees are liable, but whether they are liable in this form of action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-9\">\u2018Will covenant lie against the devisees? If so, it must be by force of the statute, because the covenant sued on \u201cis for his heirs, executors and assigns,\u201d not for his <em>devisees.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-10\">By the statute of <em>3d. W. &amp; M. C. </em>14, <em>Chitty's Stat., Vol. I, part II, p. </em>1128, <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Morton and others, </em>2 <em>Saund., p. </em>8, debt only would lie; see case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Knubley, </em>7 <em>East. </em>128. This wras in 1806, <em>Plasket, Executor of, &amp;c., </em>v. <em>Beeby, </em>4 <em>East. </em>485; <em>Farley </em>v. <em>Briant, </em>3 <em>A. &amp; E. </em>839; see <em>Rawle on Con. for Title </em>597.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-11\">The case of <em>Farley </em>v. <em>Briant, in </em>3 <em>A. &amp; E., </em>held that that this statute <em>applied only where </em>a <em>debt </em>in the ordinary sense of the word, existed between the parties in the lifetime of the debtor, and, therefore, that an action of debt did not lie against the heirs and devisees of a surety for breaches of covenant which did not occur in his lifetime, even though the damages upon the occurrence of such breach were liquidated so that in form they might be sued for in an action of debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-12\">See also the case of <em>Hunting </em>v. <em>Sheldrake and others, </em>9 <em>M. &amp; W. </em>256, as to the construction of this statute, and <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cresswell, </em>2 <em>Law Rep. </em>(Equity) 106. Afterward on appeal, same case, in 2 <em>Chancery Appeal Cases </em>112, was reversed, but on an other ground.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-13\">To remedy this defect, the statute of W. &amp; M. was afterward amended ; see notes to the case of <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>2 <em>Saund. </em>8. The recital is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201cFor the means that such creditors may be enabled to recover upon such bonds, covenants and other specialties, be it further enacted, that in cases before mentioned every such creditor shall and may have and maintain his, her and their action and actions of debt or covenant upon the said bonds, covenants and specialties against the heir and heirs-at-law of such obligor or obligors, <em>covenantor </em>and covenantors, and such <em>devisee </em>and devisees, or the. <em>devisee or devisees of such first mentioned </em>devisee <em>or devisees </em>jointly, by virtue of this act.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-5\">By this amendment the remedy was extended to actions of covenant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-6\">Our statute is substantially a copy of the statute of W. &amp; M. before the amendment by which that act was extended to actions of covenant; Chief Justice Ewing, in the case of <em>Hatfield </em>v. <em>Jaques, </em>5 <em>Halst. </em>264, says that the statute of William and Mary was adopted in the revision of our laws by Judge Paterson, in very nearly the words of the original.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-7\">It is clear that prior to the statute of W. &amp; M., neither debt nor covenant would lie against the devisee \u2014 the remedy against him was first given by that statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-8\">The first section of our statute provides when the heir shall be sued alone, and when the heir and devisee jointly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-9\">The 4th section provides that devisees made liable by this act shall be liable in the same manner as the heirs <em>by force of this act.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-10\">This language naturally suggests the inquiry \u2014 in what manner are the heirs made liable by-this act?</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-11\">The title of our act is \u201cAn act for the relief of creditors <em>against heirs and devisees, whether by simple contract or spe</em>cialty.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-12\">The 1st section says, \u201call and every <em>creditor </em>and <em>creditors </em>shall and may have his, her or their action against the heirs-at-law of any debtor.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-13\">And then the language of the 2d section, \u201cshall be liable to pay any <em>debt </em>of his, her or their creditor.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The statute only speaks of <em>creditor and </em>creditors, <em>debts and debtors.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-5\">This must mean existing creditors and existing debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-6\">At the death of Samuel Meeker, the covenantor, there was no debt due from him to the plaintiff \u2014 no such relation existed between them. This claim cannot therefore be considered a debt due from the covenantor within the meaning of our act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-7\">The statute only contemplates debts, strictly so called, and it does not extend to recovery of damages for breaches of covenant made by the testator or covenantor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-8\">But what is this suit for ? It is an action of covenant to recover damages for a breach of the ancestor\u2019s covenant to make a good title to the plaintiff. <em>Not </em>for a breach of the-ancestor\u2019s covenant to pay a sum of money which was due before his death, and part of the damages which plaintiff seeks to recover is the amount of the costs and expenses of defending an action of dower brought against plaintiff by Mrs. Halsted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-9\">It may be said that in the present case the damages for the breaches of covenant declared on are liquidated, and therefore in form may be sued for in action of debt. To which we answer \u2014 but they are not the less in substance damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-10\">We submit that our statute does not extend the remedy to actions of covenant against the devisee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-11\">For the plaintiffs, John <em>W. Taylor.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-12\">The question by the demurrers, is simply\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-13\"><em>Whether or not the plaintifs\u2019 claim is a </em>debt, within the meaning of the act entitled \u201c An act for the relief of creditors against heirs and devisees.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-14\">The claim is for compensation for the breach of a <em>covenant </em>or contract, under seal, and is two fold; consisting of (1) liquidated damages, that is of $1366.46 adjudged against the plaintiffs for the value of the dower, to the date of the judgment, (February 25th, 1873,) and costs; and</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-15\">(2) Damages unliquidated, arising from the plaintiffs\u2019 disseizin or deprivation of one-third part of their premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>I.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-5\">As to the <em>liquidated </em>portion of the claim, it is submitted that there is no room for controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-6\">It is a <em>debt </em>in the strictest and most technical sense of the-term. That it forms a part of a claim, the residue of which is unliquidated, and is sued for with the latter, in an action of <em>covenant, </em>and not of debt, does not render or prove it any the less a <em>debt.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-7\">It is too familiar and elementary learning, to be questioned or to need citation of authority for its support, that a debt or sum of money <em>covenanted </em>to be paid, may be recovered in an action of <em>covenant, </em>as well as of debt; and if <em>covenanted </em>to be paid by <em>instalments, </em>it is recoverable only in an action of covenant; although the judgment is, in <em>form, </em>for <em>damages.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-8\">So on a parol promise to pay money, (as on a promissory note,) the promisor may be sued in assumpsit, as well as in debt, and when in assumpsit, the judgment is, in form, likewise for damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-9\">Our \u201cAct for the relief of creditors against heirs and devisees,\u201d (to be presently noticed more fully,) although following in the main, that of 3 <em>W. and M., C. </em>14, yet unlike that, it does not restrict the creditor\u2019s mode of relief to an action of debt, and therefore does not limit the species of debt to such as can be recovered only in that action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-10\">Inasmuch, then, as a part, at least of the claim, is a liquidated sum \u2014 a <em>debt </em>\u2014 the demurrers should be overruled, being to the whole declaration, or to the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover the claim, as a whole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-11\">II.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-12\">Rut the residue of the claim \u2014 the whole claim\u2014 is a <em>debt, </em>within the meaning of the act referred to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-13\">I. \u2014 IT IS A DEBT.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-14\">As to the meaning of the word\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-15\">' (1.) In its narrowest and most technical, (but by no means its only legal,) sense, it is defined to be \u2014 \u201cA sum of money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>due by certain and express agreement.\u201d 3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>154; <em>Burrill\u2019s Law Dict.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-5\">(2.) Its ordinary signification is shown by the following-authorities :</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-6\">\u201c Debt, (debitum, <em>debeo, </em>from <em>de </em>and <em>habeof) </em>anything had or held, of) or from another, his property or right, <em>Ms due; </em>that which is <em>owed </em>to him ; which ought, at some time, to be delivered or paid to <em>him.\u201d </em>\u2014 Richardson\u2019s <em>Dict.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-7\">\u201c That which one person owes to another, -whether it be money, goods, or services; something due; obligation;, due.\u201d\u2014 <em>Worcester\u2019s Dict.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-8\">\u201c That which is due from one person to another, whether-money, goods or services; that which one person is bound to pay to another, <em>or to perform for Ms </em>benefit; that of which payment is liable to be exacted ; due; obligation; liability.\u201d \u2014 \u25a0 <em>Webster\u2019s Dict.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-9\">(3.) It has a legal signification, much broader than the first, and less comprehensive than the second or popular one; as indicated and illustrated by the following- authorities :</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-10\">\u201cAll that is duo a man under any form of obligation or <em>promise.\u201d </em>\u2014 Bouvier\u2019s <em>Law Dict.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-11\"><em>\u201c </em>The word <em>\u2018 </em>debt \u2019 is of large import, including not only debts of record, or judgments, and debts by specialty, but also obligations arising under simple contract, to a very wide extent; and in its popular sense includes <em>all that is due to a man under any form of obligation or promise.\u201d </em>\u2014 Burrill\u2019s <em>Law Diet.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-12\"><em>\u201c </em>A. debt is not a contract, but the result of one. This seems the broadest definition of the word. It is in this sense that breaches of trust and <em>devastavits </em>are considered debts,, <em>and that a covenantee is a specialty creditor of the covenantor, </em>though the time for payment has not arrived, (and therefore before breach,) provided that it is sure to arrive; the debt in such case being \u2018 <em>debitum in preesenti, solvendum in futuro ;\u2019 </em>nay, the mere <em>contingency </em>of liability constitutes a debt; though it is not sufficient to support a creditor\u2019s suit, and this</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>latter class is known as that of contingent <em>debts.\u201d </em>\u2014 Troioer <em>on the Laws of Debtor and Creditor </em>1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-5\"><em>\u201c </em>A creditor, whose debt is secured by a covenant, is a creditor by specialty. <em>If a covenant is broken, though the damages are unliquidated, the covenantee is a specialty creditor.\u201d \u2014Ram on Assets, &amp;c., (2d ed.) </em>3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>creditor, whose debt was secured by covenant has been held to be a specialty creditor, where the covenant was by the lessor for the lessee\u2019s quiet enjoyment during the term ; by the grantor of an annuity, that he was seized in fee of the premises charged with it; and by the grantor in a marriage settlement that the premises settled were free from encum<em>brances.\u201d </em>\u2014 Ram <em>on Assets, &amp;c., (2d ed.) </em>4, 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-7\">In the case of <em>Frazer </em>v. <em>Tunis, </em>1 <em>Binney\u2019s R. </em>254, decided in 1808, <em>a claim against an 'intestate\u2019s estate for damages on account of the breach of articles of agreement under seal, was held to be a debt by specialty, within the meaning of a Pennsylvania statute, regulating the priority of debts against the estates of decedents.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-8\"><em>\u201c A </em>demand arising from covenant is of the same nature, whether it be for a specific sum, or whether it sound merely in damages.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-9\">See <em>Toller on Executors, (4th Am. ed.) </em>282; <em>Lovelass on Wills, &amp;c., (Phil. ed. </em>1839,) 139; <em>Wentworth on Executors, P. </em>284, <em>(Phil. ed. 1832); 2 Williams on Executors, (5th Am. ed.) </em>915; 3 <em>Redfield on Wills, (2d ed.) </em>278, \u00a7 13; see, also, <em>Plumer </em>v. <em>Marchant, </em>3 <em>Burr. </em>1380; <em>Fremoult </em>v. <em>Dedire, </em>1 <em>P.

The wife of a former owner of the premises in question, did not join in the conveyance which formed a link in the title which the ancestor of the defendants conveyed <em>to the </em>plain tiffs; and the declaration shows, that after the death of such ancestor, this wife, having become a widow, enforced her right and recovered her seizin of the third of the lands, besides certain costs of suit. The action is in the form of covenant, and the -question is, whether this kind of suit, for such a subject matter, will lie against heirs and devisees, by force of the statute of this state. The statute thus brought before the -court for construction, for the first time, is, that entitled <em>\u201c </em>An act for the relief of creditors against heirs and devisees,\u201d and is to be found in <em>Nix. Dig. </em>380.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">This statute is manifestly of a remedial character. By the common law, the land of a deceased debtor was not liable for his debts or obligations. A creditor could not follow the realty which consequently passed to the heir or devisee, unencumbered by the engagements of the deceased owner. Nor was there any personal responsibility for any such engagements on the part of the heir, unless the ancestor had executed an obligation by which he had specially bound his heirs, in which event, his descendant was liable to the extent of the -value of the lands which had descended to him and which -had not been aliened at the time of the commencement of 4he suit against him. But even the obligation of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>specialties did not extend to the devisees of the debtor. The consequence was, that by force of this system, the lands of a debtor passed to his devisees discharged from his debts, or if he died intestate, they went to his heirs similarly exonerated, unless for such debts as he had specially imposed on his heirs by his contracts, under seal. Such a system was defensible only on the policy of the feudal law, the tendency of which was to transmit the heritage unburthened, as the basis of its military organization ; but it was plainly inconsistent with the commercial spirit, which can favorably exist only when its engagements can be fully enforced at law, and the consequence was, that when traffic became the prevailing interest, the old law, in the particular just noticed, was found defective. Accordingly, the evil was attempted to be remedied by the act entitled \u201c An act for the relief of creditors against fraudulent devises,\u201d passed in the third year in the reign of <em>William and Mary, ch. </em>14, (A. <em>D. </em>1691.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The preamble of this statute, stating the object in view, recites that \u201c Whereas it is not reasonable or just that by the practice or contrivance of any debtors, their creditors should be deprived of their just debts <em>; </em>and nevertheless it hath often so happened that where several persons having, by bonds or other specialties, bound themselves and their heirs, and have afterwards died seized in fee simple of and in manors, messuages, lands, tenements and hereditaments, or had power or authority to dispose of or charge the same by their wills or testaments, have, to the defrauding of such their creditors, by their last wills or testaments, devised the same or disposed thereof in such manner as such creditors have lost their said debts; for remedying of which, &amp;c. The second section of this act is the important one on this occasion, and it is as follows: \u201cAnd for the means that such creditors may be enabled to recover their said debts, be it further enacted, &amp;c., that in the cases before mentioned, every such creditor shall and may have and maintain his, her, and their <em>action and actions of debt, </em>upon his, her and their said bonds and specialties against the heir and heirs-at-law of such obligor or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>obligors and such devisee and devisees jointly, by virtue of this act, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">From this recital, it will be perceived that it appears to have been the parliamentary intention to render the heirs and devisees liable to suit in all cases in which the debtor had bound himself and heirs \u201c by a bond or other specialty,\u201d but as the body of the act was couched in less extensive terms, a doubt was left if such design was carried into effect. This doubt was set at rest by the decision of the King\u2019s Bench in the leading case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Knubley, </em>7 <em>East. </em>128. The action in that case was covenant and rested on facts similar in substance to those stated in' the present declaration, and the residt reached by the court is thus summarized by the reporter in his syllabus that, \u201c an action of covenant does not lie upon the statute (3 <em>W. and M., ch. </em>14,) against the devisee of land to recover damages for a breach of covenant made by the devisor; but the remedy thereby given is confined to cases where <em>debt </em>lies.\u201d This exposition being approved in subsequent cases, the original imperfection of the English law in this respect remained, in a measure, unamended until the passage of a later statute, which extended the remedy of the creditor against heirs and devisees to cases arising out of breaches of contracts of a deceased obligor.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In this situation of the authorities, if the statute of this state was a mere counterpart of the act of William and Mary, I should not hesitate to follow the interpretation which was put, to the effect just expressed, upon this latter enactment. But these statutes are not identical. The act of this state, which was drawn by Judge Paterson, is characterised by the use of terms of much broader signification than those contained in its English antecedent, and, upon a careful consideration, it seems to me scarcely possible not to conclude that this marked alteration of phrase was designed to remove imperfections which were observed to deform the model; one of such imperfections being the restricted range which it gave to the creditor against the devisee. According to the judicial exposition of the English act, the creditor had no action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>against the devisee except for obligations which were enforceable by a suit in the form of debt, so th^t breaches of covenant for unliquidated damages were left without redress, as they were at common law, so far as related to a person taking land by a testamentary gift. But this result was the creature of the peculiar language of the act of William and Mary, the context being, in this respect, somewhat inconsistent with the preamble. The truth of this remark will be at once apparent by a perusal of the report of the case, already cited, of Wilson <em>v. </em>Kuubley. That suit was for breaches of a covenant against encumbrances, contained in a conveyance, the grantor being dead, and the defendant being his devisee. The point raised was, whether such action would lie by virtue of the statute, the counsel for the defendant contending that the remedial compass of the act did not embrace actions of that kind, which was covenant; while, on the other side it vas insisted that such form of proceeding was at least within the meaning and equity of the statute, if not within its words. Lord Ellen-borough, in giving his opinion, places the ground of decision in so clear a light that a short quotation will not be out of place. He says: \u201cI agree with the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the grievance recited in the preamble of the act would have led one to suppose that the legislature meant to have given a larger remedy than the action of debt. For it recites, &amp;c., and by section two it says, 'for the means that such creditors may be enabled to recover <em>their said debts, </em>that in the cases before mentioned every such creditors shall have their actions <em>of debt </em>upon the said bonds \u00e1nd specialties,\u2019 &amp;c. If it had only said that they should have their <em>actions </em>without more, then there would have been ground for going the length of the argument of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel; but the legislature have expressly limited the means of recovery by such creditors to actions of debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">From this extract it will be observed that the restriction of the creditor to a remedy in one form of action, that is to the action of debt, was the decisive circumstance on which this decision was rested. But for it Lord Ellenborough clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>intimates that the argument, derived from the gravamen complained of being within the mischief to be remedied, would have bent his judgment in the opposite direction. It is clear, therefore, that this precedent is not on the side of the defendant in the present action, when we come to the exposition of our own statutes, for in this important feature our act varies from that of William and Mary. In order to be intelligible it is necessary to recite the pertinent words of the statute of this state. This is its language: \u201cAll and every creditor and creditors, whether by simple contract or specialty, and whether the heirs are mentioned therein or not, shall and may, by virtue of this act, have and maintain his, her or <em>their action and actions </em>against the heir and heirs-at-law of any debtor who hath already died, or shall hereafter die intestate, seized of any messuages, lands, tenements or hereditaments, and against the heir and heirs-at-law, and devisee and devisees of snob debtor, in case such debtor made any last will and testament,\u201d <em>&amp;c.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Thus it appears that in our act the creditor is authorized, in broad terms, to bring his <em>action or actions </em>against the heirs and devisees; whereas, in the English act he is confined to an action of debt \u2014 a difference so material that, as we have seen, the restriction to a single form of remedy led to the English adjudication just quoted. When, therefore, it is now contended that, from some of the terms used in it, an inference is to be drawn that the law makers did not intend to make the heirs and devisees liable for <em>any </em>but the debts of the ancestor, this enlargement of the form of action is a strong argument against such view. If such a contracted interpretation should be deemed legitimate, but slight reason appears why, in this respect, the statutory phraseology was changed. With the suggested end to be accomplished, the language of the English act was quite apt. I think the change of the words evinces a change of intent. At all events, it seems to me to be beyond reasonable contention that the English adjudications, interpreting <em>the </em>statute of William and Mary, can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>have but little weight in any attempt to expound the act of this state, on account of their verbal differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The remaining argument of the counsel of the defendants has greater force. That argument is, that the act in terms gives nothing more than an action in favor of a <em>creditor </em>against the heirs and devisees of a <em>debtor; </em>and that by the use of these expressions, <em>debts, </em>strictly so called, are contemplated, and not damages for the breach of covenants. Undoubtedly, according to common usage, the terms in question have the meaning ascribed to them ; and in the construction of statutes, such common usage is mostly the criterion by which the sense of the language is to be ascertained. This is the common rule, founded in good sense, and it is a rule which, I think, should not be, on slight grounds, ignored or infringed. But like all other guides to statutory interpretation, the principle cannot have a universal application. When the intent of the law maker is entirely clear, in view of the purpose expressed in the general provisions of the law, a verbal expression here and there in the act will not stand in the way of the effectuation of such intent. And, therefore, when words used have a common meaning and also an uncommon meaning, and the former appears to run counter to the general scope of the law, and the latter is in harmony with it, it is the latter that will be adopted. And this is the canon of construction now applicable, for the terms here criticised have both a usual and unusual signification; the term creditor does not mean singly a person to whom a debt is due \u2014 that is but its usual meaning; but it further denotes a person to whom any obligation is due \u2014 and this is its unusual meaning. A creditor, according to the definition of Bouvier, <em>\u201c </em>is he who has a right to require the fulfilment of an obligation or contract.\u201d In this large sense it means more than the person to whom money is owing. Webster\u2019s explanation of the word is, <em>\u201c </em>A person to whom a sum of money or other thing is due by obligation, promise, or in law.\u201d This description has scope enough to embrace the duty where nonobservance constitutes the gravamen of the present suit. Also., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the words \u201c debt <em>\u201d </em>and \u201c debtor,\u201d have a similar amplitude of meaning. \u201cThe word \u00a3clebt/\u201d says Burrill, iu his law dictionary, \u201c is of large import, including not only debts of record or judgment, and debts by specialty, but also obligations arising under simple contract, to a very wide extent, and in its popular .sense includes all that is due to a man under any form of obligation or promise.\u201d And Sir Edward \u2022Coke, in commenting on the word <em>debitum, </em>in the statute of <em>Merton, eh. </em>5, says: \u201c Debitum signifieth not only debt, for which an action of debt doth lie, but here in this ancient act of parliament, it- signifieth generally any duty to be yielded or paid.\u201d The same extent of meaning is ascribed to this term by Chief Justice Tilghman, in <em>Frazer </em>v. <em>Tunis, </em>1 <em>Binney's Rep. </em>254; and the judgment in the receut case of <em>Bide </em>v. <em>Harrison, L. R., </em>17 <em>Eq. </em>76, is to the same effect, it \u2022being there held that a bequest of \u201c all and every sum or .sums of money due to me at my decease,\u201d included damages recovered in an action by the executor for a breach of covenant committed in the lifetime of the testator. The following .are likewise pertinent authorities : <em>Ram on Assets, (2d ed.) </em>3, 4, 5; <em>Toller on Executors </em>282; <em>Wentworth on Executors </em>284; 2 <em>Williams on Executors </em>915.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">It follows, then, that the words in question, in their largest sense, are comprehensive of the remedy claimed in the present suit. Whether they are to be held to have such comprehensiveness in their present use, depends on the inquiry into the intent, in this respect, of the law maker; and a knowledge of the state of the law at'the date of the act, is requisite to the formation of a correct judgment upon this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Previous to the passage of the colonial act making real \u2022estate subject to the lien of debts, lands in this state could not be sold under execution, but could only be extended upon an <em>.elegit. </em>That law was enacted December 2d, 1743, and appears in <em>Allinson\u2019s Laws </em>129. The preamble recites that it \u201c is highly reasonable and just \u201d that the real estate of every person should be subject to the payment of his debts; and the first section enacts, that such real estate <em>\u201c </em>shall be liable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>chargeable with all just debts, duties and demands of whatever nature or kind soever, owing by, or due from any such person, &amp;c., and shall be and are hereby made chattels for the satisfaction thereof, in like manner as personal estates within this province are seized, sold or disposed of for the satisfaction of debts.\u201d The effect of this act was to make lands liable to sale on a judgment against the executor or administrator, to the same extent as were goods of the decedent; and this act was in operation at the time that Judge Paterson, in his revision, undertook to remodel this branch of the system. What his design was, and what changes he effected, will appear, if we extend our view so as to embrace not only the act just referred to, and the one immediately under consideration, but also the act drawn by the same hand, and which is a part of the same general plan, entitled \u201c an act making lands liable to be sold for the payment of debts.\u201d <em>Pat. Laws </em>369. This last enactment, so far as relates to our present subject, declares, that lands shall not be sold or affected by virtue of any judgment against executors or administrators, and provides for the sale by the order of the Orphans Court of the decedent\u2019s lands, after the exhaustion of the personal estate. By force of these acts, therefore, the alteration made in the system was this ; the heirs and devisees were made liable to the extent of the value of the lands which devolved to them \u2022 or, the executor or administrator, if the goods failed, could resort to the lands through certain judicial action. Now, no one, I think, can consider the change thus wrought without being convinced that it was no part of the design of the reviser to suffer the lands of the decedent to escape any liability for his engagements which had before been imposed upon them. The provincial law, declaring that such a course was \u201chighly reasonable and just,\u201d had made lands \u201c liable to, and chargeable with all just debts, duties, and demands, &amp;c., owing by or due from\u201d the deceased owner;. and it is most improbable that it was the intention to take a retrograde step, and to follow the lands into the hands of the heir or devisee with only a -partial liability. I can see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>no indication of any such purpose. To subject the lands to the judgment against the executor or administrator, was a hardship to the heir or devisee, as they were not parties to such proceeding, and there was real danger that their interests might be impaired by collusive recoveries ; there was a reason, therefore, to do away with that procedure, but there was no reason to invade or mutilate that admitted rule of justice, that all the property, both real and personal, should be responsible for all the debtor\u2019s legal liabilities. And, accordingly, the idea of the reviser, as I read it, was, to change,, not .this salutary principle, but merely the form of carrying it into effect. Instead of the lands being made liable in the hands of the personal representative for all the <em>\u201c </em>debts, duties, and demands\u201d of the decedent, a personal liability to the extent of the value of such lands was put upon the parties taking by descent or. by purchase under the will. I am thus forced to reject the idea, that Judge Paterson intended to place a burthen on the heir or devisee only in favor of a certain class of creditors. The machinery of the law was changed, but the purpose remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">And this construction will stand further justified, if we note the departures of our act from the provisions of that of William and Mary. This latter enactment did not extend a remedy to the creditor against the lieir or devisee, unless the contract broken was in the form of a specialty, and unless an obligation was, in terms, imposed upon the heir. To the-contrary, our act embraces obligations created by simple contract, and \u201c whether the heirs are mentioned therein or not.\u201d This amplification of remedial efficacy is a strong exhibition of a desire to carry out the ancient colonial system of this-state, which blended the real and personal assets into a fund for the payment of the legal dues of the deceased owner, and which is a consistent part of the general plan embodied in the various enactments which have just been referred to. By giving, then, a broad signification to the words in question,, the spirit of this statute is subserved, and the evident policy, as manifested in other parts of our law, is forwarded and exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>cuted. A narrower interpretation of the statutory language would be out of harmony with the purview of this act, and of those cognate acts which, being in <em>pari </em>materia, are to be taken into consideration in any endeavor to construe it. Under such conditions, the-terms in question should not be given a prevailing force. <em>\u201c </em>When the expression in a statute is special or particular,\u201d says Chancellor Kent, 1 <em>Com. </em>462, \u201c but the reason is general, the expression should be deemed general.\u201d The rule thus defined, is applicable, in its full vigor, in the present instance. The remedy provided by this statute should not be so abridged by the ascription of a narrow meaning to the terms <em>\u201c </em>creditor\u201d and \u201c debtor,\u201d as to limit it to that class of contracts which call for the payment of specific sums of money, but, in furtherance of the general policy of our laws, and of the evident design of the act itself, should be extended in meaning so as to make it applicable to every obligation growing out of contract, which rested on the decedent at the time of his decease. The result, consequently is, that the plaintiff must have judgment in his favor on this demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
