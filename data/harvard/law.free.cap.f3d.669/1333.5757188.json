During discovery, the United States Court of Federal Claims compelled the government to turn over the audit tests and related information of non-party taxpayer entities similarly tested, to help assess the validity and reliability of the test\u2019s methodology. This court is asked to decide as a matter of first impression whether that discovery can be sustained in light of the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s general prohibition against disclosure of tax \u201creturn information.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6103(a), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(a). Because we hold that it cannot and that the court\u2019s order was a clear abuse of discretion, we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">A brief description of the excise tax on ODCs and the government\u2019s audit process relating to imports will be helpful in understanding the issue raised by this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-14\">Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons are chemical compounds often used as refrigerants, cleaners, solvents, sterilants, and propellants in the manufacture of insulation, fast food cartons, and electronic items. Their longevity and stability allow them to persist in the atmosphere long enough to rise into the stratosphere twelve to thirty miles above the earth. Once there, the ultraviolet radiation from the sun causes CFCs and halons to become unstable, break apart, and release chlorine atoms, which readily react with the earth\u2019s ozone layer.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-15\">To discourage further depletion of the ozone layer, I.R.C. \u00a7 4681(a)(2) imposes an excise tax on any product imported for consumption, use, or warehousing, which is sold or used in the United States and in which any ODCs were used as material in the manufacturing or production of the product. The total liability for the excise tax for imported taxable products is reported on a quarterly basis on IRS Form 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-16\">Manufacturers are allowed to self-determine the excise tax owed based on the weight of each ODC used as a material in the imported product and to submit as supporting proof a letter signed by the manufacturer that adequately identifies the product and states the weight of each ODC used as a material in the product\u2019s manufacture.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-17\">The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), however, found that many foreign manufacturers were not paying the tax and were instead submitting letters claiming to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>have never used ODCs or to have eliminated their use to avoid the costs of switching to non-ODC manufacturing processes. This led the IRS to contract with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), a federally funded research center, to develop a test to determine whether ODCs were being used in the manufacture of imported items and to assist the IRS in auditing reporting companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">To the extent relevant here, according to the \u201cOzone Depleting Chemicals (ODC) Excise Tax Audit Techniques Guide,\u201d available on the IRS\u2019s website,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after placing the electronic circuit board of an item being testing in a sterile environment, PNNL subjects it to various levels of heat. The gases released from the board at each temperature level are captured and analyzed in order to detect for the presence, although not the actual quantity, of ODCs in the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">The facts relevant to this petition are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">During the calendar quarters ending June 30, 2002 through December 31, 2004, Panasonic manufactured and imported for sale in the United States consumer telephones assembled in Tijuana, Mexico. Panasonic reported that it owed no excise tax and submitted a certified letter from its overseas manufacturers and suppliers stating that no ODCs were used in the manufacture of the phones.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">In 2005, the IRS audited Panasonic\u2019s imports. PNNL purchased Panasonic\u2019s phones from retail stores and tested the phones\u2019 circuit boards. After completing its audit, the IRS assessed Panasonic a total of $9,885,671.91 in excise taxes, penalties, and interest payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">Panasonic paid the ODC excise tax assessments for two alleged taxable transaetions for the quarterly tax period ending September 30, 2002, and for one alleged taxable transaction in each remaining quarterly tax period ending June 30, 2002 through December 31, 2004. It then filed a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims seeking a refund. Panasonic\u2019s complaint asserts that no ODCs were ever used in its manufacturing process, and that PNNL\u2019s testing procedures are scientifically invalid and unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">In preparation for a mini-trial on the validity and reliability of PNNL\u2019s testing procedures, Panasonic sought to discover information regarding PNNL\u2019s testing of commercial products during the IRS\u2019s audit of other taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">For instance, Panasonic\u2019s Interrogatory No. 6 reads in relevant part: \u201c[ijdentify all instances in which the IRS has used testing for ODCs as a basis to determine or consider whether excise taxes should be imposed on any taxpayer other than Panasonic ... [including] for each case ... the testing methodologies used, the results of the testing (i.e., whether ODCs were detected), the amount of the taxes assessed, [and] whether the assessment was appealed or contested!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-15\">After the United States refused to turn over the requested materials on confidentiality grounds, Panasonic sought and obtained from the Court of Federal Claims an order compelling discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-16\">The court held that, while the information sought was \u201creturn information\u201d as broadly defined under I.R.C. \u00a7 6103(a), and thus generally prohibited from disclosure by the IRS, it was nonetheless authorized to be disclosed in these proceedings under the enumerated exception provided in I.R.C. \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B). <em>Panasonic Commc\u2019ns Corp. of Am. v. United States, </em>99 Fed.Cl. 418, 420-22 (2011). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>That provision authorizes disclosure of tax information on a tax return in a judicial or administrative proceeding pertaining to tax administration \u201cif the treatment of an item reflected on such return is directly related to the resolution of an issue in the proeeeding[.]\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">The court determined that PNNL\u2019s testing activities relating to other taxpayers were \u201cderivatively part of the \u2018treatment\u2019 of ODC tax liability, which is the \u2018item\u2019 identified by Plaintiff and which is reflected on the taxpayer\u2019s return, whether as a specific line item or as part of the ovei'all tax liability reported.\u201d <em>Panasonic, </em>99 Fed.Cl. at 421. The coui\u2019t thex\u2019efore concluded that the infox-mation was subject to the \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B) exception. <em>Id. </em>The court also determined that PNNL\u2019s testing of other taxpayex-s\u2019 products met the \u201cdirectly related\u201d requirement of \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B) because Panasonic\u2019s discovery was \u201cdirected to the purpose of the mini-trial, that is, the validity of the scientific testing for ODCs employed by PNNL, not to a direct comparison of its excise tax assessment with that of other taxpayers\u201d <em>Id,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Before this court, the United States contends that the Court of Federal Claims improperly interpreted \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B) in compelling discovery, so as to require the IRS to turn over information it is statutorily required to keep confidential. Thus, the United States urges that this court issue a writ of mandamxxs directing the Court of Federal Claims to vacate its order compelling disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), this coux-t has authority to issue the requested writ as \u201cnecessary or appropriate in aid of\u2019 jurisdiction. The use of mandamus is limited to correcting a lower court\u2019s usurpation of judicial power or clear abuse of discretion. <em>Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>542 U.S. 367, 380, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004); <em>see also In re Regents of the Univ. of Cal., </em>101 F.3d 1386, 1387 (Fed.Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Notwithstanding the extraordinary nature of such relief, this court has issued the writ in appropriate cases to prevent the wrongful exposure of privileged or confidential communications. <em>See Regents, </em>101 F.3d at 1387; <em>see also Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 599, 601-02, 175 L.Ed.2d 458 (2009) (noting that an appellate court may grant a writ of mandamus to correct a \u201cparticularly injurious or novel privilege ruling\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">Thus, in <em>In re Seagate Technology, LLC, </em>497 F.3d 1360, 1367 (Fed.Cir.2007) (en banc), we explained that \u201c \u2018mandamus review may be granted of discovery orders that txxrn on claims of privilege or confidentiality when (1) there is raised an important issue of first impression, (2) the privilege would be lost if review were denied until final judgment, and (3) immediate resolution would avoid the development of doctrine that would undermine the privilege.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Regents, </em>101 F.3d at 1388).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">These criteria are met here. The tax law requires millions of individuals and business entities to furnish the IRS with highly confidential information. This information, as well as the documents that are created by the IRS in connection with it, is indispensable to the administration of the revenue laws. Recognizing that the effective operation of our tax system hinges on the willingness of taxpayers to provide such information, Congress has taken steps to guarantee that confidentiality. Section 6103(a) of the Code prohibits the IRS from disclosing tax \u201creturns\u201d and tax \u201creturn information\u201d except in specifically enumerated circumstances, a prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>which is enforced by civil and criminal penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Not only is the issue of the scope of the \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B) exception vital to matters of taxpayer confidentiality and proper tax administration but it also is a matter of first impression for this or any court of appeals, and one that has created a split within the United States Court of Federal Claims. <em>Compare Panasonic, </em>99 Fed.Cl. at 421-22 (holding the disclosure requirements satisfied if the item is directly related to the purpose of discovery), <em>and Shell Petroleum, Inc. v. United States, </em>47 Fed.Cl. 812, 817-19 (2000) (using the Federal Rules of Evidence \u201cas a helpful guide\u201d to broadly construe \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B) to allow discovery of tax treatment of similarly situated third parties), <em>with Vons Cos., Inc. v. United States, </em>51 Fed.Cl. 1 (2001) (relying exclusively on legislative history to narrowly construe \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B) to deny discovery for similarly situated third parties). Hearing the issue will thus bring needed uniformity to this area of the law. Further, absent our immediate review, the protection afforded against disclosure by \u00a7 6103(a) will be lost in this case. We therefore proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">The government contends that the Court of Federal Claims was without authority to compel disclosure of confidential taxpayer information in the form of PNNL\u2019s testing results and related information because of the general prohibition of \u00a7 6103(a). The government also contends that the exception in \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B) is inapplicable. Our analysis of the language, structure, and legislative history of these provisions leads us to agree with the government that the decision of the Court of Federal Claims requiring disclosure of this private taxpayer information was a clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">Insofar as relevant here, the Internal Revenue Code obligates the government to keep confidential and not disclose \u201creturns and return information.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 6103(h)(4)(B), however, provides an exception to non-disclosure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-11\">A return or return information may be disclosed in a Federal or State judicial or administrative proceeding pertaining to tax administration, but only ...\u2014(B) if the treatment of an item reflected on such return is directly related to the resolution of an issue in the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atb\">I.R.C. \u00a7 6103(h)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">As detailed in its motions papers below and reiterated here, Panasonic rests its claim for disclosure on the argument that the \u201c \u2018item\u2019 reflected on a return is the ODC excise tax liability and the \u2018treatment\u2019 of that item with respect to third party taxpayers\u2014that is, the testing of those taxpayers\u2019 products.\u201d Panasonic also argues that this \u201citem\u201d is \u201cdirectly related to\u201d the issue of PNNL\u2019s testing methodology at issue in the mini-trial. Panasonic\u2019s argument suffers from at least three fatal flaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">First, we reject Panasonic\u2019s argument that the \u201cdirectly related\u201d requirement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>met here. As with any statutory construction, the starting point of our analysis is the language of the statute itself; here, \u201cdirectly related.\u201d <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 144, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). We find that \u201cdirectly related,\u201d as used in the statute, is ambiguous on its face; we therefore resort to legislative history to clarify its meaning. <em>See Church of Scientology of Cal. v. I.R.S., </em>484 U.S. 9, 16-17, 108 S.Ct. 271, 98 L.Ed.2d 228 (1987) (relying on legislative history to construe section 6103(a)); <em>Vons Cos., Inc., </em>51 Fed.Cl. at 16 (relying on legislative history to determine the meaning of \u201cdirectly related\u201d); <em>Shell Petroleum, Inc., </em>47 Fed.Cl. at 817 (same); <em>see also Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc. v. Nigh, </em>543 U.S. 50, 62, 125 S.Ct. 460, 160 L.Ed.2d 389 (2004) (resorting to legislative history to resolve an ambiguity in statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">The legislative history describes \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B)\u2019s \u201cdirectly related\u201d requirement by contrasting it to \u00a7 6103(h)(2)(B), which allows disclosure to the Department of Justice if \u201cthe treatment of an item reflected on such return <em>is or may be related to </em>the resolution of an issue in the proceeding or investigation.\u201d (emphasis added). The legislative history pertaining to \u00a7 6103(h)(2)(B) articulates an \u201citem test\u201d for determining whether a third party\u2019s treatment of an item meets the \u201cis or maybe related\u201d requirement. The \u201citem test\u201d allows disclosure where \u201cthe treatment of an item reflected on [the third party\u2019s] return is or may be relevant to the resolution of an issue of the taxpayer\u2019s liability under the Code.\u201d S.Rep. No. 94-938, at 325 (1976), 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3438, 3754; H.R.Rep. No. 94-1515, at 477 (1976), 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4117, 4182 (Conf.Rep.).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">According to the Senate Report, the \u201citem test\u201d is satisfied in instances where, for example, the treatment of an item on the return of a pass-through entity, such as a subchapter S corporation, partnership, or trust, is relevant to the resolution of the taxpayer\u2019s liability because of the relationship between the taxpayer (as shareholder, partner, or beneficiary) and the third party. S.Rep. No. 94-938, at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Both the Senate report and House Conference report build on this test to describe the scope of \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B)\u2019s \u201cdirectly related\u201d language, explaining that \u201c[t]he disclosure of a third party return in a tax proceeding will be subject to the same item ... test described above, except that such items ... must have <em>a direct relationship </em>to the resolution of an issue of the taxpayer\u2019s liability.\u201d S.Rep. No. 94-938, at 326, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3438 at 3755; H.R.Rep. No. 94-1515, at 478, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4117 at 4182 (emphasis added). By using \u201cdirectly\u201d to modify the \u201crelated to\u201d language in \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B), Congress intended an even narrower exception to apply for disclosure to members of the public in judicial proceedings, such as in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Therefore, scenarios that do not satisfy the item test under \u00a7 6103(h)(2)(B) would never satisfy the narrower standard required by the \u201cdirectly related\u201d language of \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B). The Senate report provides the following example of a situation that does not meet the item test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-9\">The return reflecting the compensation paid to an individual by an employer other than the taxpayer whose liability is at issue would not meet ... the item ... test[ ] described above in a reasonable compensation case. Thus, for example, the reflection on a corporate return of the compensation paid its president would not represent an item the treatment of which was relevant to the liability on an unrelated corporation with respect to the deduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>tion it claims for the salary it paid its president.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">S.Rep. No. 94-938, at 325, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3438 at 3755. This example, as well as others in the legislative history,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> makes clear that the treatment of an item on a third party\u2019s return is not related, never mind directly related, to the resolution of a taxpayer\u2019s issue when the only link between the third party and taxpayer is the same tax treatment for a similar item of liability, income, deduction, or credit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Vons Cos., Inc., </em>51 Fed.Cl. at 17. This is the exact \u201ctreatment\u201d identified by Panasonic here; the only link between the third parties that Panasonic seeks return information from and itself is the treatment of ODC tax liability, and therefore the information is not directly related.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> What is more, as <em>Vons Cos., Inc. </em>pointed out, \u201c[t]o release return information in such circumstances would fly in the face not only of the specific legislative purpose underlying section 6103(h)(4)(B), but also the broader legislative history of section 6103(a), which repeatedly emphasizes the vital importance to tax administration of maintaining the privacy of tax returns and return information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">Second, Panasonic arrives at its erroneous understanding of \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B) by failing to give effect to every clause and word in the statute. We read the words \u201cin tax statutes ... in their ordinary and natural sense.\u201d <em>Helvering v. San Joaquin Fruit &amp; Inv. Co., </em>297 U.S. 496, 499, 56 S.Ct. 569, 80 L.Ed. 824 (1936). In its ordinary and natural usage, \u201creflected\u201d means \u201cmanifest\u201d or \u201capparent,\u201d Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary 989 (9th ed.1984). PNNL\u2019s testing results and related information, however, did not exist until after the third party taxpayers filed their tax forms, and thus could not be \u201creflected\u201d on such filings within the ordinary usage of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-13\">Panasonic is thus left to focus on the IRS\u2019s \u201ctreatment\u201d of an item during the audit process. It would have made no sense, however, for Congress to condition disclosure based on the IRS\u2019s \u201ctreatment\u201d of an \u201citem\u201d as \u201creflected\u201d on a \u201creturn,\u201d for the IRS does not submit a return from which the treatment of an item is reflected. If, on the other hand, \u201ctreatment\u201d covers the taxpayer\u2019s handling of an item on a return, the phrase \u201creflected on such return\u201d is properly understood as referring to what is shown on the face of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>return submitted by the taxpayer whose \u201creturn or return information\u201d is being sought, thereby giving each part of the statute a role. <em>See United States v. Menasche, </em>348 U.S. 528, 538-539, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955) (\u201cIt is our duty \u2018to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Montclair v. Ramsdell, </em>107 U.S. 147, 152, 2 S.Ct. 391, 27 L.Ed. 431 (1883))).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Third, nothing in the language of the statute indicates, or even suggests, that Congress intended for the courts to focus on the relevance of the \u201creturn information\u201d sought to the issue in the proceeding (as opposed to the relevance of the treatment of the item on the return being sought to the issue in the proceeding). Nonetheless, Panasonic\u2019s argument is premised on this flawed assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">When Congress intended to permit disclosure of information based on relevance of the information sought to an event or issue, it said so clearly and unequivocally. The very next subsection of the statute, for example, provides for disclosure \u201cif such return or return information directly relates to a transactional relationship between a person who is a party to the proceeding and the taxpayer which directly affects the resolution of an issue in the proceeding.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(C). The lack of similar language in \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B), which Congress presumably would have included had it intended for disclosure based on the relevance of the information sought, is strong evidence that the exception the trial court relied upon for disclosure does not authorize such action. <em>See Bates v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 23, 29-30, 118 S.Ct. 285, 139 L.Ed.2d 215 (1997) (\u201c \u2018[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Russello v. United States, </em>464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983))).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">In view of the lack of anything in the language or history of these provisions that even suggests, let alone establishes, that Congress intended to authorize disclosure of information such as the information sought in this case, we hold that the Court of Federal Claims clearly erred as a matter of law in compelling discovery.

Section 6103(b)(1) defines \"return\u201d to mean \"any tax or information return, declaration of estimated tax, or claim for refund required by, or provided for or permitted under, the provisions of this title which is filed with the Secretary by, on behalf of, or with respect to any person, and any amendment or supplement thereto, including supporting schedules, attachments, or lists which are supplemental to, or part of, the return so filed.\u201d Section 6103(b)(2) broadly defines \"return information\u201d to include \"data, received by, recorded by, prepared by, furnished to, or collected by the Secretary with respect to a return or with respect to the determination of the existence, or possible existence, of liability (or the amount thereof) of any person under this title for tax, penalty, interest, fine, forfeiture, or other imposition, or offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b832-9\">. The Senate report also explains that \"[i]n section 482 cases (involving the reallocation of profits and losses among related companies), where it is sometimes necessaiy to determine the prices paid for certain services and products at arms-length between unrelated companies, the return or return information of a company which was unrelated to the taxpayer company would not be disclosable under either the item or transaction tests described above.\u201d S.Rep.

Accepting a broader reading of \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B) that would allow such scenarios to warrant disclosure would essentially rewrite the statute so that, contrary to Congress's intent, the release of third party taxpayer information would be the norm rather than the exception. <em>See Vons Cos., Inc., </em>51 Fed.Cl. at 17 (reasoning that broadly construing this section \"would be tantamount to rewriting the statute, deleting, at the very least, the word \u2018directly\u2019 and, perhaps the word 'related,' as well\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b832-15\">. That the evidence Panasonic seeks is not \"directly related\u201d under \u00a7 6103(h)(4)(B), does not imply that it is not relevant under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The legislative history makes clear that the two are not coextensive; the \"directly related\u201d requirement is far narrower and different than evaluating whether evidence is relevant. Thus, to the extent that <em>Shell Petroleum </em>suggests that \"the Federal Rules of Evidence serves as a helpful guide in understanding the meaning of the phrase, 'directly related,.\u2019 \u201d 47 Fed.Cl. at 819, it is incorrect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
