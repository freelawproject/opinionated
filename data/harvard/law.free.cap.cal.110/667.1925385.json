This property consisted of \u201call of the goods in and owned by me in my place of business in the town of Azuza\u201d\u2014a retail liquor saloon.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">\u201cAs a further and separate agreement between the parties,\u201d Beaslin agreed to deposit with the firm of Laventhal &amp; Sons (defendants herein) three hundred dollars, \u201cto be paid to the party of the first part upon the procurement of the right to sell and carry on the business at the place above named; that is, the retail or liquor business within the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">Beaslin deposited the money with Laventhal &amp; Sons, who hold it. Brown assigned his interest and rights \u201cas per agreement\u201d to Kiefer; Kiefer, after demand upon Laventhal &amp; Sons, commenced this action to obtain the three hundred dollars, making Tappeiner, who claimed by assignment from Beaslin, one of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">The complaint nowhere avers that Beaslin procured the right to carry on the business of retail liquor dealer, or that he could carry on the business without procure- \u2022 ment of a right (presumably a license), or that by his own neglect or default he had failed to secure the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>These averments lay at the foundation of plaintiff\u2019s right of action, and should have been alleged in one or another of the modes indicated. <em>(Lower </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>7 Cow. 263.)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">From the agreement alone it may reasonably be inferred that Beaslin paid Brown sixty dollars for such personal property as Brown owned in the saloon, agreeing to pay him three hundred dollars more when and if he obtained a license to conduct the business. If he succeeded, his liability to pay was complete. If he failed, then he owned the property for which he had paid sixty dollars, and the transaction was at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Judgment affirmed,</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">McFarland, J., and Temple, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
