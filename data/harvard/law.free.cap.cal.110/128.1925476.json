If it attempts to do so it is unconstitutional, being special in its nature. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCreery, </em>34 Cal. 432; <em>Savings &amp; Loan Society </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>46 Cal. 416; <em>People </em>v. <em>Reis, </em>76 Cal. 269, 276; <em>Desmond </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>55 Cal. 251; <em>Darcy </em>v. <em>San Jose, </em>104 Cal. 642; <em>Bruch </em>v. <em>Colombet, </em>104 Cal. 351; <em>Thomason </em>v. <em>Ashworth, </em>73 Cal. 79.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>Harry T.

Assuming, but not deciding, that this court could control l\u00e9gislative action of the board of supervisors, as prayed for in this proceeding, the writ must be denied, because under present statutory law the board of supervisors of the city and county of San Francisco have the power to fix the rate of taxation, and the mayor has no veto of their action in that matter.
