The failure of the court to find on the issues raised by the answer necessitates a reversal of the judgment. <em>(Billings </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>52 Cal. 661, 663; <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Canavan, </em>52 Cal. 417, 419; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>53 Cal. 687, 689; <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Kehl, </em>95 Cal. 606, 614.) The statements in the answer in reference to the obligations sued upon in the various counts of the complaint were not affirmative matter which was required to be affirmatively proved by the defendant, but were, in effect, merely denials of facts required to be proved by the plaintiff, in order to maintain his action. <em>(Bridges </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>13 Cal. 640-42; <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Fulton, </em>21 Cal. 430, 435, 436; <em>Landis </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>69 Cal. 83; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>52 Cal. 88; Angell on Limitations, 6th ed., secs. 235, 236; Wood on Limitations of Actions, 186, note 7; 2 Wharton on Evidence, 3d ed., sec. 1060.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-5\"><em>Francis A.

As the facts found support the judgment, the failure of the court to find on any issue not necessary to support the judgment cannot be considered on the appeal from the judgment. <em>(Southern Pac.

As to another of the obligations it is averred that respondent could have recovered the amount of it from one Vandagna, who signed it jointly with appellant, but that respondent never demanded payment of said Vandagna; that appellant has no knowledge of said obligation; \u201c and that if defendant\u2019s name is signed to said note he never received any consideration therefor, and denies the same or any part thereof.\u201d As to the third obligation it is averred that it <em>\u201c </em>was given with the understanding that Giovanne Vandagna was the person who had to pay said note,\u201d that he was able to pay it, and that respondent had not demanded payment of said Vandagna. There is also a general denial that the obligations were due or payable from appellant to respondent. And the only point made for a reversal is that the court did not find upon these averments in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The court found that each of these obligations\u2014called by court and counsel promissory notes\u2014was executed by appellant to respondent and delivered to him on the respective days alleged in the complaint; that they were executed in consideration of a certain named sum of money, United States gold coin, \u201cloaned by plaintiff to defendant at the respective dates thereof,\u201d and <em>\u201c </em>that no part of the principal or interest due on said promissory notes has ever been paid, but that the whole thereof remains now due, owing, and unpaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Assuming that these matters set up in the answer constitute a defense at all, then if they were not affirmative matter, but merely denials, as counsel for appellant seems to regard them in his final brief, they are fully covered by the findings. But under any view of their character, as appellant introduced no evidence to support them, and as the findings \"are sufficient to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>port the judgment, no finding in relation to them was necessary; for \u201ca failure to find upon some issue, a finding upon which would merely have the effect of invalidating a judgment fully supported by the findings made, will not be held ground for reversal, unless it is shown by statement or bill of exceptions that evidence was submitted in relation to such issue.\u201d <em>(Himmelman </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>84 Cal. 104.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Henshaw, J., and Temple, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
