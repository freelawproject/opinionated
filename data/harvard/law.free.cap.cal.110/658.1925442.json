(See 1 Brandt on Suretyship, 2d ed., sec. 92.) No strained construction -should be given to the obligation of sureties, but one which accords with a rational interpretation of the language of their agreements. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Breyfogle, </em>17 Cal. 509.) The principal has the right to do anything which <em>on </em>a fair construction of the contract was contemplated by the parties. The surety cannot complain unless some act is done which injures him. (5 Wait\u2019s Actions and Defenses, 193; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Addison, </em>5 Cranch C. C. 623; <em>Humphreys </em>v. <em>Crane, 5 </em>Cal. 173; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>30 Minn. 150; 44 Am. Rep. 187; Civ. Code, secs. 2336, 2809, 2819, 2840.) Where the great current of the evidence is against the findings of the court below, and the conviction that they are wrong cannot be escaped, the supreme court should not be deterred from setting them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>aside. <em>(Field </em>v. <em>Shorb, </em>99 Cal. 661.) Sureties are es-topped to deny the facts recited in the obligation signed by them, and this whether the recitals are true or falso in fact. (1 Brandt on Suretyship, sec. 42, et seq; <em>Tartar </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>3 Cal. 263; <em>McMillan </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>18 Cal. 339; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Fargo, </em>57 Cal. 157; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Burrus, </em>23 Miss. 550; 57 Am. Dec. 154; <em>Kiessig </em>v. <em>Allspaugh, </em>91 Cal. 234.) The decree should have been at least for the amount of the money loaned as evidenced by the promissory note. Where the contract is for the conduct of the principal in two distinct employments, an alteration in one does not discharge the surety as to the other. <em>(Skillett </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>L.

(24 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law, 722.) Where an original contract is made the basis of contract of suretyship, any alteration whatever of the terms of the original contract will discharge the surety, even when such alteration is actually beneficial to him. (Civ. Code, secs. 2819, 2836, 2840; Baylies on Sureties, 260; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>9 Wheat. 680; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tillotson, </em>1 Paine, 305; <em>Ludlow </em>v. <em>Simond, </em>2 Caines Cas. 1; 2 Am.

H. 109; 53 Am. Dec. 234, and cases there cited.) The-recitals in the mortgage show that the lease is a part, of the mortgage, and, as both instruments were exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>cuted at the same time, they are to be read and construed together with regard to the recitals. <em>(Strong </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>11 Vt. 221; 34 Am. Dec. 684; <em>Howell v. Howell, 7 </em>Ired. 491; 47 Am. Dec. 335.). Recitals of indebtedness do not estop the party making them from disputing and disproving them. (Bigelow on Estoppels, 2d ed., 281, et seq., 438, et seq., 494, and cases there cited; <em>M\u2019Crea </em>v. <em>Purmort, </em>16 Wend. 460; 30 Am.

The recitals in a deed operate as an estoppel only where declarations of the grantor to the same effect, made at the time of the execution of the deed, would be evidence against him and those claiming under him. <em>(Joeckel </em>v. <em>Easton, </em>11 Mo. 118; 47 Am.

That is to say: \u201c When property of any kind is mortgaged or pledged by the owner to answer for the default or miscarriage of another person, such property occupies the position of a surety or guarantor, and anything which would discharge -an individual surety or guarantor who was personally liable will, under similar circumstances, discharge such property.\u201d (Brandt on Suretyship, sec. 34, et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">This action was commenced February 7, 1891, to recover from the White Eiver Lumber Company and W. D. Parson the sum of $650 and interest alleged to be due on said promissory note, and the further sum of $3,064 and interest alleged to be due on said written agreement, and also to foreclose the Hilton mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The defendants, White River Lumber Company and W. D. Parson, having failed to answer the complaint, a personal money judgment was rendered against them by default for the full amount demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\">The material substance of the very verbose separate answer of the defendant Hilton is that, without his consent, said written agreement was altered materially, after the execution of the mortgage, by a verbal agreement between plaintiff and the other defendants, at the instance and request of plaintiff; and that the agreement as written was never substantially performed on his part by the plaintiff. The alleged alterations of the contract consisted in substituting for the \u201c Gardner governor\u201d and the \u201c 11 foot x 16i- inch pulley, made in halves of suitable weight,\u201d an inferior, defective, unsafe governor, known as a <em>\u201c </em>Waters governor,\u201d and an inferior, defective pulley, smaller in size than that described in the written contract, and of insufficient weight. Besides the above, Hilton\u2019s answer contained a denial of the alleged indebtedness of the White River Lumber Company and Parson to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The court below found in favor of the defendant Hilton on all the issues of fact; and, as conclusions of law, found that the defendant Hilton and the mortgaged property had been exonerated and discharged' from all liability on the mortgage, and that the mortgage should be canceled of record; and thereupon judgment was rendered accordingly. From this judgment and from an order denying his motion for a new trial the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The identical written contract hereinabove set out was construed by this court in the case of <em>Parke etc. Co. </em>v. <em>White River Lumber Co., </em>101 Cal. 37, and held not to be a lease, but a sale, either absolute or conditional. Although that decision is not the law of this case, the law.announced therein is applicable to the construction of the contract, unless the construction may be aided and changed in this case by circumstances different from those appearing in that; but I perceive no difference affecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>construction of the contract. But the construction given in that case can be applied in this case only to the extent that the contract is not a lease, since that <em>decision </em>goes only to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\">By whatever name the contract may be properly designated, or however classified, it was wholly executory by both parties thereto, the promise of each party being the only consideration for the promise of the other; and the first act to be performed\u2014the delivery of the property described to the White River Lumber Company and Parson (miscalled lessees)\u2014was to be performed by the plaintiff. The defendant Hilton mortgaged his property to secure performance, on the part of the White River Lumber Company and Parson, of this contract, and not to secure their performance of any other or materially different contract. If, therefore, the contract was altered by the parties thereto in any material particular after the execution of Hilton\u2019s mortgage, without his consent, the mortgaged property was thereby exonerated from all liability as security. (Civ. Code, secs. 2819, 2844; Brandt on Suretyship, secs. 397, 399, and cases there cited, especially <em>Bragg </em>v. <em>Shain, </em>49 Cal. <em>131; Truckee Lodge </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>14 Nev. 293; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Corwine, 1 </em>Bond, 339.)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The court below found that the contract was materially altered as alleged in Hilton\u2019s answer, and without his consent, and this finding is justified by the evidence. The only conflict of the evidence applicable to this finding is found in that part of it relating to the question whether Hilton consented to the alteration; and, as to this, the conflict is substantial to a degree which pre'cludes this court from disturbing the finding on the ground that it is not justified by the evidence, even though it should seem from the transcript of the evidence that a preponderance thereof is against the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">It is contended by appellant, however, that respondent is estopped from denying the recital in the mortgage that the lumber company and Parson <em>\u201care </em>justly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number><em>indebted \u201d </em>to appellant in the sum of $3,064 as rent on machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\">But such is not the recital. It is recited in the mortgage that the White River Lumber Company and Parson are justly indebted to the Parke &amp; Lacy Company in the sum of $650 on a certain promissory note (setting out a copy of the note); \u201cand in the further sum of $3,064, agreed to be paid as rent by said White River Lumber Company and Warren D. Parson to said Parke <em>&amp; </em>Lacy Co. for the boiler, engine, and other machinery, in accordance with the lease this day executed, of which a copy is attached hereto and made a part hereof.\u201d The whole lease, as well as the note, must be read as a jpart of the recitals; and when so read will not estop Hilton from alleging that the lease was altered by the parties thereto without his consent after the execution of the mortgage, and that the covenants therein on the part of the plaintiff were never performed; and, consequently, that no indebtedness of the lumber company and Parson to plaintiff ever accrued \u201c <em>in accordance with the lease.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The lease, being the principal part of the recitals, shows that the indebtedness referred to did not exist at the date of the recital, and could be only such as might thereafter accrue in accordance with its terms. Therefore, the averments that the lease was afterward altered, and that no indebtedness ever accrued <em>in accordance with its original terms, </em>are nowise inconsistent with the recitals in the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">I conclude that, as to the alleged indebtedness of $3,064 founded upon the written agreement called a lease, a foreclosure of the Hilton mortgage was properly denied by the trial court. But I think the court erred in denying a foreclosure of the mortgage as a valid security for the payment of the. promissory note for the sum of $650, and the conventional interest thereon. That note is entirely distinct from the so-called lease, and there is no pretense that it has been altered in any respect. It appears that the consideration for it was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>loan by plaintiff of $650, and that no part of the principal or interest had been paid when judgment was rendered against the other defendants. \u201cWhere a surety is bound by one bond for the performance by the principal of two distinct things, and the contract is varied as to one of the things to be performed, the surety is discharged as to the matter concerning which the contract has been changed, but is not discharged from that as to which it has not been changed.\u201d (Brandt on Suretyship, sec. 398, and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">I think the cause should be remanded, with instruction to modify the judgment according to this opinion-</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Britt, C., and Searls, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">For the reasons stated in the foregoing opinion the cause is remanded and the court below is instructed to modify the judgment in accordance with said opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">McFarland, J., Henshaw, J., Temple, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
