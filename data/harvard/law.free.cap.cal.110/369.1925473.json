Where the offense is prohibited in general terms in one section of the statute, and another distinct section defines the offense more particularly, it is sufficient to follow the general description in the language of the statute. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>45 Me. 436; <em>Wat</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>son </em>v. <em>State, </em>39 Ohio St. 126; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shaber, </em>32 Cal. 36; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fuqua, </em>58 Cal. 245; <em>People </em>v. <em>Savercool, </em>81 Cal. 650; <em>People </em>v. <em>Congleton, </em>44 Cal. 92-94; <em>People </em>v. <em>King, </em>27 Cal. 511; 87 Am. Dec. 95; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>34 Cal. 201; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>96 U. S. 364.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b403-5\">McFarland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJE\">The appellant was convicted of the \u201c crime of giving a bribe,\u201d and appeals from the judgment and from an order denying a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The appellant demurred to the indictment upon the grounds that it does not substantially comply with the requirements of sections 950 and 952 of the Penal Code. His demurrer was overruled, and we think that the court erred in overruling it.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The indictment charges that the appellant did willfully, feloniously, etc., \u201c give a bribe\u201d to a certain member of the board of supervisors, with intent to corruptly influence him in a certain matter; but it does not contain any averment of any act of appellant which brings his alleged conduct within the legal meaning of bribery. The indictment would be the same if it had merely charged, generally, that defendant \u201c bribed \u201d a certain person to do a certain thing. This would be the averment of a legal conclusion only, and as bad as a mere general averment that a defendant \u201c murdered \u201d somebody or \u201c stole\u201d something.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Section 950 of the Penal Code provides that the indictment shall contain \u201c a statement of <em>the acts </em>constituting the offense in ordinary and concise language\u201d; and section 952 provides that \u201c it must be direct and certain as it regards, .... 3. The particular circumstances of the offense charged when they are necessary to constitute a complete offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Subdivision 6 of section 7 of the Penal Code provides as follows: \u201cThe word \u2018bribe\u2019 signifies anything of value or advantage, present or prospective, or any promise or undertaking to give any, asked, given, or accepted, with a corrupt intent to influence, unlawfully, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the person to whom it is given, in his action, vote, or opinion, in any public or official capacity\u201d; and section 165 provides that \u2022\u201c every person who gives or offers a. bribe\u201d to one of several officers named, with intent, etc., is punishable in a certain manner. And counsel for respondents contend that the indictment is good, because, as they say, \u201c it follows the language of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">This court has said several times, in general terms, that an indictment is sufficient if it substantially follows the language of the statute. This is true generally, but not universally. It is not true of a case where \u201c the particular circumstances .... are necessary to constitute a complete offense.\u201d The rule especially applies to-purely statutory offenses. But what does the rule mean? It means simply this: that when the statute defines or describes the acts which shall constitute a particular offense, it is sufficient in an indictment to describe-those acts in the language employed in the statute, applying them, of course, concretely to the person charged. One of the earliest cases on the subject is <em>People </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>6 Cal. 487. In that case the indictment was for perjury, and left out the word \u201c feloniously \u201d; and it was held good, because in the statutory definition of the crime of perjury the word \u201c feloniously \u201d was not used. In its opinion the court said: \u201c The indictment in this cause charged the offense in the words of the statute-<em>defining it; </em>.... time, place, and <em>circumstance </em>are stated with certainty, and every information is given to-the defendant which is <em>necessary to enable him to answer the charge.\u201d </em>There the words of the statute defining the offense were used in the indictment. <em>People </em>v. <em>Shaber, </em>32 Cal. 36, is another early case. There the court, in sustaining the indictment, said: \u201c The indictment charges the offense in the very terms used in <em>defining it </em>in the fifty-eighth section of the Crimes Act.\u201d And even in that case Sanderson, J., dissented, saying that it was a familiar principle in all pleadings that \u201cthe facts are to be stated to the exclusion of conclusions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>law to be drawn therefrom.\u201d And in the cases following these earlier ones it will be found that the rule declared on the subject is simply that an indictment is good if it alleges all the facts or acts necessary to constitute the particular offense charged in the language used by the legislature in defining it. For instance, the meaning of the rule is fully stated by Paterson, J., in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>88 Cal. 138, as follows: \u201cThe information follows the language of the statute, and is sufficient. It alleges <em>all the acts and facts which the legislature has said shall constitute the offense.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The only two cases cited where bribery was involved are <em>People </em>v. <em>Edson, </em>68 Cal. 549, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Markham, </em>64 Cal. 157; 49 Am. Rep. 700. In the Edson case the language of the indictment is not given, but the opinion refers to the Markham case as authority; and in the Markham case the indictment charged that the defendant, at a certain time and place, being a police officer, etc., did \u201cagree to receive a bribe, to wit, <em>fifteen standard dollars, lawful coin of the United States of America.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATq\">Therefore, assuming the general rule, as above explained, to be that it is sufficient to allege an offense in the language of the statute, the offense charged in the case at bar is not alleged in the language of the statute in the indictment under review. It does not allege \u201c the acts and facts which the legislature has said \u25a0shall constitute the offense.\u201d The material acts or facts \u2022constituting the legislative definition of bribery are the giving to a public officer something \u201cof value or advantage, present or prospective,\u201d or giving \u201c any promise \u201d or entering into any \u201c undertaking \u201d to give something of value or advantage. There is no averment that appellant gave the supervisor anything of value, or of advantage, or that he gave anything at all; or that the thing was of present or prospective advantage; or that it was a promise to do something, or an undertaking of some kind which was, or would be, beneficial to the supervisor. As said by counsel for appellant: \u201cThe defendant is not informed whether the people will prove that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>he gave money, a promise of employment, a promise of political influence, a contract, instruction, entertainment, or any other of the many things which might constitute a bribe.\u201d It is true that the rules of the common law, with respect to criminal pleading, have been greatly relaxed in this state by legislation and judicial decision, and many of the formalities and particularities formerly deemed necessary are not now required; but the fundamental rule that an indictment must state with reasonable certainty what the defendant is charged with, so as \u201c to enable him to answer the charge,\u201d has not been abrogated either by legislature or court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>107 Cal. 477.) An indictment for bribery should aver that the defendant gave something of value or advantage, present or prospective, or some promise or undertaking, or did some act, described by the statute as constituting the offense. A mere use of the language of section 165, which prescribes the punishment, is not charging the offense \u201c in the words of the statute defining it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The judgment and order appealed from are reversed and the cause is remanded, with instructions to sustain the demurrer to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Temple, J., and Henshaw, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
