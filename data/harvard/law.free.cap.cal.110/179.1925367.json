The court having found that the sales were made-out of the usual and ordinary course of business, such finding imports notice of insolvency to the purchaser,, and the court erred in failing to find as to whether the transfer was made by the insolvent in contemplation of insolvency to prevent his property from coming to his assignee in insolvency. (Wait on Fraudulent Conveyances, sec. 376; <em>Ohleyer </em>v. <em>Bunce, </em>65 Cal. 544; <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>Huntington, supra; Godfrey </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>80 Cal. 425.) The fact that the defendant paid a valuable consideration is immaterial, as the law requires good faith as well as a valuable consideration. <em>(Blennerhassett </em>v. Sherman, 105 U.

Knox, </em>90 Cal. 273; <em>Priest </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>100 Cal. 629.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b213-5\">Britt, C.</author>\n<p id=\"AFa\">Hull was a dealer in stationery and musical instruments. His voluntary petition in insolvency was filed June 16, 1893, and in due course plaintiff was chosen his assignee. At sundry times within three days next before said June 16th, Hull sold to defendant certain pianos and organs, and notes and other contracts previously taken by him in the course of business with his customers; the amount of the sales to defendant was thirteen hundred and eighty-five dollars, of which six hundred and fifty-six dollars was paid in cash, and <em>by </em>agreement the sum of seven hundred and twenty-nine dollars was to be subsequently paid in installments. Plaintiff brought this action to set aside such sales, alleging that the same were made to prevent the coming cf the property to the possession of the assignee, and its ratable distribution among Hull\u2019s creditors, and to defeat the objects of the Insolvent Act of 1880. The trial was by the court, which found that the defendant made his purchases in good faith, without the intent charged and for sufficient consideration; defendant had judgment accordingly. Appellant urges that the findings are unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The transfers in question were not made in the ordinary course of the business of Hull, and hence were <em>prima facie </em>fraudulent (Insolvent Act, sec. 55); there was also evidence of other circumstances tending to cast suspicion on them. But on behalf of defendant there was evidence which tended to show that he had no information of Hull\u2019s insolvent condition; that the prices paid and agreed to be paid were the full and fair value of the property he purchased; that he has offered to make to the assignee the payments deferred under his arrangements with Hull; and that his conduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>speaking generally, was not inspired by any fraudulent motive. The presumption of fraud was subject to rebuttal <em>(Bernheim </em>v. <em>Christal, </em>76 Cal. 567); and, though the evidence in some parts w\u00e1s sharply conflicting, yet there was sufficient, if believed, to rebut such presumption; what credence should be allowed to it was a matter for the trial court to determine.. These remarks apply as well to the choses in action assigned -to defendant as-to the pianos and organs, though appellant argues that the facts were so different regarding the former that as to them, at least, he should have had judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">It is also contended that in failing to find whether Hull entertained the fraudulent intent alleged in the complaint the court omitted to dispose of a material issue. But, since the findings exonerated the vendee of the charge of fraud, the intent of the vendor ceased to be of any consequence in the case; a transaction of this nature cannot be vacated because of the fraud of the seller in which the purchaser had no part, and of which he had no notice. <em>(Merchants\u2019 Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Northrup, </em>22 N. J. Eq. 58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Belcher, C., and Searls, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order appealed from are affirmed..</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">McFarland, J., Henshaw, J., Temple, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
