The defendant appeals from the judgment and from an order denying his motion for a new trial. Appellant contends: 1. That the findings of fact are not justified by the evidence; and 2. That the facts found do not warrant the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The only material controversy about the facts relates to the consideration for the first note. If there was a sufficient consideration for the joint note, the surrender thereof to defendant was undoubtedly a sufficient consideration for the individual note of the defendant upon which this action is founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">In order to establish a sufficient consideration for the first note it was only necessary, in addition to the admitted facts, to find, as the court did find, an affirmative answer to the following questions: Did Burns, before he received the money, promise the bank that he would cause defendant to sign the note? Did the bank advance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>\u25a0the money relying in good faith upon that promise, so that the agreement for the loan and the security therefor was not completely executed until after defendant signed the joint note? I think the evidence, direct and circumstantial, sensibly tended to prove, and therefore justified, these findings. As to the fraud and collusion charged, there is no evidence tending to prove them.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The facts of this case plainly and materially distinguish it from that of <em>Leverone </em>v. <em>Hildreth, </em>80 Cal. 139. In that case the note signed by the defendant had been completely executed by his father, and was two months overdue when defendant signed it, and there was no plausible pretense of any consideration moving to the defendant. By implication that case justifies the judgment in this. Speaking of the authorities cited by the respondent in that ease, the court, by the chief justice, said: \u201c They are to the effect that if the payee parts with his money on the faith of a promise by the borrower that he will procure the signature of a surety to his note, the surety is bound if he sign the note after the money is advanced; but such is not the case here.\u201d Such, however, is the case at bar. The authorities referred to by the chief justice, so far as reported, are <em>McNaught </em>v. <em>McClaughry, </em>42 N. Y. 22, 1 Am. Rep. 487, and <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>77 N. Y. 72. In the first of these cases the court said: <em>\u201c </em>The authorities are clear upon the two propositions involved in the question: 1. If Abram had given his note to the plaintiff, and the same had been accepted in performance of the contract without further condition, and the note was yet unmatured, the obtaining an additional indorser Avould have been a gratuitous act on the part of Abram, and the indorser would not be bound.....On the other hand, if Abram had originally agreed with the lender that he would obtain the new indorser, and had obtained the money upon the faith of that promise, then his finding the additional indorser was based upon a valid consideration, and the indorser was held by his signature. To this precise point is the case of <em>Moies </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>11 Mass. 436, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>6 Am. Dec. 179, recognized and affirmed in <em>Hawkes </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>7 Gray, 284; <em>Lovering </em>v. <em>Fogg, </em>18 Pick. 540; <em>Leonard </em>v. Wildes, 36 Me. 265. (See, also, <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Brinkerhoff, 2 </em>Hill, 663; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Rawson, 2 </em>Denio, 135.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AB\">I think the judgment and order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Searls, C., and Belcher, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Harrison, J., Garoutte, J., Van Fleet, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
