I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b807-19\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b807-20\">J. Chesney Carson, is an attorney who was formerly employed as an Assistant State Attorney in Florida\u2019s Sixth Judicial Circuit. He was hired for that job by James T. Russell, the Florida State Attorney in that Circuit. Carson began his employment in October, 1975. Approximately one year and two months later, his employment was terminated. He has not been given any reasons for his termination, nor has he been accorded an opportunity for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-21\">Plaintiff-appellant filed this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976) suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>deprivation of property without due process of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff based his due process claim on the letter which offered him employment. That letter provided that appellant would, barring unforseen circumstances, agree to serve as an Assistant State Attorney for a period of three years beyond a six-month probationary period. Appellant asserts that the letter constituted an objective expectation of continued employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-22\">Both parties moved for summary judgment. Upon recommendation of the United States Magistrate, the district court granted appellee\u2019s motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-23\">Appellant\u2019s employment status was a protected property interest only if he had an express or implied right to continued employment. <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 343, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976); <em>McElwee v. Todd, </em>581 F.2d 1182 (5th Cir. 1978). In order for his claim of continued employment to be designated a fourteenth amendment property interest, appellant must have more than a unilateral expeeta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>tion to that employment. \u201cHe must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). The sufficiency of a claim of entitlement must be decided by reference to state law. <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 344, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976); <em>United Steelworkers of America v. University of Alabama, </em>599 F.2d 56, 59 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Florida Statute \u00a7 27.181(2) provides that \u201c[e]ach assistant state attorney . shall serve during the pleasure of the state attorney appointing him.\u201d <em>See also Carrin v. State, </em>275 So.2d 603, 604 (Fla.App.1973) (assistant state attorney may be replaced without cause at the will or pleasure of the state attorney). Thus, the state statute confers no claim of entitlement to employment on the part of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Appellant contends, however, that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 27.181(2) does not negate a property interest allegedly created by the letter offering employment. While the letter does suggest a three-year employment commitment, it is conditioned by the phrase \u201cbarring unforeseen circumstances.\u201d This caveat offers so little constraint and is so ambiguous that, without more, it constitutes no discernible limitation on either party. It does not suggest a vested right in appellant to the position of Assistant State Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Thus, although appellant may have had a unilateral expectation of three years of employment, he has not demonstrated a legitimate claim of entitlement to it. Accordingly, the granting of appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-17\">. Appellant\u2019s complaint also asserted a deprivation of liberty without due process of law. The district court concluded that his dismissal did not deprive him of a protected liberty interest. Appellant does not attack this conclusion on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b807-18\">. Indeed, both parties have stipulated that the only claimed objective expectancy of continued employment by appellant is based upon the letter. The pertinent portion of the letter provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-26\">Upon acceptance of this offer, I assume that you will, barring unforeseen circumstances, agree to serve in the capacity of Assistant State Attorney for a period of three years, beyond the probationary period.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
