F. Cox, who is performing the duties of the office with the acquiescence of his associates and under claim of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Under the circumstances a writ of <em>mandamus </em>should not be issued because, in effect, it would require us to try the title to the office. The writ should not be granted until it has been established by judicial process that there is a vacancy to be filled. <em>(Kelly </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>69 Cal. 460 [11 Pac. 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
