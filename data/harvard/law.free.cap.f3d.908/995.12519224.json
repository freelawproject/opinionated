Recently, the Supreme Court held that \"[d]isgorgement, as it is applied in SEC enforcement proceedings, operates as a penalty under [ 28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2462.\"\n   <em>\n    Kokesh v.

In this criminal sentencing appeal, we must consider whether SEC civil disgorgement is now a criminal punishment after\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   . It is not, so we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   From 2008 to 2016, James H. Brennan and Douglas A. Dyer (collectively, \"Defendants\") owned and managed Broad Street Ventures, LLC (\"Broad Street\"). Brennan and Dyer had a claimed goal of using Broad Street to create and incorporate eight Tennessee corporations that would be known as Scenic City F-10, I-VIII (collectively, \"Scenic City\"). They induced investment in Scenic City by claiming that once Scenic City was appropriately capitalized, Brennan and Dyer would register the common stock of Scenic City with the SEC by filing a Form 10. They promised to publicly trade Scenic City and use Scenic City to acquire small private businesses. This process is known as a reverse merger and is legal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Investors sent Brennan and Dyer money by mail and electronic wire from locations outside of Tennessee. As money came in, however, Brennan and Dyer did not invest it into Scenic City. Instead, they moved the funds through Broad Street's bank accounts and diverted a significant portion of that money to their own personal bank accounts. To fool the investors, Brennan and Dyer issued stock certificates to create the perception that they had handled the investment funds appropriately. Brennan and Dyer mailed these stock certificates to the investors via the United States Postal Service. Yet Brennan and Dyer never filed a Form 10 with the SEC and never completed any reverse mergers. In total, the Government estimated that investors lost $4,942,070.18 in Brennan and Dyer's scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Brennan and Dyer reported the embezzled funds they received through Broad Street as long-term capital gains, which substantially reduced their personal tax liability each year by capping the tax rate at 15%. The embezzled funds should have been reported as ordinary income subject to a significantly higher tax rate. Brennan and Dyer also made payments to themselves from Broad Street that they treated as nontaxable distributions. These payments made up Brennan and Dyer's primary\n   source of income for the relevant years. In summary, Brennan and Dyer funneled the embezzled funds through Broad Street, paid out those funds to themselves as nontaxable distributions, and underreported their income to evade paying taxes on it. For the years 2010 through 2014, Dyer owed an additional $312,799 in taxes and Brennan owed an additional $164,542.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1. SEC Civil Case Begins\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 20, 2016, the SEC began a civil enforcement suit against Brennan and Dyer (the \"Civil Case\"). The SEC alleged that Brennan and Dyer had committed securities fraud in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2077\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (q)(a)(1), 77(q)(a)(2), 77(q)(a)(3), and 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5 ). Less than a week later, Brennan and Dyer consented to a preliminary injunction freezing their assets and enjoining further securities law violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Criminal Case Begins and Defendants Plead Guilty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nine months later, on April 10, 2017, the Government filed an information charging Defendants with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1341 and tax evasion in violation of 26 U.S.C \u00a7 7201 (the \"Criminal Case\"). Dyer was also charged with criminal contempt in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20401\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 3, 2017, Defendants pleaded guilty to the conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud and tax evasion charges. Dyer also pleaded guilty to the additional count of contempt of court. As part of their plea agreements, Brennan agreed to pay $184,022.84 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service, and Dyer agreed to pay $354,251.58. Brennan and Dyer stipulated that the amount of loss caused by their conduct was greater than $3,500,000 and waived any double jeopardy defenses to the prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Defendants Consent to Final Judgment in Civil Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 10, 2017-one week after pleading guilty in the Criminal Case-Brennan and Dyer consented to entry of a final judgment in the Civil Case to enjoin them from violating 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), Rule 10b-5 (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5 ) and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a). They also agreed that the court would order disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, pre-judgment interest, and a civil penalty according to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77t(d) and \u00a7 78u(d)(3). The court left open the amount of disgorgement and civil penalty pending a motion by the SEC. As part of the consent judgment, Defendants \"waive[d] any claim of Double Jeopardy based upon the settlement of this proceeding, including the imposition of any remedy or civil penalty herein.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court entered the final judgment in the Civil Case into the record on August 1, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Criminal Sentencing and Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the Criminal Case, the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") applied the Sentencing Guidelines and gave both Defendants a base level of six under USSG \u00a7 2B1.1(a)(2). Because the amount of loss exceeded $3,500,000, eighteen levels were added under \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(J). Two additional levels were added under \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2)(A) because the offense involved approximately 200 victims. Three levels were subtracted from both Defendants because they accepted responsibility for the crimes in their plea agreements. Dyer had an additional two points added for his contempt of court pursuant to \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(9)(C). The final tally set Brennan's offense level as 23 and Dyer's as 25. Since neither Defendant had a criminal history score, each received a criminal history category of I. This produced a Guidelines range for Brennan of 46 to 57 months' imprisonment and for Dyer of 57 to 71 months of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants objected to the PSR calculations based on the Supreme Court's unanimous decision in\n   <em>\n    Kokesh v. SEC\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1645\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1645\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Decided on June 5, 2017,\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   held that in SEC enforcement proceedings, disgorgement is a \"penalty\" subject to the five-year statute of limitations in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202462\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1645\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to Defendants, the 18-level increase of their base offense level violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because Defendants were already punished by disgorgement in the Civil Case. Dyer also argued that the five-year statute of limitations from\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   prevented the court from considering conduct that happened more than five years before he was indicted. Finally, Brennan argued for a downward variance based on his status as a first offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court held a sentencing hearing in the Criminal Case on September 29, 2017 and adopted the recommendations from the PSR. The court denied each objection from Defendants. The court ruled that\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   did not apply to Defendants' Double Jeopardy claims, that the court was allowed to consider \"relevant conduct\" that could not be prosecuted separately because of the statute of limitations, and that Brennan did not qualify as a first offender given his previous censure by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\"). The court then analyzed the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) factors and sentenced Brennan to 48 months and Dyer to 60 months. The court also ordered Brennan and Dyer to pay restitution in the full amount of loss, $4,942,070.18. Brennan and Dyer were ordered to pay additional amounts of $184,022.84 and $354,251.58, respectively, to the IRS for their tax evasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Civil Case Disgorgement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On January 30, 2018, the SEC moved for disgorgement in the Civil Case. Two weeks later, the court entered an order of disgorgement against Brennan and Dyer, jointly and severally, in the amount of $4,942,070.18, to be offset by the amount of restitution ordered to be paid in the Criminal Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants now appeal their criminal sentences, principally claiming the disgorgement violates the Double Jeopardy Clause under\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   . Dyer also appeals the eighteen-level enhancement on collateral estoppel and statute of limitations grounds. Brennan also appeals the district court's decision not to grant a downward variance based on his first-offender status. We have jurisdiction over the appeal of criminal sentences pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203742\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

When reviewing the district court's calculation of the Guidelines, including sentencing enhancements, we review its factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo, and we give \"due deference\" to the district court's determination that an enhancement applies in a particular factual scenario.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court reached this conclusion for three main reasons. First, SEC disgorgement is imposed for a violation of public laws.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1645\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1645\">\n    at 1643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the remedy is designed to protect the public at large, rather than any one individual injured party.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1645\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Second, SEC disgorgement is imposed for punitive purposes\": it has a deterrent effect, and since \"deterrence [is] not [a] legitimate nonpunitive governmental objective[e],\" disgorgement must be punitive.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1645\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alterations in original) (citations omitted). Third, disgorgement is not compensatory because courts are not required to distribute the funds to the victims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1645\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1645\">\n    at 1644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It is important to recognize what the Court\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   say in\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   . The Court did not say that SEC civil disgorgement is a criminal punishment. Nor did it say anything about Double Jeopardy. Defendants ask us to read between the lines in the\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   opinion. They assert it should be read broadly to mean that every \"penalty\" is a \"punishment,\" and in turn that every \"punishment\" necessarily implicates the Double Jeopardy Clause. This is based on the general language from\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   defining \"penalty\" as a \"punishment, whether corporal or pecuniary, imposed and enforced by the State, for a crime or offen[s]e against its laws.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1645\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1645\">\n    at 1642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Huntington v.

The court in the Criminal Case set the amount of loss at $4,942,070.18 and ordered restitution in that amount. In the Civil Case, the court ordered disgorgement of $4,942,070.18 on February 15, 2018, four months after Dyer was criminally sentenced. It makes no sense to argue issue preclusion based on the later decision in the Civil Case. In any event, the courts reached the same result. Dyer fails to explain why this was an error, especially considering that Dyer stipulated that the amount of loss was greater than $3,500,000. Under USSG \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(J), an 18-level increase is applied when the amount of loss or fraud exceeds $3,500,000. The amount of loss in both the Criminal and Civil Cases easily surpasses that threshold. Even an error of over $1,000,000 by the court in the Criminal Case when calculating the amount of loss would not have affected the 18-level increase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Dyer again raises a statute of limitations objection, which the district court overruled at sentencing. Defendants' scheme lasted 8 years, from 2008 to 2016. However, in\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that the five-year statute of limitations from\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202462\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   applies when the SEC seeks disgorgement. 137 S.Ct. at 1645. Dyer argues that this five-year statute of limitations also applies to the court's consideration of the total amount of loss or fraud for criminal sentencing purposes under \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(J). In essence, because Dyer pleaded guilty on May 3, 2017, he argues that \u00a7 2462 barred the court from considering any losses that occurred prior to May 3, 2012. According to Dyer, considering only losses that occurred after that date would reduce the amount of loss below $3,500,000 and alter his Guidelines calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   However, it is a settled point of law in this circuit that the district court could consider the full amount of loss as relevant conduct for sentencing purposes, regardless of the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The court rejected Brennan's request, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   I agree there's no question there's no criminal history, but there is history of-I won't say comparable conduct, but certainly conduct that people in Mr. Brennan's and Mr. Dyer's positions shouldn't engage in; namely, this-it was a few years before this scheme at issue today started, but they were-I think they were fined either $10,000 total or $10,000 apiece, suspended by what was then NASD for two or three months, censured, and it essentially had to do with-I may be pulling this from the civil case, but I don't think there's any question that everybody knows about it.

The district court then identified the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explained how each factor applied to both Brennan and Dyer. Referencing the need for deterrence, \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), the court stated Defendants would not be deterred by a shorter sentence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [Y]ou've both been censured, fined, suspended from the securities industry before. You've had other interactions with regulatory authorities. Within a ... relatively short time after these punishments, you were back at it, except this time in a much more aggressive, bolder way. Your actions suggest to me that a significant sentence is necessary to ensure that you do not engage in criminal conduct again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Similarly, referencing the need to protect the public, a consideration codified at \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C), the court stated that a longer sentence was necessary to protect the public because Defendants have a history of misconduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [T]he prior discipline with the regulatory agencies concerns me. Within just a few years of what should have been a very public and very embarrassing punishment, you both began to engage in worse conduct than you had been punished for. You have a talent for winning over the confidence of investors, and you've shown a proclivity to take advantage of those who trust you. And I have to try to convince you to stop this conduct as I craft the sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The court declined to depart downward and gave Brennan a total sentence of 48 months, the low end of the recommended Guideline range of 46 to 57 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On appeal, Brennan argues that the district court committed procedural error when it did not specifically mention the recidivism studies in its analysis of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.

And it was offset by the amount of restitution in the Criminal Case, so Defendants are not somehow paying back more than what they stole.
