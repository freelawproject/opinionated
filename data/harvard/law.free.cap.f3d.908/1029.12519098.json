Here, plaintiffs are the Tennessee Hospital Association and three of its member hospitals, Takoma Regional Hospital, Delta Medical Center, and Parkwest Hospital. These hospitals serve a disproportionate share of Medicaid-eligible patients and are thereby entitled to supplemental payments under the Medicaid Act, known as \"DSH payments\" or \"DSH payment adjustments.\" The Medicaid Act limits the amount of DSH payments each hospital can receive in a given year, and CMS contends that plaintiffs in this case miscalculated their DSH payment-adjustments for fiscal year 2012 and received extra payments as a result. Plaintiffs, in turn, insist that CMS's approach to calculating DSH payment adjustments is out of step with the Medicaid Act and the regulations that CMS implemented in 2008 pursuant to the Medicaid Act. The district court agreed with plaintiffs and held that\n   CMS's methodology was inconsistent with both the Medicaid Act and CMS's 2008 regulation. Although we agree that CMS's policy is inconsistent with its 2008 rule and cannot be enforced against plaintiffs unless it is promulgated pursuant to notice-and-comment rulemaking, we disagree with the district court's conclusion that CMS's policy exceeds the agency's authority under the Medicaid Act. We therefore\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the final judgment of the district court on the sole ground that CMS may not enforce an invalidly promulgated policy against plaintiffs and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case-the Tennessee Hospital Association and three of its member hospitals-are challenging efforts by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") to direct Tennessee to recoup certain reimbursements paid to the hospitals under the Medicaid program. Plaintiffs are \"Disproportionate Share Hospitals\" (\"DSH\"), which means that they serve a disproportionate share of Medicaid-eligible and low-income patients. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A)(iv) ; 1396r-4(b). As DSH hospitals, plaintiffs receive supplemental \"DSH payments\" under the Medicaid Act to help offset the cost of caring for indigent individuals.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1396r-4(c). The Medicaid Act limits the amount of funds any given DSH hospital can receive in a given year to its uncompensated cost of care-i.e., the cost of caring for Medicaid-eligible and uninsured patients less certain payments made on behalf of those patients.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Congress amended the Medicaid Act in 2003 to require states to audit and report the amount of DSH payments distributed to each hospital.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1396r-4(j). In 2008, CMS issued a final rule pursuant to notice-and-comment rulemaking implementing the 2003 auditing requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Medicaid Program; Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2077%2C904\">\n    73 Fed.

The Medicaid shortfall is represented by the data element in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.299\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(11), and it reflects the \"[t]otal annual costs incurred\" ( (c)(10) ) in treating Medicaid-eligible patients less the total annual \"Medicaid IP/OP payments\" received ( (c)(9) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The question is not as simple as it may seem. For certain hospitals-and, defendants contend, for the plaintiff-hospitals here-subtracting total annual \"Medicaid IP/OP payments\" received from \"[t]otal annual costs incurred\" does not give an accurate picture of how much money a hospital has ultimately lost in caring for indigent patients because Medicaid is not the sole source of insurance coverage for all Medicaid-eligible patients. \"[C]hildren with certain disabilities may be eligible for Medicaid\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   have private insurance coverage through their parents,\" for instance, and \"some elderly individuals are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.\" First Br. at 4-5 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(II), (ii)(I) ). (The latter group is generally referred to as \"dual eligibles.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.299\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) For individuals with some form of dual coverage, Medicaid typically serves as the \"payer of last resort,\" which means that it contributes funds only if the private insurance or Medicare payments are less than what Medicaid would have paid.\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts v. Sebelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199548\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/24/#p26\">\n    638 F.3d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ark. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs. v. Ahlborn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276324\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/268/#p291\">\n    547 U.S. 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 291,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276324\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/268/#p291\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276324\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/268/#p291\">\n    164 L.Ed.2d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) ). Thus, if private insurance or Medicare compensates hospitals at a higher rate than Medicaid (which defendants contend is typical,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   First Br. at 5), then Medicaid contributes nothing to defray the cost of caring for such patients. Assume, then, that a hospital spent $100 to treat a dual-eligible patient, and assume further that Medicaid would have contributed $20 to offset the cost of that care but that Medicaid instead contributed nothing because Medicare footed $40 of the bill. Under this scenario, the Medicaid shortfall is seemingly $100 (total costs incurred minus total Medicaid payments received (zero) ), even though the actual loss to the hospital is only $60.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Br. at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants argue that the Medicaid Act should not be read to require such a perverse result, and that CMS has in fact directed hospitals to account for third-party payments (such as the $40 Medicare payment in the above hypothetical) on three separate occasions. First, defendants insist that CMS \"articulated [its] payment-deduction policy\" in the \"Discussion of Public Comments\" section of the preamble to the 2008 rule. First Br. at 10. In response to a question about how to calculate the costs attributable to \"dual eligibles\"-i.e., patients with both Medicaid and Medicare\n   coverage-CMS advised that \"the costs attributable to dual eligibles should be included in the calculation of the uncompensated costs of serving Medicaid eligible individuals. But in calculating those uncompensated care costs, it is necessary to take into account both the Medicare and Medicaid payments made, since those payments are contemplated under Title XIX [of the Social Security Act].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2077%2C904\">\n    73 Fed. Reg. at 77,912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To defendants, this response plainly directs hospitals to \"take both the good and the bad when calculating the uncompensated costs of treating dual eligibles\"-i.e., to account for both the gross costs and the offsetting Medicare payments. First Br. at 26. Plaintiffs, however, stress that the published text of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.299\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) contains no similar instructions regarding dual eligibles or Medicare patients, and, in fact, does not mention dual-insured patients at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Br. at 7, 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Next, defendants point to two \"Frequently Asked Questions\" (\"FAQs\") and responses that CMS published on its website in 2010. FAQ 33 asks, in essence, whether costs and revenues associated with patients who have \"both Medicaid and private insurance\" should be included in the \"DSH limit.\" R. 45-1 (Van Cleave Decl., Ex. A, \"Additional Information on the DSH Reporting and Audit Requirements\" at 18) (Page ID #607). CMS responds that both \"costs[ ] and revenues associated with patients that are eligible for Medicaid and also have private insurance should be included in the calculation of the hospital-specific DSH limit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.299\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   FAQ 34, in turn, notes that \"[t]he regulation states that costs for dual eligibles should be included in uncompensated care costs\" and asks, \"[u]nder what circumstances should [hospitals] include Medicare payments?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.299\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response, CMS explains that hospitals must \"include the costs attributable to dual eligibles when calculating the uncompensated costs of serving Medicaid eligible individuals,\" but \"must also take into account payment[s] made on behalf of the individual, including all Medicare and Medicaid payments made on behalf of dual eligibles.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.299\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Neither FAQ 33 nor FAQ 34 was promulgated through notice-and-comment rulemaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Finally, in August 2016, CMS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that proposed to amend subpart (c)(10) of the 2008 rule to define the \"total annual costs incurred by each hospital\" for treating Medicaid-eligible patients as \"costs net of third-party payments, including, but not limited to, payments by Medicare and private insurance.\" Medicaid Program; Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments-Treatment of Third Party Payers in Calculating Uncompensated Care Costs,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2053%2C980\">\n    81 Fed.

The District Court for the District of Columbia subsequently determined that the final rule was \"inconsistent with the plain language of the Medicaid Act,\" and vacated the rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Children's Hosp.

That case is currently on appeal before the D.C. Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Notwithstanding CMS's purported payment-deduction policy, plaintiffs here did not account for third-party payments when calculating their DSH payment adjustment. On December 1, 2016, Tennessee's Medicaid program (TennCare) notified plaintiffs that audits of their 2012 payment adjustments revealed that they had received significant DSH overpayments for the 2012 fiscal year and directed plaintiffs\n   to repay the excess funds to the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 16 (Am. Compl. Ex. D) (Page ID #260-68). In response, plaintiffs sued. As is relevant for purposes of this appeal, plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that CMS's payment-deduction policy was contrary to the unambiguous language in the Medicaid Act (Count One), ran afoul of the published text of the 2008 rule (Count Two), and had not been promulgated pursuant to the required notice-and-comment rulemaking process (also Count Two).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 16 (Am.

June 21, 2017). For the remedy, the district court \"permanently enjoined\" defendants from enforcing the \"policies reflected in FAQs 33 and 34\" against plaintiffs, \"for the fiscal years 2012-2016.\" R. 85 (Order at 1) (Page ID #1441). Defendants now appeal the district court's judgment in plaintiffs' favor, and plaintiffs appeal the district court's failure to impose a permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As the discussion below will show, defendants are correct to insist that CMS's payment-deduction policy, as purportedly established in the preamble to the 2008 rule and as plainly set forth in the 2010 FAQs, is consistent with the Medicaid Act. We agree, however, with plaintiffs and the district court that CMS failed to promulgate this policy in a procedurally valid fashion. We further agree (now with only plaintiffs) that the district court's chosen remedy-to enjoin CMS from enforcing its policy from fiscal years 2012 to 2016-was insufficient. We therefore\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the final judgment of the district court because FAQs 33 and 34 are not procedurally valid legislative rules, and we\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   this case to the district court with instructions to permanently enjoin defendants from enforcing FAQs 33 and 34 against plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Here, CMS's proposed interpretation of \"costs incurred\" would not subsume a statutory definition of \"payments\"-in part because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) does not actually define \"payments.\" Rather, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r4(g)(1)(A) instructs CMS to deduct payments \"by uninsured patients\" and \"payments under this subchapter\"-i.e., Medicaid payments from the state and federal governments-from hospitals' final calculation of costs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A).

According to plaintiffs, Congress's express direction to exclude payments from third-party payors in subsection (g)(2)(A) coupled with its failure to include any similar language in subsection (g)(1)(A) show that Congress did not intend to give CMS authority to exclude private-party payments from the \"costs incurred\" in (g)(1)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Br. at 23-24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loughrin v.

There is no tension, however, in Congress\n   <em>\n    requiring\n   </em>\n   third-party payment deductions in subsection (g)(2)(A) and\n   <em>\n    allowing\n   </em>\n   third-party payment deductions in subsection (g)(1)(A). The DSH payments provided for in (g)(2)(A) are above and beyond those mandated by (g)(1)(A); it therefore makes sense for Congress to impose a hard limit on the ceiling of the (g)(2)(A) funds-i.e., no more than 200% of the costs of serving Medicaid-eligible patients, less payments from Medicaid, uninsured patients, and \"third party payors\"-while giving CMS more discretion to calibrate the appropriate cap on the \"standard\" DSH payments discussed in (g)(1)(A). While the statute does not require CMS to use the calculation proposed here, it may reasonably be interpreted to allow for third-party deductions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Third, CMS's proposed interpretation aligns with the statutory purpose behind\n   the hospital-specific DSH limit, thereby buttressing the conclusion that, at\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   step two, the proposed interpretation is reasonable. According to the legislative history accompanying the 1993 amendment to the Medicaid Act,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [t]he purpose of the Medicaid DSH payment adjustment is to assist those facilities with high volumes of Medicaid patients in\n   <em>\n    meeting the costs\n   </em>\n   of providing care to the uninsured patients that they serve, since these facilities are unlikely to have large numbers of privately insured patients through which to offset their operating losses on the uninsured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   H. R. Rep. No. 103-111, at 211 (1993) (emphasis added). But allowing hospitals to receive DSH payments for costs that private insurance companies and Medicare have already compensated would do more than help hospitals \"meet[ ] the costs\" of serving Medicaid-eligible patients-it would doubly \"offset their operating losses on the uninsured.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193045\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/16/#p23\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, the record shows that plaintiffs had already been fully compensated for the costs of caring for Medicaid-eligible and uninsured patients before receiving DSH payments in fiscal year 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 42 (Fan Decl. at 3) (Page ID #551); R. 42-2 (Fan Decl., Exhibit B, \"State of Tennessee Schedule of Annual Reporting Requirements For The Year Ended June 30, 2012\") (Page ID #562).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   What is more, one of the concerns Congress identified as motivating its enactment of hospital-specific DSH-payment caps-that some state psychiatric or university hospitals had received DSH payments \"\n   <em>\n    in amounts that exceed the net costs\n   </em>\n   , and in some instances the total costs,\n   <em>\n    of operating the facilities\n   </em>\n   \" and had then transferred their excess funds to the \"State general fund\" to be used for other projects-is at least partially addressed by CMS's payment-deduction policy. H. R. Rep. No. 103-111, at 211 (emphasis added). In essence, Congress was concerned that hospitals were double dipping by collecting DSH payments to cover costs that had already been reimbursed. CMS's payment-deduction policy responds to that double-dipping concern. While there is no indication that the plaintiffs were transferring excess DSH funds to Tennessee's \"general fund,\" plaintiffs are conspicuously careful not to claim that their net operating costs exceeded their compensation in fiscal year 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Br. at 43 (arguing that two of the three plaintiff hospitals \"were running at losses in 2015 and part of 2016\"-but not in 2012-and noting that \"[t]heir DSH funds were far below\" the \"costs they experienced in 2012\"-meaning, presumably, the\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   costs experienced in 2012). Thus, the payment-deduction policy may very well help alleviate some of the issues motivating the hospital-specific DSH-payment limit in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Fourth, the legislative history more broadly does not foreclose CMS's proffered interpretation. Plaintiffs note that a later House Conference Report describes the statutory provision setting hospital-specific DSH-payment limits, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Assuring Proper Payments to Disproportionate Share Hospitals (Section 13621).-Prohibits designation of a hospital as a disproportionate share hospital for purposes of Medicaid reimbursement unless the hospital has a Medicaid inpatient utilization rate of at least one percent.\n   <strong>\n    Limits disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payment adjustments to no more than the costs of providing inpatient and outpatient services to Medicaid and uninsured patients, less payments received from Medicaid (other than DSH payment adjustments) and uninsured patients.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   H.R. Conf. Rep. 103-213, at 835 (1993) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs are correct to\n   insist that nothing in this description of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) suggests that CMS should interpret costs to exclude payments from Medicare or private insurers, or that Congress contemplated that such payments would be deducted from the final cost calculation. But plaintiffs go a step too far when they argue that the bolded sentence above precludes CMS from \"consider[ing] Medicare payments or private insurance payments in th[e] DSH analysis.\" Second Br. at 25-26. Congressional silence on a matter is simply not the same as a congressional prohibition. To the contrary, when silence is coupled with an express delegation, it indicates that multiple reasonable interpretations of the statute are possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Fifth, if plaintiffs are right that only Medicaid payments and payments from uninsured patients may be deducted from the gross costs of caring for Medicaid-eligible and uninsured individuals, then the 2008 rule would itself be contrary to the Medicaid Act-an issue that no hospital appears to have raised in any court. The 2008 rule directs hospitals to deduct \"Section 1011\" payments from the hospitals' total costs each year, even though 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1) does not call for such deductions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the notice-and-comment period for the 2008 rule, at least some affected parties recognized the discrepancy between the statute and the regulation, as \"[n]umerous commenters\" asked CMS \"to amend the proposed rule to eliminate the proposed treatment of Section 1011 payments\" because such payments \"do not appear to fit in the statutory categories of Medicaid payments, health plan payments, or payments made by uninsured patients[ ] that are required to be 'netted' from cost for the purpose of the DSH limit calculations.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2077%2C904\">\n    73 Fed. Reg. at 77,916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . CMS declined to make this modification, and it seems that no party subsequently challenged CMS's authority to exclude Section 1011 payments from the DSH cost calculation. While the affected parties' acquiescence to the 2008 rule does not resolve this case, it lends additional credence to the conclusion that CMS could reasonably instruct hospitals to deduct payments beyond those expressly identified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r4(g)(1)(A) when determining the hospitals' DSH-payment limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Last, plaintiffs argue extensively that CMS has changed its interpretation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) over time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Br. at 26-27, 29-31. This argument will become relevant in the context of our discussion of Count Two, but it is not clear how this point furthers plaintiffs' claim under the Medicaid Act. \"Unexplained inconsistency\" in statutory interpretation may be \"a reason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice under the Administrative Procedure Act,\" but it is \"not a basis for declining to analyze the agency's interpretation under the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   framework.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Cable &amp; Telecomms.

For instance, defendants note that \"[t]he regulation describes the Medicaid shortfall as the 'Total Medicaid\n   <em>\n    Uncompensated\n   </em>\n   Care' or '[t]he total amount of\n   <em>\n    uncompensated\n   </em>\n   care attributable to Medicaid inpatient and outpatient services.' \" First Br. at 30 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.299\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(11) ) (emphasis in original).

According to defendants, such references to uncompensated costs support defendants' subsequent instruction to deduct third-party payments from hospitals' total costs of caring for Medicaid-eligible patients. The trouble for defendants, however, is that the regulation already defines \"uncompensated costs\" in a manner that forecloses defendants' current interpretation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.299\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(11), for example, explains that the \"total amount of uncompensated care\" attributable to Medicaid patients \"should be the result of subtracting the amount identified in \u00a7 447.299(c)(9) [total Medicaid payments] from the amount identified in \u00a7 447.299(c)(10) [total cost of caring for Medicaid-eligible patients],\" and as already described above, \u00a7 447.299(c)(10) defines the cost of caring for Medicaid-eligible patients as the \"total annual costs incurred by each hospital\"-not the total\n   <em>\n    uncompensated\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    unreimbursed\n   </em>\n   costs.

A declaration submitted by Casey Dungan, the former Chief Financial Officer for TennCare, explained that the auditor of TennCare's DSH program accounted for Medicare and private insurance payments by placing those funds in the \"Regular IP/OP Medicaid FFS Rate Payments\" column of the DSH audit spreadsheet that the state submitted to CMS in accordance with its audit and reporting requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 44 (Dungan Decl. at 2) (Page ID #568);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 60 (Joint Stipulations of Fact \u00b6 24) (Page ID #836) (explaining that the column headings in the \"Schedule of Annual Reporting Requirements\" are virtually identical to the \"categories of payments and costs set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.299\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)\" and that CMS generated the Schedule form and used the Schedule in reviewing Tennessee's 2012 DSH audit). Plainly, this accounting methodology violates the 2008 rule, which defines the \"IP/OP Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) basic rate payments\" as \"[t]he total annual amount paid to the hospital under the State plan, including Medicaid FFS rate adjustments, but not including DSH payments or supplemental/enhanced Medicaid payments, for inpatient and outpatient services furnished to Medicaid eligible individuals.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.299\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(6).

Nor is the Act's relevant language ambiguous. Thus, on this record, either the Act's meaning has changed without any action by Congress-a \"Living Statute,\" so to speak-or else one of the agency's interpretations is wrong. I think the agency's 2010 interpretation (if one can call it that) is wrong, whereas the Majority essentially concludes that both interpretations are right. Hence I write separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The question presented is whether determination of a hospital's \"costs incurred[,]\" as \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) uses that term, requires a hospital not only to add up its\n   <em>\n    outlays\n   </em>\n   in providing services to Medicaid patients (which is the usual sense of \"cost\"), but also to subtract certain\n   <em>\n    payments\n   </em>\n   that the hospital receives for those services. The short answer-as a matter of ordinary English usage, and as \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) uses these terms-is that costs and payments are different concepts, and that the payments a hospital receives for\n   services are not part of its \"costs incurred\" in providing them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Section 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (g) Limit on amount of payment to hospital\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (1) Amount of adjustment subject to uncompensated costs\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (A) In general\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   A payment adjustment [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , payment under \u00a7 1396r-4 ] during a fiscal year shall not be considered to be consistent with [ \u00a7 1396r-4 ] with respect to a hospital if the payment adjustment exceeds\n   <em>\n    the costs incurred during the year of furnishing hospital services (as determined by the Secretary and net of payments under this subchapter, other than under this section, and by uninsured patients\n   </em>\n   ) by the hospital to individuals who either are eligible for medical assistance under the state plan or have no health insurance (or other source of third party coverage) for services provided during the year. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   This provision limits the amount of reimbursement a hospital receives under \u00a7 1396r-4 to the hospital's \"uncompensated costs[,]\" which is itself a term of art defined by the formula set forth in \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A). That formula includes three core elements: \"costs,\" \"payments,\" and \"net.\" All are easy enough to define. The \"cost\" of providing a service is what one loses in providing that service.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Oxford English Dictionary (online ed. 2018) (defining \"cost\" as the \"[t]he spending or outlay of money\"). Indeed \u00a7 1396r-4 itself defines cost in this way. That section provides not only a cap-in \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) -for the payment that a particular hospital may receive, but also a floor. That floor can be calculated several ways; the first among them depends on the hospital's \"operating costs for inpatient hospital services[.]\" \u00a7 1396r4(c)(1). And those costs in turn are defined as \"all routine operating costs, ancillary service operating costs, and special care unit operating costs with respect to inpatient hospital services\"-in other words, the money that a hospital spends to serve patients. \u00a7 1395ww(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In contrast, a \"payment\" is what one receives in return for providing a service.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Oxford English Dictionary (online ed. 2018) (defining \"payment\" as \"[a] sum of money ... in return for goods or services\"). The Act is clear about which payments count for purposes of \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) : specifically, payments from Medicaid (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"payments under this subchapter\") and from patients themselves (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"by uninsured patients\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The \"net,\" in turn, is what remains after deducting payments from costs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Oxford English Dictionary (online ed. 2018) (defining \"net\" as what \"remain[s] after all necessary deductions\"). Section 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) therefore provides a straightforward formula to determine the cap for a hospital's \u00a7 1396r-4 payment: the hospital's \"costs incurred\" in providing Medicaid services, minus certain \"payments[,]\" equals the \"net,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , its \"uncompensated costs[.]\" Thus, the maximum that a hospital may receive under \u00a7 1396r-4 in a given year is the difference between the money it spent serving Medicaid patients that year and certain payments (specifically, payments from Medicaid and from uninsured patients) it received in return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The 2008 regulation is as clear as the Act. As the Majority points out, the regulation specifically lists the payments that hospitals must deduct. Payments from Medicare and private insurers are not among them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.299\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   But now-per the agency's 2010 responses to \"Frequently Answered Questions\" (and later in a regulation promulgated in 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.229\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(10)(i) )-the agency asserts that payments from Medicare and private insurers indeed must be included in the calculation set forth in \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A). That calculation, to reiterate, is simple: a hospital's \"costs incurred\" in providing Medicaid services, minus certain enumerated payments (which do not include payments from Medicare or private insurers), equals the \"net,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the hospital's \"uncompensated costs.\" Payments from Medicare and private insurers (referred to from here as \"unenumerated payments\") do not, in the agency's view, actually count as \"payments\" in this calculation. Instead, the agency says, unenumerated payments are part of the determination of a hospital's\n   <em>\n    costs\n   </em>\n   incurred in providing Medicaid services. Specifically, the agency points out that, under \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A), \" 'costs incurred' are '\n   <em>\n    as determined by the Secretary\n   </em>\n   [,]' \" CMS Br. at 18 (agency's emphasis); and thus, the agency argues, the Secretary (meaning here CMS), has discretion to deduct unenumerated payments for Medicaid services from the hospital's outlays for those services in determining the hospitals' \"costs incurred\" for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In making that argument the agency seriously overplays its hand. True, \u00a7 1396r4(g)(1)(A) expressly grants the agency a measure of discretion in prescribing what counts towards a hospital's \"costs incurred.\" And that means the agency has discretion to prescribe, in the sort of minute detail that calls upon its expertise, the specific\n   <em>\n    outlays\n   </em>\n   that count towards a hospital's \"costs incurred\" for a particular service. Those outlays might include, for example, the hospital's direct costs of providing the service (for which the agency might prescribe a rate schedule), plus some portion (as prescribed by the agency) of the hospital's costs for overhead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   But just as the statutory delegation is circumscribed by the English language, so too is the agency's discretion. As an initial matter, per the statute's plain terms, the express grant of discretion (\"as determined by the Secretary\") modifies only \"costs incurred[,]\" not \"net of payments.\" And \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) clearly enumerates the payments that count in this calculation (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , payments from Medicaid and by the patients themselves), without any catchall language that would bring in payments from third parties generally. Thus, \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) is \"silent\" as to whether other, unenumerated payments count in this calculation only in the sense that, say, \"children 12 and under admitted free\" is silent as to whether 13-year-olds must pay. Moreover, \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) itself, as well as \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(2)(A), make clear that, when Congress wanted to refer to \"third party payment\" or \"third party payors[,]\" respectively, it was fully capable of doing so. For good reason, then, CMS focuses instead on its discretion to determine what counts as \"costs incurred.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As for that discretion, \"costs\" are outflows of money; \"payments\" are inflows. And nothing in the phrase \"costs incurred ... as determined by the Secretary\" allows the agency to redefine \"costs\" to include \"payments.\" The agency counters (and the Majority agrees) that \" 'words like \"cost\" give' agencies 'broad methodological leeway.' \" CMS Br. at 39 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Verizon Communications, Inc. v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"351774\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/467/#p500\">\n    535 U.S. 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 500,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"351774\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/467/#p500\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"351774\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/467/#p500\">\n    152 L.Ed.2d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) ). But again that leeway does not extend to treating \"payments\" as \"costs,\" as\n   <em>\n    Verizon\n   </em>\n   itself illustrates. There, as here, \"cost\" was \"an intermediate term\" in a formula for determining another statutory number-there, the \"just and reasonable rates\" that a telecommunications provider could charge its customers.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 499-500,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"351774\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/467/#p500\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The agency's \"leeway\" there concerned the \"\n   <em>\n    expenditures\n   </em>\n   \"-which is to say, the outlays-that would count as \"costs\" for purposes of that\n   determination.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 498-99,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"351774\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/467/#p500\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, the agency here seeks to cross a linguistic line that\n   <em>\n    Verizon\n   </em>\n   never contemplated. Moreover, \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) expressly treats \"costs,\" \"payments,\" and \"net\" as separate concepts; and \"it would have been passing strange\" to think that, \"in the very same sentence,\" Congress meant to collapse all three concepts into one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"351774\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/467/#p500\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"351774\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/467/#p500\">\n    at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"351774\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/467/#p500\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet that is what CMS does when it says that a hospital's \"costs incurred\" in providing a service are the\n   <em>\n    net\n   </em>\n   of its outlays for that service minus unenumerated\n   <em>\n    payments\n   </em>\n   (from which net, in the agency's view, the hospital then deducts the\n   <em>\n    enumerated\n   </em>\n   payments, for the \"net\" of its uncompensated costs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Agencies have a strong incentive (namely,\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   ) to make statutory language seem more complicated than it actually is. Here, as shown above, the statutory formula is straightforward: costs, minus certain clearly enumerated payments, equals the net of a hospital's \"uncompensated costs.\" The only confusion inheres in the agency's own efforts to convince us to read the statute contrary to its terms. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs, for their part, have chosen not to argue that the agency's responses to \"Frequently Asked Questions\" are unworthy of deference, and that the only agency action to which we ever could defer in this case is the 2008 regulation-which says the opposite of what the agency says now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In the end, however, the formula in \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) is discernable easily enough by means of \"the traditional tools of statutory construction.\"\n   <em>\n    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

The agency's 2008 regulation substantially honors the statute's terms, whereas the agency's later about-face does not. Thus, the agency's current interpretation of \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A) is invalid substantively, as well as (in this case) procedurally.
