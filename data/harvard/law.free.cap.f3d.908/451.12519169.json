The jury found that BNSF Railway Company violated the anti-retaliation provision of the Federal Railroad Safety Act (\"FRSA\") when BNSF fired Curtis Rookaird for, in part, refusing to stop performing an air-brake test on a 42-car train that he was tasked with moving. Rookaird was awarded over $1.2 million in damages. BNSF appeals issues related to its liability and damages; Rookaird cross-appeals issues related to damages. For the reasons below, we affirm in part, reverse in part, vacate the district court's judgment, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   BNSF operates a freight railroad in the western United States and Canada. It serves customers across North America, including northwest Washington known as Cherry Point. The Cherry Point rail line connects to a main line that runs from Bellingham to BNSF's Swift Depot. BNSF employs three-person \"switcher\" crews that serve BNSF customers in Cherry Point by switching or reassigning freight cars as part of delivering or picking up freight. In early 2010, BNSF relocated its switcher crews from Bellingham to the Swift Depot to reduce travel time to Cherry Point, thereby reducing the overtime BNSF had to pay those crews.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Curtis Rookaird was a conductor for - and thus in charge of - one such crew. On February 23, 2010, Rookaird and his crew worked a scheduled eight-hour shift beginning at 2:30 p.m. The \"Trainmaster,\" Dan Fortt, tasked Rookaird's crew with moving a 42-car train in Custer from the main line to a different set of tracks before traveling to Cherry Point to service BNSF's customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Three hours into their shift, the crew arrived in Custer after securing two engines in Ferndale (south of Custer). Before moving the 42-car train, Rookaird's crew performed a 20- to 45-minute air-brake test on the train. During the test, Fortt said on the radio to Rookaird and his crew, \"I'm not from around here, and I don't know how you guys do anything. But from where I'm from, we don't have to air test the cars.\" Fortt did not tell the crew to stop. Rookaird's crew replied that they were going to finish the test. They did, and then began moving the 42-car train.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   About ninety minutes later, around five hours into their shift, Rookaird's crew had not yet completed moving the 42-car train in Custer and had not yet serviced any Cherry Point customers. Fortt and Stuart\n   Gordon, another one of Rookaird's supervisors on duty that day, were frustrated with what they believed to be a slow pace of work by Rookaird's crew. Fortt ordered Rookaird's crew to stop work and report back to the Swift Depot because another crew was going to relieve them. Gordon believed that Rookaird was intentionally slowing down work as a way to get back at BNSF for reducing overtime hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Back at the Swift Depot, around 7:50 p.m., Gordon questioned Rookaird about the air-brake test. Gordon told Rookaird that he thought the test was unnecessary. Gordon also asked Rookaird if he would be happy with the level of service he received that day if he were a BNSF customer; Rookaird told him no. Gordon then told Rookaird and his crew that they were done for the day and to clock out and go home. Rookaird printed his timesheet at 8:02 p.m., reporting his off-duty time at 8:30 p.m. Around 8:15 p.m., Gordon again told Rookaird to go home; he did, but he did not sign his timesheet before leaving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   BNSF initiated an investigation into Rookaird to determine whether any disciplinary action was warranted. On March 19, BNSF fired Rookaird for his \"failure to work efficiently ... on February 23,\" his \"dishonesty when reporting [his] off duty time,\" his failure to sign his timesheet, and his \"failure to comply with instructions when instructed to leave the property ... on February 23.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

District Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Rookaird brought this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020109\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3). Rookaird alleged\n   that BNSF violated the anti-retaliation provision of the FRSA because BNSF fired him for, in part, refusing to stop performing the air-brake test. BNSF insisted that it did not fire him for that reason. BNSF also asserted its affirmative defense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2042121\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B)(iv) that it would have fired Rookaird even if he had not performed the air-brake test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court held that Rookaird was required to prove four elements by a preponderance of the evidence: \"that (1) he engaged in a protected activity; (2) the employer knew he engaged in the allegedly protected activity; (3) he suffered an unfavorable personnel action; and (4) the protected activity was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action.\" The district court granted Rookaird summary judgment on all but the first element of his substantive case. The district court held that BNSF knew that Rookaird performed the air-brake test, that his termination was an adverse action, and that the air-brake test was a contributing factor in his firing. With respect to the contributing-factor element, the district court found that the \"cited failure to work efficiently cannot be unwound from Rookaird's decision\" to perform the air-brake test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The issues for the jury were whether Rookaird's refusal to stop the air-brake test was FRSA-protected activity, BNSF's affirmative defense, and damages. Before closing arguments, the district court concluded that - although Rookaird's crew was not legally required to perform the air-brake test under the circumstances, describing the issue as a \"close call\" - a reasonable jury could find that Rookaird engaged in protected activity because there was evidence that Rookaird \"had a subjectively and objectively reasonable good faith belief that the air-brake test was required.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury returned a verdict for Rookaird, finding that Rookaird's refusal was FRSA-protected activity. The Court awarded Rookaird $1.2 million in damages and entered final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   These appeals followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Protected Activity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   BNSF appeals the district court's denial of BNSF's motion for judgment as a matter of law that Rookaird did not engage in protected activity.

First, BNSF insists there was insufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that Rookaird \"refused\" to violate a railroad safety rule or regulation because he was never explicitly ordered to stop the air-brake test. Second, BNSF argues that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020109\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) protects only refusals to engage in conduct that would be an\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   violation of railroad rules or regulations,\n   and thus that Rookaird did not engage in protected activity because the air-brake test was not legally required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We hold that the district court did not err in denying BNSF's motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to whether Rookaird engaged in FRSA-protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Refusal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Under the FRSA, protected activity includes an \"employee's lawful, good faith ... refus[al] to violate or assist in the violation of any Federal law, rule, or regulation relating to railroad safety or security.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020109\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (a)(2). By the FRSA's plain terms, an employee must \"refuse\" to violate a rule or regulation, necessarily requiring some action by the employer (e.g., an order to perform or not perform, or to start or stop, a particular action) which prompts the employee's \"refusal.\"\n   <em>\n    See Refuse\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 2001) (\"to show or express unwillingness to do or comply with\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quinn v.

Thus, an employee who simply performs basic job duties has not \"refused\" to violate any rule or regulation unless those job duties are covered by a rule or regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sievers v. Alaska Airlines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , ARB No. 05-109,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20316012\">\n    2008 WL 316012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4 (Jan. 30, 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   BNSF maintains that Fortt's questioning of the air-brake test's necessity constituted insufficient evidence that Rookaird 'refused' to violate a railroad safety rule or regulation because it is undisputed that Fortt never explicitly directed Rookaird to stop the test. But an employee's refusal need not be precipitated by an explicit directive in order for the employee's refusal to be FRSA-protected activity. The word \"refuse\" in the FRSA is a clear reference to the employee's conduct, not the employer's. And while certainly an explicit order can be 'refused,' statements or conduct of the employer can amount to an implicit order, and an employee can refuse to follow that implicit order just as much as an explicit one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Douds v. Milk Drivers &amp; Dairy Emp. Local No. 680\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261779\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/133/336/#p340\">\n    133 F.Supp. 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 340 (D.N.J. 1955) (\"On the other hand, 'refusal' connotes an intentional unwillingness on the part of the employee to do what he is asked to do. This asking may be by an explicit direct order, but since 'actions speak louder than words' ..., no particular form of words is essential.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Here, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Rookaird refused, in good faith, to violate a railroad safety rule or regulation. Fortt's statements questioning the need for the air-brake test came in the middle of the test. Rookaird responded that the crew was going to finish the test, and they did so. Fortt was Rookaird's supervisor. And the substance of Fortt's statements - \"I'm not from around here,\" \"I don't know how you guys do anything,\" and \"from where I'm from, we don't have to air test the cars\" - are exactly the kind of statements, taken in context, that a reasonable jury could have found sufficient to prompt Rookaird to 'refuse' to stop the test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Actual Violation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The parties vigorously disputed before the district court whether Rookaird was legally required to perform the air-brake test under the circumstances. The district court ultimately concluded that he was not but described the issue as a \"close call.\" The district court went on to hold that the\n   good-faith requirement in subsection (a) of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020109\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   required Rookaird to prove that he \"must have had a subjectively and objectively reasonable good faith belief that the air-brake test was required by federal law or regulation.\" The district court also held that substantial evidence supported the jury's finding that it was objectively reasonable for Rookaird to believe that the air-brake test was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On appeal, BNSF argues as a matter of statutory interpretation that paragraph (a)(2) of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020109\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   applies only to conduct that, if undertaken, would\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   violate a rule or regulation, and therefore that Rookaird did not engage in protected activity because the test was not legally required. BNSF effectively asks us to add the word \"actually\" before \"violate\" in paragraph (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We reject this interpretation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020109\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) as incorrectly narrowing its intended scope. To constructively add the word \"actually\" into paragraph (a)(2) would undercut the good-faith requirement that applies throughout subsection (a). Congress's use of the phrase \"good faith\" in subsection (a) means that it intended for paragraph (a)(2) to extend to an employee's good-faith refusal to undertake conduct the employee believed to be violative of a law, rule, or regulation, even if the conduct at issue would not constitute an actual violation of a law, rule, or regulation if performed or continued.\n   <em>\n    See Good Faith\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (\"A state of mind consisting in (1) honesty in belief or purpose, [or] (2) faithfulness to one's duty or obligation.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Rookaird's case presents a good example of why this interpretation must be correct. The jury found that Rookaird had a good-faith belief that the air-brake test was required; there was disagreement between Rookaird and his supervisors as to the test's propriety; the issue was hotly contested through trial; and the district court only resolved the issue after acknowledging that it was a \"close call.\" We think Congress intended for Rookaird's good-faith refusal to be within the scope of paragraph (a)(2), notwithstanding that the air-brake test turned out to be legally unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   By contrast, limiting paragraph (a)(2) to actual violations would allow railroads to avoid liability for conduct clearly intended be covered by paragraph (a)(2). For example, if a railroad supervisor nefariously orders an employee to perform an act that the supervisor is sure would violate federal law, and the employee believes - like the supervisor - that following the order would require the employee to violate federal law, the railroad could fire the employee for insubordination if the employee refused in good faith to follow that order if it turns out that both the supervisor and the employee were mistaken. This creates a situation in which, because of a nuanced technicality that neither the supervisor nor the employee knew of, the employee's noncompliance with the supervisor's order would not have been an actual violation of federal law. If paragraph (a)(2) were construed to cover only actual violations, this hypothetical employee would have no recourse under paragraph (a)(2). We cannot imagine that Congress intended for railroads to escape FRSA liability in such a situation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Lower courts' interpretations of a different paragraph of subsection (a) support our conclusion. Courts interpreting paragraph (a)(4) of \u00a7 20109 - which prohibits retaliation against employees who \"notify ... the railroad carrier ... of a work-related personal injury\" - have refused to construe paragraph (a)(4) to require that the reported injury\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   be work-related.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

In its summary-judgment order, the district court found that Rookaird's alleged inefficiency \"cannot be unwound from\" his decision to perform the air-brake test and therefore granted Rookaird summary judgment on \"the 'contributing factor' element of his prima facie case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, however, the district court instructed the jury that the contributing-factor element was not in dispute, and that to prevail on the merits, Rookaird only needed to prove that his refusal to stop the air-brake test constituted FRSA-protected activity. Thus, although the district court's summary-judgment order purported to rule only on an element of Rookaird's prima facie showing, the order's effect was to grant Rookaird summary judgment on an element of his substantive case. This was improper. As explained, a complainant's burden is lower at the prima facie stage than at the substantive stage. A complainant who prevails at the prima facie stage likely can avoid the employer's summary-judgment motion because a prima facie showing includes evidence that \"the circumstances were sufficient to raise the inference that the protected activity ... was a contributing factor,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201982.104\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1982.104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(iv), and reasonable inferences would be drawn in the employee's favor on an employer's motion for summary judgment,\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

BNSF presented evidence that, if credited, could lead a reasonable jury to find that Rookaird's refusal to stop the air-brake test did not contribute to BNSF's decision to terminate him. For example, Fortt and Gordon each testified that the air-brake test did not factor into the decision to fire Rookaird. Doug Jones, the general manager of BNSF's Northwest Division who made the decision to fire Rookaird, also testified that the air-brake test did not factor into his decision. BNSF also presented evidence that Rookaird was fired for reasons unrelated to the air-brake test, including his failure to provide a signed time slip, his refusal to leave BNSF property when instructed, and his inaccurate reporting of his off-duty\n   time. Viewing that evidence in the light most favorable to BNSF, a reasonable jury could find that Rookaird's refusal to stop the air-brake test did not contribute to BNSF's decision to terminate him. Rookaird was therefore not entitled to summary judgment on his substantive case. The jury should have determined whether Rookaird proved by a preponderance of the evidence that his refusal to stop performing the air-brake test was a contributing factor in his termination.

The district court determined that federal law did not require Rookaird to perform an air-brake test on the train, and Rookaird presented no evidence regarding BNSF's perception of what federal law required. Because Rookaird did not \"refuse to violate ... any Federal law,\" his claim fails as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020109\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In reaching the contrary conclusion, the majority rewrites the statutory language. The majority asserts that because the statute refers to an employee's \"lawful, good faith act,\" \u00a7 20109(a), employees should be able to prove they engaged in the conduct listed in subsection (a)(2) (i.e., refusal \"to violate ... any Federal law\") merely by showing they had a good faith belief that they were doing so. Maj. at 457. In effect,\n   the majority asserts that we must read subsection (a)(2) as referring to an employee's \"lawful, good faith act done ... to refuse [\n   <em>\n    to take an action that in the reasonable belief of the employee would\n   </em>\n   ] violate ... any Federal law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The majority offers many justifications for this extra-textual interpretation, but none of them have merit. First, the majority claims that giving effect to the statute as written would \"incorrectly narrow[ ] its intended scope.\" Maj. at 457. According to the majority, had Congress intended the particular conduct listed in \u00a7 20109(a)(2) to be a refusal to \"violate ... any Federal law,\" it would have inserted the word \"actually\" before the word \"violate.\" Maj. at 457. By failing to add the word \"actually,\" the majority claims, Congress established that it did not intend to refer to an\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   violation of federal law. Maj. at 457. This is nonsensical on its face. Congress does not have to insert the words \"actually\" or \"literally\" or say \"and we really mean it\" in order for statutory language to mean what it says.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The majority next claims that its rewriting of the statute to insert \"to take an action that in the reasonable belief of the employee would\" between \"to refuse\" and \"to violate ... any Federal law\" in (a)(2) must be correct for policy reasons. Absent the added language, the majority asserts, an employer could \"nefariously order[ ] an employee to perform an act\" that the employer and employee both believe would violate federal law, fire the employee for refusing to follow the order, and then escape liability if it turns out that the act did not violate federal law due to some technicality. Maj. at 457. But the text of the statute addresses that exact situation without the majority's help. Under subsection (a), FRSA is violated if the employee takes an act that is \"perceived by the employer to have been done ... to refuse to violate ... Federal law.\" In the majority's hypothetical, the employer would be liable because, even though no actual violation occurred, the railroad fired the employee for a \"perceived\" refusal to violate federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020109\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Nor do the majority's references to \u00a7 20109(a)(4) and (a)(7) support its interjection of new language into the statutory text. Maj. at ---- - ----, ----. The majority notes that district courts have read \u00a7 20109(a)(4) (covering employees who notify employers of work-related injuries or illnesses) as applying regardless whether the injury or illness is work-related. Maj. at 457-58. But we should consider district courts' interpretations of statutes only to the extent they are persuasive; district courts' refusal to give effect to the statutory language based on policy preferences is not. Similarly, the fact that Congress used the word \"accurately\" in \u00a7 20109(a)(7) (covering employees who \"accurately report hours on duty\"), Maj. at 458-59, does not support (or even logically relate to) the majority's conclusion that it must rewrite subsection (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Finally, the majority's theory that Congress's use of the phrase \"good faith\" in subsection (a) requires us to read a \"reasonable belief\" element into subsection\n   (a)(2), Maj. at 457, is inconsistent with the statute as a whole. First, subsection (a)(1) already includes a \"reasonable belief\" element: it prohibits discrimination when an \"employee's lawful, good faith act\" was done \"to provide information ... regarding any conduct which the employee\n   <em>\n    reasonably believes\n   </em>\n   constitutes a violation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020109\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (emphasis added). Congress's use of \"reasonably believes\" in (a)(1) but not in (a)(2) raises the presumption that Congress did not intend to import a reasonable belief component into the refusal \"to violate ... Federal law.\" \u00a7 20109(a)(2). \"[W]hen Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another[,] ... this Court presumes that Congress intended a difference in meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Dig.

This is a misunderstanding of how the interpretive canon applies here. Subsections (a)(1) through (a)(7) are part of an \"associated group or series\" because each subsection enumerates purposes for which an employee might undertake the \"lawful, good faith act\" described in \u00a7 20109(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnhart v.

Rather, recognizing the complexity of railroad regulation, Congress could have reasonably concluded that an employer is better positioned to know the law than the employee. Therefore, Congress could have intended \"to provide broader protections for employees who complain about perceived but nonexistent safety violations - as it has, for example, in Title VII and other statutes protecting employees from discrimination in the workplace - and narrower protections for employees whose refusals to\" work might \"significantly impede\" railroad operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koch Foods, Inc. v.

Because federal law did not require the performance of an air-brake test, the district court erred in concluding that Rookaird could establish that he refused \"to violate ... any Federal law,\" \u00a7 20109(a)(2), and therefore erred in denying BNSF's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the protected activity element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from Part II.A of the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    The district court treated the propriety of the air-brake test as an issue for the court to resolve, not the jury.

Under the dissent's reading of the statute, the employee has recourse in such a situation because the act that the employee undertook was \"perceived by the employer\" to be a refusal to violate federal law.
