After rejecting the Government's contention that the case is moot, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When the district court originally sentenced Ketter, he had two prior convictions for South Carolina second-degree burglary. Pursuant to then-controlling law, these prior crimes provided the basis for finding him an \"armed career criminal\" under the ACCA's residual clause. This subjected him to a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years' imprisonment with a Guidelines range of three to five years of supervised release.

He maintained, and the Government agreed, that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   established that he no longer qualified as an armed career criminal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 16, 2016, the parties jointly moved for expedited resentencing.

The Fourth Circuit issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   on April 7, 2017. Two days later, the district court granted the motion and resentenced Ketter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At this point, Ketter had served approximately 90 months in prison. The new presentence investigation report, to which neither party objected, recommended a Guidelines range of 27 to 33 months of imprisonment and 1 to 3 years of supervised release. The district court, stating it had \"considered the 3553(a) factors,\" including offense conduct and criminal history, resentenced Ketter to time served (90 months) with two years of supervised release. The court explained that Ketter had served \"some 53 months above [the] guideline range,\" and found this \"the basis ... to have him serve two years of supervised release.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ketter's counsel objected to the sentence, contending that the time-served sentence amounted to an improper upward variance and was substantively unreasonable. The Government countered that a time-served sentence \"serve[d] the exact same purpose as the guideline sentence.\" The district court adhered to its sentence. In its Statement of Reasons, the court checked a box indicating that the sentence was \"within the guideline range,\" and did not check any box signaling a departure or variance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although neither the Government nor Ketter raised the question, we directed\n   the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing possible mootness, given that Ketter has completed his term of imprisonment.

In\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that a defendant's challenge to incarceration for a parole revocation became moot as soon as he served his revoked term of imprisonment.

He maintains that such a sentence is unitary. Accordingly, he argues that he can mount a challenge to his sentence even after incarceration has ceased, because he continues to serve a term of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We agree with Ketter that he received a unitary sentence and that a challenge to that sentence presents a live controversy, even though he has served the custodial portion of that sentence. Treating custodial and supervised release terms as components of one unified sentence appropriately recognizes the interdependent relationship between incarceration and supervised release. \"[T]he term of supervised release, the revocation of that term, and any additional term of imprisonment imposed for violating the terms of the supervised release are all part of the original sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because of the reciprocal relationship between a prison sentence and a term of supervised release,\n   even when a prison term has ceased, a defendant serving a term of supervised release has a \"legally cognizable interest in the outcome\" of a challenge to his sentence.\n   <em>\n    Already, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/#p91\">\n    568 U.S. at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407123\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/85/#p91\">\n    133 S.Ct. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the underlying prison sentence has been served, a case is not moot when an associated term of supervised release is ongoing, because on remand a district court\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   grant relief to the prevailing party in the form of a shorter period of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Neither\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   support a contrary holding.

The government does not argue for a different standard at resentencing. Under this standard, as the Government conceded at oral argument, the district court's imposition of a time-served sentence amounted to an unexplained variance from the Guidelines and so constituted procedural error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675664\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/38/#p41\">\n    552 U.S. at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675664\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/38/#p41\">\n    128 S.Ct. 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a sentencing court must explain \"any deviation from the Guidelines range\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The record, however, conclusively demonstrates that any error was harmless. This is so because, although the court did not explain its variance, it expressly recognized that Ketter had \"overserved his time.\" And in light of that \"overserved\" time, the court significantly reduced the period of Ketter's supervised release from five years to two years-one year below Ketter's new statutory maximum,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), and within the range counseled by the Guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(a)(2). In doing so, the court explained that the fact that Ketter had served a prison term \"some 53 months above [the] guideline range\" provided \"the basis\" for this reduced term of supervised release. Thus, the district court fully and expressly accounted for Ketter's overserved time in determining his prospective sentence of supervised release. Further, any error did not have the practical effect of prolonging Ketter's incarceration by even one day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Accordingly, any error did not \"affect [Ketter's] substantial rights\" and so was harmless. Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a) ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The harmless error doctrine \"promotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness\" of a proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Delaware v. Van Arsdall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207521\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/673/#p681\">\n    475 U.S. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 681,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207521\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/673/#p681\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207521\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/673/#p681\">\n    89 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). This prudential analysis considers whether an error so affected the proceedings as to unfairly influence the outcome. The inquiry diverges from the jurisdictional question of mootness, which (as we have explained) asks only whether the possibility of relief is so remote and speculative as to obviate any case or controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In sum, although Ketter's appeal is not moot because the challenge to his prison term\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   alter the length of his ongoing supervised release term, any error was harmless because it did not\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   affect his substantial rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Ketter's appeal fails, like those of other litigants in his position.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310384,4060098\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/672/\">\n    809 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   675-76 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blackburn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673001\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/259/#p262\">\n    461 F.3d at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (\"Given the majority's acknowledgment that the district court\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   resentence Blackburn to a reduced supervised-release term, its ultimate conclusion should be not that the case is moot, but that any error ... was harmless.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    A Sixth Circuit panel in an unpublished opinion recently rejected a challenge to a time-served resentencing under a divisible-sentence theory.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

In fact, only one circuit that has faced this precise issue has departed from the unified-sentence approach, and even that departure was equivocal.
