When one of the victims hesitated to surrender her keys, Garrett shoved her to the ground, grabbed her purse, removed the keys, and drove off. Garrett never objected to this description of his conduct.

Once again: after\n   <em>\n    Ovalles\n   </em>\n   , there is no basis for Garrett, or any other federal prisoner seeking leave to file a second or successive motion in any district court in this Circuit, to contend that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   supplies any rule of constitutional law on which a vagueness challenge to section 924(c) could be based.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Garrett's other claims also fail to justify a second or successive motion under section 2255(h). Read liberally, his application complains that his sentence is inconsistent with the form of his indictment, that this Court erred in his direct appeal when it declined to consider his untimely and forfeited argument that the district court should have suppressed certain evidence, and that it erred in failing to review the district court's denial of his first motion under section 2255. He claims that each of these putative errors violated his right to due process of law. These claims are not based on any new evidence or any new rule of constitutional law that the Supreme Court has made retroactive, so they cannot support a second or successive motion. And, to the extent that Garrett has asserted identical claims in his previous\n   unsuccessful applications, that is another reason why his application cannot be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Baptiste\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336260\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/1337/#p1339\">\n    828 F.3d 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1339-41 (11th Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We\n   <strong>\n    DISMISS\n   </strong>\n   Garrett's application to the extent that it presents repetitive claims and\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the remainder.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
