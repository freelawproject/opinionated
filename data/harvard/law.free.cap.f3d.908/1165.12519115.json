Thus, the district court has jurisdiction to review the OMB's decision to deny Gilbert Hyatt's PRA petition (\"Petition\"). We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In January 2013, the Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") submitted a number of collections of information to the OMB, as required by the PRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203507\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The PTO's submission included several previously approved collections of information, which had already been issued an OMB control number pursuant to \u00a7 3507(d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The OMB renewed these collections and their corresponding OMB control number (0651-0031).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The submission also included purported collections of information, contained in PTO rules 111, 115, and 116 (\"PTO Rules\"), that had not previously been approved or assigned an OMB control number.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The OMB did not approve or disapprove these purported collections of information. Instead, on July 31, 2013, the OMB affirmatively declared that these purported collections were \"not subject to the [PRA]\" (\"July 2013 Determination\"). As a result, the OMB did not issue a control number for the purported collections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 1, 2013, Hyatt filed his Petition, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203517\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), asking the OMB to determine that he did not need to disclose the information sought by the PTO Rules, because the PTO had not obtained an OMB control number, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203507\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). The OMB denied the Petition on September 13, 2013. The agency referenced its July 2013 Determination, explaining that the PTO Rules did not contain any collections of information, because three regulatory exceptions to the definition of \"information\" applied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201320.3\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1320.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1), (6), (9). Consequently, the agency concluded that the PTO Rules were not subject to the PRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hyatt filed a complaint with the district court on August 16, 2016, asserting two\n   claims under the APA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He challenged both the OMB's July 2013 Determination\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the OMB's denial of his Petition, which itself was based on the July 2013 Determination. On November 11, 2016, the OMB moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the OMB's actions under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court granted the motion to dismiss. It determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear Hyatt's asserted APA claims on three independent grounds. First,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203507\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(6) precluded judicial review. Second, the challenged administrative actions did not constitute final agency actions. Third, the OMB's decision (not to provide any remedial action in response to Hyatt's Petition) was discretionary. Hyatt timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
