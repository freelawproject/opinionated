On July 6, 2007, a jury convicted him on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Snider's presentence report recommended an adjusted offense level of 34 under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(B), because Snider qualified as a career criminal offender based on three Tennessee aggravated burglary convictions deemed crimes of violence. The guidelines define a career offender as having at least two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). At the time of Snider's sentencing, \"crime of violence\" was defined to include \"burglary of a dwelling.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (Nov. 1, 2007).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The presentence report relied (erroneously it turns out) on three burglaries committed in 1995. In March 1995, Snider broke into three different residences on\n   three different dates, March 19, 20, and 21. He was arrested for all three burglaries on the same day, April 19, 1995, and pleaded guilty to all three crimes on the same day, May 22, 1995.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the presentence report did not rely upon it in its calculation of the career offender designation, it also listed an additional qualifying Tennessee aggravated burglary conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With the career offender designation, Snider's guidelines range was 360 months to life. (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(c)(3) ). The presentence report noted that Snider's adjusted offense level after application of the various sentencing enhancements would have been the same in any event. However, without the career offender designation, based on Snider's criminal history score of 17, which established a criminal history category of VI, Snider's resulting advisory guidelines range was 262 to 327 months, plus 60 months consecutive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Snider did not object to the classification of his prior convictions as crimes of violence in his sentencing memorandum or at the sentencing hearing. Snider asked for a sentence above the statutorily-mandated ten-year minimum, but \"substantially less\" than the 360 months suggested by the guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In considering the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   sentencing factors, the district court described the instant crime as \"very serious\" and \"involving the manufacture of a poison, along with firearms, fleeing from police, putting police officers at risk during the flight.\" The court noted that Snider's life of crime began at age 15 (he was 30 at the time of sentencing), that he had twenty-four convictions listed in his presentence report, and that these included \"serious burglary and theft convictions\" as well as \"drug convictions.\" The district court rejected Snider's request for a below-guidelines sentence, but sentenced him to the low end of the advisory guidelines range, with a total sentence of 300 months on the first five counts and the required 60-month consecutive sentence on count six.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On direct appeal, Snider raised one issue-he successfully argued that count six of the indictment mixed elements of two distinct offenses created by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A), and the jury instructions did not cure this flaw.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

On February 2, 2012, the district court directed the government to reply to Snider's first claim-that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing because counsel failed to object to his designation as a career criminal \"on the ground that his three convictions for aggravated robbery were not committed 'on occasions different from one another' \"-and denied relief on the three remaining claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the government argued that even if Snider's three prior aggravated burglary convictions should only collectively count as one crime of violence, Snider still qualified as a career offender because he had an additional qualifying conviction listed in the presentence report; that the ineffective assistance\n   of counsel issue was not fairly raised in Snider's motion; and that there was no evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel because Snider did not suffer any prejudice as a result of his attorney's failure to object to sentencing based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 23, 2013, Snider filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to supplement his \u00a7 2255 motion based on\n   <em>\n    Alleyne v.

On November 14, 2013, the district court granted the motion to supplement and denied relief on the first and supplemental claims. The court agreed with the government that although the three aggravated burglaries should have been counted as only a single predicate, Snider was properly classified as a career offender based on the additional aggravated burglary conviction listed in the presentence report but not specifically designated as a predicate offense. The court failed to see the relevance of\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   and concluded that Snider was not entitled to relief on the supplemental issue presented. Moreover, it stated that \"this Court is bound by the Sixth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Nance\n   </em>\n   that 'Tennessee aggravated burglary represents a generic burglary[.]\" Thus, the district court determined that none of the issues raised in Snider's \u00a7 2255 motion had merit and further declined to issue a certificate of appealability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 16, 2013, Snider filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for reconsideration under Fed.

He contends that the offense of aggravated burglary under Tennessee law is not categorically a crime of violence under the Career Offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a) because it is not a \"generic\" burglary. That argument is without merit. As the Court noted in the order denying the \u00a7 2255 motion, the Sixth Circuit held, in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Relatedly, he argues that because of ineffective assistance of counsel, he was incorrectly assessed as a career offender under the Sentencing Guidelines. The government has several responses: First, that Snider's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Stitt\n   </em>\n   is misplaced because\n   <em>\n    Stitt\n   </em>\n   dealt with the definition of generic burglary in the ACCA, and Snider's sentence is based on the advisory sentencing guidelines. So, Snider has forfeited his argument on appeal. Second, that Snider cannot challenge an advisory guidelines calculation on collateral review. Third, that Snider procedurally defaulted his claim by failing to raise it during sentencing, and he cannot show cause and prejudice to excuse his default. Fourth, that Snider received effective assistance from his sentencing counsel and suffered no prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Stitt\n   </em>\n   , the en banc court held that because Tennessee's aggravated burglary statute is both broader than the generic form of burglary and indivisible, such a conviction does not categorically qualify as \"violent felony\" under the ACCA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n   <em>\n    Stitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276330\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/854/\">\n    860 F.3d at 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, although I do not believe the mere distinction between mandatory and advisory guidelines should automatically doom advisory guideline claims brought under \u00a7 2255, in any case the advisory guidelines have an extraordinary impact and in certain scenarios the same \"miscarriages of justice\" may occur with advisory guideline errors if left uncorrected as with mandatory guideline errors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355560\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/591/#p596\">\n    836 F.3d at 596-97, 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determining that a prisoner's mandatory-guideline sentence could constitute a \"miscarriage of justice\" warranting a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   petition);\n   <em>\n    Narvaez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3748788\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/621/#p629\">\n    674 F.3d at 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that an improperly calculated pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   sentence could form the basis of a cognizable \u00a7 2255 claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

I do not believe these factors apply in such a way as to bar all individuals from relief under \u00a7 2255. For instance, in a case in which a defendant was incorrectly designated as a career offender based on later-determined judicial error, the \"integrity of the judicial system\" would hardly be supported by requiring that defendant to remain in prison, particularly if he has consistently (and correctly) argued as to the inapplicability of the enhancement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054774\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/1132/#p1144\">\n    773 F.3d at 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Martin, J., dissenting);\n   <em>\n    Sun Bear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5649094\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/700/#p701\">\n    644 F.3d at 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Melloy, J., dissenting) (\"[D]enying relief does not build confidence in our court system because this looks to the world like a court refusing to acknowledge or make amends for its own mistake.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gilbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203153\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/1293/#p1334\">\n    640 F.3d at 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Martin, J., dissenting) ) ). Similarly, because these cases present purely legal questions (whether an individual is a \"career offender\" under the guidelines), there is no concern that evidence will have been lost or destroyed; in most cases, the defendant will still be guilty and his criminal history will remain the same.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054774\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/1132/#p1144\">\n    773 F.3d at 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Martin, J., dissenting). And because these cases involve federal sentencing statutes and guidelines, \"[t]he contrary result dictated by the majority's holding promotes finality at the expense of justice in a situation where, unlike most AEDPA cases, there are no concerns of comity or federalism.\"\n   <em>\n    Sun Bear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5649094\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/700/#p701\">\n    644 F.3d at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Melloy, J., dissenting).
