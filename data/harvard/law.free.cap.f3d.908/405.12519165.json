(collectively, \"ABS\") appeal from the grant of summary judgment by the Central District of California in favor of CBS Corporation and CBS Radio, Inc. (collectively, \"CBS\"), holding that CBS did not violate any state law copyrights possessed by ABS in sound recordings originally fixed before 1972. ABS also appeals from the district court's striking of its class action certification, and certain evidentiary rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We conclude that the district court erred in finding a lack of a genuine issue of material fact about the copyright eligibility of remastered sound recordings distributed by CBS. We also conclude that the district court abused its discretion by excluding the testimony of ABS's expert Paul Geluso, excluding the Triton Reports as evidence of CBS's performance of ABS's sound recordings in California, and granting partial summary judgment of no infringement with respect to the samples contained in those reports. Finally, we conclude that the district court's strict application of its local rules with respect to the timeliness of ABS's motion for class action certification was inconsistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and was thus an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the grant of summary judgment and the striking of class certification, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 1971, Congress passed the Sound Recording Act. This Act for the first time created federal copyright protection for certain sound recordings. Under that law, sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972 were made subject to a compulsory license regime for performance via digital transmission and were excused from infringement for performance via terrestrial radio.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20114\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ABS owns sound recordings embodying musical performances initially fixed in analog format prior to February 15, 1972 (\"pre-1972 sound recordings\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As digital\n   formats replaced analog ones, ABS hired remastering engineers to remaster the pre-1972 sound recordings onto digital formats (\"remastered sound recordings\"). In doing so, ABS determined to optimize the recordings for the new digital format using standard, technical processes to create accurate reproductions of its original pre-1972 analog recordings and did not set out to create any new and different sound recordings. ABS contends that this resulted in a change in quality but not a substantial difference in the identity or essential character of the sound recordings themselves. ABS argues that injecting a substantial difference in the digital remasters from their analog originals would have diminished the value of the remastered sound recordings, contrary to ABS's objective in seeking to fully exploit its intellectual property in those sound recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ABS did not enter copies of the contracts between ABS and the remastering engineers into the record, but both parties agree that ABS authorized the creation of the remastered sound recordings at issue here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no dispute that the remastered sound recordings contain only the sounds (i.e. the vocals and instruments) originally performed and fixed in the studio before 1972 and contained in the pre-1972 sound recordings, and that no sounds were removed or rearranged from the original fixed version. ABS agrees that the remastered sound recordings are not identical to the pre-1972 sound recordings, but contends that any differences were trivial and of no copyrightable consequence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   CBS delivers music content through terrestrial radio and digital streaming, including 18 music stations in California that are themselves streamed over the internet in \"simulcast.\" CBS's Radio 2.0 system logs \"all sound recordings it digitally transmits over the Internet,\" and a third party, Triton, tracks CBS's simulcasts. CBS does not use any analog sound recordings; it exclusively relies on digitally mastered or remastered sound recordings for the content it delivers to its customers. For all the broadcast content, CBS paid a royalty to the owner of the underlying musical composition. For the digitally streamed content, CBS paid the compulsory license fee under the Sound Recording Act to Sound Exchange. For content delivered by terrestrial radio, CBS does not pay a license fee pursuant, as permitted, to the Sound Recording Act's safe haven for terrestrial radio performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20114\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 17, 2015, ABS filed a putative class action against CBS in the Central District of California, alleging that CBS's transmission and distribution of the remastered sound recordings violated California state law-specifically, California Civil Code \u00a7 980(a)(2) (protecting the property rights of an author of a sound recording fixed prior to February 15, 1972); misappropriation and conversion; and unfair competition, under California Business and Professions Code \u00a7 17200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On November 17, 2015, the district court denied a joint stipulation to extend the 90-day deadline for filing a motion for class action certification to allow for class certification discovery, explaining that there was \"no show of cause, let alone good cause.\" On November 19, 2015, the expiration date\n   of the local rule's 90-day deadline for filing of class certification, the court denied without explanation another joint stipulation to extend the filing date. That same day, ABS timely filed a motion for class certification. On November 25, 2015, the district court struck the motion for class certification because it set a hearing date for the motion beyond the 35-day period after service of process as required by the court's standing orders and it did not include a statement pursuant to Local Rule 7-3 that a \"conference of counsel\" took place prior to the filing of the motion. The court then struck ABS's class allegations as untimely filed under Local Rule 23-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   CBS thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the remastered sound recordings were authorized original derivative works, subject only to federal copyright law. In support of its motion, CBS submitted declarations from music engineers, including from Durand R. Begault, attesting that the remastering process involved originality and aesthetic judgment. In response, ABS submitted expert declarations of its own, including from Paul Geluso, who testified that the pre-1972 and remastered recordings \"embodied\" the same performance based on waveform, spectral, and critical listening analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court decided two important evidentiary issues and granted summary judgment to CBS. The district court excluded Geluso's testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p589\">\n    509 U.S. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 589-90,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p589\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p589\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) as \"unscientific\" and \"unnecessary to aid a fact finder capable of listening to the sound recordings on his or her own,\" and, \"[a]lternatively\" because Geluso's testimony was \"irrelevant.\" The court reasoned that Geluso limited his forensic analysis to only the first five seconds of each sound recording, which was \"clearly inadequate to rule out the possibility that non-trivial differences exist between the [pre-1972 and remastered sound recordings].\" The court also rejected Geluso's reliance on \"critical listening\" as undefined and unscientific, and objected to Geluso's failure to include in his report the results of his phase inversion testing, which the court categorized as \"adverse to Plaintiffs' position.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Considering only Begault's expert testimony, the district court then held that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the remastering created original derivative works protected by federal copyright law. The district court explained that \"during the remastering process, at least some perceptible changes were made to Plaintiff's Pre-1972 Sound Recordings,\" and that these changes were not merely \"mechanical\" or \"trivial\" changes, but rather \"reflect multiple kinds of creative authorship, such as adjustments of equalization, sound editing, and channel assignment.\" The court thus concluded that as to the 57 works reviewed by both parties' experts, the remastered sound recordings were entitled to federal copyright protection as original derivative works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Next, the district court concluded that ABS authorized the creation of the remastered sound recordings, because ABS had failed to meet its burden to show that its authorization to create the remastered sound recordings did not extend to the creation of a derivative work, and because, in any event, \"the right to claim copyright in a non-infringing derivative work arises by operation of law, not through authority from the copyright owner of the underlying work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The district court also concluded that, because the remastered sound recordings, created after 1972, were original and authorized,\n   the remastered sound recordings were exclusively governed by federal copyright law. Therefore, the district court held, CBS had the right to perform the remastered sound recordings by complying with the statutory compulsory license obligations and taking advantage of the terrestrial radio performance safe harbor under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20114\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court assumed that because the right to perform the remastered sound recordings had been secured, CBS's performance of the remastered sound recordings could not infringe the pre-1972 sound recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The district court also held, in the alternative, that CBS was entitled to partial summary judgment of non-infringement with respect to 126 of the 174 representative remastered sound recordings because ABS failed to provide evidence of CBS's performance of those sound recordings. The evidence presented with respect to the 174 samples breaks down as follows. Sixty samples were contained in CBS's internal digital audio library, Radio 2.0, which tracks broadcast or transmission via CBS's internet-only radio stations. The parties agree that for 48 of these, ABS presented evidence of CBS's broadcast or transmission of sound recordings embodying the same performances as ABS's pre-1972 sound recordings. The parties also agree that nine sound recordings were not infringing because CBS's records show that it broadcast versions based on different performances than the pre-1972 sound recordings. Three of these sound recordings were not reviewed by the parties' experts. An additional 40 samples were contained exclusively in the Triton Reports, which are created by a third-party company to track \"simulcasts\"-live internet streams-of CBS's radio broadcasts across the United States. The parties do not discuss on appeal the evidence available with respect to the remaining 74 sound recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The district court concluded that the Triton Reports were hearsay and did not fall within the business records exception because \"Plaintiffs have failed to establish any one of the requirements necessary for them to be admitted under the business records exceptions.\" The district court thus concluded that ABS had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to CBS's transmission or broadcast in California of all but the 48 samples both parties agree CBS transmitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   ABS appealed each of the adverse rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , asking whether the moving party has met its burden to prove the absence of genuine issues of material fact.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Auto Parts Net., Inc. v.

This is known as the\n   <em>\n    Durham\n   </em>\n   test. Both prongs arise out of Copyright's basic focus on originality.

In most circumstances, derivative works contain obvious creative contributions and so are easily recognizable as distinct from the underlying work. The casting, lighting, cinematography, props, editing, acting, and directing required to craft a movie from a screenplay, for example, easily render the movie distinct from the screenplay. Likewise, the authors of most sound recordings that use a sample of another sound recording to create distinct derivative works do so by adding new vocals, instruments, and edits to the underlying sample. Where the alleged derivative work, however, is intended as, and is in fact, a direct representation of the original work, the contributions of the derivative work author are harder to identify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This court applied the two-part\n   <em>\n    Durham\n   </em>\n   test in\n   <em>\n    Entertainment Research Group, Inc. v.

Finally, the court considered Toyota's intent in authorizing Meshwerks to create an accurate representation of Toyota's vehicles, not something new and different: \"If an artist affirmatively sets out to be unoriginal-to make a copy of someone else's creation, rather than to create an original work-it is far more likely that the resultant product will, in fact, be unoriginal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581215\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/528/1258/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Second Circuit considered the originality needed to justify copyright protection for a derivative work in\n   <em>\n    L.

The essential character and identity of a sound recording include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the aggregate of the \"emphasis or the shading of a musical note, the tone of voice, the inflection, the timing of a vocal rendition, musical or spoken,\" 1 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 2.10 (2018); the choice of instrumental, vocal and percussion components; and the subtleties of dynamics and other performance characteristics that together result in \"something irreducible, which is one [band's] alone.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bleistein v.

Such factors distinguish an original vocal rendition of a song from the vocal rendition of the same song by another singer and are not present when an original vocal rendition is merely remastered. A remastering, for example, of Tony Bennett's \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" recording from its original analog format into digital format, even with declicking, noise reduction and small changes in volume or emphasis, is no less Bennett's \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" recording-it retains the same essential character and identity as the underlying original sound recording, notwithstanding the presence of trivial, minor or insignificant changes from the original. That is so even if the digital version would be perceived by a listener to be a brighter or cleaner rendition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   If an allegedly derivative sound recording does not add or remove any sounds from the underlying sound recording, does not change the sequence of the sounds, and does not remix or otherwise alter the sounds in sequence or character, the recording is likely to be nothing more than a copy of the underlying sound recording and is presumptively devoid of the original sound recording authorship required for copyright protection. Such a work lacks originality. This presumption may, of course, be overcome, by showing that the work contains independent creative content, recognizable contributions of sound recording authorship or variations in defining aspects that give a derivative sound recording a new and different essential character and identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A number of practical considerations, including but not limited to the considerations that follow, inform a determination of the essential character and identity of a remastered sound recording.

In doing so, the district court placed critical reliance on the testimony of CBS's\n   expert, Begault.

In its brief to this court, CBS explained that the reason for the remastering was to overcome the technical limitations of vinyl using the \"nearly unlimited\" sound range that CDs could reproduce. William Inglot, a remastering engineer responsible for some of the remastered sound recordings here and one of CBS's witnesses, testified that his goal was to do a \"good job,\" to \"do a better version of maybe what the production process was at that time because you have a little more control than maybe they had,\" by \"taking advantage of the technology.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Begault analyzed the differences between the pre-1972 sound recordings and the remastered sound recordings using sensitive digital analysis and concluded that the remastered sound recordings would be different if there was\n   <em>\n    any difference\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the four analyzed characteristics. But Begault nowhere analyzed whether the changes he identified reflected any original sound recording authorship that might have changed the essential character and identity of the resulting sound recordings. The technical changes as measured by sensitive digital analysis does not necessarily result in a change in the essential character and identity of the work in question. ABS's expert, Geluso, aptly explained this shortcoming of Begault's analysis: \"I believe that two sound recordings would have to be nearly identical to pass all four of [Begault's] tests. For example, Begault set a standard of 1 dB of loudness differential for two recordings as his passing mark. This is unreasonably extreme. In my experience, 1dB of dynamic range compression is barely audible and will most likely go undetected by a listener.\" Geluso also explained that the spectral balance of a sound recording can be adjusted on most consumer listening equipment, and the loudness can be adjusted on most consumer software used to create and edit music. It is unlikely that such changes-even if made with more technical expertise by a remastering engineer and fixed in a sound recording-would amount to a change in the essential character and identity of the sound recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The district court excluded several paragraphs of Geluso's declaration as unscientific, based on unreliable methodology, lacking adequate foundation as expert testimony, unnecessary and irrelevant. The district court found Geluso's critical listening methods to be unscientific, and \"unexplained in Mr. Geluso's declaration.\" But in his declaration, Geluso cited an FBI report on forensic sound recording analysis that held out critical listening as an essential component of forensic audio analysis. Also, despite Geluso's testimony that he critically listened to all of the recordings he examined, the district court found fatally deficient the fact that Geluso limited his waveform and spectral analysis to the first five seconds of each recording. While the shortness of the technical analysis impacts the weight of that testimony, there is no reason to question the science behind or the methodology of such testing for whatever it may show. And the district court failed to explain why five seconds of waveform analysis was insufficient to determine whether the pre-1972 and remastered sound recordings embodied the same performances. Moreover, Geluso's testimony, offered in rebuttal to the testimony of CBS's expert, Begault, addressed the nature and extent of the differences between the original analog recordings and the digitally remastered sound recordings and was thus directly relevant to the issue of originality before the court. The district court also found deficient the fact that Geluso excluded from his report a phase inversion test from the first test he attempted. But that is not an adequate basis to exclude Geluso's testimony. That test merely identifies the fact of difference-something that ABS and Geluso do not contest exists between the pre-1972 and remastered sound recordings. The district court's exclusion of Geluso's testimony was an abuse of discretion, and his testimony should be considered in full by the district court on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The district court also erred in failing to consider ABS's objective in creating the digital remasters. ABS hired recording engineers to create digitally remastered sound recordings of the pre-1972 sound recordings in order to allow for digital distribution and compilation albums and to take advantage of the improvements enabled by digital technology, not to introduce any substantive changes. As one ABS representative explained: \"we understood as the technology increased, as things went from LP and cassette to CD [that the recordings would be re-mastered] ... in such a way that they could be CD's made out of them. They had to go digital. We knew they were going to have to be converted analog to digital.\" Plaintiff Brunswick's representative agreed, stating that \"in order to release recordings in a digital format that they would in fact be remastered.\" And Inglot testified that his goal was to \"do a better version of maybe what the production process was at that time because you have a little more control than maybe they had\" by \"taking advantage of the technology.\" Another declaration submitted by Plaintiffs averred that they \"never would have permitted a Licensee to make any substantial or non-trivial changes to the sound of the Recordings when creating a remastered copy.\" Nothing in the record suggests that ABS set out to make any substantive changes or distinguishable variations that would give the digital remasters a different essential character or identity, to add any original sound recording authorship or to do anything other than make accurate copies in digital format of the original analog sound recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Notwithstanding the above, CBS argues that all that is needed to support copyright is \"more than a merely trivial variation,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Schrock v. Learning Curve Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3487424\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/513/#p521\">\n    586 F.3d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 521 (7th Cir. 2009), and that this is the test mandated by\n   <em>\n    U.S. Auto Parts\n   </em>\n   and properly adopted by the district court. CBS argues that it met its burden when it pointed out deficiencies in ABS's claims, and that ABS failed to provide significant probative evidence that the differences between the pre-1972 and the remastered sound recordings were mechanical, trivial, or insufficiently original.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   CBS is correct that the threshold of creativity for copyright eligibility often is characterized as minimal, and that the courts police the amount of creativity only within the \"narrowest and most obvious limits.\"\n   <em>\n    Bleistein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11726337\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/188/239/#p250\">\n    188 U.S. at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11726337\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/188/239/#p250\">\n    23 S.Ct. 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 1 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 2.01[B][1] (2018). But that relatively low bar does not eliminate the fundamental requirement of originality that is the touchstone of copyright protection. Here, the district court's identification of \"perceptible changes\" between the recordings in characteristics relating to \"quality\" did not ensure that the remastered versions contained\n   <em>\n    anything of consequence\n   </em>\n   owing its origin to the remastering engineers. As discussed above, a derivative sound recording that merely exhibits perceptible changes does not necessarily exhibit a change to the essential character and identity of the work or reflect the addition of even a minimal amount of sound recording authorship or originality.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   1 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 3.03 (2018) (\"Any variation will not suffice, but one that is sufficient to render the derivative work distinguishable from its prior work in any meaningful manner will be sufficient.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   CBS also argues that \"copyrightability is [ ] purpose-agnostic,\" and that the creation of a derivative work for \"the purpose of migrating expression from one format to another\" is a proper copyrightable purpose, relying on\n   <em>\n    New York Times Co. v.

For example, Inglot testified that his goal was to \"do a better version of maybe what the production process was at that time because you have a little more control than maybe they had\" by \"taking advantage of the technology.\" Although we do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   hold that a remastered sound recording\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   be eligible for a derivative work copyright, a digitally remastered sound recording made as a copy of the original analog sound recording will rarely exhibit the necessary originality to qualify for independent copyright protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The second prong of the\n   <em>\n    U.S. Auto Parts\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Durham\n   </em>\n   test requires that a copyright-eligible derivative work must \"reflect the degree to which it relies on preexisting material and must not in any\n   way affect the scope of any copyright protection in that preexisting material.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Auto Parts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514268\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/1009/#p1014\">\n    692 F.3d at 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Were ABS intent on granting an authorization to create an intentionally derivative work, for example by authorizing use of the underlying works as samples or remixes, those authorized works would be at high risk of infringement suits from the remastered sound recording copyright holders. This risk would, in effect, grant the remastered sound recording copyright holder a \"de facto monopoly\" on derivative works.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1224. Indeed, in this case, where the underlying and derivative works are both sound recordings with few, if any, readily discernable differences, and the derivative work is the only one available in the vastly more accessible and marketable digital medium, the danger that the copyright holder of the derivative work could bring suit against a potential licensee of the underlying work is particularly acute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   If, on remand, the factfinder concludes that any or all of the remastered sound recordings here\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   manifest a change sufficient to create a derivative, copyrightable work, the factfinder should also consider the effect of recognizing a copyright in the remastered sound recording on ABS's ability to exercise whatever copyrights it may possess in the pre-1972 sound recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For the above reasons, we conclude that the district court erred in holding that there were no genuine issues of material fact that the remastered sound recordings used by CBS were independently copyright eligible. We therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment to CBS as to that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The parties here dispute whether ABS authorized the remastering engineer to create derivative works, whether such permission was necessary, and which party bears the burden to show such authorization\n   (or lack thereof).

Evidence 803(6) when:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (A) the record was made at or near the time by-or from information transmitted by-someone with knowledge;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (B) the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   (D) all these conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness, ... and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (E) the opponent does not show that the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Fed. R. Evidence 803(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   ABS argues that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting the Triton Reports because those reports fit squarely within the business records hearsay exception. CBS argues that Mr. Neiman, a CBS employee relied upon by ABS to provide the foundation for the business records exception, did not know how the Triton Reports were made or maintained,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NLRB v. First Termite Control Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217950\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/646/424/#p427\">\n    646 F.2d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 427 (9th Cir. 1981), and was not a Triton employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   We conclude that Mr. Neiman was qualified to establish the foundation for the business records exception, and that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the Triton Reports. The business records exception only requires \"someone with knowledge\" about the record-keeping, not necessarily an employee of the business or someone with knowledge of how the reports were made or maintained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FDIC v. Staudinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615045\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/797/908/#p910\">\n    797 F.2d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 910 (10th Cir. 1986). Mr. Neiman testified that Triton was hired by CBS to create the reports, and that CBS sent those reports to Sound Exchange to determine artist royalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We agree with ABS that\n   <em>\n    First Termite Control\n   </em>\n   is inapposite here.\n   <em>\n    First Termite Control\n   </em>\n   held that business records, to be admissible under the business records exception, must be supported by testimony of a witness knowledgeable about the creation and maintenance of those records.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217950\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/646/424/#p427\">\n    646 F.2d at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But in that case, the accuracy of the records was contested. Here, CBS itself relied on the reports to establish its royalty payments to Sound Exchange in the ordinary course of business. The accuracy of the records is not in question. In a similar situation, we have held that third party reports of this kind fall within the business records exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Childs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517804\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/5/1328/\">\n    5 F.3d 1328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1334 and n.3 (9th Cir. 1993) (distinguishing\n   <em>\n    First Termite Control\n   </em>\n   due to reliance on third party reports by company challenging their admissibility). CBS has presented no evidence or argument showing that the Triton Reports were unreliable or inaccurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The district court also held that, if it were to consider the Triton Reports, it would nevertheless conclude that the listing of a name and song title in the Triton Reports was legally insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact \"[a]bsent the comparative analysis\" to show that the performed sound recordings were not different recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   We conclude that the district court here erroneously decided a genuine issue of material fact at summary judgment. We agree with ABS that the Triton Reports contain an album title, and sometimes the company label, and so would be sufficient for a jury to infer that the records CBS performed were the versions captured in Plaintiffs' pre-1972 sound recordings. The Triton Reports were used by CBS to govern the royalties paid to recording artists via Sound Exchange; CBS has failed to present evidence that these same reports were not sufficient to identify the recording artists or the versions performed. The district court erred in finding the absence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the samples listed in the Triton Reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   VI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finally, we address the district court's dismissal of ABS's class certification motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Central District of California Local Rule 23-3 requires Plaintiffs to file a motion for class certification within ninety days after service of the complaint. The parties here twice stipulated to extend the deadline, explaining in the second stipulation that ABS needed more time for class action-focused discovery. The district court denied the first stipulation for failure to show good cause, and denied the second without explanation. The district court did not address the asserted need for pre-certification discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Despite the district court's rulings, ABS timely filed its motion for class certification\n   on November 19, 2015. The district court struck the motion because of two technical deficiencies: (1) noticing the hearing outside the thirty-five-day period required by the Judge's Standing Order and (2) not including in the notice of motion a statement that the parties had met and conferred and the date on which such a conference took place, as required by Local Rule 7-3. Having thus stricken the timely motion, the district court then dismissed the motion for class certification for failure to file a timely motion for class certification under Local Rule 23-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   ABS argues that the district court abused its discretion in striking the timely filed motion as a sanction for what it categorizes as \"trivial\" omissions in the notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Central District of California Local Rule 23-3 sets a strict 90-day time frame from the filing of a complaint to the motion for class action certification. This bright line rule is in direct contrast to the flexibility of the Federal Rule, which calls for a determination on class certification \"[a]t an early practicable time after a person sues or is sued as a class representative.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(A). That flexible approach makes sense. The class action determination can only be decided after the district court undertakes a \"rigorous analysis\" of the prerequisites for certification.\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.
