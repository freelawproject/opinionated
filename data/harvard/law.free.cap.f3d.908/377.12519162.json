Tripler's Department of Ministry and Pastoral Care (DMPC) provides religious services for patients, hospital staff, military personnel, and their families. In 1992, the Government contracted with the Theatine Fathers, a Catholic religious order, for the services of a priest. The Theatine Fathers assigned Matson to serve at Tripler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Government did not do a background check on Matson. It relied on an ecclesiastical endorsement by the Archdiocese of Military Services. The endorsement certified that an individual \"[i]s a fully qualified member of the clergy of a religious faith group represented by the certifying Agency\" and met \"the requirements established by the Military Departments for appointment as an officer and a chaplain.\" To obtain the endorsement, Matson submitted information on his criminal history. Matson then had no prior convictions and no pending charges against him. Matson, however, had a history of sexual abuse allegations. In 1987, Matson was arrested for fondling two teenage boys, and in 1989, he was charged with the sexual assault of a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under his contract, Matson's primary duty was to conduct Mass several times a week. At the request of families-without seeking prior approval from the DMPC-he conducted Confraternity of Christian Doctrine classes to help prepare children for their first Holy Communion. These were not required by the contract. As a child, Michael Croyle attended Mass at Tripler. He alleges that Matson sexually assaulted him six different times while escorting him to CCD classes after Mass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Croyle, by his parent and legal guardian, sued the United States for negligence and negligent supervision. He alleges the Government knew or should have known about Matson's history of sexual abuse and was negligent in failing to warn families of his sexual propensities. Further, Croyle claims the Government breached its duty of care by failing to prevent Matson from having contact with children. The district court found the United States was entitled to sovereign immunity and dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). Croyle appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In deciding a motion under Rule 12(b)(1), the district court must distinguish between a facial attack-where it looks only to the face of the pleadings-and a factual attack-where it may consider matters outside the pleadings.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Osborn v.
