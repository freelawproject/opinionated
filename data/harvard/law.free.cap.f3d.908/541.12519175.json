The term \"particularly serious crime\" requires the agency to place the alien's conviction along a spectrum of seriousness. The surrounding text provides two clues as to whether a crime is \"particularly serious\": the crime must allow an inference that the person is a \"danger to the community of\n   the United States\"; and aggravated felonies with resulting sentences of at least five years are per se particularly serious, though the statutory text makes clear that other crimes, too, may be particularly serious. As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Alphonsus\n   </em>\n   , the per se category \"suggest[s] the types of crimes most likely to be covered by the statute even when the aggregate sentence is less than five years.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658913\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/705/1031/#p1037\">\n    705 F.3d at 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We know with certainty that a minor traffic infraction is not \"particularly serious\" and that a heinous, violent crime is \"particularly serious.\" But for the crimes in between, the statute provides little guidance. Instead, the statute provides an uncertain standard to be applied to a wide range of fact-specific scenarios. In that sense, the standard is uncertain. But that kind of uncertainty does not mean that a statute is unconstitutionally vague. Many statutes provide uncertain standards and, so long as those standards are applied to real-world facts, the statutes are almost certainly constitutional. The problem in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   was not that the terms were uncertain in isolation; the problem was that the uncertainty had to be applied to an idealized crime:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Many laws] require gauging the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages\n   <em>\n    on a particular occasion\n   </em>\n   . As a general matter, we do not doubt the constitutionality of laws that call for the application of a qualitative standard such as \"substantial risk\" to real-world conduct; the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends on his estimating rightly some matter of degree. The residual clause, however, requires application of the \"serious potential risk\" standard to an idealized ordinary case of the crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation, ellipsis, and some internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Many perfectly constitutional statutes use imprecise terms like \"serious potential risk\" (as in ACCA's residual clause) or \"substantial risk\" (as in \u00a7 16 's). The problem came from layering such a standard on top of the requisite \"ordinary case\" inquiry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Critically, the \"particularly serious crime\" inquiry in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(B)(ii) applies\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to real-world facts. Unlike many standards in the immigration context, the \"particularly serious crime\" inquiry requires the BIA to assess what the alien actually did; \"the categorical and modified categorical approaches ... are not applicable to evaluating whether a crime is 'particularly serious,' \"\n   <em>\n    Anaya-Ortiz v.

Accordingly, the fatal combination at issue in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   is absent here. The \"particularly serious crime\" inquiry requires an imprecise line-drawing exercise, but it is no less certain than the \"perfectly constitutional statutes\" that the Supreme Court discussed.\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in determining that Petitioner committed a particularly serious crime. Accordingly, we deny the petition with respect to both forms of withholding of removal. But we hold that substantial evidence does not support the BIA's determination concerning deferral of removal under CAT. We therefore grant the petition in that respect.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
