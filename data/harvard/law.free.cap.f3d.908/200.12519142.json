Under \u00a7 16(b), a shareholder can bring an insider trading action to disgorge \"short-swing\" profits that an insider obtained improperly. But there is a catch. Although the shareholder can bring the lawsuit, any recovery goes only to the company. In other words, \u00a7 16(b) allows a shareholder to pursue\n   claims on behalf of the company. This creates a problem for Olagues because he begins most of his lawsuits in the same way: without an attorney. And because a pro se plaintiff cannot represent the interests of a company, we affirm the district court's decision that Olagues cannot proceed pro se under \u00a7 16(b). But we remand to give Olagues the opportunity to retain counsel and file an amended complaint with counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This lawsuit dates from February 2015 when Ward Timken, Jr., president and CEO of TimkenSteel Corporation, exercised a stock option and transferred TimkenSteel stock that he owned back to the company. But less than six months later, Mr. Timken purchased TimkenSteel stocks on the open market. After discovering this transaction, Olagues contacted Mr. Timken and TimkenSteel asserting that Olagues was a shareholder and that, on behalf of TimkenSteel, he was seeking recovery of the short swing profits earned by Mr. Timken through his trading.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Timken and TimkenSteel informed Olagues that they would not make any payments to him personally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Olagues then filed a complaint under \u00a7 16(b), alleging that Mr. Timken had engaged in short-swing trading by purchasing new TimkenSteel stock on the open market within six months of transferring his old stock to TimkenSteel. He sought $554,700 in damages-the profit Mr. Timken earned through the purportedly forbidden trade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Timken and TimkenSteel moved to strike Olagues' complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f). They argued that TimkenSteel was the real party in interest and that, as a pro se litigant, Olagues could not represent TimkenSteel's interests or those of other shareholders. The district court agreed-granting the motion to strike Olagues' complaint and dismissing the action. As the district court explained, Olagues, as a pro se litigant, could not pursue a \u00a7 16(b) claim on behalf of TimkenSteel because he would be representing the interests of the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Olagues then moved for reconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), but the district court summarily denied the motion. On appeal, Olagues argues that \u00a7 16(b) provides for a private right of action and contains no textual requirement that a shareholder obtain counsel. We review de novo the district court's decision to dismiss the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winget v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130233,3780215\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/565/\">\n    537 F.3d 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 572 (6th Cir. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This is not Olagues' first lawsuit. Instead, this action is one of Olagues' many \u00a7 16(b) lawsuits around the country. By defendants' count, this appears to be one of at least fourteen lawsuits that Olagues filed within just the last two years. But there is some confusion over whether Olagues can maintain these lawsuits pro se. Many district courts have dismissed Olagues' complaints with instructions to obtain counsel and file an amended complaint through counsel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Olagues v.

June 6, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   But other courts, including the Second Circuit, have considered the merits of Olagues' \u00a7 16(b) suits despite his pro se status.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Olagues v.
