On December 1, 1993, the district court revoked Okpala's certificate of naturalization because of his conviction for procuring naturalization unlawfully. Okpala swore in his naturalization application that he had not knowingly committed any crime for which he had not been arrested. In light of the October convictions, this was false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") issued an Order to Show Cause in January 1994 and began deportation proceedings. The Government charged Okpala as being removable as an alien with controlled substance and aggravated felony convictions. Because Okpala was in the custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons serving his criminal sentence, an IJ administratively closed the immigration proceedings in May 1995. Twenty years later, in anticipation of Okpala's release, the DHS moved to recalendar Okpala's immigration proceedings and transfer the proceedings to the Immigration Court in Oakdale, Louisiana, where Okpala was detained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The motion was granted on January 21, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Okpala moved to terminate his deportation proceedings. He argued that the order revoking naturalization was invalid and that he was a United States citizen. He initially conceded both charges of deportability before later denying them. The DHS submitted an exhibit with records of his criminal convictions. Okpala objected, arguing that the Government did not timely file the exhibit and the documents were insufficient. Okpala also argued that his 1993 convictions did not qualify as criminal convictions for immigration purposes. On May 31, 2016, the IJ denied the motion to terminate proceedings, because the denaturalization order sufficiently established that Okpala was no longer a United States citizen and the record contained sufficient evidence to establish the criminal convictions. The IJ additionally concluded that the heroin-related convictions were aggravated felonies that constituted violations of a law relating to a controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Okpala filed a motion to reconsider the May 31, 2016 order and a second motion to terminate proceedings. Okpala challenged the determination that he was not a United States citizen and the validity of his 1993 criminal convictions. The IJ denied the motion to reconsider and the second motion to terminate and ordered that Okpala be deported to Nigeria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Okpala appealed the IJ's denial of his motions to reconsider and terminate. He argued that, under\n   <em>\n    Costello v. INS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379789\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/120/\">\n    376 U.S. 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379789\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/120/\">\n    84 S.Ct. 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379789\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/120/\">\n    11 L.Ed.2d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1964), he was a United States citizen at the time of the 1993 convictions, so he was not an alien under the general deportation statutes. He also contended that the denaturalization order was void for failure to comply with procedural and substantive provisions; the record of the 1993 convictions was untimely and lacked foundation; the DHS did not submit a \"nonpoisonous\" jury verdict of the 1993 convictions; the 1993 convictions constituted in absentia convictions and did not attain a substantial degree of finality; the instant removal proceeding was barred by collateral estoppel and res judicata; and his due process rights were violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The BIA concluded that the IJ properly determined that Okpala was convicted of an aggravated felony. The BIA also concluded that, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, a prior denaturalization judgment conclusively established the ultimate facts in a subsequent deportation hearing. The BIA did not have jurisdiction to look at these ultimate facts and was precluded from reconsideration of issues of law resolved by the prior court arising from identical facts. The BIA noted that Okpala's denaturalization order was affirmed on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The BIA also determined that Okpala, now an alien, was amenable to deportation proceedings. The BIA distinguished\n   <em>\n    Costello\n   </em>\n   from the instant case on grounds that a judicial recommendation against deportation was unavailable to Okpala but had been central to\n   <em>\n    Costello\n   </em>\n   's holding. As to the Due Process claim, the BIA determined that Okpala was afforded ample opportunity to present evidence on his behalf, had submitted substantial written and oral contentions to the IJ, and the IJ had considered those contentions. As Okpala failed to identify any specific action by the IJ resulting in actual prejudice, the BIA concluded that Okpala failed to show that the proceedings below were fundamentally unfair and dismissed the appeal. Okpala timely filed his petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We review the BIA's findings of fact for substantial evidence; that review includes the IJ's judgment to the extent it influenced the BIA's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Sealed Petitioner v.

Thus, this argument also fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Okpala argues that the IJ and BIA erroneously determined that collateral estoppel applied to the instant case, so the IJ and BIA did not address his affirmative defenses regarding the denaturalization order and the 1993 convictions. Because the denaturalization was mandated by statute, Okpala's convictions were affirmed on direct appeal, and the Supreme Court denied certiorari, the BIA correctly rejected his arguments regarding the validity of the denaturalization order and the 1993 convictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1451(e) ;\n   <em>\n    Okpala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20154636\">\n    1997 WL 154636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 ;\n   <em>\n    Okpala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11611201,11611493,11611334,11611559,11611080,11611243,11610988,11611629,11611438,11611121,11611698,11611031,11611384,11611737,11611290,11611164\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/1097/\">\n    522 U.S. at 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=118%20S.%20Ct.%20895\">\n    118 S.Ct. 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we grant petition for review and vacate the deportation order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   My able colleague has written reasonably based on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Costello v.

But under the\n   <em>\n    Costello\n   </em>\n   decision, this is an absurd result. Okpala was convicted on the same day of serious heroin trafficking charges, in which he engaged throughout his naturalization proceedings, and also of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201425\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which criminalizes fraudulent procurement of citizenship, because of exactly the same trafficking. As the government points out, Okpala's denaturalization was automatic following the \u00a7 1425 conviction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201451\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The six-week\n   delay in the court's entry of a denaturalization order was mere formality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Costello\n   </em>\n   should be distinguishable because of the conjunction of reasons that exists here between the fraudulent naturalization and the heroin convictions. In\n   <em>\n    Costello\n   </em>\n   , the man's naturalization fraud concerned his misstatement of his occupation in 1925, while the tax evasion crimes leading to his deportability occurred and were prosecuted over twenty years later. Thus, the Court addressed the single question \"whether this provision applies to a person who was a naturalized citizen at the time he was convicted of the crimes,\n   <em>\n    but was later denaturalized\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379789\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/120/\">\n    376 U.S. at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379789\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/120/\">\n    84 S.Ct. at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Given such a disconnect between the fraudulent naturalization and the later crimes,\n   <em>\n    Costello\n   </em>\n   was arguably defensible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, however, Okpala was not \"later\" denaturalized. The underlying crime and naturalization fraud arise from exactly the same facts. Okpala flouted immigration law by applying for naturalization in October 1991; the indictment alleges he was participating in drug trafficking crimes from mid-1990 through 1991. He was dealing heroin while lining up at the immigration office to amend his status from legal permanent resident to a citizen. The facts that he secured naturalization in March 1992 before he was convicted in August 1993 are simply happenstances of official and bureaucratic timing. And as noted, his denaturalization was concomitant with his conviction. On these facts, I find it hard to conclude that Okpala's case involves the \"relation back\" doctrine condemned in\n   <em>\n    Costello.\n   </em>\n   Realistically, this is not so much a \"relation back\" case as a \"relation to\" case, since the fraudulent procurement is based on the same illegality as the drug trafficking perpetrated by the alien. A person denaturalized on this basis should not be able to claim the protection of fraudulently obtained United States citizen status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Reading\n   <em>\n    Costello\n   </em>\n   to overturn Okpala's recent deportation means that the immigration consequences of precisely the same conduct differ for \"naturalized\" citizens and non-naturalized aliens solely because of the relative scheduling of the prosecution and the naturalization proceedings. The \"naturalized\" aliens will require two steps before they may be processed out of this country-denaturalization followed by a separate deportation proceeding-whereas aliens face the single remedy of deportation proceedings. Thus, Okpala (who has been deported) may return to the United States as a \"legal permanent resident,\" only to face further deportation or inadmissibility proceedings based on his heroin trafficking convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because the Supreme Court wrote broadly in\n   <em>\n    Costello,\n   </em>\n   it imposed this illogical result.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Okpala was removed to Nigeria on August 29, 2017 and is no longer in the United States.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    This section, 241(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), is located today at\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2)(A)(ii).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The Government argues that language from the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which amended the INA, shows Congress's contrary intentions.
