We affirm that the relevant Georgia statute qualifies as an aggravated felony and\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the district court's judgment reflecting Valle-Ramirez's conviction under \u00a7 1326(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Valle-Ramirez pled guilty to being an alien found unlawfully present in the United States after his May 2013 deportation, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b). His presentence report (PSR) applied a 16-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) (2014) because of his previous Georgia felony conviction for aggravated assault, which the PSR deemed a crime of violence. The PSR further determined that Valle-Ramirez faced a statutory maximum imprisonment term of 20 years under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) because his Georgia conviction was an aggravated felony within that statute's meaning. Valle-Ramirez objected to the sentencing enhancement, urging that the Georgia statute of conviction is not a crime of violence. He did not, at that time, object to \u00a7 1326(b)(2) 's applicability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court overruled the objection and adopted the PSR's findings, varied downward from the guidelines range, and imposed a 30-month sentence. The judgment listed his statute of conviction as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Valle-Ramirez timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, Valle-Ramirez reasserted that his Georgia aggravated assault conviction is not a crime of violence for purposes of the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement. Valle-Ramirez then asserted for the first time that he \"is not subject to the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)\" because his Georgia conviction is not an aggravated felony-defined in relevant part as a crime of violence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, he asserted that his Georgia conviction could not be a crime of violence under\n   \u00a7 16(a) because the underlying statute did not have \"as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\" He also argued the unconstitutional vagueness of \u00a7 16(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This court's affirmance,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Although Valle-Ramirez technically failed to challenge the applicability of \u00a7 1326(b)(2) in the district court, we need not resort to plain error review. The objection to his \u00a7 2L1.2 sentencing enhancement made the same argument about the Georgia conviction that applies to \u00a7 1326(b)(2) -that his Georgia conviction does not have as an element the use of force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   These provisions incorporate nearly identical use of force definitions. The guideline defines a crime of violence to\n   include \"any other offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n.1(B)(iii) (2008). Section 1326(b)(2) incorporates identical language. It says that an alien \"whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony\" is subject to an enhanced prison term. This statute defines \"aggravated felony\" to include \"a crime of violence [ ]as defined in Section 16 of Title 18.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(F).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) defines a crime of violence to include \"an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\" Thus, the use of force provision relevant to determining \u00a7 1326(b) 's applicability matches the provision to which Valle-Ramirez objected in the district court regarding his sentencing enhancement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   held that Section 16(b) 's residual clause cannot suffice under Section 1326(b)(2), the sole issue on appeal is whether Valle-Ramirez's Georgia conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony because it has \"as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Valle-Ramirez's Georgia aggravated assault conviction easily meets this requirement. Under Georgia law at the time of Valle-Ramirez's offense, Georgia's assault statute was written as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (a) A person commits the offense of simple assault when he or she either:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (1) Attempts to commit a violent injury to the person of another; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (2) Commits an act which places another in reasonable apprehension of immediately receiving a violent injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   GA. CODE ANN. \u00a7 16-5-20(a) (2012). Aggravated assault occurs when one commits a simple assault:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) With intent to murder, to rape, or to rob;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (2) With a deadly weapon or with any object, device, or instrument which, when used offensively against a person, is likely to or actually does result in serious bodily injury; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (3) [Against] a person or persons without legal justification by discharging a firearm from within a motor vehicle toward a person or persons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   GA. CODE. ANN. \u00a7 16-5-21(a)(1)-(3) (2012). Valle-Ramirez concedes that his aggravated assault conviction can be narrowed using state court documents to an offense under \u00a7 16-5-21(a)(2) and \u00a7 16-5-20(a)(2). In other words, he committed an act with a deadly weapon, an auto, placing another in reasonable apprehension of immediately receiving a violent injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In response to this court's request for supplemental briefing on remand, Valle-Ramirez argues only that his Georgia offense cannot be a crime of violence because\n   the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   required to commit Georgia assault has \"no requirement that the defendant intend to injure or threaten injury,\" whereas an act that has as an element the use of force requires such an intent. This is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that the word \"use\" in the context of \"use of force\" \"is indifferent as to whether the actor has the mental state of intention, knowledge, or recklessness with respect to the harmful consequences of his volitional conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Voisine v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598062\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2272/#p2278\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2278-79,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598062\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2272/#p2278\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court has recognized that post-\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   , \"the mental state of recklessness may qualify as an offense that 'has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, post-\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   , the phrase \" 'has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use or physical force against the person of another' [is] indifferent to\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   : we concern ourselves only with whether [the] predicate conduct was volitional\" in contrast to purely accidental.\n   <em>\n    Mendez-Henriquez\n   </em>\n   , 847 F.3d at 221-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Georgia's required\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   for assault more than satisfies merely volitional conduct. At issue here, an assault occurs when one \"[c]ommits an act which places another in reasonable apprehension of immediately receiving a violent injury.\" GA. CODE ANN. \u00a7 16-5-20(a)(2) (2012). The Supreme Court of Georgia has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [P]ursuant to the express language of (a)(2), an assault under that subsection looks to the victim's state of mind, rather than the accused's, to establish the elements of an assault. There is an intent of the accused that must be shown, but it is only the criminal intent to commit the acts which caused the victim to be reasonably apprehensive of receiving a violent injury, not any underlying intent of the accused in assaulting the victim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Dunagan v.

For example, a defendant must intend to drive a vehicle rapidly through a parking lot, though he need not intend to scare the person standing nearby to commit the assault.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

In short, to commit the relevant assault under Georgia law, the defendant must intend to commit the act that causes the victim to feel reasonable apprehension of immediate violent injury, though the defendant need not intend to cause the apprehension itself. Such a\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement is more than enough to satisfy the low volitional conduct standard for \"use of force\" purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Aside from\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   , Georgia law is clear that committing an act with a deadly weapon that places another in reasonable apprehension of immediately receiving a violent injury requires the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force. Under Georgia law, an assault must include \"a demonstration of violence, coupled with an apparent present ability to inflict injury so as to cause the person against whom it is directed reasonably to fear that he will receive an immediate violent injury unless he retreats to secure his safety.\"\n   <em>\n    Daniels v.
