Born into poverty, Garcia and her parents shared a San Diego house with other families to save money on rent; she was even homeless for a time as a child. But she studied hard and excelled academically in high school. When her family could not\n   afford to send her to the top university where she had been accepted, Garcia enrolled in a local community college and ultimately put herself through a four-year university, where she again excelled while working full-time as a legal assistant. She then was awarded a scholarship that, together with her mother's life savings, enabled her to fulfill her longstanding dream of attending and graduating from law school. Today, Garcia maintains a thriving legal practice in San Diego, where she represents members of underserved communities in civil, criminal, and immigration proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On the surface, Dulce Garcia appears no different from any other productive-indeed, inspiring-young American. But one thing sets her apart. Garcia's parents brought her to this country in violation of United States immigration laws when she was four years old. Though the United States of America is the only home she has ever known, Dulce Garcia is an undocumented immigrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Recognizing the cruelty and wastefulness of deporting productive young people to countries with which they have no ties, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced a policy in 2012 that would provide some relief to individuals like Garcia, while allowing our communities to continue to benefit from their contributions. Known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the program allows those noncitizens who unwittingly entered the United States as children, who have clean criminal records, and who meet various educational or military service requirements to apply for two-year renewable periods of deferred action-a revocable decision by the government not to deport an otherwise removable person from the country. DACA also allows recipients to apply for authorization to work in this country legally, paying taxes and operating in the above-ground economy. Garcia, along with hundreds of thousands of other young people, trusting the government to honor its promises, leapt at the opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   But after a change in presidential administrations, in 2017 the government moved to end the DACA program. Why? According to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, upon the legal advice of the Attorney General, DACA was illegal from its inception, and therefore could no longer continue in effect. And after Dulce Garcia-along with other DACA recipients and affected states, municipalities, and organizations-challenged this conclusion in the federal courts, the government adopted the position that its fundamentally legal determination that DACA is unlawful is unreviewable by the judicial branch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   With due respect for the Executive Branch, we disagree. The government may not simultaneously both assert that its actions are legally compelled, based on its interpretation of the law, and avoid review of that assertion by the judicial branch, whose \"province and duty\" it is \"to say what the law is.\"\n   <em>\n    Marbury v. Madison\n   </em>\n   , 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121622\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/137/\">\n    2 L.Ed. 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1803). The government's decision to rescind DACA is subject to judicial review. And, upon review, we conclude that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the rescission of DACA-at least as justified on this record-is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law. We therefore affirm the district court's grant of preliminary injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    A. History of Deferred Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The central benefit available under the DACA program is deferred action. Because\n   much of this dispute revolves around the legitimacy of that practice, we begin by reviewing the Executive Branch's historical use of deferred action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The basic concept is a simple one: deferred action is a decision by Executive Branch officials not to pursue deportation proceedings against an individual or class of individuals otherwise eligible for removal from this country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   6 Charles Gordon et al., Immigration Law &amp; Procedure \u00a7 72.03[2][h] (2018) (\"To ameliorate a harsh and unjust outcome, the immigration agency may decline to institute proceedings, may terminate proceedings, or may decline to execute a final order of deportation.

The original DACA program remained in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In 2017, a new presidential administration took office, bringing with it a change in immigration policy. On February 20, 2017, then-Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly issued a memorandum that set out the administration's new enforcement priorities, stating that \"the Department no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.\" However, the memorandum explicitly left DACA and DAPA in place. In a second memorandum issued June 15, 2017, after \"consider[ing] a number of factors, including the preliminary injunction in the [\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ] matter, the ongoing litigation, the fact that DAPA never took effect, and our new immigration enforcement priorities,\" Secretary Kelly rescinded DAPA as an \"exercise of [his] discretion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Then, on June 28, 2017, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote to United States Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions III threatening that if the federal government did not rescind DACA by September 5, 2017, Paxton would amend the complaint in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation to challenge DACA as well as DAPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   On September 4, 2017, the day before Paxton's deadline, Attorney General Sessions sent his own letter to Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke. The Attorney General's letter \"advise[d] that the Department of Homeland Security ... should rescind\" the DACA memorandum based on his legal opinion that the Department lacked statutory authority to\n   have created DACA in the first place. He wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   DACA was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress'[s] repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result. Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Attorney General further opined that \"[b]ecause the DACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to DACA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The very next day, following the Attorney General's directive, Acting Secretary Duke issued a memorandum rescinding DACA. The memorandum begins with a \"Background\" section that covers DACA, DAPA, the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation, Secretary Kelly's previous memoranda, Texas Attorney General Paxton's threat, and the Attorney General's letter. Then, in the section titled \"Rescission of the June 15, 2012 DACA Memorandum,\" the Duke memorandum states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Taking into consideration the Supreme Court's and the Fifth Circuit's rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated. In the exercise of my authority in establishing national immigration policies and priorities, except for the purposes explicitly identified below, I hereby rescind the June 15, 2012 memorandum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Duke memorandum further states that although DHS would stop accepting initial DACA requests effective immediately, the agency would provide a one-month window in which renewal applications could be filed for current DACA beneficiaries whose benefits were set to expire before March 5, 2018. It also states that DHS would not terminate existing grants of deferred action under DACA \"solely based on the directives in this memorandum.\" Thus, beginning on March 5, 2018, each DACA recipient's grant of deferred action would be allowed to expire at the end of its two-year term. As of September 4, 2017-the day before the rescission-approximately 689,800 individuals were enrolled in DACA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The rescission of DACA instantly sparked litigation across the country, including the cases on appeal here. Suits were filed in the Northern District of California by the Regents of the University of California, a group of states led by California, the City of San Jose, the County of Santa Clara and Service Employees International Union Local 521, and a group of individual DACA recipients led by Dulce Garcia. The complaints included claims that the rescission was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); that it was a substantive rule requiring notice-and-comment rulemaking under the APA; that it violated the due process and equal protection rights protected by the U.S. Constitution; and that DHS was equitably estopped from using the information provided on DACA applications for enforcement purposes. The cases were consolidated before Judge William Alsup in the District Court for the Northern District of California and proceeded to litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   On October 17, 2017, the district court ordered the government to complete the administrative record, holding that the record proffered by the government was incomplete\n   in several respects. Seeking to avoid providing additional documents, the government filed a petition for mandamus. In arguing its mandamus petition, the government took the position that the legality of the rescission should stand or fall based solely on the reasons and the record already provided by the government. We denied the mandamus petition, stating that \"the notion that the head of a United States agency would decide to terminate a program giving legal protections to roughly 800,000 people based solely on 256 pages of publicly available documents is not credible, as the district court concluded.\"\n   <em>\n    In re United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267018\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/1200/#p1206\">\n    875 F.3d 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1206 (9th Cir. 2017) (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The government next petitioned the Supreme Court for the same mandamus relief; the Court did not reach the merits of the administrative record dispute, but instead instructed the district court to rule on the government's threshold arguments challenging reviewability of its rescission decision before requiring the government to provide additional documents.\n   <em>\n    In re United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12615187\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/443/#p445\">\n    138 S.

The district court granted the request for a nationwide preliminary injunction, holding that most of the plaintiffs had standing;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   that neither the APA nor the INA barred judicial review; and that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the decision to rescind DACA was arbitrary and capricious. The district court therefore entered a preliminary injunction requiring DHS to adjudicate renewal applications for existing DACA recipients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In a separate order, the court partially granted and partially denied the government's motion to dismiss. The court dismissed plaintiffs' notice-and-comment and Regulatory Flexibility Act claims; a due process claim premised on an entitlement to deferred action; and the equitable estoppel claim. The court denied the motion as to plaintiffs' equal protection claim and a due process claim premised on an alleged change in DHS's information-sharing policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The district court certified the issues addressed in both its orders for interlocutory review under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

If an agency head is mistaken in her assessment that the law precludes one course of action, allowing the courts to disabuse her of that incorrect view of the law does not constrain discretion, but rather opens new vistas within which discretion can operate. That is, if an administrator chooses option\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   for the sole reason that she believes option\n   <em>\n    B\n   </em>\n   to be beyond her legal authority, a decision from the courts putting option\n   <em>\n    B\n   </em>\n   back on the table allows a reasoned, discretionary policy choice between the two courses of action. And if the agency's view of the law is instead confirmed by the courts, no injury to discretion results because the status quo is preserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Moreover, allowing judicial review under these circumstances serves the critical function of promoting accountability within the Executive Branch-not accountability to the courts, but democratic accountability to the people.

Acting Secretary Duke easily could have included \"the prospect of litigation challenging DACA\" in her list of considerations; had she done so, then perhaps the reference to the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation could be read as supporting a practical worry about an injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Absent that, however, the\n   mention of the courts' \"rulings\" is best read as referencing the courts' legal conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Attorney General Sessions's September 4, 2017, letter likewise focuses on the supposed illegality of DACA, rather than any alleged \"litigation risk.\" Its substantive paragraph states\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   DACA was effectuated ...\n   <em>\n    without proper statutory authority\n   </em>\n   and with no established end-date, after Congress'[s] repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result. Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was\n   <em>\n    an unconstitutional exercise of authority\n   </em>\n   by the Executive Branch.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   These sentences unmistakably reflect the Attorney General's belief that DACA was illegal and therefore beyond the power of DHS to institute or maintain. The letter goes on to opine that \"[b]ecause the DACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA [in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation], it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to DACA.\" But in the context of the full paragraph, the reference to \"similar results\" is best read not as an independent reason for rescinding DACA, but as a natural consequence of DACA's supposed illegality-which is the topic of the paragraph as a whole. In the words of Judge Garaufis of the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, that reference \"is too thin a reed to bear the weight of Defendants' 'litigation risk' argument.\"\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272941\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/279/401/#p429\">\n    279 F.

In this connection, it is helpful to compare the operative language used by Acting Secretary Duke to rescind DACA with that used by her predecessor, Secretary John Kelly, to rescind DAPA just months before. In his June 15, 2017, memorandum, Secretary Kelly wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   After consulting with the Attorney General, and\n   <em>\n    in the exercise of my discretion\n   </em>\n   in establishing national immigration enforcement policies and priorities, I hereby rescind the November 20, 2014 memorandum [that established DAPA].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   (emphasis added). Placed alongside Acting Secretary Duke's language, the parallels-and the differences-are stark. Acting Secretary Duke's memorandum reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   <em>\n    In the exercise of my authority\n   </em>\n   in establishing national immigration policies and priorities, except for the purposes explicitly identified below, I hereby rescind the June 15, 2012 memorandum [that established DACA].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The obvious similarities between the two passages strongly suggest that Acting Secretary Duke modeled her language after that of Secretary Kelly's memo. And indeed, we\n   <em>\n    know\n   </em>\n   that the Acting Secretary considered the Kelly memorandum in reaching her decision, because the government has told us so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition for Writ of Mandamus,\n   <em>\n    In re United States\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-72917 (9th Cir. Oct. 20, 2017) (stating that the government's proffered administrative record in this case, which includes the\n   Kelly memorandum, \"consist[s] of the non-privileged materials considered by the Acting Secretary in reaching her decision to rescind the DACA policy\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (taking the position that only materials personally reviewed by the Acting Secretary herself, not by subordinates, are \"considered\" by the Secretary).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Given that Acting Secretary Duke hewed so closely to Secretary Kelly's language in general, it is appropriate to draw meaning from the one major difference between the two sentences: Secretary Kelly exercised his \"\n   <em>\n    discretion\n   </em>\n   \" in ending DAPA; Acting Secretary Duke merely exercised her \"\n   <em>\n    authority\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jama v.

The point is that with the example set by the Kelly memorandum in front of her, Acting Secretary Duke clearly would have known how to express that the rescission was a discretionary act-if that were indeed the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the near-verbatim language of the two rescission memoranda suggests that the Acting Secretary adopted the majority of Kelly's wording, but actively rejected describing the DACA rescission as an act of discretion. This difference in language cuts strongly against any suggestion that the rescission was discretionary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The government counters that the memorandum \"focused from beginning to end principally on litigation concerns, not the legality of DACA\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   .\" But as the State plaintiffs point out, the memorandum's references to these supposed \"litigation concerns\" were limited to a simple summary of the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation's procedural history; appeared only in the \"Background\" section of the memorandum; and were not referenced in the Acting Secretary's statement of what she was \"[t]aking into consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   note 16,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The government also asserts that because the Acting Secretary wrote that DACA \"should\" rather than\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be ended, she did not view herself as bound to act. But even on its face, \"should\" is fully capable of expressing obligation or necessity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Should\n   </em>\n   , New Oxford American Dictionary (3d ed. 2010) (\"used to indicate obligation, duty, or correctness\");\n   <em>\n    cf. Should\n   </em>\n   , Garner's Dictionary of Legal Usage (3d ed. 2011) (\"should ... is sometimes used to create mandatory standards\"). The Acting Secretary's use of \"should\" instead of \"must\" cannot overcome the absence of any discussion of potential litigation or the \"risks\" attendant to it from the rescission memorandum's statement of reasons, and the discrepancy between the rescission of DAPA as an act of \"discretion\" and the rescission of DACA as an act of \"authority.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Finally, the government takes a quote from the Supreme Court to the effect that courts should \"uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency's path may reasonably be discerned,\"\n   <em>\n    Bowman Transp., Inc. v.

First, the Attorney General states that \"DACA was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action ... after Congress'[s] repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result.\" But our court has already explained that \"Congress's failure to pass the [DREAM] Act does not signal the illegitimacy of the DACA program,\" partly because \"the DREAM Act and the DACA program are not interchangeable policies because they provide different forms of relief\": the DREAM Act would have provided a path to lawful permanent resident status, while DACA simply defers removal.\n   <em>\n    Brewer II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277054\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/957/#p964\">\n    855 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   976 n.10 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Motomura,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 175 (\"DACA is not the DREAM Act; as an interim executive measure, it is limited in duration and provides no durable immigration status.\") (footnote omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DREAM Act of 2011, S. 952, 112th Cong. (2011). Moreover, there is nothing inherently problematic about an agency addressing a problem for which Congress has been unable to pass a legislative fix, so long as the particular action taken is properly within the agency's power. This argument therefore provides no independent reason to think that DACA is unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The Attorney General's primary bases for concluding that DACA was illegal were that the program was \"effectuated ... without proper statutory authority\" and that it amounted to \"an unconstitutional exercise of authority.\" More specifically, the Attorney General asserted that \"the DACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA\" in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The claim of \"constitutional defects\" is a puzzling one because as all the parties recognize, no court has ever held that DAPA is unconstitutional. The Fifth Circuit and district court in\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   explicitly declined to address the constitutional issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We decide this appeal ... without resolving the constitutional claim.\");\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303866\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/86/591/\">\n    86 F.

Indeed, the government makes no attempt in this appeal to defend the Attorney General's assertion that the DACA program is unconstitutional. We therefore do not address it further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   With respect to DACA's alleged \"legal ... defects,\" the district court explained in great detail the long history of deferred action in immigration enforcement, including in the form of broad programs; the fact that the Supreme Court and Congress have both acknowledged deferred action as a feature of the immigration system; and the specific statutory responsibility of the Secretary of Homeland Security for \"[e]stablishing national immigration enforcement policies and priorities,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20202\">\n    6 U.S.C. \u00a7 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5). The government does not contest any of these propositions, which themselves go a long way toward establishing DACA's legality. Instead, the government argues that the Fifth Circuit's reasons for striking down the related DAPA policy would also apply to DACA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The Fifth Circuit concluded that DAPA was unlawful on two grounds: first, that DAPA was in fact a legislative rule and therefore should have been promulgated through notice-and-comment rulemaking; and second, that DAPA was substantively inconsistent with the INA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 171-78, 178-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   With respect to the first holding, notice-and-comment procedures are not required where the agency pronouncement in question is a \"general statement[ ] of policy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A). \"The critical factor to determine whether a directive announcing a new policy constitutes a rule or a general statement of policy is the extent to which the challenged [directive] leaves the agency, or its implementing official, free to exercise discretion to follow, or not to follow, the [announced] policy in an individual case.\"\n   <em>\n    Mada-Luna v.

The court read those statistics as revealing that DACA was discretionary in name only-that is, that DHS personnel had no discretion to deny deferred action if the DACA criteria were met.\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 172-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   But as the dissenting judge in\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   pointed out, DACA's (then) 5% denial rate-which did not include applications rejected for administrative deficiencies-is consistent with a discretionary program given that applicants self-select: \"It should be expected that only those highly likely to receive deferred action will apply; otherwise, applicants would risk revealing their immigration status and other identifying information to authorities, thereby risking removal (and the loss of a sizeable fee).\"\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (King, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Moreover, the denial rate has risen as the DACA program has matured. DHS statistics included in the record reveal that in fiscal year 2016, for example, the agency approved 52,882 initial DACA applications and denied 11,445; that is, 17.8% of the applications acted upon were denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Judge King concluded, \"Neither of these numbers suggests an agency on autopilot.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   210 n.44 (King, J., dissenting);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arpaio v.

Specifically, the Fifth Circuit reasoned that the INA provides \"an intricate process for illegal aliens to derive a lawful immigration classification from their children's immigration status\" but that \"DAPA would allow illegal aliens to receive the benefits of lawful presence solely on account of their children's immigration status without complying with any of the requirements ... that Congress has deliberately imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 179-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the district court in this case noted, there is no analogous provision in the INA defining how immigration status may be derived by undocumented persons who arrived in the United States as children. One of the major problems the Fifth Circuit identified with DAPA is therefore not present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In resisting this conclusion, the government flips the Fifth Circuit's reasoning on its head, arguing that \"[i]nsofar as the creation of pathways to lawful presence was relevant, the fact that Congress had legislated only for certain individuals similarly situated to DAPA beneficiaries-and not DACA recipients-would make DACA\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   inconsistent with the INA than DAPA.\" To the extent the government meant to draw on the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   court's analysis, it gets it exactly backwards: the whole thrust of the Fifth Circuit's reasoning on this point was that DHS was without authority because \"Congress has 'directly addressed the precise question at issue.' \"\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mayo Found. for Med.

There is no argument that Congress has similarly occupied the field with respect to DACA; as the Attorney General himself noted, Congress has repeatedly rejected Dreamer legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The second major element of the Fifth Circuit's analysis on the substantive issues was that the INA itself \"prescribes ... which classes of aliens can achieve deferred action and eligibility for work authorization.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/\">\n    809 F.3d at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is true that Acting Secretary Duke's rescission memorandum makes rejections of DACA applications mandatory. But the relevant question under the rescission memorandum is not whether DHS officials retained discretion to accept applications for a program that no longer existed; instead, the question is whether DHS officials retained discretion\n   <em>\n    to grant deferred action\n   </em>\n   and collateral benefits outside of the (now-cancelled) DACA program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   For its part, the government asserts that the rescission memorandum made clear that, despite the rescission, \"future deferred action requests will be 'adjudicat[ed] ... on an individual, case-by-case basis.' \" Mildly put, this assertion mischaracterizes the memorandum. The quoted language refers to the treatment of only (a) initial applications pending on the date of the rescission, and (b) renewal applications filed within the one-month wind-down period. It does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   refer to how future requests for deferred action outside the DACA program would be handled. Still, the rescission memorandum also did not forbid the agency from granting such requests, and it acknowledged the background principle of deferred action as \"an act of prosecutorial discretion meant to be applied only on an individualized case-by-case basis.\" And the memorandum closed by stating that \"no limitations are placed by this guidance on the otherwise lawful enforcement or litigation prerogatives of DHS\"-presumably including granting deferred action on a case-by-case basis to some people who would have been eligible for DACA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   If allowed to go into effect, the rescission of DACA would undoubtedly result in the loss of deferred action for the vast majority of the 689,800 people who rely on the program. But the rescission memorandum does not mandate that result because it leaves in place the background principle that deferred action is available on a case-by-case basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' primary argument against this conclusion is a citation to\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

But again, this argument answers the wrong question. The Acting Secretary's legal conclusion that a DACA-like program is unlawful does not constrain the discretion of line-level DHS employees to grant deferred action on a case-by-case basis, and those employees lack authority to institute such an agency-wide program in the first place. And plaintiffs do not point to any reason why\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   Acting Secretary's legal conclusion about DACA would bind subsequent Secretaries if they were to disagree with its reasoning-just as Acting Secretary Duke reversed course from previous Secretaries who concluded DACA was legal.

The dispute here focuses on whether such \"mutually explicit understandings\" existed between the government and DACA recipients with respect to the renewal of DACA benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs assert that they and the government \" 'mutually' understood that DACA recipients would be\n   able to renew their benefits and protection on an ongoing basis so long as they fulfilled the program's criteria.\" But this argument is undercut by the DACA FAQs published by DHS, which explicitly state that \"USCIS retains the ultimate discretion to determine whether deferred action is appropriate in any given case even if the [renewal] guidelines are met.\" The FAQs also state that any individual's \"deferred action may be terminated at any time, with or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS's discretion,\" and Secretary Napolitano's DACA memorandum claims that it \"confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship.\" Whether or not these provisions are legally operative, they do not indicate that the government shared plaintiffs' expectation of presumptive renewal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Attempting to overcome this facially discretionary language, plaintiffs emphasize several factors. First, they say, the very nature of the DACA project was such that presumptive renewal was required to encourage people to participate; a two-year term with no presumption of renewal would not have been attractive enough to outweigh the risks to the applicants. Moreover, Secretary Napolitano's DACA memorandum itself states that grants of deferred action under DACA will be \"subject to renewal,\" and the actual criteria for renewal were \"nondiscretionary\" in nature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the plaintiffs point to a more than 99% approval rate for adjudicated DACA renewal applications. This, they assert, is powerful evidence of a mutual understanding of presumptive renewal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   All these points might have revealed a question of fact as to whether a mutually explicit understanding of presumptive renewal existed-thereby avoiding dismissal on the pleadings-if plaintiffs were bringing a claim that, for example, their individual DACA renewals were denied for no good reason. But it is hard to see how an expectation of renewal within the confines of the existing DACA policy could have created a mutually explicit understanding that the DACA program\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   would not be terminated wholesale. That is, a 99% renewal rate under DACA provides no evidence that the government shared an understanding that the DACA program would continue existing indefinitely to provide such renewals. None of plaintiffs' cited authorities appear to address this kind of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   While we may agree with much of what plaintiffs say about the cruelty of ending a program upon which so many have come to rely, we do not believe they have plausibly alleged a \"mutually explicit understanding\" that DACA-created by executive action in a politically polarized policy area and explicitly couched in discretionary language-would exist indefinitely, including through a change in presidential administrations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196982\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/1013/#p1020\">\n    637 F.3d at 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A person's belief of entitlement to a government benefit, no matter how sincerely or reasonably held, does not create a property right if that belief is not mutually held by the government.\").

Due Process: Information-Sharing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Several of the complaints allege a different due process theory: DACA recipients had a protected interest based on the government's representations that the personal information they submitted with their applications would not be used for enforcement purposes, and the government violated this interest by changing its policy to allow such use. The district court held that the plaintiffs had plausibly alleged facts that state a claim under this theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   As with their other due process claim, the question whether DACA recipients enjoy a protected due process right protecting them from having the government use their information against them for enforcement purposes turns on the existence of a \"mutually explicit understanding[ ]\" on that point between the government and DACA recipients.\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   , 408 U.S. at 601,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782863\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/593/#p601\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196982\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/1013/#p1020\">\n    637 F.3d at 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The DACA FAQs published by DHS state the following information-use policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   Information provided in this request\n   <em>\n    is protected from disclosure\n   </em>\n   to ICE and CBP for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings unless the requestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice to Appear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS' Notice to Appear guidance (www.uscis.gov/NTA). Individuals whose cases are deferred pursuant to DACA will not be referred to ICE. The information may be shared with national security and law enforcement agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal, including for assistance in the consideration of DACA, to identify or prevent fraudulent claims, for national security purposes, or for the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense. The above information sharing policy covers family members and guardians, in addition to the requestor. This policy, which may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice, is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   (emphasis added). The statement that applicant information \"is protected from disclosure\" to the enforcement arms of DHS is a strong commitment, and plaintiffs plausibly allege that DACA recipients reasonably relied on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   The government of course points to the express caveat that the information-sharing policy \"may be modified, superseded or rescinded at any time.\" But as the district court held, this qualifier is ambiguous as to whether it allows the government to change its policy only prospectively, or also with respect to information already received-and this ambiguity presents a fact question not amenable to resolution on the pleadings. Plaintiffs' interpretation that a policy change would only apply prospectively is a plausible one, given that the policy is written in terms of what will happen to \"[i]nformation provided in\n   <em>\n    this request\n   </em>\n   ,\" rather than DACA-derived information generally. (emphasis added). It is at least reasonable to think that a change in the policy would apply only to those applications submitted after that change takes effect. And while the government also relies on the language stating that the policy does not create enforceable rights, such a disclaimer by an agency about what its statements do and do not constitute as a legal matter are not dispositive.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454944,3674341\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/208/1015/\">\n    208 F.3d 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1022-23 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (declining to give legal effect to agency statement that its guidance did \"not represent final Agency action, and cannot be relied upon to\n   create any rights....\"). Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged a mutually explicit understanding that DACA applicants' information would be protected from disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   The government argues in the alternative that plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege that DHS actually changed its policy. Plaintiffs' allegations rest on a set of FAQs about the DACA rescission that DHS published the same day it issued the rescission memorandum, September 5, 2017. In those rescission FAQs, the previous language stating that personal information \"is protected from disclosure\" has been replaced with the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   Information provided to USCIS in DACA requests\n   <em>\n    will not be proactively provided\n   </em>\n   to ICE and CBP for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings, unless the requestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice to Appear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS' Notice to Appear guidance (www.uscis.gov/NTA).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   The government's first response-that the differing language in the two FAQs does not actually reflect a difference in policy-is hard to swallow. It does not take much parsing of the text to see the significant difference between \"protect[ing]\" something from \"disclosure\" on the one hand, and merely declining to \"proactively provide[ ]\" it on the other. This is especially so when the entities in question (and to which USCIS presumably\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   now provide information\n   <em>\n    re\n   </em>\n   actively) are fellow components of the same umbrella agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Changing gears, the government also points to yet a third set of FAQs, published months after the rescission and not part of the record in this case, which state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   Information provided to USCIS for the DACA process will not make you an immigration priority for that reason alone. That information\n   <em>\n    will only be proactively provided\n   </em>\n   to ICE or CBP if the requestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS' Notice to Appear guidance (www.uscis.gov/NTA).\n   <em>\n    This information-sharing policy has not changed in any way since it was first announced\n   </em>\n   , including as a result of the Sept. 5, 2017 memo starting a wind-down of the DACA policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   USCIS, Guidance on Rejected DACA Requests: Frequently Asked Questions (Nov. 30, 2017) (emphases added). The government notes that a district court relied on FAQs containing this language in parallel litigation to dismiss a nearly identical information-use due process claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal v.

As the court there explained, \"Plaintiffs ... have effectively pleaded themselves out of court by relying on a document that contradicts their otherwise-unsupported allegation of a change to DHS's information-use policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523475\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/260/#p279\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523475\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/260/#p279\">\n    at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But we do note several points. First, a literal reading of\n    <em>\n     Chaney\n    </em>\n    's language would not even encompass the decision to rescind DACA, since\n    <em>\n     Chaney\n    </em>\n    by its own terms applies only to \"agency decisions\n    <em>\n     not to undertake\n    </em>\n    enforcement action.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p830\">\n     470 U.S. at 832\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"399\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p830\">\n     105 S.Ct. 1649\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). Nowhere does the opinion suggest the broader proposition that any decision simply related to enforcement should be presumed unreviewable. Our court's dicta in\n    <em>\n     Morales de Soto v. Lynch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323847\" index=\"400\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/822/\">\n     824 F.3d 822\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 827 n.4 (9th Cir. 2016), which addressed a completely separate issue of jurisdiction under the INA, is not to the contrary. Thus, to the extent that the\n    <em>\n     Montana Air\n    </em>\n    exception might not seem a perfect fit for the rescission of DACA-which was not exactly a decision not to enforce-the\n    <em>\n     Chaney\n    </em>\n    presumption itself shares the same defect. There is no daylight between the\n    <em>\n     Chaney\n    </em>\n    rule and the\n    <em>\n     Montana Air\n    </em>\n    exception in terms of the type of agency action to which they apply. So if the rescission of DACA were outside the\n    <em>\n     Montana Air\n    </em>\n    exception by virtue of not being strictly a nonenforcement decision, it would also fall outside the\n    <em>\n     Chaney\n    </em>\n    presumption of unreviewability in the first place.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-264\">\n    Second, the D.C.

In the memorandum, Secretary Nielsen \"provide[d] additional explanation of the basis for the DACA rescission,\" in response to an order filed in a parallel lawsuit. The government's letter does not argue that the Nielsen memorandum represents fresh agency action that could possibly moot this appeal. We therefore leave it to the district court in the first instance to determine the admissibility of Secretary Nielsen's letter given that it cannot possibly be a part of the administrative record in this case, and its impact, if any, on this case.
