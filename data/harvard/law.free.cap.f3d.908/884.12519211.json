Its extreme measures helped many, but others suffered as a result. One of the rescue measures, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, authorized the government to act as conservator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises with critical roles in the home-mortgage market. Under that conservatorship, Fannie and Freddie made a deal with the Department of Treasury. The deal guaranteed Fannie and Freddie access to hundreds of billions of dollars. But in return, they had to give their net profits to the Treasury-in perpetuity. Fannie's and Freddie's junior shareholders had expected to share in those future profits, but the deal wiped out that expectation. So some of those junior shareholders now challenge that deal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We reject the shareholders' challenge on all fronts. First, the Recovery Act gave the government broad, discretionary power to enter into the deal. Second, the deal complies with the requirements of the Recovery Act, as well as Delaware and Virginia corporate law. And third, the relief sought would \"restrain or affect the exercise of [the government's] powers\" as conservator, which the Recovery Act forbids.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f).

This case turns in part on how to interpret and apply that subsection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2008, the collapse of the housing market cost Fannie and Freddie billions of dollars, threatening the U.S. mortgage market. The Treasury quickly took steps to prop up Fannie and Freddie. But the mortgage and financial markets remained perilous, and the financial crisis grew worse. So the Agency put both Fannie and Freddie into conservatorship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Under the Agency's direction, they entered into funding agreements with the Treasury. The Treasury gave each enterprise a funding commitment. When Fannie's or Freddie's liabilities exceed their assets, they can draw on that funding commitment to keep their net worth in the black.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In return, the Treasury received one million shares of senior preferred stock in each of Fannie and Freddie. These shares gave the Treasury a liquidation preference in each enterprise equal to $1 billion plus all the money drawn from the Treasury's funding commitment. The shares also gave the Treasury an annual dividend equal to 10% of the liquidation preference, if paid in cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Treasury initially capped its funding commitment at $100 billion per enterprise. That was not enough, at least for Fannie. Two amendments to the funding agreement more than doubled that cap, and Fannie and Freddie wound up drawing $116.1 billion and $71.3 billion from the Treasury. But as Fannie and Freddie drew more and more money from the Treasury, they owed it larger and larger dividends. In a vicious cycle, they sometimes had to draw money from the Treasury just to pay the Treasury's dividends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 2012, the Treasury and the Agency renegotiated the funding agreements and agreed to the Third Amendment. The Third Amendment replaced the 10% annual dividend with a quarterly variable dividend. It set that variable dividend equal to Fannie's and Freddie's positive net worth above a capital buffer, which was set to decrease with each dividend payment. The capital buffer is now down to zero. So each\n   quarter, the dividend consumes each enterprise's entire positive net worth. The challengers call this arrangement the Net Worth Sweep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In other words, under the Third Amendment, if Fannie or Freddie has a positive net worth, it pays all that worth out as a dividend to the Treasury. If its net worth is zero or negative, it pays nothing. Fannie and Freddie pay only what they can. That way, they need never again draw from the Treasury to pay the Treasury's dividends. But they also have no money left over to pay dividends to junior shareholders or to redeem the Treasury's shares, exit conservatorship, and return to private control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural history\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   David Jacobs and Gary Hindes filed this class-action suit against the Agency, Treasury, Fannie, and Freddie to challenge the Third Amendment. Their original complaint asserted claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violations of Delaware and Virginia corporate law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The challengers later amended their complaint, voluntarily dismissing their claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The amended complaint contains four counts: two asserting that the Third Amendment violates Delaware and Virginia corporate law, and two new claims against the Treasury for unjust enrichment. It seeks declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, including damages, restitution, and disgorgement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Agency, Treasury, Fannie, and Freddie moved to dismiss. The District Court granted that motion, holding that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) barred all the challengers' claims.\n   <em>\n    Jacobs v.

Del. Nov. 27, 2017). It reasoned that the Agency acted within its statutory powers, that the Recovery Act did not incorporate state law, and that \u00a7 4617(f)'s \"sweeping limitations ... on judicial review\" deprived it of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3-5. The court also refused to take judicial notice of certain documents that allegedly undermined the Agency's and Treasury's assertions, because it did not rely on those assertions in reaching its decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This appeal followed. Like the District Court, we do not rely on those assertions, so we will affirm the refusal to take judicial notice of the challengers' documents. We review the District Court's dismissal de novo.\n   <em>\n    Hindes v.

THE RECOVERY ACT EMPOWERED THE AGENCY TO ENTER INTO THE THIRD AMENDMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Section 4617(f) bars claims when 1) the government acts as a conservator, 2) it does not exceed its statutory authority, and 3) the remedy sought would affect the exercise of that authority. So to figure out whether \u00a7 4617(f) bars the challengers' claims, we first identify \"the powers or functions of the Agency as a conservator.\" In this part of the opinion, we hold that the Act empowers the Agency to enter into the Third Amendment. In Part III, we go on to hold that the Third Amendment does not contravene any other limitations in the Recovery Act. And in Part IV, we hold that the relief requested by the challengers would \"restrain or affect\" the Agency's exercise of its powers.

THE THIRD AMENDMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RECOVERY ACT'S LIMITATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Third Amendment does not violate any other provision of the Recovery Act. The challengers assert that it violates Delaware and Virginia corporate law, as supposedly incorporated by two provisions of the Recovery Act (known as the succession clause and the repudiation-of-contracts clause). They also assert that it violates the Act's liquidation-of-assets procedures and its alleged requirement to serve Fannie's and Freddie's interests, rather than the government's. But that is not so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

So, they reason, if the Agency violates those laws, it also violates the Recovery Act itself. Because the Agency supposedly violated Delaware and Virginia law, it violated the Act itself and acted ultra vires. The Agency responds that the Recovery Act does not incorporate those state-law requirements and that, even if it did, they would be preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The challengers' argument fails because the Third Amendment is consistent with both states' laws. So we need not decide whether and to what extent the Act itself requires the Agency to follow Delaware and Virginia law. We also need not decide whether federal law preempts these states' laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Third Amendment complies with Delaware law.\n   </em>\n   The challengers claim that the Third Amendment does not specify a rate at which to pay the Treasury's dividend. They also claim that it does not pay the Treasury in preference to or in relation to other classes of shareholders. Both arguments miss the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    The dividend rate.\n   </em>\n   Delaware's corporate law entitles \"holders of preferred or special stock ... to receive dividends at such rates ... as shall be stated in the certificate of incorporation or in the [board] resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such stock.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Del.%20Code%20Ann.%20tit.%208%2C%20%C2%A7%20151\">\n    Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, \u00a7 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (2017). The Treasury receives all of Fannie's and Freddie's positive net worth in perpetuity, the challengers argue, not just a specified dividend rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   But the Third Amendment does specify a rate: 100%. The challengers cite no Delaware authority holding this rate unlawful. So the rate argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    The dividend preference\n   </em>\n   . That same provision of Delaware law authorizes dividends \"payable in preference to, or in such relation to, the dividends payable on any other class ... of stock.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Del.%20Code%20Ann.%20tit.%208%2C%20%C2%A7%20151\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The challengers claim that the Third Amendment does not create a preference, but rather permanently eliminates all other shareholders' dividends. And it cannot be payable in relation to another dividend that does not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This argument fails too. The Treasury's dividend is payable in preference to all other classes of stock. It is always paid first and with all available funds. The challengers cite no Delaware authority suggesting that this preference is unlawful or that it must reserve funds to pay junior stockholders. Indeed, \u00a7 151 contemplates that preferred shareholders' dividends may absorb all funds and leave none for junior shareholders: once preferred dividends have been paid out \"to the extent of the preference, ... a dividend on the remaining class or classes or series of stock\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   then be paid out of the\n   <em>\n    remaining\n   </em>\n   assets of the corporation available for dividends.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Del.%20Code%20Ann.%20tit.%208%2C%20%C2%A7%20151\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphases added). So common shareholders are not guaranteed dividends. They may receive the dividends only if the board approves, only if preferred shareholders are paid, and only if assets remain available for dividends. Here, after paying the Treasury's dividend, no assets remain. So even if Delaware\n   law applies, the Third Amendment complies with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Third Amendment complies with Virginia law.\n   </em>\n   The challengers reiterate their dividend-preference argument for Freddie, this time under Virginia law. Virginia statutory and case law, they argue, forbids the Third Amendment's preferred-dividend arrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Virginia law authorizes corporations to issue classes of stock that have preference over other classes.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2013.1-638\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 13.1-638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C)(4) (West 2018). The challengers again claim that the Treasury does not merely have a preference, but excludes other classes of stock entirely. But that is a preference, just an extreme one. Nothing in the statute forbids that preference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The challengers also rely on two century-old Virginia cases. One of them described the \"common understanding\" that preferred shareholders get first dibs on earnings through \"limited dividends,\" while common shareholders get the \"hope of unlimited gain\" through the company's \"surplus profits.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Johnson &amp; Briggs, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1866872\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/138/487/\">\n    138 Va. 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20S.E.%20100\">\n    122 S.E. 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 103 (1924). But a \"common understanding\" is not a rigid rule. And nothing about this case is \"common.\" Fannie and Freddie are public-private entities in conservatorship under an intricate statutory scheme tailored to respond to an economic catastrophe. The ordinary case does not control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The challengers' other case is likewise inapt. That case held that a corporation may not agree to pay preferred dividends when it lacks earnings with which to pay them.\n   <em>\n    Drewry, Hughes Co. v. Throckmorton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1846519\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/120/859/\">\n    120 Va. 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20S.E.%20818\">\n    92 S.E. 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 819 (1917). But the Third Amendment abides by this rule. Fannie and Freddie pay Treasury a dividend only when they have funds to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In short, the Third Amendment comports with both Delaware's and Virginia's laws. No authority even puts the matter in doubt, so we see no need to certify the issues to the Delaware or Virginia Supreme Court. The challengers' claims under the Recovery Act's succession and repudiation-of-contracts clauses fail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fairholme Funds, Inc. v.

They would have us void it and force the Treasury to disgorge all the dividends that it received under the Third Amendment. Undoing the Third Amendment would restrain the Agency's powers. So the challengers' concession dooms their case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Section 4617(f) applies to monetary relief that would restrain or affect the exercise of the Agency's powers as conservator\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The challengers argue, however, that their concession does not bar their claims for monetary relief. They claim that \u00a7 4617(f) applies only to \"equitable and injunctive relief,\" not damages claims. Appellants' Br. 41-43. They even call that subsection an \"anti-injunction clause.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n    at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that label is inaccurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Their argument has some support. Some courts of appeals likewise call \u00a7 4617(f) an \"anti-injunction\" clause.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Saxton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518389\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/954/#p960\">\n    901 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   957 ;\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263924\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/220/#p232\">\n    876 F.3d at 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And some interpret \u00a7 4617(f) as barring only equitable relief, not damages claims.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Saxton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518389\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/954/#p960\">\n    901 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   957 ;\n   <em>\n    Perry Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275833\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/591/#p599\">\n    864 F.3d at 606, 613-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We decline to adopt this interpretation for two reasons. First, the text of \u00a7 4617(f) is not limited to declaratory, injunctive, or other equitable relief. Second, our FIRREA precedent suggests that \u00a7 4617(f) also bars some monetary claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The text of \u00a7 4617(f) extends to monetary relief\n   </em>\n   . Section 4617(f) reads, in full: \"Except as provided in this section or at the request of the Director, no court\n   may take any action to restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of the Agency as a conservator or a receiver.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Nothing in that text refers to the type or form of remedy a plaintiff seeks. It says nothing about law versus equity or damages versus injunctions. Rather, the text forbids courts to take \"any action\" that seeks to \"restrain or affect\" the Agency's exercise of its powers as conservator. The focus is not on the\n   <em>\n    form\n   </em>\n   of requested relief, but its\n   <em>\n    effect\n   </em>\n   . If monetary relief would have that effect, then it is barred. If not, then it is permitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Our FIRREA precedent supports applying \u00a7 4617(f) to some monetary relief\n   </em>\n   . That interpretation accords with our cases interpreting FIRREA's parallel provision. In\n   <em>\n    Rosa v. Resolution Trust Corp.\n   </em>\n   , we held that \u00a7 1821(j) barred monetary relief granted as part of an injunction.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523722\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/383/#p399\">\n    938 F.2d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 399 (3d Cir. 1991). We did not rely on the equitable nature of the relief. What mattered was that the relief would have impeded the Resolution Trust Corporation's powers as \"conservator promptly to perform its important functions in dealing with the savings and loan crisis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523722\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/383/#p399\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs were limited to seeking a \"remedy that would not 'restrain or affect' the exercise of the receiver's or conservator's powers or functions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523722\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/383/#p399\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Our later precedent continued to apply\n   <em>\n    Rosa\n   </em>\n   's approach.\n   <em>\n    Hindes\n   </em>\n   , for example, recognized that \u00a7 1821(j) leaves open \"a judicial remedy for an\n   <em>\n    appropriate\n   </em>\n   damages claim.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"105805\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/137/148/#p153\">\n    137 F.3d at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). But not all damages claims are appropriate. Courts have suggested that appropriate damages claims might include constitutional claims, breach-of-contract claims, claims authorized by FIRREA or the Recovery Act through the administrative process, claims based on ultra vires Agency action, and other damages claims that do not restrain or affect the Agency's exercise of its authorized powers.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"105805\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/137/148/#p153\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (constitutional claims);\n   <em>\n    Perry Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275833\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/591/#p599\">\n    864 F.3d at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same, as well as breach of contract);\n   <em>\n    Saxton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518389\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/954/#p960\">\n    901 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   960 n.8 (Stras, J., concurring) (constitutional challenges to the Agency's structure);\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517755\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/640/#p653\">\n    896 F.3d at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same);\n   <em>\n    Gross v.

They are not constitutional. They have not gone through the Recovery Act's administrative process. They do not flow from ultra vires agency action. And they are not claims for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Their claims would also restrain or affect the Agency's exercise of its statutory powers. The Recovery Act empowered the Agency to enter into the Third Amendment. And all parties agree that \u00a7 4617(f) bars declaratory and injunctive relief. But granting the challengers' claims for damages, restitution, or disgorgement would require us to find the Third Amendment unlawful. The challengers cannot evade the bar on declaratory relief by asking for such a declaration as the basis for awarding damages. No matter how we label the relief, striking down the Third Amendment would interfere with the Agency's exercise of its powers as conservator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Even apart from the declaratory aspect, awarding monetary relief would restrain or affect the Agency's conservatorship. The request for damages, disgorgement, and restitution, against both the Agency and the Treasury, would (as the challengers concede) unravel the Third Amendment, reverse the monetary payments made under it, and prevent or at least deter the Agency from implementing it further. Those are the same consequences\n   that would flow from granting an injunction or a declaratory judgment. So the monetary relief sought here would restrain or affect the exercise of the Agency's powers as conservator. All of it is barred by \u00a7 4617(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The challengers are in an unfortunate spot. They invested in Fannie and Freddie, expecting regular dividend payments in return. The Third Amendment destroyed those expectations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   But the Recovery Act is clear. It empowered the Agency to enter into the Third Amendment. That deal complies with Delaware law, Virginia law, and the Recovery Act itself. And the challengers' requested relief would effectively unwind the Third Amendment. Doing so would restrain or affect the Agency's exercise of its powers as conservator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   This we cannot do. So we will affirm.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
