Appellant Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc. A response to the petitions was invited by the court and filed by the United States. Several motions for leave to file amici curiae briefs were filed and granted by the court. The petitions for rehearing, response, and amici curiae briefs were first referred to the panel that heard the appeals, and thereafter to the circuit judges who are in regular active service. A poll was requested, taken, and failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon consideration thereof,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   IT IS ORDERED THAT :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The petitions for panel rehearing are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The petitions for rehearing en banc are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The mandates of the court will issue on November 13, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The judiciary's role is to assure fidelity to law and to the Constitution. The Federal Circuit has a special responsibility as a national court, for no other circuit court is in our jurisdictional loop. Thus when questions of national impact reach us, it devolves upon us to bring the full potential of the court to bear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The national impact of these health insurance cases, coupled with the role of \"appropriations riders\" as a legislative tool, led to a split panel decision; and the ensuing requests for reconsideration have been accompanied by amicus curiae briefs on behalf of the insurance industry, state governments, economists and other scholars, and the public, advising us on the law, the Constitution, the legislative process, and the national interest. From the court's denial of rehearing en banc, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The facts are simple; the principle large. The critical question concerns the methods by which the government deals with non-governmental entities that carry out legislated programs. Here, in order to persuade the nation's health insurance industry to provide insurance to previously uninsured or uninsurable persons, and thus to take insurance risks of unknown dimension, the Affordable Care Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   provided that insurance losses over a designated percentage would be reimbursed, and comparable profits would be turned over to the government-the \"risk corridors\" program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   With this statutory commitment that the government \"shall pay,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018062\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), the nation's insurance industry provided the designated health insurance. However, when large losses were experienced by some carriers, the government refused to appropriate the funds to pay the statutory shortfall, and required that existing funds not be used for this purpose. Thus the insurers, who had performed their part of the bargain, were denied the promised compensation. My colleagues now ratify that denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This is a question of the integrity of government. \"It is very well to say that those who deal with the Government should turn square corners. But there is no reason why the square corners should constitute a one-way street.\"\n   <em>\n    Fed. Crop Ins. Corp. v.

For example, America's Health Insurance Plans, a national association of the insurance industry, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The panel majority's opinion, however, now makes it a risky business to rely upon the government's assurances.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners informs the court that \"only six of the 24 CO-OPs operating at peak participation were still in business,\" and that the government's refusal to make the promised payments \"transformed the Exchanges from promising to punitive for the insurance industry.\" Br. of Amicus Curiae The Nat'l Ass'n of Ins. Comm'rs in Supp. of Pl.-Appellee at 12, 14, Aug. 28, 2017, ECF No. 51.

The government's access to private sector products and services is undermined if non-payment is readily achieved after performance by the private sector. The Court has stated that \"[i]f the Government could be trusted to fulfill its promise to pay only when more pressing fiscal needs did not arise, would-be contractors would bargain warily-if at all-and only at a premium large enough to account for the risk of nonpayment.\"\n   <em>\n    Salazar v.
