Thomas, Chief Judge, Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\n   This case concerns an insurance dispute between T-Mobile USA Inc. (\"T-Mobile USA\") and Selective Insurance Company of America (\"Selective\"). After T-Mobile USA was sued over damage to a building caused by one of its cellular antennae towers, a dispute arose over whether T-Mobile USA was entitled to coverage as an additional insured under a Selective insurance policy taken out by a contractor that provided services in connection with the tower's construction. After Selective denied coverage, T-Mobile USA filed suit against Selective in state court in Washington. Selective removed the case to federal district court based on diversity jurisdiction. After discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court granted Selective's motion for summary judgment, which resulted in the dismissal of all of T-Mobile USA's claims. T-Mobile USA's subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied. T-Mobile USA appeals the district court's orders granting summary judgment and denying reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Order certifies to the Washington Supreme Court a critical question of state law before us-namely, whether, under Washington law, the rule that an insurer is bound by representations made by its authorized agents overrides the rule that certificates of insurance cannot affect insurance coverage, when the latter rule is echoed by disclaimer language in the certificate at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <judges id=\"p-13\">\n   Before addressing the certified question, we summarize the relevant facts.\n  </judges>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2010, T-Mobile Northeast, LLC (\"T-Mobile NE\")-a wholly owned regional subsidiary of Appellant T-Mobile USA\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -entered into a Field Services Agreement (\"FSA\") with Innovative Engineering, Inc. (\"Innovative\"). T-Mobile NE engaged Innovative to provide services in connection with the construction of rooftop cellular antennae towers in New York City, which provide cellular telephone coverage for T-Mobile users in the area. The FSA included a provision requiring Innovative to maintain general liability insurance naming T-Mobile NE as an additional insured, and required that Innovative provide T-Mobile NE with certificates of insurance documenting that coverage. Innovative engaged Selective to provide the insurance coverage mandated under the FSA. Selective issued the policy to Innovative, covering the period of January 16, 2012, to January 16, 2013 (the \"Policy\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Policy contained an Additional Insured (\"AI\") Endorsement that automatically extends \"additional insured\" status to any entity with whom Innovative enters into a written contract requiring Innovative to add that entity as an additional insured under the Policy (i.e., T-Mobile NE).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2012, Selective's authorized agent and insurance broker, the Van Dyk Group, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\"VDG\"), issued a Certificate of Insurance (\"COI\") to\n   <em>\n    T-Mobile USA\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The COI stated that\n   <em>\n    T-Mobile USA\n   </em>\n   , as the certificate holder, \"is included as an additional insured\" under the Policy. But it also stated, in capitalized and bolded text, that the COI \"is issued as a matter of information only and confers no rights upon the certificate holder,\" \"does not affirmatively or negatively amend, extend or alter the coverage afforded by\" the Policy, and \"does not constitute a contract between the issuing insurer(s), authorized representative or producer, and the certificate holder.\" The COI further warns that \"[i]f the certificate holder is an ADDITIONAL INSURED, the policy(ies) must be endorsed\" and that \"[a] statement on this certificate does not confer rights to the certificate holder in lieu of such endorsement(s).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2005, T-Mobile NE's predecessor, Omnipoint Communications, Inc. (\"Omnipoint\"), had leased space on the roof of a building in New York City to construct a cell tower, and contracted with Innovative to perform services in connection with this work. Omnipoint assigned this lease to T-Mobile NE in 2009, when T-Mobile NE subsumed Omnipoint. In early 2013, the building owner notified T-Mobile USA and Innovative of alleged property damage that resulted from Innovative's earlier work on the rooftop cell tower.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Innovative tendered this claim directly to Selective, and T-Mobile USA tendered the claim to Innovative with a request that Innovative \"immediately notify [its] insurance carrier.\" Innovative passed that claim on to Selective. In April 2013, the building owner brought suit against T-Mobile USA, Omnipoint, and Innovative in the Southern District of New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In July, 2013, Selective acknowledged Innovative's tender and agreed to defend Innovative in the Underlying Lawsuit subject to a reservation of rights letter (the \"ROR Letter\"). The ROR Letter stated that Selective would defend Innovative, but took the position that a Professional Services Exclusion might ultimately preclude coverage. Later, Selective denied T-Mobile USA's tender in an email vaguely referencing the ROR Letter. When representatives of T-Mobile USA followed up with Selective to question the coverage denial, Selective's coverage counsel stated that Selective would not be defending T-Mobile USA because \"T-Mobile does not appear in the Selective Policy named as an\n   insured\" and \"[i]t does not qualify as an additional insured.\" (emphasis removed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   T-Mobile USA-which is headquartered in Seattle, Washington-brought suit against Selective in the Superior Court for King County, Washington, on September 15, 2015, asserting claims for breach of contract, declaratory judgment, common law insurance bad faith, common law attorney's fees, and violation of consumer fraud statutes. T-Mobile USA's complaint alleged that T-Mobile USA qualified as an additional insured under the Policy. Selective removed the action to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington on November 4, 2015, invoking diversity jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After discovery, T-Mobile USA moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that the district court should enter judgment in T-Mobile USA's favor on its breach of contract and declaratory judgment claims because,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the 2012 COI issued by Selective's authorized agent states that T-Mobile USA is an additional insured under the Policy. Selective filed a cross-motion for summary judgment along with its opposition to T-Mobile USA's motion, requesting that T-Mobile USA's claims be dismissed in their entirety because,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the 2012 COI could not confer coverage on T-Mobile USA. The district court denied T-Mobile USA's partial motion for summary judgment and granted Selective's motion for summary judgment, ultimately dismissing all of T-Mobile USA's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We now turn to the issue that is the basis of our certification order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   T-Mobile USA argues that the 2012 COI that VDG issued to T-Mobile USA confers additional-insured status on T-Mobile USA under the Policy. T-Mobile USA\n   <em>\n    does not\n   </em>\n   contend that the COI is relevant to\n   <em>\n    interpreting\n   </em>\n   the Policy. Rather, T-Mobile USA contends that Selective is bound by VDG's representation in the COI that T-Mobile USA is an additional insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   There are two competing principles under Washington insurance law that are at loggerheads here. The first is that under Washington law, \"an insurance company is bound by all acts, contracts, or representations of its agent, whether general or special, which are within the scope of [the agent's] real or apparent authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Chicago Title Ins.

Accordingly, under Washington law, a COI is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the functional equivalent of an insurance policy, and it therefore\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   be used to amend, extend, or alter the coverage provisions of an insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=720%20P.2d%20805\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Int'l Marine Underwriters v.

On the one hand, VDG is Selective's duly authorized agent empowered to issue insurance binders confirming coverage, and therefore Selective should be bound by VDG's representations regarding T-Mobile USA's status as an additional insured under the Policy, which were contained in COIs issued on Selective's\n   behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chicago Title Ins.Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20P.3d%20372\">\n    309 P.3d at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, while VDG had actual authority to issue the 2012 COI, Selective argues that VDG had authority to do so only to the extent that its representations were consistent with the exact terms of the Policy. While the district court did not reach this question, Washington law is clear that \"where an agent acts within its authority, the principal cannot excuse itself from vicarious liability through an undisclosed private arrangement that purports to restrict that authority.\"\n    <em>\n     Chicago Title Ins.
