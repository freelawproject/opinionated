The caller described the shooter as a \"taller\" black man with a goatee, wearing a white shirt and dark pants. A few blocks from the bar, police officers saw Perry and another man crossing the street. Perry-the taller of the two-appeared to have a goatee and to be wearing a white shirt and dark pants. After briefly making eye contact with the police, the two men split up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Perry walked between some buildings to a parking lot. The police circled around the block. They found him standing next to a car, on the passenger side. They could then see that although the back and sleeves of his shirt were white, the front was dark blue or black. They could also see he had a full beard that was longer around his chin, not a goatee. One officer went to talk to Perry. The other began checking the area for evidence. Through the windshield of the car Perry was standing next to, he saw a handgun and two magazines under the passenger seat. The officers handcuffed and arrested Perry. He was charged with possessing the handgun from the car and three bullets the police found in his pockets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Perry argues the district court should have suppressed the bullets because the police did not have probable cause to arrest him, making the search of his pockets illegal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Minnesota v.

The district court, adopting the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, did not clearly err in finding: \"While there are some inconsistencies, [Perry] matched the material aspects of the shooter's description.\" Perry emphasizes his actual height is over six feet, while the 911 caller's estimate was \"5'8? to 5'9?.\" But the caller gave that specific measurement only in a follow-up interview\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Perry had been arrested. At the time of the arrest, which controls the probable-cause inquiry,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9095702\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/346/1165/#p1169\">\n    346 F.3d at 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the only description to the police was that the shooter was \"taller.\" That term aptly describes Perry. He is a taller black man, had a beard that was noticeably longer at his chin than on his cheeks, wore a shirt that looked white from the back, and had dark pants. Further, the police found him standing next to a car where a handgun and magazines were plainly visible, just a few blocks from where someone had reported \"shots fired\" minutes earlier. In the circumstances, a reasonable officer could have concluded that Perry was the shooter from the bar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because he remained calm and polite, even when the officers approached, Perry thinks they were compelled to conclude he was just an innocent passerby, not the shooter. \"But probable cause does not require officers to rule out a suspect's innocent explanation for suspicious facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Wesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12615996\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/577/#p586\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He was in custody before and during trial. After getting in a dispute with a sergeant at the jail, he was placed in segregation. This interfered with his ability to access a computer and legal materials and, in Perry's view, violated his constitutional right to mount a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Perry did not raise this issue to the district court and does so only conclusorily on appeal, with no meaningful explanation or argument. He has likely forfeited any entitlement to relief.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In any event, he makes no showing that his inability to access the law library \"hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim\" at trial, so his claim also fails on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

He focuses on one instance where the district court sustained a relevancy objection to his questioning of the government's DNA expert about forensic concepts and terminology. Perry asserts, again without meaningful explanation or argument, that his cross-examination \"was hindered by the court during trial, despite the seemingly relevant nature of his inquiries.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Perry questioned the expert extensively about her analysis. Before ruling on the objection, the district court discussed with Perry at length the relevance of the particular piece of information he sought to elicit. On appeal, Perry cannot say how the expert's answer to the question he was prevented from asking-\"what is a 'blob'?\"-would have contributed to his defense. The minimal constraint the court placed on Perry's ability to confront the government's witness posed no constitutional problem, and the court did not abuse its discretion by its evidentiary rulings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

ACCA mandates a sentence of at least 15 years for felons-in-possession \"who ha[ve] three previous convictions ... for a violent felony ... committed on occasions different from one another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). The district court held that Perry qualified based on (1) his convictions for first-degree aggravated robbery, simple robbery, and second-degree assault, all arising out of a holdup of a gas station; (2) another conviction for second-degree assault, following the gas-station robbery; and (3) a conviction for felony domestic assault. All of these convictions were under Minnesota law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Perry argues his conviction for first-degree aggravated robbery is not a \"violent felony.\" This court recently rejected Perry's argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Libby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266493\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1011/#p1014\">\n    880 F.3d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1014-16 (8th Cir. 2018) (\"[T]he elements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.245\">\n    Minn.

He argues that the conduct underlying his robbery and assault convictions all took place on the same \"occasion,\" so they should not be counted separately for ACCA purposes. If correct, he would have at most two qualifying \"violent felony\" convictions, not the necessary three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Perry entered a gas station, pointed a gun at the cashier, and took money from the register. That conduct led to Perry's robbery convictions and the first of his second-degree-assault convictions, all of which the district court treated as a single ACCA predicate. Grabbing the cash, Perry ran outside, still holding the gun. Someone saw him. As Perry fled, this witness drove after him. Perry then shot toward the witness's vehicle, close enough that the witness heard a \"zing\" and smelled gunpowder. For that, Perry received his other second-degree-assault conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The question is whether the second assault was \"committed on [an] occasion[ ] different from\" the robbery itself.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). Three main factors bear on this question: \"(1) the time lapse between offenses, (2) the physical distance between their occurrence, and (3) their lack of overall substantive continuity, a factor that is often demonstrated in the violent-felony context by different victims or different aggressions.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Perry's argument rests on his belief that his domestic-assault conviction was enhanced based on a second-degree-assault conviction that itself counted as a \"violent felony.\" In Perry's view, this constitutes improper \"double-dipping\" and a violation of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Classifying Perry's conviction as a \"violent felony\" is entirely consistent with the terms of the statute. Perry does not argue otherwise. As relevant, ACCA defines a \"violent felony\" as a crime that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\" and is \"punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(i).

He cites no authority. As the government explains, the conviction was \"employed for two different purposes\": first as a crime in its own right; second as an element in a different crime, involving different acts of violence. This court need not definitively resolve this issue, however, because Perry's domestic-assault conviction would have been a felony even without the earlier assault conviction. The criminal complaint in Perry's domestic-assault case (which he filed as an exhibit to his sentencing memorandum) listed three \"qualified domestic violence-related offense convictions\" as the basis to enhance the charge to a felony: the second-degree-assault conviction and two unrelated convictions for making terroristic threats.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.2242\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because only two qualifying convictions are required for the enhancement,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.2242\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 609.2242, subdiv. 4, the terroristic-threat convictions are enough on their own.

Years ago, Perry fired a warning shot at a witness after robbing a gas station.

This court therefore need not address whether the district court properly admitted and considered those materials.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Perry also argues the district court erred in determining his recommended sentence because his prior convictions did not qualify as \"crimes of violence\" under section 4B1.2(a) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2).
