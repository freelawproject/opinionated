Petitioners Elisa de Jesus Menendez and Hector Rodriguez-Castellon are both subject to removal for their respective convictions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20288\">\n    Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). In Menendez's case, No. 14-72730, the BIA determined that \u00a7 288(c)(1) is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Because the commission of such a crime stops the accrual of continuous residence, the BIA held that Menendez failed to accrue the seven years of residence required for cancellation of removal. In Rodriguez's case, No. 16-70365, the BIA determined that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20288\">\n    Cal.

On that basis, the BIA denied sua sponte reopening of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We hold that \u00a7 288(c)(1) is neither categorically a crime involving moral turpitude nor categorically a \"crime of child abuse.\" We grant Menendez's and Rodriguez's petitions for review. We remand both cases to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A. Menendez\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Elisa de Jesus Menendez is a native and citizen of El Salvador. She entered the United States without inspection at an unspecified time and place. After entering, she remained in the United States, married, and had three children. On August 17, 2004, Menendez successfully adjusted her status to lawful permanent resident pursuant to the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 23, 2010, Menendez was convicted of committing a \"lewd or lascivious act\" in violation of \u00a7 288(c)(1) of the California Penal Code. Section 288(c)(1) prohibits the commission of such an act when \"the victim is a child of 14 or 15 years, and [the defendant] is at least 10 years older than the child.\" A conviction under \u00a7 288(c)(1) is punishable by imprisonment in state prison for one to three years, or \"imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20288\">\n    Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). Menendez entered a nolo contendere plea and was sentenced to 180 days in county jail and five years of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In October 2013, the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings by filing a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\"). The NTA charged Menendez with removability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(E)(i), which makes removable any noncitizen convicted of, among other crimes, a \"crime of child abuse.\" Menendez admitted the charge through counsel, but argued that she was eligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found Menendez ineligible for cancellation of removal. For lawful permanent residents, eligibility for cancellation of removal requires a person to have established seven years of continuous residence in the United States \"after [admission] in any status.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(2). Under the stop-time rule, the commission of a disqualifying offense, including any crime involving moral turpitude, cuts off the accrual of continuous residence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1229b(d)(1) (incorporating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) ). The IJ held that Menendez's conviction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20288\">\n    Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) was categorically for a crime involving moral turpitude, and that\n   the stop-time rule therefore applied. Menendez was admitted into the United States on August 17, 2004. The felony complaint charged her with violating \u00a7 288(c)(1)\"on or about\" October 14, 2009, resulting in not quite five years and two months of continuous residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The IJ denied cancellation of removal and voluntary departure, and ordered Menendez removed to El Salvador. The BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge on all grounds and dismissed Menendez's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B. Rodriguez-Castellon\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Hector Rodriguez-Castellon is a native and citizen of Mexico. He was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on June 16, 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 2, 2009, the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings by serving Rodriguez with an NTA. The NTA charged that on June 7, 2005, Rodriguez entered a nolo contendere plea for a violation of Cal. Penal. Code. \u00a7 288(c)(1). An amended NTA brought three charges of removal against Rodriguez: (1) removal due to his alleged status as an aggravated felon, under a statutory subsection defining \"aggravated felony\" as including \"sexual abuse of a minor,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(A), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) ; (2) removal under a different aggravated felony subsection that applies to noncitizens convicted of a \"crime of violence,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) ; and (3) removal under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), which applies to noncitizens convicted of a \"crime of child abuse.\" The IJ sustained all three charges and ordered Rodriguez removed to Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, the BIA rejected the IJ's determination that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20288\">\n    Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) constitutes sexual abuse of a minor, citing this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Castro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683357\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/566/\">\n    607 F.3d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2010). The BIA, however, upheld the IJ's ruling on an alternative ground, holding that \u00a7 288(c)(1) categorically constitutes a crime of violence. It noted that the statutory definition for \"crime of violence,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(F), cross-references\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), which in turn, defines the term as including felony offenses that \"by [their] nature, involve[ ] a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\" The BIA reasoned that the age differential required by \u00a7 288(c)(1) creates a risk that physical force would be used and that Rodriguez was therefore removable as an aggravated felon. The BIA did not reach the question whether Rodriguez was also removable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(E)(i) (noncitizen convicted of child abuse).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In October 2013, we denied Rodriguez's petition for review in a published opinion, holding that a conviction under \u00a7 288(c)(1) is categorically a crime of violence because it \"raises a substantial risk of the use of force in the ordinary case.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez-Castellon v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3714956\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/847/#p860\">\n    733 F.3d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860 (9th Cir. 2013). Two years later, in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347586\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/1110/#p1120\">\n    803 F.3d 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1120 (9th Cir. 2015), we held that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) is unconstitutionally vague. The Supreme Court affirmed that decision in\n   <em>\n    Sessions v. Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/#p1216\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1216,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/#p1216\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). In November 2015, in light of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , Rodriguez filed a motion to reconsider his removal proceedings\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   He argued that the BIA's order of removal was premised on its conclusion that \u00a7 288(c)(1) was categorically a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b), and that because\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   had held \u00a7 16(b) void for vagueness the conclusion could not stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The BIA denied Rodriguez's motion. It acknowledged that Rodriguez's motion was untimely, but noted that \"a fundamental change in law may warrant sua sponte reopening notwithstanding otherwise applicable\n   time and number limitations on motions.\" The BIA declined to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen after holding that Rodriguez was removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) as a noncitizen convicted of a crime of child abuse, even if he was no longer removable as an aggravated felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We generally lack jurisdiction to review the BIA's decision not to invoke its sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Ekimian v.

However, we have jurisdiction to review the reasoning behind the BIA's sua sponte denial of reopening \"for the limited purpose of reviewing the reasoning behind the decisions for legal or constitutional error.\"\n   <em>\n    Bonilla v.

Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To determine whether a state statute describes a removable offense, we apply the categorical approach set forth in\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

The first step is to identify the elements of the state statute of conviction-here,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20288\">\n    Cal.

It requires a defendant to have acted \"willfully,\" but this requirement applies only to the defendant's commission of the act. Section 288(c)(1) requires only that a defendant did not act accidentally; it does not \"require any intent to violate law, or to injure another, or to acquire any advantage.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207\">\n    Cal.

However, we remain troubled that, here, immigration consequences and, in other settings, sentences should turn on a determination in the abstract of the breadth of the underlying state statute rather than the person's actual offense. The present system forces courts to parse state statutes for determinations that no state legislator ever considered, and leads to uneven results, as the immigration consequences to individuals who committed basically the same offenses turn on the fortuity of the breadth of the state statute, which in most instances has nothing to do with the individual's actual criminal conviction. If Congress will not, or cannot act (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Almanza-Arenas v.
