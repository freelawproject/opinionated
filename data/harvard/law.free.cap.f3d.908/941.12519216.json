Webb filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and made post-petition payments to his Chapter 13 Trustee (the \"Trustee\") under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) before the dismissal of the petition. Subsequent to the dismissal, the Division sought to obtain the post-petition payments held by the Trustee to apply against Webb's delinquent child support.

At the time, Webb owed nearly $75,000 to the Division for unpaid child support. In January 2017, the Division filed a proof of claim setting Webb's child support indebtedness in the amount of $74,277.32.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As required by \u00a7 1326(a)(1), Webb began making post-petition payments to the Trustee while awaiting confirmation of his proposed Chapter 13 Plan. However, despite four attempts, Webb was unable to propose a confirmable Chapter 13 Plan. The bankruptcy court, with Webb's consent, dismissed the case on February 10, 2017. At the time of dismissal, Webb had paid the Trustee $3,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Section 63.2-1929 of the Code of Virginia permits the Division to serve a notice of levy upon \"any person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision or department of the Commonwealth.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2063.2-1929\">\n    Va.

Citing the authority of that Virginia statute, the Division served the Trustee with an Order to Withhold for child support indebtedness soon after Webb's bankruptcy case was dismissed. The Order to Withhold directed the Trustee to surrender to the Division the $3,000 in post-petition payments the Trustee held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Trustee concluded that the Order to Withhold left him with \"conflicting obligations.\" J.A. 163.

J.A. 166.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Trustee then filed a motion in the bankruptcy court seeking direction as to whom he should pay the post-petition funds. After a hearing, the bankruptcy court directed the Trustee to return the funds to Webb. In a cogent opinion, the bankruptcy court resolved the matter based on the plain language of the Bankruptcy Code:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   This Court agrees with the line of cases finding that the language of section 1326(a)(2) is clear and unambiguous. That is, the Bankruptcy Code is clear that \"[i]f a plan is not confirmed, the trustee ... shall return such payments ... to the debtor.\" At the February 9, 2017 hearing on confirmation of the debtor's chapter 13 plan, the Court did not confirm the plan and dismissed the case. At that point, the trustee became obligated under the Bankruptcy Code to return the funds to the debtor.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   The\n   Court finds no ambiguity or confusion in the language of the statute as enacted. The Court thus will enforce the plain reading of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The chapter 13 trustee in this case received the payments pursuant to his statutory duties as trustee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201302\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1326. The Bankruptcy Code, under section 1326, provides unambiguous terms for the trustee's responsibilities with respect to the payments received. That section provides a mechanism for a creditor to be paid the funds held by the trustee. That mechanism is pursuant to section 503(b) or section 1326(a). In this case the Division admits that it has no claim under either section 503(b) or under section 1326(a), but it asks this Court to direct the trustee to pay the Division anyway on the grounds that it was the first creditor to exercise its non-bankruptcy law collection remedies to, in effect, attach the funds held by the trustee. To honor the Division's collection order would require this Court to ignore the express language of Bankruptcy Code sections 1326 and 349.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   J.A. 181-82 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The bankruptcy court bolstered its conclusion by pointing out that, if it adopted the Division's preferred construction, it would create a \"race to the trustee,\" a result at odds with the effect of a dismissal under \u00a7 349(b)(3). J.A. 182. Thus, the bankruptcy court found that its reading of \u00a7 1326(a)(2)\"returned [the parties] as closely as possible to their respective [pre-petition] positions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201302\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Division appealed to the district court, which affirmed the bankruptcy court's decision finding that the \"[plain] language [of \u00a7 1326(a)(2) ] ... is determinative.\" J.A. 247. The district court noted that, after the automatic stay expires, creditors may pursue state law remedies against the debtor generally, including levying upon \"other individuals who possess the debtor's property or income (for example, an employer).\" J.A. 248. \"But Congress changed the default situation in Section 1326(a)(2) by directing the Chapter 13 trustee to give the funds [paid to him by the debtor back] to the debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201302\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Relying on the plain language of the statute, the district court rejected the Division's alternate arguments.

None have merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, the Division argues that the language of \u00a7 1326(a) neither prohibits the Trustee from complying with the Order to Withhold nor mandates that the Chapter 13 trustee return payments to a debtor\n   <em>\n    whenever\n   </em>\n   a Chapter 13 plan is not confirmed. Instead, according to the Division, requiring return of the post-petition payments would lead to an absurd result by forcing the trustee to return funds to the debtor even when the debtor contemplates submitting an amended plan. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Division's argument simply ignores the plain statutory direction that the trustee \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   return any [post-petition] payments ... to the debtor[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (emphasis added). And there is nothing at all absurd about returning\n   the funds to the debtor. Besides being Congress' specific choice, it follows Congress' direction in \u00a7 349(b)(3) that the effect of dismissal of a case \"revests the property of the estate in the entity in which such property was vested immediately before the commencement of [a bankruptcy case].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20349\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). Here, that \"entity\" is Webb.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This result \"follow[s] directly from Congress' decisions\" to have these payments returned to the debtor after a confirmation of his plan is denied and particularly when the case is also dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116248\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1829/#p1835\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That outcome is not \"demonstrably at odds with clearly expressed congressional intent.\"\n   <em>\n    RCI Tech. Corp. v. Sunterra Corp.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Sunterra Corp.\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645481,9268788\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/257/\">\n    361 F.3d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 265 (4th Cir. 2004) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sigmon Coal Co., Inc. v.

Neither is the outcome \"so gross as to shock the general moral or common sense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11231413\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/291/#p304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sigmon Coal Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11231413\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/291/#p304\">\n    226 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   304 ). If anything, the absurd result would be to ignore the plain statutory direction and create the \"race to the trustee\" that the bankruptcy court rejected. Thus, we agree with the bankruptcy and district courts that the Division's absurdity argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, the Division argues that the Court should read \u00a7 1326(a) in conjunction with \u00a7\u00a7 349 and 362, the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code governing, respectively, dismissal and the automatic stay. But following the plain language of \u00a7 1326(a)(2) creates no conflict with these other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Division's reference to \u00a7 349 is puzzling. As pointed out above, \u00a7 349(b)(3)\"revests the property of the estate in the entity in which such property was vested immediately before the commencement of [a bankruptcy case]\" upon dismissal of the case.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20349\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). That clear language simply reinforces the district court's determination that the payments be returned to Webb as the debtor whose case has been dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Division's \u00a7 362 argument fares no better; under that statute, the automatic stay shielded Webb's post-petition payments from the Division or any other creditors during the Chapter 13 proceeding. Once the bankruptcy court dismissed the case, the automatic stay was lifted. The Division contends that it now should be able to pursue its remedies available in state court against Webb and directly levy on the Trustee as a stakeholder of Webb's assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As the district court pointed out, the Division's approach would generally be applicable to persons who possess Webb's property. But doing so in this particular instance would require the Trustee to relinquish post-petition payments to an entity other than the one designated by the statute-the debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The Division's \u00a7 362 argument is simply unrelated to the clear requirement of \u00a7 1326(a)(2). As the district court noted: \" Section 362 's description of a stay's conclusion does not contradict or muddle Section 1326(a)(2) 's statement about\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   gets the funds, it only addresses\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   those funds are available.\" J.A. 248.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Further, the Division contends that because funds the Trustee now holds did not exist before Webb filed his petition, revesting that money in him unfairly enhances his financial position. The Division posits that without the bankruptcy case, the money would not have been available to him because the Division could have garnished or levied upon it. Thus, according to the Division, the plain language of \u00a7 1326(a)(2) affords him greater protections than the Bankruptcy Code intends by protecting his money even after the stay expires. Whether that is true or not, that is the choice Congress has made and \"follow[s] directly from Congress' decisions to shield postpetition\n   wages from creditors\" during the pendency of a Chapter 13 proceeding and to return the debtor's post-petition payments to him.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116248\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1829/#p1835\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Lastly, the Division argues that reading \u00a7 1326 to bar levy on the Trustee through the Order to withhold overrides Virginia Code \u00a7 63.2-1929. The Division asserts that this violates a presumption that Congress did not intend to preempt state law by enacting a federal statute. The Division contends that \u00a7 1326(a)(2) and state laws allowing levy or garnishment are easily reconciled-if \u00a7 1326(a)(2) does not require the Trustee to refund the post-petition payments to Webb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We are not persuaded. The Court is not at liberty to ignore the plain text of \u00a7 1326(a)(2) : \"Under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, a state law which conflicts with federal law is preempted.\"\n   <em>\n    Cox v. Shalala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854908\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/151/#p154\">\n    112 F.3d 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 154 (4th Cir. 1997). Thus, if \"the federal statute dictates one result and the state statute another, the state statute is preempted to the extent that it directly conflicts with federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854908\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/151/#p154\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, any state authority under Virginia Code \u00a7 63.2-1929 for levy on the Trustee directly conflicts with the federal statutory mandate in \u00a7 1326(a)(2) that the Trustee refund the post-petition payments to Webb. Thus, \u00a7 1326(a)(2) preempts Virginia Code \u00a7 63.2-1929 and requires that the Trustee return the post-petition payments to Webb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As the bankruptcy and district courts found, the plain language of \u00a7 1326(a)(2) resolves this case and requires the Trustee return the post-petition payments to Webb. Once the Trustee returns the funds to Webb, the Division, or any other creditor, is free to levy upon Webb or others who possess his property. Section 1326(a)(2) simply prevents the Division from levying upon the Trustee when he is in possession of the post-petition payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Thus, for all the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Section 503(b) defines \"administrative claims,\" none of which are claimed to be at issue here. In other words, the parties agree the administrative expense exception under \u00a7 1326(a)(2) has no application to the Division's claim for child support payments. Similarly, no party claims any entitlement \"pursuant to paragraph (3).\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2).
