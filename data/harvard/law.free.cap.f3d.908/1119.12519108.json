She alleged\n   that Hot Spring County Deputy Amie Martin was deliberately indifferent to Barton's serious medical needs and that Hot Spring County Jail Administrator George Wright failed to adequately train or supervise Martin, thereby causing the deprivation of Barton's constitutional rights. Regina Barton further alleged that Hot Spring County did not adequately train its detention facility workers and that its policies failed to ensure that detainees received adequate medical care. We affirm the district court's denial of qualified immunity to Martin, we reverse the denial of qualified immunity to Wright, and we dismiss the County's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 12, 2011, Barton was involved in a single-vehicle accident at an overpass located on U.S. Highway 270. He was placed under arrest after a portable breath test indicated that his blood alcohol concentration was .117. Barton could not stand without assistance. When he fell to the ground during the search of his person, he briefly was not responsive, and an officer checked to make sure that he still had a pulse. Officers thereafter placed Barton in a patrol car, and Arkansas State Trooper Zachary Owens transported him to the Hot Spring County detention center for booking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Martin was working at the detention center when Barton arrived at approximately 3:15 p.m. According to Martin, he \"appear[e]d to be highly intoxicated, his speech was slurred, [and] he was having trouble standing alone.\" Trooper Owens led Barton to a room for additional testing to determine his blood alcohol concentration. After numerous attempts, Barton was able to provide only one adequate sample, which indicated a blood alcohol concentration of .115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Owens thereafter escorted Barton to the booking area where Martin was stationed. Barton sat on a bench as Owens completed paperwork. When asked by Owens to stand beside him, Barton walked over to Owens and held the handrail before collapsing to the ground. Two trustees helped Owens return Barton to the bench, where he remained seated while Owens finished explaining the citation and asked him to sign certain documents. Owens instructed Barton three times where to sign the document, but Barton did not seem to understand the instructions, and he did not sign the document. Owens told Martin that Barton was under the influence of alcohol and hydrocodone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Martin's arrest-disposition report noted that Barton was under the influence of alcohol and hydrocodone upon his arrival at the detention center, but that he was conscious, breathing normally, and did not appear to be suicidal. Martin wrote that Barton was unable to answer any questions about his medical needs or his next of kin. He could not sign his name or provide a phone number of someone she could call for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although she knew that Barton had been involved in a car accident immediately before his arrest and that he was heavily intoxicated, Martin did not conduct the healthcare screening that the detention center's policy requires. She decided to accept Barton into the detention center, placed him in a holding cell, and allowed Trooper Owens to leave. Martin herself left the detention center at approximately 4:50 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During the night, a trustee reported to a jailer that Barton did not seem to be doing well and that his condition was not improving. Barton died in his cell sometime that night. His body was found at 12:03 a.m. on September 13, 2011. An autopsy determined that the cause of death was a heart condition-anomalous right coronary artery, fatty infiltration of right ventricle and atrium of heart. Small amounts of ethanol and hydrocodone and a non-toxic level of anti-anxiety medication were found in Barton's system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Wright was serving as the jail administrator when Barton was detained. Although he had no contact with Barton, Wright was responsible for ensuring that the detention center's personnel were adequately trained and were implementing the County's policies, which Wright admitted he did not fully understand. Those policies instructed booking officers to conduct a healthcare screening of an arrestee before releasing the arresting officer; to refer an intoxicated arrestee to detoxification, or in the alternative, to seek medical clearance before admitting the individual into the detention center; to keep intoxicated arrestees under close observation; and to refuse arrestees who appear to be in a medical emergency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court denied, in relevant part, the defendants' motion for summary judgment. It concluded that neither Martin nor Wright was entitled to qualified immunity on the \u00a7 1983 claims or summary judgment on the state-law claim. With respect to the County, the district court determined that there was a question of fact whether the \"County had a custom of remaining deliberately indifferent to the objectively serious medical needs of its detainees, or of failing to train or supervise its Detention Facility staff.\" D.

We disagree. As recounted above, Barton had been in a car accident. He could not follow simple instructions or answer basic questions; he was unable to stand without assistance and fell during the booking procedure. Although Barton had a .115 blood alcohol concentration, he reportedly was so heavily intoxicated that Wright could not recall whether he had \"ever r[u]n into somebody that was in [Barton's] particular shape,\" and he \"d[id]n't know that any of [his] officers had either.\" In light of the evidence of Barton's recent car accident, his severe intoxication, and his drug ingestion, we conclude that a jury could find that Barton was experiencing a medical need so obvious that a layperson would recognize that he needed prompt medical attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We reject Martin's contention that Barton presented symptoms similar to the detainee in\n   <em>\n    Grayson v.

The detainee in\n   <em>\n    Grayson\n   </em>\n   was under the influence of methamphetamine, but he sat calmly and answered questions during booking, causing the booking officer to remark that \"the jail had booked detainees in worse condition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5559631\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/802/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5559631\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/802/\">\n    at 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The officer thereafter accompanied the detainee to a dressing room, where the detainee complied with instructions to change into a prison uniform. We concluded that \"[c]onfronted with a calm, non-combative person sitting on a bench answering questions, a layperson would not leap to the conclusion that Grayson needed medical attention, even if he were aware that Grayson had taken methamphetamine.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5559631\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/802/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5559631\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/802/\">\n    at 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast to the situation in\n   <em>\n    Grayson\n   </em>\n   , Martin was confronted with a confused, noticeably intoxicated person who was unable to stand and who could not answer simple questions, including those about his medical\n   needs. The facts here are more analogous to\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. King\n   </em>\n   , in which we affirmed the denial of qualified immunity to the booking officer who was presented with a detainee \"who passed out in the booking area, nearly fell out of his seat, was unable to sign his name, and ... 'couldn't even answer questions that [the booking officer] was asking him.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703266\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/742/#p746\">\n    730 F.3d at 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Martin next argues that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that she knew that Barton needed medical care and nonetheless disregarded his serious medical need. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Barton, a jury could infer Martin's knowledge by Barton's evident need for prompt medical attention and Martin's obviously inadequate response to that need.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barton I\n   </em>\n   , 820 F.3d at 965 (explaining that a defendant's mental state can be inferred from evidence \"that demonstrate[s] that a medical need was obvious and that the [official's] response was 'obviously inadequate' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703266\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/742/#p746\">\n    730 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   747 ) ). Martin saw Barton collapse and observed that he did not understand Owens's instructions. Despite knowing that Barton had been in a car accident, that he had symptoms of severe intoxication, and that he could not answer her questions about his medical needs, Martin did not conduct the healthcare screening that the County's policies require and which would have revealed significant bruising on Barton's back and legs. A jury also could consider evidence that Martin did not follow the County's policies when she decided to accept the obviously intoxicated Barton into the detention center without medical approval and without attempting to refer him to the detoxification unit. The circumstances presented to Martin thus are distinguishable from those presented to the booking officer in\n   <em>\n    Grayson\n   </em>\n   , because the detainee there had no obvious injuries and his \"behavior at the time of the intake did not suggest a high degree of intoxication.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5559631\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/802/\">\n    454 F.3d at 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We also reject Martin's contention that it was not clearly established on September 12, 2011, that booking Barton into jail would constitute deliberate indifference to Barton's serious medical needs.

In the absence of such evidence, the mere assertion of prior suits does not support an inference that Wright had notice on September 12, 2011, that the County's training procedures and supervision were inadequate and likely to result in constitutional violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   III. Arkansas Civil Rights Act\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Martin and Wright argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on the state-law claim. Arkansas has adopted the federal deliberate-indifference standard as that which is to be applied to claims brought by pretrial detainees under the Arkansas Civil Rights Act.\n   <em>\n    Grayson v. Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4016833\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/369/241/\">\n    369 Ark. 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4016833\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/369/241/\">\n    253 S.W.3d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 433 (2007). Accordingly, for the same reasons set forth above, Wright is entitled to summary judgment and Martin is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We affirm the denial of qualified immunity as to Martin. We reverse the denial of qualified immunity as to Wright. Because our resolution of the qualified immunity issues does not necessarily resolve the question whether the County maintained an unconstitutional custom, we do not have pendent appellate jurisdiction over the County's appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lockridge v. Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ark.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9378423\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/1005/#p1012\">\n    315 F.3d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1012 (8th Cir. 2003) (en banc). The County's appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    In an earlier appeal, we affirmed the denial of qualified immunity to Owens.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Barton v. Taber\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256309\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/958/\">\n     820 F.3d 958\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (8th Cir. 2016) (\n    <em>\n     Barton I\n    </em>\n    ). The district court later granted Regina Barton's motion to dismiss Owens from the lawsuit and dismissed the claims against him without prejudice.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D. Ct. Order of Mar. 2, 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
