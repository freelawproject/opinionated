Tricarichi appeals from the tax court's decision on his petition challenging a notice of transferee liability regarding West Side Cellular, Inc.'s (\"West Side\") unpaid taxes. We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207482\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this opinion, we affirm the tax court's conclusion that Tricarichi is liable for the \"pre-notice interest\" component of West Side's tax liability. Specifically, we hold that because Tricarichi received transferred assets worth\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   than West Side's total federal tax liability, the federal Internal Revenue Code determines pre-notice interest, and the availability of interest under state law is irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Tricarichi was the sole shareholder of West Side. In 2003, West Side received a $65 million litigation settlement that exposed it to significant tax liabilities. Tricarichi then sold his stock in West Side and received about $35.2 million through a so-called \"Midco\" tax-shelter transaction. Following the sale, West Side failed to pay its corporate taxes for 2003 and the IRS was unable to collect from West Side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2012, the IRS issued a notice of transferee liability to Tricarichi, seeking to collect West Side's unpaid taxes from Tricarichi as a \"transferee\" of about $35.2 million of West Side's assets. Tricarichi then filed a petition in tax court, challenging the IRS's notice of transferee liability. After a bench trial, the tax court ruled in the IRS's favor, holding that Tricarichi was liable as a transferee for the full amount of West Side's 2003 tax deficiency and associated penalties and interest, totaling about $35.1 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In a concurrently filed memorandum disposition, we affirmed the tax court's conclusion that Tricarichi is liable for West Side's unpaid taxes under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206901\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Ohio Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (\"UFTA\").

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because the parties dispute only the legal question of whether federal or state law determines pre-notice interest, we decide de novo whether Tricarichi is liable for such interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hongsermeier v. Comm'r\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784906\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/890/#p899\">\n    621 F.3d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 899 (9th Cir.2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Pre-Notice Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties dispute whether Tricarichi is liable for pre-notice interest, meaning interest that accrued on West Side's 2003 tax liability between the date its tax was due to be paid (March 15, 2004) and the date the IRS issued Tricarichi a notice of transferee liability (June 25, 2012). The Commissioner argues that the federal Internal Revenue Code-specifically\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206601\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -controls whether Tricarichi is liable for pre-notice interest. If the Commissioner is correct, Tricarichi owes more than $13 million in pre-notice interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, Tricarichi contends that state law (here, Ohio law) determines any liability for pre-notice interest, and that under state law, he owes $0 in pre-notice interest. The tax court agreed with the Commissioner and ordered that Tricarichi pay pre-notice interest of nearly $13.9 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For over half a century, tax courts have generally held that whether federal or state law determines the right to and amount of pre-notice interest depends on whether the value of assets received by the transferee exceeds the total federal tax liability owed by the transferor, including statutory penalties and interest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Estate of Stein v.

Where, as here, a transferee has received assets worth\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   than the transferor's total federal tax liability, pre-notice interest is determined under the federal Internal Revenue Code and there is no need to consult state law regarding interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lowy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6071444\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/35/393/#p395\">\n    35 T.C. at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, where a transferee has received assets worth\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   than the transferor's total federal tax liability, the IRS's recovery is limited to the value of the assets transferred, and the IRS can then look to state law to attempt to recover any interest in excess of that amount from the transferee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Stein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6071948\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/37/945/#p961\">\n    37 T.C. at 961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lowy\n   </em>\n   , the tax court explained the rationale for this distinction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6071444\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/35/393/#p395\">\n    35 T.C. at 395-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Stern\n   </em>\n   , \"the existence and extent of transferee liability should be determined by State law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 396. However, as the tax court explained, the federal Internal Revenue Code creates the right to and determines the \"quantum\" of the IRS's underlying claim that it is seeking to enforce against the transferee, including the statutory interest accrued upon the tax deficiency.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 395-96. Therefore, where the assets transferred \"are\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   than ample to discharge the full Federal liability of the transferor (including interest),\" it is unnecessary \"to look to State law for the creation of any right to interest\" to satisfy the IRS's claim.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 397 (emphasis added). On the other hand, \"where the amount of the transferred assets is\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   than the amount of the [IRS's] claim,\" to make the IRS whole, under state law the IRS \"may\n   have a further right to collect interest from the transferee, based upon the wrongful use of those assets by the transferee prior to payment\" of the transferor's tax liability.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 395, 397 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Stein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6071948\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/37/945/#p961\">\n    37 T.C. at 961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (further explaining rationale for distinction).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In our only decision related to this issue, we followed this line of tax court cases, holding that \"[w]here transferee liability is found to exist but the transferred assets are insufficient to satisfy the transferor's total tax liability, a transferee's liability for interest is controlled by state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Edelson v.

However, we have not yet addressed the situation presented in\n   <em>\n    Lowy\n   </em>\n   and the instant case, where the transferee received assets worth\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   than the transferor's total federal tax liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The First Circuit recently followed the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Lowy\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Estate of Stein\n   </em>\n   to derive the \"simple\" rule that \"[t]he IRS may recover from [the transferee] all amounts [the transferor] owes to the IRS (including section 6601 interest accruing on [the transferor's] tax debt), up to the limit of the amount transferred to [the transferee], with any recovery of prejudgment interest above the amount transferred to be determined in accord with [state] law.\"\n   <em>\n    Schussel v.

In so holding, the First Circuit explained that \"it is helpful to distinguish between interest accrued on the tax obligation of the taxpayer-transferor, and interest accrued on the transferred funds recovered from the transferee by a creditor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 88-89. \"Federal interest on a tax obligation accrues automatically ... [and] is simply a part of the debt owed by the taxpayer-transferor to the IRS,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6601(e), all of which may usually be collected from a fraudulent transferee to the extent of the amount fraudulently transferred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 89 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lowy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6071444\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/35/393/#p395\">\n    35 T.C. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   394 ). As a result, there is no need to consult state law where the value of the transferred assets is\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   than the transferor's total tax liability. \"[F]or example, if the taxpayer owes $100 in taxes, upon which $30 in interest accrues, and the taxpayer then fraudulently transfers $150 to a transferee, the IRS can certainly recover a judgment of no less than $130 against the transferee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\"Therefore, where the assets in the hands of the transferee [are] 'more than ample to discharge the full Federal liability of the transferor (including interest),' there [is] no need to resort to state-law interest principles to make the IRS whole.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 92 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lowy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6071444\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/35/393/#p395\">\n    35 T.C. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   397 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We agree with the First Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Schussel\n   </em>\n   and the tax court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lowy\n   </em>\n   , and hold that because the value of assets transferred from West Side to Tricarichi is\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   than West Side's total federal tax liability, the federal Internal Revenue Code determines Tricarichi's pre-notice interest liability, and there is no need to consult state law regarding such interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Despite acknowledging the above case law, Tricarichi argues that the pre-notice interest here must be determined under Ohio law, which purportedly would immunize him from liability for any pre-notice interest.
