The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   re-sentenced Kemp on both the ACCA conviction and his drug trafficking conviction. Kemp argues that the sentences imposed at the re-sentencing hearing were procedurally unreasonable because of a miscalculation of the applicable United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"USSG\" or \"Guidelines\") range. We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 26, 2013, Kemp appeared before the district court for sentencing on two offenses: conspiracy to distribute at least 500 grams of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) and 846 (Count I); and felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) and 924(e)(1) (Count II). Because of the quantity of methamphetamine involved, the penalties for Count I included a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 10 years.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). Due to Kemp's three prior Missouri convictions for second-degree burglary, Kemp faced an enhanced 15-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment on Count II under the ACCA, rather than the statutory maximum term of 10 years set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court, in calculating the applicable Guidelines range, determined that, with respect to Count I, Kemp was a career offender under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 and with respect to Count II, Kemp was an armed career criminal under USSG \u00a7 4B1.4(a). After grouping the offenses, the district court found that the applicable Guidelines range was a term of imprisonment of 324 to 405 months, based on a total offense level of 36 and criminal history category VI. Judge Jackson sentenced Kemp to concurrent terms of 210 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 3, 2016, Kemp filed a motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , seeking relief under\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court concluded that, after\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   , Kemp no longer had the requisite number of qualifying violent felony convictions to support the ACCA-enhanced sentence imposed on Count II. Judge Jackson determined that Count I was unaffected and ordered a re-sentencing hearing on Count II only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By administrative order, Kemp's case was transferred to Judge Limbaugh for the re-sentencing hearing. The re-sentencing hearing was held on September 6, 2017. On re-sentencing, the parties disputed whether Kemp could be re-sentenced on Count I. Kemp advocated for re-sentencing on Count I under the sentencing packaging doctrine. Judge Limbaugh re-sentenced Kemp on both counts since the amount of time Kemp would spend in custody was going to be unchanged. In calculating the applicable Guidelines range, the court relied on the 2013 Sentencing Guidelines manual as contained in the Resentencing Report prepared by the United States Probation Office. The Guidelines calculation recited at the initial sentencing hearing was re-announced at re-sentencing. Judge Limbaugh re-imposed a term of imprisonment of 210 months on Count I and imposed the statutory maximum, a concurrent term of 120 months' imprisonment, on Count II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Kemp seeks a remand because Judge Limbaugh used the 2013 edition of the Guidelines manual in effect at the time of his initial sentencing rather than the 2016 edition in effect at the time of his re-sentencing hearing. \"Generally, district courts should apply the Guidelines 'that are in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Steward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266356\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/983/#p985\">\n    880 F.3d 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 985 (8th Cir. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Peugh v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697059\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/530/#p537\">\n    569 U.S. 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 537-38,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697059\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/530/#p537\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697059\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/530/#p537\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) ). The United States concedes that when the court re-sentenced Kemp on both counts, it should have recalculated the Guidelines range for Count I because (A) the drug quantity amount would have been two levels lower pursuant to Amendment 782, and (B) burglary was removed as a predicate offense for career offender classification under Amendment 798.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"We review a sentence in two parts: first, we review for significant procedural error, such as an improper calculation of the advisory sentencing guidelines range; and second, absent significant procedural error, we review for substantive reasonableness.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Fischer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5753260\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/551/751/#p754\">\n    551 F.3d 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 754 (8th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted).

While in some cases a court sentencing a defendant under an incorrect Guidelines range may require remand without any further showing of prejudice, when a district court's detailed explanation for the sentence imposed makes clear that the judge based the sentence he or she selected on factors independent of the Guidelines, the error may be harmless.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court repeatedly stated that the sentence was going to be the same regardless of whether re-sentencing occurred as to only the vacated count or both counts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Okay. All right. Well, in any event, I'll just say up front that my conclusions on the disposition in this case will be the same whether I was resentencing on both counts or just the one count that Judge Jackson vacated under the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   You know, like I said, it's not going to matter, because I'm going to give him the same sentence. I might as well resentence him on both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court clearly identified not only the contested issue of the parameters of the resentencing hearing, but also discussed the facts necessary to support its broader sentencing decision instead of merely relying on Kemp's advisory Guidelines range:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   First of all, I looked at your criminal history, and it is hugely substantial with all the felony offenses, but the prosecutor is right the amount of methamphetamine involved was more than 5 kilograms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   It was an enormous amount. And it's my opinion that you got hugely lenient treatment when you were originally sentenced in the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   As I say, that is still very lenient treatment from the top of the guidelines, or from the bottom of the guidelines I should say, 324 to 405 months, or even if the guidelines were reduced to what your lawyer indicated, even assuming that I was imposing a sentence with that lower guideline range, I would still think that given all the factors under 3553(a) that the appropriate sentence - - or I should say that the generous and lenient sentence would still be 210 months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On this record, any error in calculating the applicable Guidelines range was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
