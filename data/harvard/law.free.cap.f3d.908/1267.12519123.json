Mechanical resistance, or ultimate tensile strength (\"UTS\"), is measured in megapascals (\"MPa\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hot-stamping is a thermal treatment process where steel blanks are rapidly heated, inserted into a stamping machine that contains special dies, stamped into a particular shape, and then rapidly cooled, or quenched.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ArcelorMittal Fr. v.

The high UTS of the hot-stamped steel is desirable for use in the production of auto parts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Independent claim 17 of the RE940 patent is representative of the asserted product-by-process claims and recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   17.

The difference is that claim 17 of the RE940 patent reflects the district court's prior claim construction that \"very high mechanical resistance\" in the '805 patent means \"a mechanical resistance of 1500 MPa or greater,\" which was affirmed by this court on appeal as part of an earlier litigation in 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ArcelorMittal I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3636906\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/700/1314/#p1317\">\n    700 F.3d at 1321-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The claimed \"thermal treatment\" inherently includes \"hot-shaping the coated steel sheet\" and cooling it to produce martensitic structures. Appellee Br. 19. This appeal focuses on the limitations \"thermal treatment\" and \"a mechanical resistance in excess of 1500 MPa.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   2. The 2010 Action\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In January 2010, ArcelorMittal sued AK Steel Corporation (\"AK Steel\") for infringement of the '805 patent (the \"2010 action\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The primary issue in the 2010\n   action was whether steel sheets produced by AK Steel met the \"a mechanical resistance of 1500 MPa or greater\" limitation of the '805 patent after thermal treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The record indicates that when the 2010 action was filed, AK Steel manufactured steel sheets referred to as \"AXN,\" which denoted that the steel sheets were an experimental grade.\n   <em>\n    ArcelorMittal v. AK Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-685-SLR,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20239344\">\n    2017 WL 239344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 &amp; n.6 (D. Del. Jan. 19, 2017). Evidence about the stamped AXN products indicated stamping by a single non-commercial \"prototype shop\" named Vehma. J.A. 1061-62. The evidence indicated that the stamped AXN product had a UTS that did not exceed 1,500 MPa. ArcelorMittal's own expert testified that, after hot-stamping, the AXN product had a UTS of 1,442 MPa.\n   <em>\n    ArcelorMittal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20239344\">\n    2017 WL 239344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 &amp; n.6. ArcelorMittal's expert further testified that a UTS of 1,442 MPa would be \"equivalent to something that's a little bit over 1,500 [MPa].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Evidence also indicated that Ford Motor Company sought to order steel sheets from AK Steel that were to be hot-stamped by a commercial hot-stamper for production of automobile parts, but that those orders were never fulfilled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The 2010 action proceeded to trial and, in January 2011, resulted in a jury verdict of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, \"in part based on the lack of evidence of the hot-stamped steel sheet meeting the limitation requiring a [UTS] of 1500 MPa.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. ArcelorMittal appealed, and this court remanded after reversing in part on a separate issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   3. The 2013 Litigation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In April 2013, while the 2010 case was on remand, ArcelorMittal filed the complaint related to this appeal. ArcelorMittal first asserted the RE153 patent and later amended the complaint to substitute the RE940 patent. AK Steel subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the case on the basis of collateral estoppel, arguing that the action was estopped by the verdict in the 2010 action. According to AK Steel, the accused products in this case-steel sheets marketed and sold under the trade name ULTRALUME-are the same as the AXN steel sheets in the 2010 case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In response, ArcelorMittal argued that new evidence, obtained after the 2011 verdict, established that AK Steel's ULTRALUME products were materially different from the AXN products because the ULTRALUME sheets were hot-stamped to achieve a UTS exceeding 1,500 MPa. In particular, ArcelorMittal relied on a declaration by its employee, Marc Millius. The declaration provided that Mr. Millius became aware, as of December 2012, that AK Steel was supplying the market with steel sheets that were hot-stamped by a commercial hot-stamper\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to a UTS exceeding 1,500 MPa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On April 19, 2016, the district court denied AK Steel's motion to dismiss. The court allowed discovery, but limited it to a single deposition of an AK Steel representative and the production of AK Steel's manufacturing specifications for the period of 2010 to 2013. J.A. 538-39. The district court reasoned that limited discovery was necessary to resolve the question of whether\n   the AK Steel products had changed since the 2010 case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The district court cautioned that it was \"reluctant to simply open the doors to discovery without\n   <em>\n    some modicum of proof\n   </em>\n   (more substantive than the [Millius] declaration already submitted) that the accused steel sheet products have changed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After limited discovery concluded, AK Steel moved for summary judgment based on collateral estoppel. J.A. 1-2. In support, AK Steel argued that there was no evidence that its pre-stamped steel sheets or its conduct had changed since 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 8-9; 564-66; 582. AK Steel reasoned that because the accused products were the same products found not to infringe in the 2010 action, collateral estoppel applied, and it was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In opposition, ArcelorMittal argued that the evidence before the district court now showed that AK Steel commercially marketed and supplied steel sheets to various auto producers that were hot-stamped to a UTS exceeding 1,500 MPa. ArcelorMittal pointed to an AK Steel marketing brochure describing how ULTRALUME products underwent hot-stamping that converted the steel's crystalline microstructure into martensite, and that hot-stamped steel sheets are sold as auto parts with a UTS of \"1,400 MPa and higher.\" J.A. 1095-1100. ArcelorMittal also submitted a supplemental declaration from Mr. Millius that provided detail on his observations that AK Steel's sheets were hot-stamped to exceed a UTS of 1,500 MPa (and supplied to a major auto manufacturer\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in December 2012). The supplemental Millius declaration included an exhibit consisting of a slide from a webinar conducted by the auto manufacturer that he personally attended, which includes a bar graph that shows the auto manufacturer's various suppliers of 1,500 MPa UTS steel sheets, including AK Steel and ArcelorMittal. J.A. 1362-66. According to the declaration and as shown on the slide, the bar on the graph representing steel supplied by AK Steel indicated a tensile strength exceeding 1,500 MPa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Based on the evidence, ArcelorMittal requested additional discovery under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d). J.A. 1354-60. ArcelorMittal argued that additional discovery was necessary to present additional facts related to the accused products and business conduct subsequent to the verdict in the 2010 action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The district court denied the requested additional discovery and granted AK Steel's motion for summary judgment of non-infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The district court agreed that ArcelorMittal's infringement claims with respect to the RE940 patent were barred by collateral estoppel.\n   <em>\n    ArcelorMittal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20239344\">\n    2017 WL 239344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4. The district court found that \"the product at issue is the same and cannot-prior to hot stamping-be infringing as the steel sheets have a tensile strength of about 600 MPa.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The district court noted a lack of evidence in the 2010 case that AK Steel's steel sheets were hot-stamped to achieve a UTS exceeding 1,500 MPa. According to the district court, \"[t]hat [AK Steel] may ship the steel sheets to a third party hot stamper on behalf of its purchaser is of no consequence to the infringement analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The district court further noted that neither the chemistry of the steel sheets nor the tensile strength of the sheets as shipped by AK Steel were in dispute.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The district court concluded that these facts foreclosed the possibility of direct infringement.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The district court also\n   concluded that with no direct infringement, there could be no indirect infringement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Limelight Networks, Inc. v.

Collateral Estoppel of Non-infringement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A primary issue in a collateral estoppel analysis with respect to non-infringement is whether the accused product is the same-i.e., the issue sought to be precluded is the same as that involved in the prior action-or whether the accused products have materially changed. The question on appeal, then, is whether changes, if any, in the accused products are \"material\" for the purpose of collateral estoppel application. We conclude that the evidence in this case supports that the products are not materially the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Under Third Circuit law, collateral estoppel applies when \"(1) the issue sought to be precluded [is] the same as that involved in the prior action; (2) that issue [was] actually litigated; (3) it [was] determined by a final and valid judgment; and (4) the determination [was] essential to the prior judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Evidence of Material Differences\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We conclude that AK Steel failed to meet its burden that the ULTRALUME products in the present action are materially the same as the AXN products in the 2010 action, especially when the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant, ArcelorMittal. In the 2010 action, there was no evidence that the AK Steel AXN products met the \"in excess of 1,500 MPa\" UTS limitation or that any AXN products were commercially stamped and supplied to an auto manufacturer at all. In this action, there is evidence that AK Steel is a supplier of such products to at least one major auto manufacturer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The September 2016 supplemental Millius declaration supports the allegation that AK Steel is a supplier of steel sheets that have a UTS exceeding 1,500 MPa to the auto-producing industry. J.A. 1362-66. The declaration was supported by an exhibit of a presentation slide taken from a December 2012 auto manufacturer-hosted webinar that provided tensile test information for hot-stamped steel from several of the auto manufacturer's suppliers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202469\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/639/1303/#p1311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The auto manufacturer's webinar slide, entitled \"Tensile Strength Comparison by Supplier,\" includes a bar graph representing tensile strengths of steel sheets that, according to the declaration, correspond to each supplier, including ArcelorMittal and AK Steel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202469\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/639/1303/#p1311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For both ArcelorMittal and AK\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Steel, the graph indicates a UTS in excess of 1,500 MPa.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202469\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/639/1303/#p1311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the parties dispute the significance of the auto manufacturer's tensile test data, it is significant that the auto manufacturer's own 2012 test data shows that AK Steel's products were thermally treated to achieve a UTS in excess of 1,500 MPa. J.A. 1364 \u00b6 5, 1366. This evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to ArcelorMittal as the non-movant, reflects a material difference in the accused product and AK Steel's conduct since the 2011 verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

AK Steel points to testimony from ArcelorMittal's expert in the 2010 action who heat treated and tested several steel sheets from various suppliers, using what he called a \"conservative heat treatment\" that resulted in a UTS of 1,442 MPa. J.A. 705. But the auto manufacturer's test data shows strengths of steel hot-stamped by a commercial hot-stamper (as named in the first Millius declaration) to meet the auto manufacturer's commercial specifications. AK Steel in attorney argument characterizes the auto manufacturer's test data as \"experimental,\" but there is no evidence supporting such a characterization.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Appellee Br. 46,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1364 \u00b6 4. AK Steel's attorney argument is not sufficient to rebut ArcelorMittal's evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Icon Health &amp; Fitness, Inc. v. Strava, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277839\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/1034/#p1043\">\n    849 F.3d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1043 (Fed. Cir. 2017). In addition, that the auto manufacturer's test data was prior to the RE940 patent's issue date is not material. In the 2010 action, the evidence was that the AXN products were of \"experimental grade,\" i.e., not for sale, and were thermally treated by the Vehma \"prototype shop,\" i.e., non-commercial hot-stamper; there was no evidence that those products were supplied to an auto manufacturer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ArcelorMittal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20239344\">\n    2017 WL 239344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, 1061-63 ;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 1065 (\"The Vehma trial was rudimentary. ... [It] should not, by any means, be used as a mass production trial.\"). The evidence in this case indicates that the production process is no longer \"rudimentary,\" that commercial stampers are utilized, and that the stamped steel is being commercialized. This crucial evidence represents a material difference in the accused products and did not exist during the 2010 action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, AK Steel's own product brochure, made after the verdict in the 2010 action, lends further support to ArcelorMittal's contention that AK Steel's conduct and the accused products have changed. The brochure explains that blanks produced from ULTRALUME are hot-stamped to undergo \"a phase transformation\" to its microstructure that results in \"a high strength phase - martensite.\" J.A. 1089. The brochure advertises that this process \"increases the tensile strength of the steel from approximately 600 MPa to 1,400 MPa\n   <em>\n    and higher\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20239344\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). AK Steel's brochure is evidence in this action that supports an allegation that AK Steel is commercially marketing and supplying steel sheets to auto manufacturers that may exceed 1,500 MPa UTS after hot-stamping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   At minimum, this evidence contravenes the undisputed evidence in the 2010 action that AXN steel sheets hot-stamped by Vehma did not exceed 1,500 MPa UTS, and that none of the stamped AXN sheets were supplied to, or used by, auto manufacturers. In aggregate, this evidence constitutes, as the district court put it, more than a modicum of proof that the accused products materially differ from those in the 2010 action with respect to claimed limitations. Differences with respect to the claimed limitations constitute changes in controlling facts, such that collateral estoppel\n   does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scooper Dooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"192999\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/494/840/#p846\">\n    494 F.2d at 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For this reason, the district court erred in finding that the accused products cannot as a matter of law infringe and granting summary judgment of non-infringement on the basis of collateral estoppel. We express no opinion on whether the RE940 patent is actually infringed or who might infringe it, only that there is now evidence that the accused products, the stamped steel sheets originating from AK Steel and supplied to auto manufacturers, are materially different from the products in the 2010 action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   3. The Relevance of Hot-Stamping\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The parties dispute the extent to which there may be differences in the chemical composition between the AXN and ULTRALUME products and the effect of those differences, but those are not the only facts relevant to the claim limitations at issue. Consistent with the claim language of the patent, the mechanical resistance of the accused products after the claimed thermal treatment, i.e., hot-stamping, which transforms the crystalline microstructure of the steel (as opposed to its chemical composition), is also relevant to the claim limitations at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The district court erred when it focused solely on the pre-stamped product and stated \"[t]hat [AK Steel] may ship the steel sheets to a third party hot stamper on behalf of its purchaser is of no consequence to the infringement analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    ArcelorMittal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20239344\">\n    2017 WL 239344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. The asserted product-by-process claims are not directed to unstamped blanks that have not yet been subject to the claimed thermal treatment process step.

Yet in concluding that the product now at issue cannot infringe, the district court instead focused on the accused product prior to hot-stamping, having the same composition as the 2010 products and a tensile strength of about 600 MPa. By simply focusing on the composition and mechanical resistance of the pre-processed, blank steel sheets, and by ignoring the claimed thermal treatment process step conducted by hot-stampers and the resulting UTS, the district court erred in determining whether a material claimed element in the patent as defined by the inventor had changed in the accused products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ArcelorMittal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20239344\">\n    2017 WL 239344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4.
