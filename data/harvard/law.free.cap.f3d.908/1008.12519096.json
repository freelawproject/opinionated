Thus, we\n   <strong>\n    VACATE\n   </strong>\n   the judgment of the district court with instructions to\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   to Michigan state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Robert Cornell, Jr. (\"Robert\") died on July 29, 2015, owing an outstanding mortgage amount of $113,358.12 on his home at 8615 Wisconsin Street in Detroit, Michigan. At the time of Robert's death, the monthly mortgage payments on the Wisconsin Street home were up to date. Yet in the five months following his death, the mortgage went unpaid. Defendant Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC (\"Bayview\"), the mortgage holder, sent a delinquency notice to the home on December 16, 2015, showing an unpaid balance of $5,813.95. On November 3, 2016, Bayview foreclosed on the mortgage and purchased the home by sheriff's deed at public auction. Bayview later sold the home to Defendant Thien Hoang Tran (\"Tran\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 25, 2017, Plaintiffs-Appellants Estate of Robert L. Cornell, Jr. (\"Estate\"), by and through Personal Representative Audrey D. Bantom and Anthony Cornell (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") filed a complaint in Michigan state court alleging four causes of action against Bayview, including most notably a lack of standing to foreclose under the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701j-3 (\"Garn-St. Germain Act\" or \"Act\") and MICH . COMP . LAWS \u00a7 445.1626.

Plaintiffs did not object to removal or seek remand. Instead, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting an additional claim of quiet title against Tran (Count V). Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings in part on the argument that the Garn-St. Germain Act does not authorize a private right of action. The district court agreed, ruling that the Garn-St. Germain Act does not authorize a private right of action, the\n   Garn-St. Germain Act did not apply to Plaintiffs' claims, or both. The district court granted Defendants' motion on all counts and entered a judgment in their favor. The district court denied Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, and Plaintiffs filed this timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Before Congress passed the Garn-St. Germain Act, many states had laws restricting the enforcement of due-on-sale clauses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Dupuis v.

The Garn-St. Germain Act prohibits states from banning due-on-sale clauses, providing in principal part that \"[n]otwithstanding any provision of the constitution or laws (including judicial decisions) of any State to the contrary, a lender may, subject to subsection (c) of this section, enter into or enforce a contract containing a due-on-sale clause with respect to a real property loan.\" 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701j-3(b)(1). That means a due-on-sale clause is presumptively valid unless it qualifies as one of nine exceptions listed in \u00a7 1701j-3(d) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   With respect to a real property loan secured by a lien on residential real property containing less than five dwelling units, including a lien on the stock allocated to a dwelling unit in a cooperative housing corporation, or on a residential manufactured home, a lender may not exercise its option pursuant to a due-on-sale clause upon-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) the creation of a lien or other encumbrance subordinate to the lender's security instrument which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (2) the creation of a purchase money security interest for household appliances;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (3) a transfer by devise, descent, or operation of law on the death of a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (4) the granting of a leasehold interest of three years or less not containing an option to purchase;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (5) a transfer to a relative resulting from the death of a borrower;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (6) a transfer where the spouse or children of the borrower become an owner of the property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (7) a transfer resulting from a decree of a dissolution of marriage, legal separation agreement, or from an incidental property settlement agreement, by which the spouse of the borrower becomes an owner of the property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (8) a transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower is and remains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (9) any other transfer or disposition described in regulations prescribed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In other words, after the Garn-St. Germain Act, states can only regulate nine types of due-on-sale clauses. In response to the Garn-St. Germain Act, Michigan created its own cause of action for lendees harmed by one of those nine banned due-on-sale clauses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MICH . COMP . LAWS \u00a7 445.1626 (\"A lender shall not enforce a due-on-sale clause in a residential real property loan in any circumstances under which enforcement is prohibited under section 341(d) of the Garn-St. Germain depository institutions act of 1982, 12 U.S.C. 1701j-3, as currently in force.\"); MICH .

Under the Act, a due-on-sale clause is presumptively valid, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701j-3(b)(1)-(2), unless one of nine exceptions apply,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20445.1628\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1701j-3(d). A due-on-sale clause is defined as, \"a contract provision which authorizes a lender, at its option, to declare due and payable sums secured by the lender's security instrument if all or any part of the property, or an interest therein, securing the real property loan is sold or transferred without the lender's prior written consent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20445.1628\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1701j-3(a)(1).

State due-on-sale clause restrictions \"adversely affect[ed] secondary mortgage markets, which rely on uniform, homogenous mortgage documents to efficiently operate,\" and these \"restrictions ... caused the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Corporation to alter their investment practices in several states.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20445.1626\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20445.1626\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, these state restrictions were adversely affecting entities sponsored by the federal government, and consequently, Congress intervened to protect the federal interests at play.

The Act, in addition to preempting state laws contrary to its provisions, \u00a7 1701j-3(b)(1), prescribes the situations in which due-on-sale clauses must be enforced, \u00a7 1701j-3(b)(2), details specific situations in which such clauses cannot be enforced, \u00a7 1701j-3(d), and authorizes the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to issue rules and regulations\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   pursuant to the Act, \u00a7 1701j-3(e).

Senate Rep. at 20-21. When Congress passed the Garn-St. Germain Act and preempted any state law contrary to the Act's provisions, Congress also created federal rights.

Notably, in\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   , the federal government also lacked a direct interest in the property at issue in the case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209152\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/308/#p312\">\n    545 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   317 n.4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209152\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/308/#p312\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But in the present matter, we can look to a more objective factor: the statute itself. At risk of belaboring the point, clearly Congress thought this issue was important enough to preempt state laws, including judicial decisions, in areas traditionally reserved to the states. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701j-3(b)(1). The upshot is that this case does not involve \"a typical state-law property issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC v.

The issue is the applicability of exemptions in a federal statute. In\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   , we further noted that \"there is no allegation that [state courts] are not enforcing the property rights of natural gas companies or are otherwise impeding the [federal interest in] safe transmission of natural gas in a way that would call for a federal forum.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3536327\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/583/#p590\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Congress found the opposite to be true in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Senate Rep. at 20-21. Not only that, but Congress also gave the power to promulgate rules and to publish interpretations of the Act to a federal agency. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701j-3(e). Considering the context in which Congress enacted the Garn-St. Germain Act, as well as the Act's plain text, the majority cannot say with a straight face that hearing this claim in federal court would \"disrupt the deference Congress gave to state courts to regulate in their traditional areas of expertise.\" Majority Op. at 1015. The inescapable fact is that Congress took away such deference from the states and replaced state law with a federal statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As stated, however, preemption alone should not be dispositive. In\n   <em>\n    Mikulski\n   </em>\n   , we also noted that \"the IRS has never issued a rule\" or \"ever litigated an action\" involving the provision of law at issue.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707500\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/555/#p568\">\n    501 F.3d at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If we concluded that the Plaintiffs' federal question claim fails on the merits, that could, in fact, dispose of the entire case because the federal court need not hear the other state claims.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). More importantly, the answer to the federal question will completely resolve the relevant state claim because that claim turns exclusively on federal law. Accordingly, this third factor weighs in favor of substantiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As to the fourth factor, we have to reconcile the \"numerous other cases\" language with the concern, once again, that we could throw open the courthouse doors to too many state claims. Admittedly,\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   seems to suggest that \"cases\" refers to the amount of litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p260\">\n    568 U.S. at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p260\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If the question arises frequently, it will soon be resolved within the federal system, laying to rest any contrary state court precedent; if it does not arise frequently, it is unlikely to implicate substantial federal interests.\").

In discussing the federal-state balance issue,\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   thought the fact that \"it will be the rare state title case that raises a contested matter of federal law\" counseled in favor of welcoming the state-law claim into federal court.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209152\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/308/#p312\">\n    545 U.S. at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209152\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/308/#p312\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Assuming for the sake of argument that we should focus on the amount of litigation, this factor leans against substantiality. The Garn-St. Germain Act does not appear to be frequently litigated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   But this factor is not dispositive and there are good reasons to give it less weight in the instant case. For one, hostile state-court precedent caused federal entities to alter their investment strategies in several states, which then motivated Congress to pass the Garn-St. Germain Act in the first place. Senate Rep. at 21. Additionally, even if this issue is not frequently\n   <em>\n    litigated\n   </em>\n   , due-on-sale clauses are common in mortgage contracts, and government-sponsored entities, lenders, and home buyers and sellers may find it beneficial to know how far the Act's due-on-sale enforcement exemptions reach.

Pfander, Principles of Federal Jurisdiction 101 (West 2006) (\"Judged solely by the degree to which it brought clarity to jurisdictional law, one might consider the\n   <em>\n    Merrell Dow\n   </em>\n   decision a failure.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hart &amp; Wechsler at 824-25; Chemerinsky at 306-07.

Hart &amp; Wechsler at 824-25; Chemerinsky at 306-07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Meanwhile, the majority resurrects the very confusion\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   sought to correct. One reading the majority opinion might understandably think that the cause of action analysis is determinative to the jurisdictional issue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Majority Op. at 1016-17 (relying on the absence of a cause of action to say that hearing this claim in federal court would \"disturb the balance of state and federal responsibilities.\"). If the majority's analysis on this prong is taken too seriously and applied to its fullest extent, that would effectively undercut over a century of Supreme Court precedent that recognizes federal question jurisdiction even in the absence of a federal cause of action. But at the very least, the majority goes against\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   's reading of\n   <em>\n    Merrell Dow\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Finally, even if all fifty states adopted a law like Michigan's, the exercise of jurisdiction over such laws would not amount to a\n   <em>\n    federal court\n   </em>\n   disturbing the federal-state balance. Again,\n   <em>\n    Congress\n   </em>\n   wanted the Garn-St. Germain Act to displace any \"laws (including the judicial decisions) of any State to the contrary.\" 12 US.C. \u00a7 1701j-3(b)(1). If there is a disturbance in the federal-state balance, it is not the disturbance the majority is looking for. Majority Op. at 1016-17. That a federal court would throw the Act's interpretation into the hands of the states,\n   <em>\n    and only the states\n   </em>\n   , seems to undermine Congress's expressed intent in the text of the Act. To be sure, state courts are presumptively competent to adjudicate issues of federal law,\n   <em>\n    Tafflin v. Levitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11332379\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/455/#p458\">\n    493 U.S. 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 458-59,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11332379\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/455/#p458\">\n    110 S.Ct. 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11332379\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/455/#p458\">\n    107 L.Ed.2d 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), including this one. But that fact settles nothing about whether the federal courts have jurisdiction. The majority, however, seems to believe that the\n   <em>\n    Tafflin v. Levitt\n   </em>\n   presumption weighs against finding federal question jurisdiction. Majority Op. at 1016-17 n.8, 1015-16. If so, the majority is wrong. Ultimately, this final prong of the\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   standard focuses on congressional intent. In this case, the federal courts exercising jurisdiction is, if anything, consistent with Congress's intent to ensure that state courts do not restrict the enforcement of due-on-sale clauses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701j-3(b)(1) ; Senate Rep. at 20-21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   OCC Interpretive Letter,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   footnote 1, at *1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Subject matter jurisdiction is so fundamental that a court can (indeed a court must) rule on the matter sua sponte, without any motions by a party. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). We are the first circuit court of appeals to address this issue as it relates to the Garn-St. Germain Act.
