He now appeals that order, arguing that, because the corporations and limited liability companies (\"LLCs\") are small, closely held entities for which he is either the sole\n   shareholder or sole employee, or is solely responsible for accounting and record keeping, he may invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to resist producing those collective entities' documents. We join all of our sister circuits to have considered the issue in holding that the Fifth Amendment provides no protection to a collective entity's records custodians-and that the size of the collective entity and the extent to which a jury would assume that the individual seeking to assert the privilege produced the documents are not relevant. We therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant is the subject of an ongoing grand jury investigation of various crimes, including obstruction of justice, tax evasion, and bankruptcy fraud. The grand jury issued twelve subpoenas to the custodian of records of various entities in which Appellant holds an interest. Appellant, who is the custodian of records for each of the entities, objected to the subpoenas and refused to produce the requested documents. Appellant argued that because, for the years in question, he was either the sole shareholder, officer, or member of the various entities, and because he was the individual responsible for accounting and document preparation for those entities, the compelled production of the documents would incriminate him personally. He therefore contended that his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination protected him from complying with the subpoenas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Government moved to compel compliance, and the district court thereafter granted the Government's motion, ordering Appellant to comply with all twelve grand jury subpoenas. Appellant again refused, and the district court held Appellant in contempt pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201826\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the legal question whether any exception exists to the general rule that a corporate records custodian may not assert a Fifth Amendment privilege to refuse production of corporate documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Second, he argues that we should answer the question left open in the\n   <em>\n    Braswell\n   </em>\n   footnote by holding that a custodian who can establish that a jury inevitably would conclude it was he or she who produced the records may be excepted from the rule that the Fifth Amendment does not shield records custodians from being compelled to produce a collective entity's records. We reject both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   First, as to Appellant's argument that we should treat\n   <em>\n    Braswell\n   </em>\n   as having\n   been overruled by\n   <em>\n    Hobby Lobby\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   , we are skeptical that either case has any bearing on the collective entity rule as articulated and applied in\n   <em>\n    Braswell\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, regardless, we remain bound by\n   <em>\n    Braswell\n   </em>\n   until the Supreme Court says otherwise. Where Supreme Court precedent \"has direct application in a case,\" the Supreme Court has instructed \"the Court of Appeals [to] follow the case which directly controls,\" even if it \"appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions,\" and thereby to \"leav[e] to th[e] Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Agostini v.

Specifically, Appellant argues that he is akin to a sole proprietor and that he could establish that a \"jury would inevitably conclude that [Appellant] produced the records,\"\n   <em>\n    Braswell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774966\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/99/#p104\">\n    487 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   118 n.11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774966\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/99/#p104\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Appellant claims, he fits into the exception whose potential existence was left open by the\n   <em>\n    Braswell\n   </em>\n   footnote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reaching this question for the first time in this circuit, we conclude that no exception exists to the rule that records custodians lack any Fifth Amendment privilege against the compelled production of a collective entity's documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, to recognize an exception for custodians of small, closely held collective entities, including one-person corporations or LLCs, would be inconsistent with the reasoning and holding of\n   <em>\n    Braswell\n   </em>\n   . The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Braswell\n   </em>\n   reiterated the longstanding principle that \"no privilege can be claimed by the custodian of corporate records,\n   <em>\n    regardless of how small the corporation may be\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774966\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/99/#p104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774966\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/99/#p104\">\n    at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774966\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/99/#p104\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bellis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1519989\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/85/#p90\">\n    417 U.S. at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1519989\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/85/#p90\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Notably,\n   <em>\n    Braswell\n   </em>\n   itself involved two corporations entirely owned or held (either directly or indirectly) by Petitioner Braswell, with corporate boards consisting only of Braswell, his wife, and his mother. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court held that Braswell could not assert a Fifth Amendment privilege to resist producing corporate records on the ground that it would incriminate him personally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Braswell\n   </em>\n   considered the possibility that a corporate custodian's production of records could be testimonial in nature. But the Court concluded that this fact did not make the production anything other than an act of the corporation, and that \"[a]ny claim of Fifth Amendment privilege asserted by the agent would be tantamount to a claim of privilege by the corporation-which of course possesses no such privilege.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1519989\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/85/#p90\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1519989\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/85/#p90\">\n    at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774966\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/99/#p104\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the\n   Court explained, \"a custodian's assumption of his representative capacity [on behalf of a corporation] leads to certain obligations, including the duty to produce corporate records on proper demand by the Government.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774966\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/99/#p104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court thus treated the possible testimonial consequences of fulfilling this obligation as beside the point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Further, in light of this reasoning in the body of the\n   <em>\n    Braswell\n   </em>\n   opinion, we are unable to identify any situation in which the\n   <em>\n    Braswell\n   </em>\n   footnote would have any practical import. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Braswell\n   </em>\n   contemplated-and endorsed-the notion that although the Government could \"make no evidentiary use of the 'individual act' against the individual\" custodian, it could \"use the\n   <em>\n    corporation's\n   </em>\n   act of production against the custodian.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774966\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/99/#p104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774966\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/99/#p104\">\n    at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774966\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/99/#p104\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, \"if the defendant held a prominent position within the corporation that produced the records, the jury may ... reasonably infer that [the defendant] had possession of the documents or knowledge of their contents.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774966\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/99/#p104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court explained that \"[b]ecause the jury is not told that the defendant produced the records, any nexus between the defendant and the documents results solely from the corporation's act of production and other evidence in the case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774966\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/99/#p104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In any situation where a jury would inevitably conclude that a defendant produced the records in question, the relevant nexus between the defendant and the documents would still result, first and foremost, from the defendant's role in the corporation. Given the obvious-and wholly permissible-inference that the defendant in such a case must have had possession of the documents or knowledge of their contents, the fact that a jury may also conclude that Appellant produced the documents would be irrelevant to the jury's assessment of guilt or innocence as to the charges in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, recognizing an exception for small corporations or LLCs\n   <em>\n    operating like\n   </em>\n   sole proprietorships but formally organized as collective entities under state law would give defendants like Appellant a windfall. Appellant argues that it makes little sense to apply the collective entity doctrine to small or family-owned corporations or LLCs that operate like sole proprietorships. But by choosing to operate his businesses as a corporation or LLC and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   as a sole proprietorship, Appellant knowingly sought out the benefits of these forms. Having done so, he cannot now be shielded from its costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
