Williams also contends he should be allowed to proceed against Officers Aswood and Nix for failing to protect him from other inmates when, knowing that Williams had reported a theft, the Officers returned Williams to the pod without first ensuring that the other inmates\u2019 cells were locked, resulting in four inmates attacking Williams. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-21\">As to Williams\u2019 excessive force claim, generally, parties are not allowed to plead fictitious parties in federal court. <em>See Richardson v. Johnson, 598 </em>F.3d 734, 738 (11th Cir.2010). A fictitious name like \u201cJ.E.S. team,\u201d when the real defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>cannot be readily identified for service,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is insufficient to sustain a cause of action. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, as Williams\u2019 excessive force complaint does not name an actionable party, the district court did not err in dismissing it for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">As to Williams\u2019 failure to protect claim, while \u201cprison officials have a duty ... to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners,\u201d not every instance of inmate on inmate violence \u201ctranslates into constitutional liability for prison officials responsible for the victim\u2019s safety.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 833-34, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (ellipsis in original). It is a \u201cprison official\u2019s deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to an inmate [that] violates the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 828, 114 S.Ct. 1970. In order to constitute \u201cdeliberate indifference,\u201d the prison official must have subjective knowledge of the risk of serious harm, and must nevertheless fail to reasonably respond to the risk. <em>Id. </em>at 837, 844-45, 114 S.Ct. 1970. A prison official must have a \u201csufficiently culpable state of mind\u201d to be deliberately indifferent. <em>Carter v. Galloway, </em>352 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted) (quotation omitted). \u201cMerely negligent failure to protect an inmate from attack does not justify liability under section 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1350 (citation omitted) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">The district court did not err when it dismissed Williams\u2019 failure to protect complaint for failure to state a claim, because there is nothing in Williams\u2019 complaint to suggest that Officers Aswood and Nix were actually aware that failing to lock the other inmates in their cells would result in injury to Williams. Therefore, the Officers were not deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk to Williams\u2019 safety. <em>See Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 837, 844-45, 114 S.Ct. 1970. Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b998-22\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) using the same standards that govern dismissals under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Leal v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001). The complaint is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff\u2019s well-pleaded facts are accepted as true. <em>Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 1043, 1057 (11th Cir.2007). To avoid dismissal, the complaint must state a claim for relief that is facially plausible. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b999-19\">. We note, as did the district court, that we recognize that Williams states he was unable to identify the J.E.S. team members \"because they don\u2019t w[ear] name, tags.\u2019\u2019 As Williams further states, however, other jail officials to whom he spoke, including \"Ms. Green Internal Affairs\u201d helped him identify Lieutenant Akies, and there were other methods available to him to obtain the names of the J.E.S. Team members during the almost two-year period he waited before filing his complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b999-21\">. In his brief, Williams also requests a court-appointed attorney. We can appoint a civil litigant an attorney, but the privilege of one is usually justified only by exceptional circumstances in the case. <em>See Bass v. Perrin, </em>170 F.3d 1312, 1320 (11th Cir.1999). As we have already denied Williams\u2019 request for a court-appointed attorney on appeal, and Williams provides no reason for us to reconsider our decision, we once more deny his request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
