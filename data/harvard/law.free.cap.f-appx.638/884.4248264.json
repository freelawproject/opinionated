Ater careful review of the record and briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AD5\">A. Mlegations in the Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b907-21\">On August 25, 2014, Plaintiff Kelly filed a <em>pro se </em>amended complaint (the \u201ccomplaint\u201d) against the Aabama Department of Revenue (\u201cADR\u201d), two ADR employees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>David Baxley and Eddie Crumbley, in their individual and official capacities, and other \u201cUnknown Agents\u201d of ADR, also in their individual and official capacities (collectively the \u201cdefendants\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kelly\u2019s complaint alleged seven federal claims and three state claims arising from the ADR\u2019s assessment and collection of Kelly\u2019s 2010 and 2011 Alabama state income tax liability</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Specifically, according to the complaint, Plaintiff Kelly attended college in Alabama, but has lived and worked in Tennessee since 2007. On July 2, 2014, Kelly\u2019s mother received an ADR letter at her Alabama home and that ADR letter stated that Kelly owed $1,707 in Alabama state income taxes for the years 2010 and 2011. However, Kelly\u2019s amended complaint alleges that: (1) she lived and worked in Tennessee during those taxable years; (2) she owed no income tax to the state of Alabama; and (3) it was \u201cnot possible for the [ADR] to have any tax records to review\u201d unless they sought such information from the Internal Revenue Service \u201cthough illegalities.\u201d Despite having access to IRS tax records indicating Kelly was not an Alabama resident, ADR agents \u201cdecided to pursue a purely' illegal collection action against\u201d Kelly by sending \u201cthe first and only collection letter\u201d to the address of Kelly\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">On July 10, 2014, Kelly called the ADR to discuss the letter sent to her mother\u2019s home. An ADR agent instructed Kelly to provide documentary proof of her Tennessee residency. The next day, Kelly submitted to the ADR her vehicle registration, her Nashville Electric Service seven-year billing history, a current water bill, and a lease from a former apartment. The ADR, however, \u201c[b]latantly ignor[ed] [Kelly\u2019s] evidentiary submissions\u201d and placed a tax lien on Kelly\u2019s credit report, causing her credit score to drop and \u201ceffectively seizing her property.\u201d Other than the letter sent to her mother\u2019s house, Kelly received no notice from the ADR that it would place a tax lien on her credit report.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">Kelly repeatedly called the ADR to ask why it imposed a tax lien, but, at least initially, no ADR agent could answer her questions. Eventually, Defendant David Baxley, an ADR agent, called Kelly and informed her that the ADR had initiated a collections action against her 'because she still had an Alabama driver\u2019s license. Defendant Baxley also told Kelly that the ADR sent her a notice before imposing the tax lien, though the notice was mailed to one of her prior Tennessee addresses. Kelly later contacted Defendant Eddie Crumbley, the Director of Operations for the ADR\u2019s Criminal Division, who stated that he \u201ccould not assist in any way regarding the matter\u201d and refused to investigate the situation further. The ADR agents\u2019 actions were related to a separate law suit filed by Kelly\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Samuel Robinson, in the Middle District of Tennessee against Tennessee officials. These Tennessee officials \u25a0 directed ADR\u2019s attention to Kelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">B. Federal and State Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">Construed liberally, Kelly\u2019s complaint alleged federal statutory violations, federal constitutional violations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a civil rights conspiracy claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985, and various state law claims. As to all defendants, Kelly\u2019s complaint contained three counts\u2014due process, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Specifically, Kelly alleged that the defendants violat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>ed her procedural and substantive due process rights (Count I). As to procedural due process, the defendants determined Kelly\u2019s state residency and state income tax liability \u201cwithout affording [her] minimal due process.\u201d As to substantive due process, the ADR initiated \u201ca government action\u201d against Kelly \u201cwithout legal authority or personal jurisdiction,\u201d and Defendants Baxley and Crumbley failed to protect her rights despite their \u201caffirmative duty under the law to uphold the Constitution.\u201d As for her state law claims, Kelly alleged that all the defendants \u201cwillfully and intentionally committed fraud\u201d by making false representations regarding her tax liability and the legality of their actions, and that Defendants Baxley and Crumbly specifically made false representations regarding their ability to assist her (Count IX). Kelly alleged that the defendants willfully and intentionally inflicted emotion distress by \u201cperpetuating an illegal threat against [her] financial ability to pay\u201d her living expenses (Count X).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">In addition, Kelly alleged seven counts against only the ADR and the \u201cUnknown Agents.\u201d In particular, Kelly alleged that the ADR and the unknown agents: (1) violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause by imposing Alabama law on her in a manner dissimilar to other Tennessee residents (Count II); (2) violated the Fourth Amendment by imposing a tax lien, which prevented her from transferring property, refinancing her home, or using credit to make purchases (Count III); (3) violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2, by imposing a tax lien for which they knew there was no legal basis, fraudulently reporting the lien to credit reporting agencies, and making a fraudulent representation as to her tax liability (Count IV); (4) violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692e and 1692f, by using false information and threatening to take legal action they could not legally pursue in an attempt to collect an invalid debt (Count V); (5) conspired to violate her civil rights under color of state law, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242 (Counts VI and VII); and (6) invaded her privacy in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Alabama tort law (Count VIII).-</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">Kelly sought a preliminary injunction enjoining the ADR from instituting further collection proceedings, a declaratory judgment that the defendants had committed criminal fraud and violated several of Kelly\u2019s constitutional rights, and awards of $200,000 in compensatory damages and $750,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">C. Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">On October 1, 2014, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. The defendants argued, among other things, that the Tax Injunction Act (\u201cTIA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, and principles of comity barred the district court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction because the relief Kelly requested would \u201cenjoin, suspend, or restrain\u201d the state\u2019s ability to assess taxes and Kelly had an adequate state remedy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">A magistrate judge issued an order stating that, after reviewing Kelly\u2019s complaint, he \u201charbor[ed] grave doubts about\u201d subject matter jurisdiction. To determine whether the TIA barred the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>jurisdiction, the magistrate judge directed the defendants to submit for <em>in camera </em>review the ADR\u2019s \u201cfile concerning its efforts to collect taxes\u201d from Kelly, including any correspondence with Kelly, preliminary and final assessments, documentation as to any levy or lien, and documentation as to any administrative or judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">After an <em>in camera </em>review, the magistrate judge directed that some of the materials be placed in the record under seal and provided to Kelly so she could respond. These documents included: (1) an August 28, 2018 notice indicating no record of Kelly\u2019s 2010 tax return and a balance due of $1,810.18; (2) an October 29, 2013 notice of preliminary assessment; (3) a January 6, 2014 final notice of assessment; (4) a March 18, 2014 notice of intent to offset federal income tax refund; <em>(5) </em>a July 1, 2014 certificate of lien for taxes and taxpayer notice of lien; (6) a July 8, 2014 final notice before seizure; and (7) a June 30, 2014 notice indicating no record of Kelly\u2019s 2011 tax return and a balance due of $1,707.68. All of the notices were addressed to Kelly at a Goodlettsville, Tennessee address, except the last notice on June 30, 2014, which was addressed to Kelly at her mother\u2019s home in Tuscumbia, Alabama. Each notice advised Kelly what to do under Alabama law if she disagreed with the notice and/or wanted to appeal the determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Kelly responded that she had resided at the Goodlettsville, Tennessee address from 2007 to 2011, but not when the notices were purportedly sent. Kelly pointed out that the defendants had not submitted evidence that she received any of the notices prior to July 8, 2014, and asserted without elaboration that the notices were fraudulent. Kelly also questioned how the ADR had determined that she was subject to income tax in Alabama and calculated her tax liability. Kelly contended that the defendants\u2019 documents showed that she had no adequate state remedy \u201csince all remedies [had] expired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">D. Dismissal of Kelly\u2019s Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (\u201cR <em>&amp; </em>R\u201d) recommending that the district court dismiss Kelly\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the TIA. The R <em>&amp; </em>R concluded that Kelly\u2019s requested relief \u201cwould unquestionably \u2018enjoin, suspend, or restrain\u2019 the State\u2019s ability to assess its taxes.\u201d The R <em>&amp; </em>R further concluded that Kelly had not alleged nor shown: (1) that Alabama\u2019s procedures for appealing a final tax assessment or seeking a refund of taxes paid pursuant to an assessment were not a \u201cplain, speedy, and efficient remedy\u201d for contesting taxes; (2) that the ADR failed to comply with Alabama\u2019s procedures in assessing Kelly\u2019s tax liability and undertaking collection measures; or (3) that Kelly had followed Alabama\u2019s procedures in contesting her tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">Over Kelly\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the R <em>&amp; </em>R and dismissed her complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">A. TIA and Comity</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">Under the TIA, district courts are prohibited from \u201cenjoin[ing], suspending] or restraining] the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. Rather than confer jurisdiction, the TIA \u201climits jurisdiction which might otherwise exist,\u201d and \u201cwas intended to prevent taxpayers from using federal courts to raise questions of state or federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>law relating to the validity of particular taxes.\u201d <em>Osceola v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>893 F.2d 1231, 1232-33 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">The TIA bars the exercise of federal jurisdiction if these two requirements are met: (1) the relief requested by the plaintiff would enjoin, suspend, or restrain a state tax assessment, and (2) the state affords the plaintiff a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy. <em>Williams v. City of Dothan, Ala., </em>745 F.2d 1406, 1411 (11th Cir.1984). The burden is on the plaintiff to show facts sufficient to overcome the TIA\u2019s jurisdictional bar. <em>Amos v. Glynn Cty. Bd. of Tax Assessors, </em>347 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir.2003), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). In light of the TIA\u2019s overarching purpose to impede federal court interference with state tax systems, the Act has been construed broadly. <em>A Bonding Co. v. Sunnuck, </em>629 F.2d 1127, 1133 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">B. Type of Relief Requested</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Kelly\u2019s request for injunctive relief preventing Alabama from assessing taxes against her plainly constitutes relief that would enjoin, suspend, or restrain a tax assessment and thus meets the first requirement of the TIA bar. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341; <em>Osceola, </em>893 F.2d at 1233. The TIA also prohibits declaratory relief. <em>California v. Grace Brethren Church, </em>457 U.S. 393, 411, 102 S.Ct. 2498, 2509, 73 L.Ed.2d 93 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Under our binding precedent, the TIA also bars claims for damages because a monetary award against the state or its tax administrators, would have the same detrimental effect on the state as equitable relief, and would dampen state tax collectors. <em>See A Bonding Co., </em>629 F.2d at 1132-33 (concluding the TIA deprives district courts of jurisdiction over claims for money damages based on the unconstitutionality of the city tax and the tortious nature of enforcement). In <em>A Bonding Co., </em>the former Fifth Circuit noted that \u201c[a] federal court suit for damages against a state tax administrator ... would have many of the same detrimental effects that actions for tax refund, declaratory, or in-junctive relief would have. Although the federal court\u2019s decision in such a ease technically would bind only the immediate parties, as a practical matter it would undoubtedly dampen future state collection efforts.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">While the Supreme Court has declined to address whether the TIA alone acts as a jurisdictional bar to all requests for damages, it has concluded that comity, also referred to as the doctrine of equitable restraint, bars federal-court jurisdiction over a 42 U.S.C. ,\u00a7 1983 action for damages arising from a state tax system. <em>See Fair Assessment in Real Estate Ass\u2019n v. McNary, </em>454 U.S. 100, 107, 102 S.Ct. 177, 181, 70 L.Ed.2d 271 (1981) (\u201cBecause we decide today that the principle of comity bars federal courts from granting damages relief in such cases, we do not decide whether [the TIA], standing alone, would require such a result.\u201d). The Supreme Court explained that a damages award under \u00a7 1983 against individual state tax officials would first require a federal-court declaration that those officials, in administering a state tax, violated the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 113-14, 102 S.Ct. at 184-85. A damages award also would have the practical effect of halting the operation of the state\u2019s tax scheme because \u201csuch officials, faced with the prospect of personal liability to numerous taxpayers, not to mention the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, would promptly cease the conduct found to have infringed the petitioners\u2019 constitutional rights, whether' or not those officials were acting in good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115, 102 S.Ct. at 185. Thus, taxpayers seeking to challenge the validity of a state tax system under federal law must pursue state remedies to do so, provided that the state remedies are \u201cplain, adequate, and complete.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116, 102 S.Ct. at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">This Court has explicitly relied on both the TIA and comity to conclude that a district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in a state-tax dispute requesting damages and declaratory relief. <em>See Noble v. Joint City-Cty. Bd. of Tax Assessors of Fulton Cty., </em>672 F.2d 872, 873-75 (11th Cir.1982). And in \u00a7 1983 actions for damages for alleged constitutional violations, this Court either based its decision solely on principles of comity or determined that the suit was \u201cin essence an action for the refund of taxes.\u201d <em>See e.g., Ayers v. Polk Cty., Ga., </em>697 F.2d 1375, 1376-77 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Moss v. Georgia, </em>655 F.2d 668, 669 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">C. Alabama\u2019s Remedies for Taxpayers</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Before the TIA bar applies, however, the state must meet \u201ccertain minimal <em>procedural </em>criteria\u201d in providing a \u201cplain, speedy, and efficient\u201d remedy. <em>See Grace Brethren Church, </em>457 U.S. at 411, 102 S.Ct. at 2509 (quotation marks omitted). In particular, the remedy must provide the taxpayer with a \u201cfull hearing and judicial determination at which she may raise any and all constitutional objections to the tax.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). The state remedy, however, need not \u201cbe the best remedy available or even equal to or better than the remedy which might be available in the federal courts.\u201d <em>Bland v. McHann, </em>463 F.2d 21, 29 (5th Cir.1972).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">At the time of Kelly\u2019s Alabama tax assessment, state law provided that a taxpayer had the right to appeal a final assessment to either the Administrative Law Division or to the state\u2019s circuit courts within 30 days of the final assessment date. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 40-2A-7(b)(5) (2013).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because Alabama law allows taxpayers a right to appeal an assessment to the circuit courts within 30 days of the assessment, it provides a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy within the meaning of the TIA. <em>Lasker Boiler &amp; Eng\u2019g Corp. v. Hamm, </em>328 F.2d 429, 429-30 (5th Cir.1964). In <em>Lasker, </em>Alabama\u2019s appeals process was deemed sufficient even though the plaintiffs attempt to appeal a tax assessment under state law was dismissed as untimely because the taxpayer appealed on the 31st day. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">In addition, under Alabama law, taxpayers may petition for a refund of taxes paid to the state and may appeal the denial of such petitions and raise federal constitutional challenges to state taxes in the state courts. <em>See, e.g., AT&amp;T Corp. v. Surtees, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>953 So.2d 1240, 1243-46 (Ala.Civ.App.2006) (overturning the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs constitutional claims against an Alabama state tax assessment); <em>see also </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 40-2A-7(b)(4)-(5). A state scheme requiring a taxpayer to pay the contested tax and then seek a refund through state administrative and judicial procedures was deemed sufficient by the Supreme Court. <em>See Rosewell v. LaSalle Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>450 U.S. 503, 522-28, 101 S.Ct. 1221, 1233-37, 67 L.Ed.2d 464 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">As the district court noted, a taxpayer also may file a declaratory judgment action in state court pursuant to the Alabama Declaratory Judgment Act and the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 6-6-220-232, 41-22-10; <em>Rabren v. Mudd, </em>234 So.2d 549, 285 Ala. 531 (Ala.1970) (involving taxpayer\u2019s declaratory judgment action against the ADR and two agents asserting that the plaintiff was not domiciled in Alabama and thus not required to file an Aabama income tax return); <em>Gibbs v. Cochran, </em>198 So.2d 607, 608, 281 Ala. 22, 25 (Ala.1967) (stating that \u201ccontroversies touching the legality of acts of public officials or public agencies\u201d are properly brought in declaratory judgment actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">D. Dismissal of Kelly\u2019s Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Here, the district court did not err in dismissing Kelly\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It was Kelly\u2019s burden \u201cto show facts sufficient to overcome\u201d the TIA\u2019s jurisdictional bar, which she did not do. <em>See Amos, </em>347 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">First, the relief Kelly\u2019s complaint requests would \u201cenjoin, suspend, or restrain\u201d Alabama\u2019s income tax assessment. <em>Id. </em>at 1255. All of Kelly\u2019s claims, against both the ADR and the individual defendants who work there, spring from what she alleges were a wrongful assessment of state income taxes by the ADR and the subsequent failure of the ADR\u2019s employees to remedy the error. The relief Kelly seeks includes enjoining the ADR: (1) from any further collection efforts against her; and (2) from imposing state taxes on people, like Kelly, who have an Alabama driver\u2019s license, but live and work in another state. Kelly also asks for a declaration that, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201cprocedure for tax lien processes in the state of Alabama is unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">Granting Kelly the relief she requests would require the district court to interfere with Alabama\u2019s tax system, which would contravene the principle underlying both the TIA and comity that federal courts generally should avoid interfering with state taxation schemes. <em>See Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Collins, </em>921 F.2d 1237, 1242 (11th Cir.1991). Specifically, the plain language of the TIA and this Court\u2019s prior holdings clearly prohibit her claims for injunctive and declaratory relief. Although this Court has not recognized a complete categorical bar to damages claims, Kelly\u2019s damages claims based on federal statutory and civil rights violations were correctly dismissed as seeking to restrain or suspend state tax collection. <em>See McNary, </em>454 U.S. at 113-16, 102 S.Ct. at 184-86; <em>A Bonding Co., </em>629 F.2d at 1132-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Second, Alabama law provides a \u201cplain, speedy, and efficient remedy\u201d for claims derived from tax-assessment challenges under Alabama Code \u00a7 40-2A-7(b)(5). <em>See Lasker, </em>328 F.2d at 429-30. Under that provision, Kelly could have brought her various claims to the then-designated Alabama Law Division or to the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>courts within the prescribed time frame. Kelly also could have brought a state court declaratory judgment action under Alabama\u2019s Declaratory Judgment Act. <em>See Rabren, </em>234 So.2d at 550-51. Kelly\u2019s argument that a state remedy must be presently available, not expired, is foreclosed by <em>Lasker. See Lasker, </em>328 F.2d at 429-30. Additionally, Kelly\u2019s argument that she does not have a remedy available to address her federal claims is without merit. Alabama state courts provide a venue for bringing federal challenges to state tax assessments. <em>See AT&amp;T Corp., </em>953 So.2d at 1243. In sum, given that Kelly\u2019s action seeks to enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment of taxes and that Alabama provides Kelly with sufficient state court remedies, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the TIA and principles of comity.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Finally, because the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction in this case, it properly declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Kelly\u2019s state law claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c); <em>Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, </em>484 U.S. 343, 350, 108 S.Ct. 614, 619, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988) (\u201c[W]hen the federal-law claims have dropped out of the lawsuit in its early stages and only -state-law claims remain, the federal court should decline the exercise of jurisdiction by dismissing the cas\u00e9 without prejudice.\u201d (footnote omitted)). Thus, as the district court correctly concluded, Kelly\u2019s entire action was due to be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">For all these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Kelly\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-6\">. Kelly\u2019s complaint identified the individual defendants as \"David Becldey\u201d and \"Eddie Crowley,\u201d but the defendants noted in their motion to dismiss her complaint that their correct surnames were Baxley and Crumbley, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b909-6\">. The defendants alternatively argued that: (1) the claims against the ADR and the individual defendants in their official capacities are barred by the Eleventh Amendment; (2) the claims against the individual defendants in their individual capacities are barred by qualified immunity; and (3) the complaint failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b911-10\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>this Court adopted as binding precedent the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down on or before September 30, 1981. <em>Bonner, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b911-14\">. The former Fifth Circuit did stop short of determining whether the TIA precludes <em>all </em>suits for damages against administrators of state and local taxes. <em>See A Bonding Co., </em>629 F.2d at 1132-33.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b912-7\">. The Supreme Court has found \u201cno significant difference\u201d between the TIA\u2019s requirement for a \u201cplain, speedy and efficient\u201d state remedy and comity\u2019s requirement for a \"plain, adequate and complete\" state remedy. <em>See McNary, </em>454 U.S. at 116 n. 8, 102 S.Ct. at 186 n. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b912-13\">. Effective October 1, 2014, after Kelly filed her action in August 2014, the Alabama legislature amended the relevant code provisions to create an Alabama Tax Tribunal to replace the Administrative Law Division in hearing appeals from a final assessment by the ADR, <em>See </em>2014 Alabama Laws 378 (Act 2014-146).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b913-9\">.
