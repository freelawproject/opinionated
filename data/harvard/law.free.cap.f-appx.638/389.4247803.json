Hernandez contends that his within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, he asserts that the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 illegal reentry sentencing guideline should not be afforded a presumption of reasonableness because it is not empirically based, double counts certain predicate criminal convictions, overstates the seriousness of the illegal reentry offense, and does not provide just punishment for the offense. Hernandez further argues that his sentence fails to reflect his personal history and characteristics, namely, that he is 30 years of age, he was brought to the United States when he was a child, he has \u00e1 wife and three children, he has a child that suffers from cerebral palsy, and he returned to the United States to find work to support his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">We need not decide this case under plain error review, because Hernandez\u2019s sentence can be affirmed under an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). When a sentence falls within a properly calculated guidelines range, we apply a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Hernandez\u2019s empirical basis challenge to the presumption of reasonableness is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.2009). We have rejected the argument that a sentence imposed under \u00a7 2L1.2 is substantively unreasonable because certain predicate criminal convictions are double counted in the computation of a defendant\u2019s guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). We have also rejected the assertion that \u00a7 2L1.2 overstates the seriousness of illegal reentry. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008). Finally, Hernandez\u2019s contention that his sentence fails to reflect his personal history and characteristics is nothing more than a disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which is insufficient to show an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
