We have reviewed the record and briefs on appeal and affirm the district court\u2019s Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-17\">Rule 60(b) provides relief from a final judgment, order or proceeding in the event of mistake or misconduct, newly discovered evidence, fraud or other reasons that justify relief. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Mayo argues that he was denied such relief because the defendants and the district court committed fraud, misrepresentation and misconduct. The evidence does not support his contentions; Thus, the district court properly concluded that Mayo failed to clearly and convincingly establish the existence of fraud or other misconduct that prevented him from \u201cfully and fairly presenting his case.\u201d <em>Gov\u2019t Fin. Servs. One Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Peyton Place, Inc., </em>62 F.3d 767, 772 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-18\">Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mayo\u2019s request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
