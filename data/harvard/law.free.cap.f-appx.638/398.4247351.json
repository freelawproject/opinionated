California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Bowie has filed a response. The record is not sufficiently developed to allow this court to make a fair evaluation of Bowie\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, so we decline to consider them, without prejudice to collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-21\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief, relevant portions of the record reflected therein, and Bowie\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal pres: ents no nonfrivolous , issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
