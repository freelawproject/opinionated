He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of his sentence pursuant to Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. He argues that the district court abused its discretion in finding he was ineligible for a sentence reduction because the calculation of his advisory guidelines range did not involve a drug quantity. He contends that he is eligible for a sentence reduction because his conviction for maintaining a place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using a controlled substance involved drugs. He further asserts that the district court based its decision on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence and did not consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-22\">The district court correctly determined that Brooks was not eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782 because his sentence was not based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). Because Brooks\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>sentence was not based on a guidelines range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, he was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendment 782. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam). Therefore, Brooks has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In addition, Brooks challenges the drug quantity alleged in the indictment and Pre-sentence Report and argues that the Government breached his plea agreement by using protected information to increase his sentence. However, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not the appropriate vehicle to challenge purported errors in the original criminal proceeding and sentencing. See <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under-the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
