On appeal, he argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines when it added, two points to his criminal history score under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d) because he was no longer under his sentence of probation for his 1998 New Mexico conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-19\">We review.the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006). Section 4Al.l(d) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that two points shall be added, to a defendant\u2019s criminal history score \u201cif the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape status.\u201d \u00a7 4Al.l(d). The section applies \u201cif the defendant committed any part of the instant offense (i.e., any relevant conduct) while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation.\u201d \u00a7 4A1.1, comment, (n: 4). For purposes of \u00a7 4Al.l(d), a defendant who commits the instant offense while a violation warrant from a prior sentence is outstanding, e,g., a probation, parole, or supervised release violation warrant, shall be deemed to be under a criminal justice sentence if that sentence is otherwise countable, even if that sentence would have expired absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>the violation warrant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(m); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 4Al.l(d), comment, (n. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">According to the presentence report, Gonzalez was sentenced to nine years in prison in May 1998, but the sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation for five years. In October 1998, Gonzalez was deported. On April 20, 1999, a revocation warrant was issued against Gonzalez, which remained outstanding through Gonzalez\u2019s return to the United States in November 2003 and until he was convicted of the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Based on these facts, Gonzalez insists that \u00a7 4Al.l(d) and \u00a7 4A1.2(m) should not apply to his case. He first argued that he should not be penalized because the revocation warrant was based on his failure to appear following the deportation, even though reporting to his probation officer would have been impossible at that time. Following the government\u2019s supplementation of the record with documents relating to the revocation warrant, however, Gonzalez conceded that the revocation warrant was based on his pre-revocation conduct and withdrew this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Gonzalez also asserts that the six-month delay by the state of New Mexico before issuing the revocation warrant and the 15-year pendency of the warrant together show a lack of reasonable diligence and should render \u00a7 4Al.l(d) inapplicable. In <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>184 F.3d 479 (5th Cir.1999), we held that for purposes of determining whether \u00a7 4Al.l(d) requires the inclusion, of two criminal history points, \u201cthe Guidelines do not require us to assess the state authorities\u2019 diligence in executing a violation warrant. Rather the two-point increase applies to any defendant who commits the instant offense while a violation warrant from a prior sentence is outstanding.\u201d 184 F.3d at 481 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although Gonzalez maintains that the delays constitute a due process violation, he presents no binding authority overruling <em>Anderson. </em>One panel of this court may not overrule a prior decision of another panel in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Traxler, </em>764 F.3d 486, 489 (5th Cir.2014). Gonzalez has not shown that the district court erred in imposing the criminal history points under \u00a7 4Al.l(d) and \u00a7 4A1.2(m). <em>See Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d at 290. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
