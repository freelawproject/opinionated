At sentencing, the district court held him responsible for 10.9 kilograms of methamphetamine and sentenced him to 135 months of imprisonment, which was at the low end of the guideline range. Gentry now argues that the district court\u2019s drug quantity determination is flawed because it was based on the unreliable, self-serving hearsay of cooperating co-conspirators and an unknown source.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-19\">When considering a claim of procedural error, we review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). A district court\u2019s calculation of the quantity of drugs involved in an offense is a factual \u25a0finding and is \u201cnot clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-20\">In this case, the statements in the witness reports produced by the government are sufficiently reliable to support the district court\u2019s drug quantity calculation, given the similarities among them. <em>See United States v. Zuniga, </em>720 F.3d 587, 591-92 (5th Cir.2013) (affirming reliance on facts from in PSR that were based on two co-conspirators\u2019 detailed and consistent statements). The fact that the statements were made by Gentry\u2019s co-conspirators and were not corroborated by physical evidence does not render the statements inherently unreliable, and Gentry has failed to proffer competent rebuttal evidence to demonstrate that they are materially untrue. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Alvarez, </em>781 F.3d 787, 796 (5th Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
