Appellant sought a modification of his sentence based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-19\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because it gave excessive weight to his lengthy criminal history and did not adequately consider the other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or his mitigating arguments. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-24\">The district court was not under any obligation to reduce Appellant\u2019s sentence. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673. In the instant case, the record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the \u00a7 3582(c) motion as a whole, listened to Appellant\u2019s, mitigating arguments, and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Appellant\u2019s criminal history and the danger he posed to the community; thus, there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73 &amp; n. 11; <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1009-10 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-25\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
