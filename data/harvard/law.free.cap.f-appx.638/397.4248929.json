He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence based on Amendment 782 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels in the drug quantity table set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-21\">We have a duty to examine the basis of our jurisdiction even if we must do so sua sponte. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Ruiz\u2019s notice of appeal was filed almost 11 months after entry of judgment and was thus untimely. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000); Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). Nonetheless, because this issue is not jurisdictional, we pretermit it. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 388 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-22\">We review the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011). Section 3582(c)(2) grants discretion to a district court to modify a sentence that was based.on a guidelines range that was later lowered by the Sentencing Commission, \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-23\">The district court determined that Ruiz was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction because his base offense level was not changed by Amendment 782. Ruiz\u2019s failure to dispute this reasoning has the same effect as if he had not appealed the district court\u2019s judgment at all. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>see also United States v. Delgado, </em>672 F.3d 320, 328 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-24\">Ruiz\u2019s argument that he was entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because he should not have been sentenced as a career offender, which is raised for the first time on appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>is unavailing because claims regarding the validity of the original conviction and sentence are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>645 F.3d 709, 712 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R, 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
