This sanction required Black to seek approval from the court prior to filing any new civil complaints. He subsequently sought the district court\u2019s approval for a complaint alleging various violations of his constitutional rights and seeking compensation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court concluded that his complaint was \u201cclearly frivolous\u201d and denied authorization for Black to proceed with his complaint. We agree and therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Pro se Plaintiff-Appellant Harold Joe Black filed a civil rights complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 on December 3, 2014. Black was previously convicted of distribution of cocaine by a Louisiana state court and was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and his various attempts to obtain postconviction relief were denied by federal and state courts. While incarcerated, Black filed numerous frivolous civil actions and was eventually barred from proceeding <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). After his release in 2013, Black filed a new civil action, and on June 15, 2014, the district court dismissed this action as frivolous and sanctioned Black. The court specifically prohibited Black from filing new civil actions in the Western District of Louisiana without first obtaining the approval and authorization of the chief judge of the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">In the instant case, Black named as defendants several United States district and magistrate judges, a number of state judges and other officials, and all of the defendants identified in the civil actions he filed in the Western District of Louisiana between 2001 and 2013. He alleged that Defendants violated his constitutional rights to equal protection and access to the courts. In particular, he appears to take issue with Defendants\u2019 dismissal of various complaints and petitions and Defendants\u2019 imposition of strikes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Because the chief judge of the district was named as a defendant, Black\u2019s complaint was referred to another judge for approval and authorization consistent with the sanctions previously imposed on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">After reviewing his complaint, a magistrate judge recommended that the complaint be dismissed with prejudice. The magistrate judge noted that all of Black\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against judicial officers were barred by judicial immunity. The magistrate judge further noted that all of Black\u2019s remaining claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and entered judgment on January 9, 2015, ordering that \u201cauthorization to file this clearly frivolous complaint is denied.\u201d The district court reopened the time to file an appeal pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6), and Black timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">We review a district court\u2019s enforcement of its own sanctions for abuse of discretion. <em>See Balawajder v. Scott, </em>160 F.3d 1066, 1067 (5th Cir.1998) (\u2018We review sanctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>imposed upon vexatious or harassing litigants by the district court for an abuse of discretion.\u201d). We have previously recognized that barring a litigant from filing future complaints without the consent of the court is an appropriate sanction for filing multiple frivolous complaints. <em>Id. </em>at 1067 (\u201cWe have affirmed a district court\u2019s sanction barring a litigant from filing future civil rights complaints without the prior consent of a district court or magistrate judge.\u201d). A complaint \u201cis frivolous where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">III. BLACK\u2019S COMPLAINT IS CLEARLY FRIVOLOUS</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Because of the number and nature of Black\u2019s previous filings, the district court required Black to seek the authorization of the court before filing any new civil action. In enforcing its previously imposed sanction, the district court reviewed the complaint Black sought to file in this case. After doing so, the court declined to authorize the complaint\u2019s filing, finding that it was \u201cclearly frivolous.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree that Black\u2019s complaint is \u201cclearly frivolous,\u201d and accordingly find no abuse of discretion by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Black\u2019s complaint contains a variety of allegations that Defendants violated his constitutional rights and claims for damages arising from those violations; however, none of the claims he advances has any merit. All of his claims against federal and state judges are barred by the doctrine of judicial immunity. \u201cJudicial officers are entitled to absolute immunity from claims for damages arising out of acts performed in the exercise of their judicial functions.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284 (5th Cir.1994). \u201cA judge is absolutely immune from liability for his judicial acts even if his exercise of authority is flawed by the commission of grave procedural errors.\u201d <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 359, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978). \u201c[Jjudicial immunity is an immunity from suit, not just from ultimate assessment of damages.\u201d <em>Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 11, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991). Accordingly, all of Black\u2019s claims against judicial officials, which arise exclusively out of those officials\u2019 execution of their judicial functions, are barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Black\u2019s remaining claims are likewise barred by the statute of limitations governing claims brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The Supreme Court has held that \u201c\u00a7 1983 claims are best characterized as personal injury actions.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 280, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(a). Accordingly, the Court explained that the statute of limitations for \u00a7 1983 actions is the same as the statute of limitations governing personal injury actions in the state where the \u00a7 1983 claims accrue. <em>Id.; see also Bourdais v. New Orleans City, </em>485 F.3d 294, 298 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201cIn \u00a7 1983 claims, the applicable statute of limitations is that which the state would apply in an analogous action in its courts.\u201d). This court has previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>approved the application of the \u201cone-year liberative prescriptive period\u201d found in Louisiana Civil Code article 3492 to \u00a7 1983 actions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Bourdais, </em>485 F.3d at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">While state law provides the statute of limitations for \u00a7 1983 claims, the date of accrual for these claims is a question of federal law. <em>Piotrowski v. City of Hous., </em>51 F.3d 512, 516 (5th Cir.1995). \u201cUnder federal law, the [limitations] period begins to run \u2018the moment the plaintiff becomes aware that he has suffered an injury or has sufficient information to know that he has been injured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Russell v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>968 F.2d 489, 493 (5th Cir.1992)). A plaintiff need not know that a legal cause of action exists; rather, he must only be aware of facts that would support the cause of action. <em>Id.; see also Harrison v. United States, </em>708 F.2d 1023, 1027 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In this case, all of the claims Black presses on appeal that are not barred by judicial immunity occurred during his arrest, trial, and incarceration. As noted in Black\u2019s complaint, he was released from prison on May 30, 2013, so that was the last day all of his remaining claims could have accrued. He filed the instant complaint on December 3, 2014\u2014approximate-ly eighteen months after his claims accrued\u2014which is well outside the one-year period of limitations under Louisiana law. <em>See </em>La. Civ.Code Ann. art. 3492. Therefore, all of the remaining claims are clearly barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Because all of Black\u2019s claims are clearly barred as a matter of law, we conclude that they \u201clack[ ] an arguable basis .., in law.\u201d <em>Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827. Accordingly, we agree with the district court that Black\u2019s complaint is \u201cclearly frivolous.\u201d Because his complaint is clearly frivolous, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied authorization to file the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\">. Black is not proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>in this action, and the district court did not explicitly conclude that his complaint was \"clearly frivolous\u201d under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. However, the Supreme Court has recognized that \"[statutory provisions may simply codify existing rights or powers. Section 19151(e)], for example, authorizes courts to dismiss a 'frivolous or malicious\u2019 action, but there is little doubt they would have power to do so even in the absence of this statutoiy provision.\u201d <em>Mallard v. U.S. Dist. Court for S. Dist. of Iowa, </em>490 U.S. 296, 307-08, 109 S.Ct. 1814, 104 L.Ed.2d 318 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\">, The statute provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj_\">Delictual actions are subject to a liberative prescription of one year. This prescription commences to run from the day injury or damage is sustained. It does not run against minors or interdicts in actions involving permanent disability and brought pursuant to the Louisiana Products Liability Act or state law governing product liability actions in effect at the time of the injury or damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuD\">La.
