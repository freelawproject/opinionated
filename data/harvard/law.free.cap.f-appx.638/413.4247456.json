He appealed his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in imposing a six-level upward adjustment for an offense involving more than 250 victims. <em>United States v. Cardenas, </em>598 Fed.Appx. 264, 265 (5th Cir.2015). This court agreed, vacating Carrillo-Torres\u2019s sentence and remanding the case for re-sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 270. On remand, the district court again imposed a sentence of 108 months of imprisonment. Carrillo-Torres appeals the sentence imposed, arguing that it is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">This court reviews sentences for reasonableness by engaging in a bifurcated review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). An appellate court must first ensure that the sentencing court committed no significant procedural error, including improperly \u2022 calculating the guidelines range and failing to adequately explain the reasons for the chosen sentence, including an explanation for any variance from the advisory guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. In evaluating whether a district court committed a procedural error in the sentencing determination, this court employs a de novo standard of review. <em>United States v. Garcia Mendoza, </em>587 F.3d 682, 688 (5th Cir.2009). In reviewing a non-guidelines sentence for substantive reasonableness, we \u201cconsider the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">We conclude that the sentence is reasonable under the circumstances. The record in this case reflects that the district court did not fail to account for a factor that should have received significant weight, give weight to any improper factor, or clearly err in balancing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Chandler, </em>732 F.3d 434, 437 (5th Cir.2013). Moreover, we defer to the district court\u2019s determination that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justify the extent of the upward variance imposed in this case. <em>See United States v. Broussard, </em>669 F.3d 537, 551 (5th Cir.2012). Finally, given that the court heard the parties\u2019 arguments, permitted Carrillo-Torres and his counsel to present mitigating evidence, and articulated its reasons for the upward variance based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court was not required to offer additional explanation for the sentence. <em>See United States v. Fraga, </em>704 F.3d 432, 439 (5th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
