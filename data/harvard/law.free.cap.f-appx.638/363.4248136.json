HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Eric Heilman appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims against defendants, the City of Beaumont and the Beaumont Chief of Police. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The following facts are consistent with Heilman\u2019s second amended complaint. Heilman was a police officer in the Beaumont Police Department. On October 13, 2008, Heilman and his partner arrested a suspect based on evidence provided by a confidential informant. Heilman did not disclose the confidential informant at the time of the arrest or in his testimony to a grand jury because the policy of the Department was to only disclose a confidential informant if the informant was involved in the arrest. Despite this policy, Tom Maness, the District Attorney for Jefferson County\u2014encompassing the City of Beaumont\u2014pursued a charge of perjury against Heilman based on his failure to disclose the informant. Shane Phelps, an Assistant District Attorney, misled Heil-man into pleading guilty to tampering with a government record, a misdemeanor. The plea agreement included a waiver of the relevant statute of limitations. Heil-man was sentenced to six months deferred adjudication. He resigned from the Pe-partment on January 11, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">After being notified that the statute of limitations could not be waived in his plea agreement, Heilman filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court granted relief and dismissed the charges. The government appealed, and the Court of Appeals of Texas, Ninth District, affirmed the grant of relief. The government again appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the lower court\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">Heilman then filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Texas alleging numerous constitutional violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Maness, Phelps, Jefferson County, the City of Beaumont, and the Beaumont Chief of Police. Heilman alleged that the defendants engaged in malicious prosecution, infringement of his protected speech by forcing him to plead guilty, retaliation by forcing him to resign because of his protected speech, and deprivation of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Following a motion to dismiss Heilman\u2019s second amended complaint, the district court dismissed Heil-man\u2019s claims against Maness, Jefferson County, the Beaumont Chief of Police, and the City of Beaumont because, <em>inter alia, </em>the claims were barred by the relevant statute of limitations. On appeal, Heilman challenges the dismissal as to his claims against the City of Beaumont and the Beaumont Chief of Police. Finding that the statute of limitations bars Heilman\u2019s remaining claims, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">We review the dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo. <em>Spiller v. City of Texas City, Police Dep\u2019t, </em>130 F.3d 162, 164 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, \u2018to state a claim to relief that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citation omitted). The plaintiff must allege facts that suggest liability and are more than consistent with unlawful conduct. <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 563, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed,2d 929 (2007). \u201cA motion to dismiss may be granted on a statute of limitations defense where it is evident from the pleadings that the action is time-barred, and the pleadings fail to raise some basis for tolling.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Bailey Tool Mfg. Co., </em>744 F.3d 944, 946 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Section 1983 does not prescribe a statute of limitations. Instead, \u201c[t]he statute of limitations for a suit brought under \u00a7 1983 is determined by the general statute of limitations governing personal injuries in the forum state.\u201d <em>Piotrowski v. City of Hous., </em>237 F.3d 567, 576 (5th Cir.2001). Texas has a two year statute of limitations for personal injury claims. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 16.003(a); <em>Piotrowski, </em>237 F.3d at 576. Under our law, the limitations period begins to run when the plaintiff \u201cknows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action.\u201d <em>Burrell v. Newsome, </em>883 F.2d 416, 418 (5th Cir.1989) (citations omitted). The plaintiff must know of the injury and the causal connection between the defendant and the injury. <em>Piotrowski </em>237 F.3d at 576. Heilman filed his complaint on March 4, 2014. To survive the motion to dismiss, Heilman must have sufficiently pleaded facts that suggested liability for injuries that he did not know of until after March 4, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In his second amended complaint, Heil-man alleged that the City of Beaumont and the Beaumont Chief of Police adversely acted against him by forcing him to resign and refusing to honor their promise to rehire him. Heilman contended that these acts were in response to his protected speech\u2014not disclosing the confidential informant, arguing that such nondisclosure was the policy of the Department, and challenging the validity of his guilty plea. In addition, Heilman alleged that the City \u201chas a pattern and practice of wrongfully punishing Police Officers who follow orders or policies or practices which \u2018embarrass\u2019 the City\u2019s administration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">To establish a retaliation claim under \u00a7 1983, Heilman, a public employee, must satisfy the following elements: \u201c(1) the plaintiff must suffer an adverse employment decision; (2) the plaintiffs speech must involve a matter of public concern; (3) the plaintiffs interest in commenting on matters of public concern must outweigh the defendant\u2019s interest in promoting efficiency; and (4) the plaintiffs speech must have motivated the defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Finch v. Fort Bend Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>333 F.3d 555, 563 (5th Cir.2003). Discharges and refusals to hire are considered adverse employment actions. <em>Sharp v. City of Houston, </em>164 F.3d 923, 932 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">For his retaliation claim to fall within the statute of limitations, Heilman must have pleaded that the adverse actions in response to his protected speech occurred after March 4, 2012. Even if we took his allegations of protected speech to be more than conclusory and of public interest, the only adverse action that Heil-man sufficiently pleaded is that the City and the Chief of Police forced him to resign. This injury occurred on January 11, 2011. Heilman also alleged that the City promised to reinstate him and did not do so. Heilman pleaded that the City \u201cforced Chief of Police Coffin to renege on promises to Heilman about continued employment despite Maness\u2019 claims\u201d and \u201cprom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ised to reinstate [him] through its current Chief of Police and City Manager, and then refused to perform as recently as 2014.\u201d In his second amended complaint, Heilman acknowledged that Chief of Police Coffin resigned in 2011; therefore, any failure to hire by Coffin occurred well before March 4, 2012. Heilman\u2019s allegations that the current chief of police also refused to reinstate him as recently as 2014 are conclusory. Heilman did not point to a discrete instance where he actively pursued reinstatement and the City or the current chief of police failed to hire him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Heilman did not plead any facts sufficient to allege that the City adversely acted against him after' 2011. <em>See Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Heilman\u2019s final alleged injury is that the City withheld evidence that would have shown that he was acting in accordance with the policy of the Department when he did not disclose the confidential informant. Even ignoring Heiman\u2019s internal inconsistency\u2014Heilman also pleaded that Coffin told Maness that Heilman was following Department policies\u2014this alleged injury is also time barred. Heilman knew or should have known of this injury during his prosecution that resulted in his guilty plea on December 22, 2010. The existence and nature of the Department\u2019s policies were not at issue in Heilman\u2019s subsequent habeas petitions. Because Heilman failed to sufficiently plead facts suggesting that the City is likely liable for injuries that occurred within Texas\u2019s two year statute of limitations, each of his claims is time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Heilman did not allege any facts that' would suggest that his \u00a7 1983 claims against the City of Beaumont and the Beaumont Chief of Police are not barred by the applicable statute of limitations. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Heilman\u2019s claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\">. Heilman instead inconsistently pleaded that the City promised to reinstate him, and that the current chief of police, Jimmy Singletary, repeatedly insisted that he would rehire him \u201cbut for the City.\u201d Heilman did not reference paragraphs sixty and sixty-one of his second amended complaint, or the facts contained therein, in his brief to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
