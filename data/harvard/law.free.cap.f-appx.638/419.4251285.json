Now, he appeals the eight-year prison sentence imposed by the district court following revocation of his probation. First, he argues that his sentence, which exceeds the four-to-ten-month range recommended by the Guidelines\u2019 policy statements, is procedurally unreasonable be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>cause it was primarily grounded in his immigration status and'the state conviction that led to the revocation. Next, he contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court did not properly account for all of the pertinent sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Because Castillo-Gonzalez did not raise his procedural unreasonableness arguments in the district court, they are reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Warren, </em>720 F.3d 321, 327 (5th Cir.2013). To establish plain error, a defendant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but will do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>Castillo-Gonzalez has not met this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Our review of the record shows that the district court\u2019s choice of sentence was grounded in its balancing of Castillo-Gonzalez\u2019s history and characteristics, the nature and circumstances of the violation conduct, the severity of the violation conduct, the need for deterrence, the desire to encourage respect for the law, and the need to protect the public from him. These are proper considerations. <em>See </em>18 U.SU. \u00a7 3565(a); 18 U.S.C. . \u00a7 3553(a); <em>United States v. Kippers, </em>685 F.3d 491, 499 (5th Cir.2012). Additionally, the record shows that the district court had \u201ca reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Castillo-Gonzalez has shown no procedural error, plain or otherwise, in connection with his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Because Castillo-Gonzalez objected to the reasonableness of his sentence, review of his substantive unreasonableness claim is for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kippers, </em>685 F.3d at 499-500. He has not met this standard, as he has not shown that the district court ignored an important sentencing factor, relied upon an improper factor, or made a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d when weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 332 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, Castillo-Gonzalez\u2019s arguments are, in essence, a request for this court to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We decline to do so. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
