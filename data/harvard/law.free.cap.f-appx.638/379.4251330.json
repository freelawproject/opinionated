On appeal, he argues that his prolonged detention for questioning exceeded the scope of the traffic stop and was not supported by reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-21\">When reviewing a denial of a motion to suppress evidence, this court reviews factual findings for clear error and the ultimate constitutionality of law enforcement\u2019s action <em>de novo. See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Pack, </em>612 F.3d 341, 347 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-22\">When, the officers stopped Bernal for having a defective headlight and brake light, he was traveling on Highway 287, a known drug-trafficking corridor. Bernal was also traveling from California, a state that, in the officers\u2019 experience, had a reputation for drug trafficking. Bernal was driving a recently purchased car, and based on the officers\u2019 experience, drug traffickers typically use a rental car or a recently purchased car when transporting narcotics. Bernal\u2019s story about the purpose of the trip (i.e., visiting his sister) was suspicious to the officers given that he did not know her address or even the city where she lived. Bernal was driving across the country, from California to Alabama, on a suspended license, a risk that seemed inappropriate given the stated purpose of the trip (i.e., visiting a sister whose general area of residence he did not even know). Bernal exhibited an inappropriate level of concern regarding the reason for the stop and remained nervous even after he was allowed to inspect the defective headlight.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-23\">These factors, when taken together, demonstrate that the officers\u2019 detention of Bernal for only two minutes after writing the citation and warning was supported by reasonable suspicion. This court has found reasonable suspicion under similar circumstances. <em>See Pack, </em>612 F.3d at 361 (finding reasonable suspicion where the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>ficer testified as to the defendant\u2019s nervousness, the driver\u2019s and passenger\u2019s conflicting stories, and the fact that the pair was traveling on a known drug corridor); <em>United States v. Fishel, </em>467 F.3d 855, 856 (5th Cir.2006). (holding that reasonable suspicion existed based on defendant\u2019s nervousness, expired driver\u2019s license, and suspicious story regarding travel plans); and <em>United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 509 (5th Cir.2004) (holding that absence of an authorized driver, inconsistent explanation regarding reason for trip, and passenger\u2019s presentation of fake ID justified officer\u2019s continued detention of defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Bernal also claims that his consent to search the vehicle was involuntary because it was given after the officers had written the citation and warning but before they returned Bernal\u2019s identification card and insurance papers. But this argument ignores all of the factors demonstrating that his consent was voluntary. <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 436 (5th Cir.2002) (setting out factors considered when analyzing whether consent to search was voluntary). As stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s report, Bernal\u2019s encounter with the officers was \u201cthe antithesis of coercive.\u201d The officers put no pressure on Bernal to consent to the search, and Ber-nal volunteered to allow the search before it was even requested. Bernal was cooperative and complied with each of the officers\u2019 requests. Although Bernal did not speak English, there was no evidence that Bernal was of below average intelligence, and one of the officers was fluent in Spanish and was available to translate. Finally, given how well the drugs were hidden in the trunk, Bernal likely believed that no incriminating evidence would be found. In light of the forgoing, Bernal has failed to show that the district court clearly erred in concluding that Bernal\u2019s consent to search was voluntary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Because the officers\u2019 search of the vehicle was supported by voluntary consent, obtained during a lawful detention, the district court did not err in denying Ber-nal\u2019s motion to suppress. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-5\">. Bernal also argues that his consent was not an independent act of free will. Because his consent was not given during an illegal detention, however, the court need not consider this prong of the consent inquiry. <em>See United States v. Khanalizadeh, </em>493 F.3d 479, 484 (5th Cir.2007) (declining to address whether consent was an independent act of free will where no constitutional violation preceded consent).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
