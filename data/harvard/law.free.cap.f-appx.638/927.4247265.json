After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b950-16\">In 2008, Defendant pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Following his guilty plea, the probation officer prepared a Pre-sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR indicated that Defendant was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because he had two prior convictions for crimes of violence. Because the statutory maximum for Defendant\u2019s present offense was 25 years or more, Defendant\u2019s career offender status resulted in a base offense level of 34. Defendant received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), which resulted in a total offense level of 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-17\">Based on both his lengthy criminal history and his career offender status, the PSR assigned Defendant a criminal history category of VI. With a total offense level of 31 and a criminal history category of VI, the PSR calculated Defendant\u2019s guideline range as 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>Defendant did not file any objections to the PSR. At the sentencing hearing, Defendant explained that he was a career offender due to a 1991 conviction for attempted capital sexual battery\u2014an offense that occurred when he was sixteen years old. Absent the career offender designation, his guideline range would have been 92 to 115 months. He asked that the district court disregard his career offender status and vary below the guideline range to 92 months\u2019 imprisonment. The Government agreed that a below-guidelines sentence was appropriate in this case. After considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court determined that a sentence below the guideline range was appropriate and sentenced Defendant to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment. Defendant did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">In March 2015, Defendant filed a counseled motion for a reduction in sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 782. Though acknowledging that he was considered a career offender, Defendant argued that he was eligible for a sentence reduction because the district court had varied downward and based Defendant\u2019s sentence on the guideline range that would have applied absent his career offender designation. He also noted that he might not have qualified as a career offender in light of recent Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit precedent, The district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that, because Defendant was sentenced as a career offender, he was ineligible for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Defendant now appeals from that decision, arguing that he was eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 782. In particular, he asserts that he is not a career offender because recent Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit precedent dictate that his predicate offenses are not crimes of violence. Additionally, Defendant argues that the district court erred by concluding that it lacked authority to reduce his sentence on the basis that he was sentenced as a career offender. Because he received a sentence below the guideline range, he contends that he was sentenced, at least in part, on the sentencing range set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions on the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment when the original sentencing range has subsequently been lowered as a result- of an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2). To be eligible for a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant must identify an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines that is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). A defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction if a guideline amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">Amendment 782 reduced the base offense level for most drug offenses by two levels. See <em>id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(d); U.S.S.GApp. C., Amend. 782 (2014). Amendment 782 did not make any changes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C., Amend. 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">When a defendant is sentenced as a career offender, his base offense level is determined under \u00a7 4B1.1, not under the Drug Quantity Table set forth in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Moore, </em>we considered whether defendants who were sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief in \u25a0 light of Amendment 706, which lowered the \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) base offense levels for certain quantities of crack cocaine. 541 F.3d at 1325. We held that the defendants did not qualify for .\u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendment 706 had no effect on their applicable guideline ranges, which had been calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28, 1330; <em>see also United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012) (concluding that <em>Moore </em>remained binding precedent- and that Amendment 750 did not lower the guideline range for career offenders).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Here, the district court did not err when it concluded that Defendant was not eligible for a sentence reduction. Defendant\u2019s total offense level and applicable guideline range were not based on the drug quantity offense levels in .\u00a7 2D1.1, but instead were based on the career offender level in \u00a7 4B1.1. The downward variance Defendant received does not change the fact that his applicable guideline range was based on the career offender guideline. Indeed, the commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 defines \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d as the guideline range based on the offense level and criminal history category calculated before consideration of any variance. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Because Defendant\u2019s guideline range was not based on the drug quantity guidelines, Amendment 782 \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-30. Section 3582(c)(2) therefore does not authorize a reduction in sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Although Defendant also challenges the validity of his career offender designation, his arguments on this point are outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000) (stating that in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding \u201conly the amended guideline is changed. All other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact.\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (holding that the alleged sentencing errors that the Defendant sought to correct were not affected by the applicable guideline amendment and were therefore outside the scope of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings). Accordingly, the district court committed no error in concluding that Defendant was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-10\">. Without the career offender designation, the PSR indicated that Defendant\u2019s base offense level would have been 26, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
