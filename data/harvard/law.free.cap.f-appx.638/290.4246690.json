Vaughan, and Buck Files, and denying his motion to file a second amended complaint. Osborne also challenges an earlier order denying his motion to disqualify counsel for Vaughan. Because we agree that Osborne\u2019s pleading, even if amended, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and because the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Osborne\u2019s motion to disqualify counsel, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-18\">Osborne graduated from law school and applied for admission to the State Bar of Texas (\u201cthe Bar\u201d) in 2009 but failed the bar exam. Nevertheless, Osborne applied for a job as a Travis County attorney in early 2013. Travis County did not hire him. Later in 2013, Osborne again applied for admission to the Bar but did not attend the bar exam \u201cdue to a personal conflict.\u201d As a result, Osborne has not obtained a license to practice law in Texas. Osborne would like to practice law but cannot legally do so in Texas without a license. As the district court explained, out of this factual scenario \u201ccame a whole assortment of claims, including due process, freedom of association, antitrust, regulatory taking, professional malpractice, civil rights, equal protection, First Amendment [freedom of speech], and improper taking of property claims.\u201d <em>Citizens Against the Bar v. Travis Cty., </em>No. A-13-CV-528-LY, 2014 WL 7338891, at *1 (W.D.Tex. Dec. 22, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-19\">Osborne initially brought this action against the State of Texas, the Texas Board of Law Examiners, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Court of Texas, and the three remaining defendants, Travis County, Julia E. Vaughan, and Buck Files. Later, Osborne voluntarily dismissed the State of Texas, the Texas Board of Law Examiners, and the Supreme Court of Texas. The remaining defendants each filed a motion to dismiss Osborne\u2019s claims against them, and Osborne filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The district court denied Osborne\u2019s motion, granted-the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, and dismissed the action with prejudice. Osborne timely appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Osborne appeals the district court\u2019s final order granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and denying Osborne\u2019s' motion to file a second amended complaint. Osborne also appeals the district court\u2019s earlier order denying his motion to disqualify counsel, in which Osborne argued that the Office of the Texas Attorney General did not have the authority to represent defendant Vaughan in this action because she was being sued in her individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> Reece v. U.S. Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n, </em>762 F.3d 422, 424 (5th Cir.2014). We review a denial of a motion to file an amended pleading for abuse of discretion, but when, as here, \u201cthe court\u2019s decision is based solely on futility, we review the matter de novo, using the standard for a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\u201d <em>McClaine v. Boeing Co., </em>544 Fed.Appx. 474, 476 (5th Cir.2013) (citing <em>City of Clinton v. Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp., </em>632 F.3d 148, 152 (5th Cir.2010) and <em>Wilson v. Bruks-Klockner, Inc., </em>602 F.3d 363, 368 (5th Cir.2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">The district court first determined that Osborne\u2019s claims against defendant Vaughan were barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>Citizens Against the Bar, </em>2014 WL 7338891, at *4. Osborne sued Vaughan for her actions as \u201cCEO\u201d of the Texas Board of Law Examiners (\u201cTBLE\u201d) for violating various federal constitutional rights. The district court construed Osborne\u2019s claims against Vaughan as claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and reasoned that because Vaughan was a state official being sued in her official capacity for damages, Vaughan was entitled to immunity from Osborne\u2019s claims under the Eleventh Amendment. <em>Id.; see Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 169, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985) (\u201c[A]bsent waiver by the State or valid congressional override, the Eleventh Amendment bars a damages action against a State in federal court,\u201d and \u201c[t]his bar remains in effect when State officials are sued for damages in their official capacity.\u201d). However, Os<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>borne specifically stated in his complaint<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that Vaughan was being sued in her \u201cindividual\u201d capacity, and Osborne also alleged a continuing violation of federal law and requested injunctive relief, which triggers the <em>Ex Parte Young </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court did not address these allegations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nevertheless, \u201cwe may affirm a district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal on any grounds supported by the record.\u201d <em>Rojas v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>571 Fed.Appx. 274, 279 n. 7 (5th Cir.2014) (citing <em>Hosein v. Gonzales, </em>452 F.3d 401, 403 (5th Cir.2006)). As such, we review the complaint to determine if the dismissal of Osborne\u2019s claims against Vaughan was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Whether or not Osborne alleges an official- or individual-capacity claim against Vaughan, his claims against her fail because Osborne\u2019s complaint does not allege a plausible constitutional violation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Osborne first alleged that Vaughan violated his \u201cright to freedom of thought\u201d under the First and Fourteenth Amendments \u201cby administering the Texas Bar Exam, compelling ... Osborne to give his legal opinions and beliefs as a condition precedent for a recommendation for a license to practice law and by refusing to recommend Plaintiff for a license to practice law based on Plaintiffs opinions and beliefs.\u201d Osborne\u2019s allegations against Vaughan do not make out a plausible constitutional violation. First, Osborne is free to think any thought of any kind regardless of whether he must pass the Texas bar exam to obtain a law license. Second, both the Supreme Court and this circuit have recognized the constitutionality of state licensure requirements for the practice of law, including the requirement that an applicant must show a certain level of competency in the law by, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>for example, passing a bar exam. <em>See Sperry v. Florida ex rel. Fla. Bar, </em>373 U.S. 379, 383, 83 S.Ct. 1322, 10 L.Ed.2d 428 (1963) (acknowledging that a state \u201chas a substantial interest in regulating the practice of law within the State\u201d); <em>Schware v. Bd. of Bar Exam\u2019rs of N.M., </em>353 U.S. 232, 238-39, 77 S.Ct. 752, 1 L.Ed.2d 796 (1957) (\u201cA State can require high standards of qualification, such as good moral character or proficiency in its law, before it admits an applicant to the bar, but any qualification must have a rational connection with the applicant\u2019s fitness or capacity to practice law.\u201d); <em>Attwell v. Nichols, </em>608 F.2d 228, 230 (5th Cir.1979) (\u201cIt seems clear that there is no constitutional guarantee of the right to practice law without examination.\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe Constitution proscribes only those qualifications or requirements which have no rational connection with an applicant\u2019s fitness or capacity to practice law.\u201d <em>Attwell, </em>608 F.2d at 230 (citing <em>Schware, </em>353 U.S. at 239, 77 S.Ct. 752). Osborne has not alleged any facts showing how the Texas bar exam requirement fails to \u201chave a rational connection with the applicant\u2019s fitness or capacity to practice law.\u201d <em>Schware, </em>353 U.S. at 239, 77 S.Ct. 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Osborne also alleged that Vaughan deprived Osborne of his procedural due process rights by refusing to issue him a refund of the fee he paid to apply to the State Bar of Texas (\u201capplication fee\u201d). To state such a claim for deprivation of due process, Osborne must allege a constitutionally protected property interest, among other elements. <em>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 538-39, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985) (stating that the plaintiffs\u2019 due process claim \u201cdepends on their having had a property right\u201d in the thing of which they were deprived by the state).\u2019 Here, Osborne\u2019s complaint fails to show how he retained a constitutionally protected property interest in his money after paying the nonrefundable application fee. Because both of Osborne\u2019s claims against defendant Vaughan fail, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">With regard to defendant Buck, Osborne alleged that Buck, as \u201cPresident of the Texas Bar,\u201d \u201cdeliberately placed an undue burden\u201d on the right of Osborne\u2019s brother, Mikal Osborne, to petition the courts by inadequately regulating attorney\u2019s fees. The district court reasoned that Osborne failed to allege facts showing that Mikal Osborne had any trouble petitioning the courts, as Mikal Osborne did in fact litigate his dispute that related to the high attorney\u2019s fees and was one of the plaintiffs who brought this action. <em>Citizens Against the Bar, </em>2014 WL 7338891, at *5. We agree that no facts show any burden on Mikal Osborne\u2019s ability to petition the courts and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Osborne\u2019s claims against Buck.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Finally, Osborne alleged that defendant Travis County violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by only hiring applicants with law licenses for its attorney positions. Osborne alleges that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>practice has a disparate impact on African-Americans because a lower percentage of African-American bar applicants passed the Texas bar exam in 2004, as compared to Caucasian bar applicants. \u201cTo establish a prima facie case of discrimination under a disparate-impact theory, a plaintiff must show: (1) an identifiable, facially neutral personnel policy or practice; (2) a disparate effect on members of a protected class; and (3) a causal connection between the two.\u201d <em>McClain v. Lufkin Indus., Inc., </em>519 F.3d 264, 275 (5th Cir.2008). As the district court explained, Osborne failed to make such a showing because the only statistical evidence supplied by Osborne relates to the bar exam, which \u201citself is not an \u2018employment practice\u2019 of Travis County\u201d and, moreover, provides no information on the effect on African-Americans of Travis County\u2019s practice of only hiring licensed attorneys when compared to overall \u201cpool of applicants.\u201d <em>See Crawford v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>245 Fed.Appx. 369, 379-80 (5th Cir.2007) (holding that appellant failed to allege a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate impact discrimination when her statistics were \u201cnot properly tailored\u201d to the alleged discrimination); <em>Citizens Against the Bar, </em>2014 WL 7338891, at *5-*6. We agree with the district court and AFFIRM the dismissal of Osborne\u2019s claims against Travis County.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Upon review of the relevant filings, we also AFFIRM the denial of Osborne\u2019s motion to file a second amended complaint for essentially the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s December 22, 2014, order. <em>See Citizens Against the Bar, </em>2014 WL 7338891, at *2-*4.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to disqualify counsel for abuse of discretion. <em>In re ProEducation Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>587 F.3d 296, 299 (5th Cir.2009). Defendant Vaughan, who was sued for her actions as the Executive Director of the TBLE, is represented by the Office of the Attorney General of Texas (\u201cAG\u2019s Office\u201d). Osborne asserted that the AG\u2019s Office did not have legal authority to represent Vaughan because Osborne was suing her in her individual capacity. The district court denied the motion because the TBLE is a state governmental entity formed under Texas law, and the AG\u2019s Office \u201chas constitutional and statutory authority\u201d to represent state officials and employees \u201cin all actions in which the State has an interest,\u201d regardless of whether the state employee or official is sued in his or her official or individual capacity. Because the district court\u2019s order did not make clearly erroneous factual findings or errors of law, we AFFIRM. <em>See In re ProEducation Int\u2019l, </em>587 F.3d at 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\">. Because Osborne timely appealed the denial of his Rule 59 motion, we have appellate jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s previous orders granting the motions to dismiss and denying Osborne\u2019s motion to disqualify Vaughan\u2019s counsel. <em>See Armour v. Knowles, </em>512 F.3d 147, 156 (5th Cir.2007) (\"An appeal from a final judgment sufficiently preserves all prior orders intertwined with the final judgment.\u201d); <em>Picco v.
