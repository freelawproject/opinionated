California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Cisneros has filed several responses. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Cisneros\u2019s responses. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no non-frivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Cisneros\u2019s motions to withdraw counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, to have counsel file an appropriate brief showing clear and specific facts of the case, to remand the case, and to compel counsel to file an appropriate brief are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
