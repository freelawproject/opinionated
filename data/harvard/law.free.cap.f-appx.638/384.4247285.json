He maintains that the district court failed to consider whether he was eligible for a reduction in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the need for rehabilitation. Dickerson further suggests that the district court inordinately relied on the guideline sentencing range, failed to consider the policies underlying Amendment 782, and violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The record reflects that Dickerson was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 782 did not have the effect of lowering his sentencing range. His guideline sentencing range at his initial sentencing exceeded the statutory maximum sentence that applied to his offense; thus, his sentencing range was restricted to the statutory maximum punishment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a). If Dickerson was granted the two-level reduction provided by Amendment 782, his guideline sentencing range would remain greater than the statutory maximum sentence; his amended guideline sentencing range also would be limited to the statutory maximum punishment. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, because Amendment 782 would not reduce Dickerson\u2019s sentencing range, the district court properly found that he was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) &amp; comment, (n. 1(A)); <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Dickerson\u2019s challenges to the district court\u2019s ruling lack merit. Because he was ineligible for a reduction under Amendment 782, there was no basis for the district court to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or the need for rehabilitation. Furthermore, the district court did not have to review the policies underlying Amendment 782 because they did not implicate his eligibility for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). His assertion that the district court violated <em>Booker </em>is unavailing because <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying relief. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R, 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
