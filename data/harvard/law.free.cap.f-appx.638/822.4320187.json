Debtor asserts the order should be reversed because: (1) the funds at issue are \u201cearnings\u201d under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.11 and, therefore, are exempt from turnover to Trustee; and (2) Trustee failed to properly object to Debtor\u2019s exemption of the funds. Debtor also avers the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in denying his motion to alter or amend. We hold that the funds \u00e1re not \u201cearnings\u201d under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.11 and res judicata precludes us from considering whether Trustee properly objected to Debtor\u2019s exemption. Further, we hold that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying Debtor\u2019s motion to alter or amend. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b983-18\">Debtor is an attorney who, at relevant times, operated a law practice as a solo practitioner. He filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, listing contingency fees he expected to receive from several cases as exempt from turnover. Debtor received some of the fees (the funds) shortly after filing his petition. The Chapter 13 trustee timely filed objections to Debtor\u2019s exemption. Subsequently, the bankruptcy court converted Debtor\u2019s petition to a Chapter 7 petition and appointed Calderin as the new trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-19\">Following the Chapter 7 conversion, Debtor filed a motion to deem the funds exempt \u201cearnings\u201d under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.11. The bankruptcy court denied the motion and Debtor appealed to the district court. Debtor argued that Trustee waived her objections to his exemption by failing to timely object and not sufficiently pleading her objections. Debtor claimed this failure required the bankruptcy court to grant his motion. The district court rejected Debtor\u2019s arguments and upheld the order. Debtor filed a notice of appeal, but this court dismissed the appeal for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-20\">Ultimately, the bankruptcy court determined that the funds are not exempt under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.11 and ordered turnover of a portion of the funds to Trustee. Debtor sought relief from this order via a motion to alter or amend. However, the motion was limited to factual allegations and arguments that Debtor averred prior to the bankruptcy court\u2019s order. Accordingly, the bankruptcy court denied the motion. Debtor then appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s \u201cturnover\u201d order and denial of his motion to alter or amend. The district court again affirmed the bankruptcy court. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">A. <em>The Funds Are Not Exenvpt Under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.11.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Whether the funds are exempt as \u201cearnings\u201d under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.11 is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>See In re Valone, </em>784 F.3d 1398, 1402 (11th Cir.2015). When interpreting a state statute, such as Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.11, \u201cwe look to the decisions of the state\u2019s courts.\u201d <em>See In re Schlein, </em>8 F.3d 745, 754 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.11 defines \u201cearnings\u201d as \u201ccompensation paid or payable, in money of a sum certain, for personal services or labor whether denominated as wages, salary, commission, or bonus.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.11(l)(a). Florida courts have held that proceeds from a debtor\u2019s business, including a law practice, do not constitute \u201cearnings.\u201d <em>See Brock v. Westport Recovery Corp., </em>832 So.2d 209, 212 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2002) (affirming trial court ruling that the \u201cearnings\u201d exemption does not apply to proceeds from a family-owned business); <em>Vining v. Martyn, </em>858 So.2d 365, 366 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2003) (per curiam) (\u201c[T]he funds at issue here were proceeds of [the debtor\u2019s] law practice. We agree with the trial court that the funds do not qualify for the statutory exemption.\u201d); <em>Vining v. Segal, </em>731 So.2d 826, 827 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1999) (holding that proceeds from a debt- or\u2019s dental practice are not exempt under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.11).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Federal courts interpreting Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.11 have held the same. <em>In re Zamora, </em>187 B.R. 783, 785 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1995) (\u201cDebtor\u2019s compensation from his legal practice and his corporation do not qualify as exempt earnings....\u201d); <em>In re McDermott, </em>425 B.R. 848, 851 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.2010) (\u201cA debtor who owns and runs his own business ... cannot rely on [Fla. Stat. \u00a7 ] 222.11 to exempt\u201d his compensation.), <em>aff'd, </em>No. 6:10-CV-890-ORL-31, 2011 WL 740727 (M.D.Fla. Feb. 24, 2011). However, if the debtor has an \u201carms-length employment agreement\u201d with his business providing for a set salary or wages, the \u201cearnings\u201d exemption applies. <em>See Brock, </em>832 So.2d at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">Here, the funds at issue are proceeds from Debtor\u2019s law practice. Moreover, the funds are not derived from any \u201carms-length employment, agreement\u201d between Debtor and his business.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, we find that the funds are not exempt \u201cearnings\u201d under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.11. <em>See Brock, </em>832 So.2d at 212; <em>In re Zamora, </em>187 B.R. at 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>B. <em>Res Judicata Applies to Debtor\u2019s Claim Regarding Trustee\u2019s Objections.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">Under the doctrine of res judicata, a claim is barred by prior litigation if: \u201c(1) there is a final judgment on the merits; (2) the decision was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) the parties, or those in privity with them, are identical in both suits; and (4) the same cause of action is involved in both cases.\u201d <em>Ragsdale v. Rubbermaid, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.1999). All of these requirements are met with respect to Debtor\u2019s claim that Trustee\u2019s objections were improper. First, this court dismissed \u2014 for want of prosecution \u2014 Debtor\u2019s appeal of the district court decision holding that Trustee\u2019s objections were proper. The dismissal was an adjudication on the merits. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b); <em>Bierman v. Tampa Elec. Co., </em>604 F.2d 929, 930 (5th Cir.1979) (per curiam).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, there is no dispute that this court had jurisdiction to dismiss the appeal. Finally, the same parties and cause of action were involved in the appeal. Therefore, Debtor\u2019s claim that Trustee\u2019s objections were improper is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">C. <em>The Bankruptcy Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion in Denying Debtor\u2019s Motion to Alter or Amend.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">We review a denial of a motion to alter or amend for abuse of discretion. <em>Arthur v. King, </em>500 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). A motion to alter or amend may only be granted if the mov-ant presents \u201cnewly-discovered evidence\u201d or shows \u201cmanifest errors of law or fact.\u201d <em>See In re Kellogg, </em>197 F.3d 1116, 1119 (11th Cir.1999). Such a motion cannot be used \u201cto relitigate old matters, raise argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\u201d <em>Michael Linet, Inc. v. Vill. of Wellington, </em>408 F.3d 757, 763 (11th Cir.2005). Debtor\u2019s motion to alter or amend did not rely on any newly-discovered evidence. In addition, the motion did not present a manifest error of law or fact. Instead, the motion repeated the same facts and arguments that debtor averred prior to the entry of judgment. Thus, the bankruptcy court properly denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-8\">. The Florida Supreme Court has yet to address whether proceeds from a debtor's business are exempt earnings under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.11. Thus, the state\u2019s appellate court decisions are controlling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b984-9\">. Debtor argues he received the funds pursuant to an \"arms-length employment agreement\u201d because the funds resulted from a contingency fee agreement he had with a client. But, such an agreement generates proceeds for a law practice as opposed to a set employee salary or wage. <em>See In re Zamora, </em>187 B.R. at 783, 785 (holding solo practitioner\u2019s contingency fees were not exempt under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.11).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b985-7\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
