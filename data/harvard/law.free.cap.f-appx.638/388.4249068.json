The district court also revoked Sagun-Villareal\u2019s supervised release on a prior conviction and imposed a consecutive sentence within the advisory range of 8 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">On appeal, Sagun-Villareal \u25a0 argues that the court committed procedural error by failing to articulate reasons for ordering that the sentences run consecutively. He also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that his revocation sentence should not have been imposed consecutively to the sentence for the new conviction. Finally, he challenges the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 in calculating his guidelines range because he asserts that the Guideline is not empirically based. We review these newly raised arguments for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Sagun-Villareal\u2019s claim that the district court failed to provide adequate reasons for imposing a consecutive revocation sentence is not supported by the record. The district court provided reasons, citing to Sagun-Villareal\u2019s criminal history. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c); <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 262 (5th Cir.2009). With regard to Sagun-Villareal\u2019s arguments that the two sentences combined to produce an unreasonable total prison term, this court has rejected similar arguments. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 808-09 (5th Cir.2008). Additionally, Sagun-Villareal\u2019s argument challenging the application of \u00a7 2L1.2 has been consistently rejected. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">Accordingly, the judgments of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
