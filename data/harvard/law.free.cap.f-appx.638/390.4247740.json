We review the denial of a motion for sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Appellant argues that the district court gave excessive weight to his criminal history and failed to consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. The record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as a whole and considered both the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the continuous nature of Appellant\u2019s criminal history and the danger that a reduced sentence would pose to the community. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(B)). The court was under no obligation to reduce his sentence, and Appellant has not demonstrated that the court abused its discretion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73 &amp; n. 11; <em>see also United States v. Duhon, </em>541 F.3d 391, 397 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
