Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we AFFIRM for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">After spending a decade working on the Space Shuttle program in Huntsville, Alabama, thermodynamics engineer Jos\u00e9 A. Rodriguez (\u201cRodriguez\u201d) decided he wanted to pursue a long-held interest in business. So in 1990, at the urging of a friend, Rodriguez formed and incorporated Rismed Oncology Systems, Inc. (\u201cRismed Oncology\u201d or \u201cRismed\u201d) to \u201csuppl[y] medical equipment to Latin America, principally Venezuela.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">A number of years later, sensing a demand from his customers for dialysis supplies, Rodriguez developed an expertise in the area and \u201cbegan marketing dialysis sales through\u201d Rismed Oncology. Over a five year span, from 1999 to 2004, Rodriguez made \u201cseveral attempts to break into the dialysis business in Venezuela[,]\u201d with the ultimate aim of becoming the sole supplier of dialysis products to the Instituto Venezolano de los Seguros Sociales (\u201cIVSS\u201d)\u2014the Venezuelan equivalent of the United States Social Security Administration. He eventually found success: IVSS placed an order with Rismed Oncology for over 350,000 dialysis kits, paying the corporation $13.7 million between March and August 2005. Sales representative Daniel Esgardo Rangel Baron (\u201cRangel Baron\u201d)\u2014the biological father of Rodriguez\u2019s stepson, the ex-husband of his wife, and a resident of Caracas\u2014was put in charge of the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">IVSS appeared satisfied with Rismed Oncology, as it placed a second order with the corporation, this time representing 100% of its dialysis supplies needs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But sometime in late 2005 and early 2006, Ran-gel Baron made a series of troubling representations to Rodriguez about the order: first, that the Venezuelan government was postponing it; second, that it \u201cwas \u2018being processed\u2019\u201d and should arrive \u201csometime during the fourth quarter of 2005\u201d; and finally, that it had been cancelled. Rather than proceed with Rismed, Rangel Baron informed Rodriguez that IVSS had decided to award the purchase order to \u201cContinental\u201d\u2014a medical supply company that Ran-gel Baron had allegedly formed with his biological son, Daniel Alberto Rangel Di Nardo (\u201cDaniel Rangel\u201d), whom Rodriguez had raised since Daniel was thirteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-16\">Or so Rangel Baron said. What actually happened, Rodriguez learned, was that Rangel Baron directed the incorporation of a number of companies in a number of locations, all called Rismed Dialysis Systems, Inc. Specifically, Rangel Baron and his sister, Isabel Rangel Baron, incorpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>rated a Rismed Dialysis Systems in Venezuela (\u201cRismed Dialysis Venezuela\u201d); Daniel Rangel incorporated a Rismed Dialysis Systems in Alabama (\u201cRismed Dialysis Alabama\u201d); Rangel Baron, under Daniel Rangel\u2019s name, incorporated a Rismed Dialysis Systems in Florida (\u201cRismed Dialysis Florida\u201d); and Rangel Baron and partner Orlando Araya Amador incorporated a Rismed Dialysis Systems in San Jose, Costa Rica (\u201cRismed Costa Rica\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The ramifications of Rangel Baron\u2019s creation of these Rismed Dialysis companies is two-fold. First, while Rodriguez had incorporated his company as Rismed Oncology and operated its oncology business under that name, he actually conducted Rismed\u2019s dialysis business under the trade name \u201cRismed Dialysis Systems.\u201d This trade name was emblazoned on all of Rismed\u2019s dialysis products, and it was the name by which Rismed\u2019s vendors knew the company. Second, when IVSS paid an invoice to Rismed Oncology, it simply made the payment out to \u201cRismed.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Given the above, it should come as no surprise that IVSS never cancelled its second order for dialysis supplies from Rismed Oncology, but \u201ccontinued to make purchase orders for the dialysis kits under the contract trade name \u2018RISMED,\u2019 \u201d and did so through at least February 2013. In short, if Plaintiffs allegations are accurate, Rangel Baron orchestrated a scheme whereby he usurped Rismed Oncology\u2019s contract with IVSS by utilizing the same products, supplies, and company name that had for years been used by Rismed. Ran-gel Baron concealed this scheme from Rodriguez and explained his new-found wealth by claiming that IVSS had can-celled its contract with Rismed Oncology and had awarded it instead to his father-son corporation, Continental. Rangel Baron fooled IVSS by convincing it to change the routing numbers for bank accounts to which it wired payments to those he established in connection with each Rismed Dialysis company he had formed. (He had previously failed to persuade IVSS to change the name of the contract award from Rismed Oncology to Continental.) And he pulled the wool over the eyes of Rismed\u2019s vendors by incorporating his companies under Rismed\u2019s trade name.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Thus, to the outside world it seemed that the only thing different about IVSS\u2019s subsequent orders was the routing information for payments. But really, Rangel Baron had siphoned away roughly $50 million worth of business from Rismed Oncology and Rodriguez: his employer and the man who had raised his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">Rodriguez learned of Rangel Baron\u2019s scheme in July 2012 and when seven months of \u201cefforts to avoid a lawsuit\u201d failed, he filed suit in the Northern District of Alabama on behalf of Rismed Oncology. The complaint alleged three federal RICO claims and two state law fraud claims against Rangel Baron; Isabel Ran-gel Baron; Rismed Dialysis Venezuela (the \u201cForeign Defendants\u201d); and Rismed Dialysis Alabama and Rismed Dialysis Florida (the \u201cDomestic Defendants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">Almost immediately after Rodriguez filed the lawsuit, he was contacted by a minister, Daniel Garlick (\u201cGarlick\u201d), with whom he and Daniel Rangel were close. Garlick impressed upon Rodriguez that litigation would be a treacherous path, detrimental to' his family and faith, and that instead he should engage in Christian mediation with Daniel Rangel to work through the dispute. Rodriguez agreed, and he and Garlick traveled to Miami to \u201cresolve the lawsuit and the underlying disagreements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>With Garlick acting as mediator, Rodriguez and Daniel Rangel ironed out their differences over the course of an extended lunch. Afterward, Garlick drafted a document that the parties refer to as the \u201cMiami Agreement[,]\u201d which outlined their basic obligations to one another. Generally, Rodriguez agreed to \u201c[i]rrevocably [c]lose[ ]\u201d Rismed\u2019s lawsuit and give Daniel Rangel an ownership interest in a side business, while Daniel Rangel agreed to provide capital to that company and to give Rodriguez an ownership position in his own side business. Both Rodriguez and Daniel Rangel signed the Miami Agreement on March 28, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Next, the parties\u2019 attorneys set to work drafting a settlement agreement. The document they created more or less provided that the parties would release any claims they may have had as a result of the IVSS imbroglio and that Rodriguez would transfer shares in his side business to Daniel Rangel. Notably, however, the Settlement Agreement did <em>not </em>incorporate every obligation outlined in the Miami Agreement. Despite being advised by his attorneys that the Settlement Agreement did not protect him to any meaningful degree and that he should not sign the document, Rodriguez did so anyway on April 3, 2013. So too did Daniel Rangel.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The next day, pursuant to Rodriguez\u2019s obligations under the Miami Agreement, Rismed Oncology filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss its complaint with prejudice, \u201cas a settlement ha[d] been reached in th[e] action.\u201d Four days later, Rismed filed a second motion to voluntarily dismiss its complaint with prejudice that was exactly the same as the first, except for the addition of one paragraph. That paragraph, in full, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-10\">[cjonsent [for a voluntary dismissal] has been obtained from the domestic parties[,] all of whom have been served in this matter. The foreign parties have not stated a position with regard to the dismissal (Rismed Dialysis Systems, C.A (Venezuela), Daniel Esgardo Ran-gel Baron, [and] Isabel Rangel Baron).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABQX\">The district court granted Rismed\u2019s motion on April 9, 2013. It noted that Rismed had served its complaint on the Domestic Defendants, who consented to the dismissal, but had not effected service on the Foreign Defendants, who \u201cha[d] not stated a position on the issue.\u201d Nevertheless, the court dismissed all claims, against all defendants, with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">Nearly eight months passed when, on November 22, 2013, Rismed Oncology filed a motion for relief from the above order, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 60(b)(3) and 60(b)(6).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rismed premised this motion upon newly-discovered \u201cfraud, misrepresentation, deceit[,] and illegality\u201d by which the Defendants obtained the Settlement Agreement, which agreement was the reason Rismed voluntarily dismissed its claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">Essentially, Rismed alleged that Daniel Rangel only negotiated, agreed to, and partially performed under the Settlement Agreement to \u201cbuy time\u201d to finalize and complete Rangel Baron\u2019s scheme and that he had no intention of fulfilling his end of the bargain. Specifically, Rismed claimed that Daniel Rangel engaged in this conduct to enable his mother, Liliana Di Nardo Rodriguez (\u201cDi Nardo\u201d)\u2014Rodriguez\u2019s wife at the time and Rangel Baron\u2019s ex-wife\u2014 to fraudulently transfer and sell two prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>erties that belonged to Rodriguez. Upon completion of these transfers, Di Nardo divorced Rodriguez and moved to Caracas to be with her ex-husband, Rangel Baron. Daniel Rangel cut off all communication with Rodriguez. Rismed claimed that given these actions, the Settlement Agreement and order dismissing its lawsuit should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">In a thorough order, the district court denied Rismed\u2019s motion. As to its Rule 60(b)(3) claims, the court found Rodriguez\u2019s reliance upon any fraud to be unreasonable, given that he was represented by counsel, understood the importance of the Miami Agreement, and deeply desired to resolve the dispute in order to repair familial relationships. As the court wrote: \u201c[i]n short, [Rodriguez] closed his eyes where ordinary diligence required him to see, and thereby was willingly deceived.\u201d With respect to the Rule 60(b)(6) claims, the court found them improperly classified, as they hinged upon fraudulent acts of Daniel Rangel and Di Nardo, and Rule 60(b)(6) \u201capplies only to conduct that does not fit within the first five clauses of Rule 60(b).\u201d Again, the court questioned Rodriguez\u2019s level of ignorance as to Daniel Ran-gel\u2019s and Di Nardo\u2019s actions and motivations.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Following the court\u2019s denial, Rismed filed two motions. The first was a lengthy motion for reconsideration, citing, among other things, (1) errors in the court\u2019s consideration of Di Nardo\u2019s fraudulent transfers and the role they played in the Settlement Agreement, (2) errors in the court\u2019s consideration of Garlick\u2019s role in Rodriguez\u2019s and Daniel Rangel\u2019s lives, and (3) the need for full discovery. The court granted this motion, allowing the parties a limited period of time to explore \u201cthe issue of whether [Rodriguez] was tricked or induced by fraud into executing the \u2018Settlement Agreement\u2019 that precipitated the dismissal of [Rismed\u2019s] action on April 9, 2013.\u201d Rismed\u2019s second motion noted that it had finally served the Foreign Defendants with process and asked the court to set aside its order of dismissal under Rule 60(b)(4), which Rismed now claimed was void since it addressed previously un-served parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Reconsideration of Rismed\u2019s motion, additional briefing, and \u201chundreds of pages of evidentiary materials\u201d did not change the court\u2019s mind. It still concluded that Rismed Oncology failed to produce \u201c \u2018clear and convincing evidence that an adverse party obtained [the dismissal of this action with prejudice] through fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct.\u2019 \u201d In particular, the court noted that Rodriguez had the support of counsel throughout the settlement process and understood that the settlement document had to reflect the Miami Agreement to retain its protections. Yet, Rodrigupz still chose to sign the Settlement Agreement and dismiss Rismed Oncology\u2019s action anyway because he \u201cgot [his] son and grand kids back[.]\u201d Thus, the court concluded, Rismed failed to show Rodriguez\u2019s reliance on \u201cthe alleged frauds that led to dismissal of [Rismed\u2019s] action\u201d was reasonable under the circumstances. The court did not address Rismed\u2019s 60(b)(4) motion, denying it as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Rismed later tried one final motion for reconsideration, but the court affirmed its earlier findings in a summary order. This appeal followed in December 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">We generally review a district court\u2019s denial of relief under Rule 60(b) for an abuse of discretion. <em>BUC Int\u2019l Corp. v. Int\u2019l Yacht Council Ltd., </em>517 F.3d 1271, 1275 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see, e.g., Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh Produce N.A., Inc., </em>741 F.3d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir.2014) (reviewing a 60(b)(6) ruling for abuse of discretion). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>\u201c \u2018A district court abuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard, applies the law in an unreasonable or incorrect manner, follows improper procedures in making a determination, or makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fed. Trade Comm\u2019n v. Nat\u2019l Urological Grp., Inc., 785 </em>F.3d 477, 481 (11th Cir.2015) (quoting <em>Citizens for Police Accountability Political Comm. v. Browning, 572 </em>F.3d 1213, 1216-17 (11th Cir.2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">A Rule 60(b)(4) ruling receives a more stringent review, however. Because the validity of a judgment or order is a question of law, \u201c \u2018[w]e review de novo ... a district court\u2019s ruling upon a Rule 60(b)(4) motion to set aside a judgment as void[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Baragona v. Kuwait Gulf Link Transp. Co., </em>594 F.3d 852, 854 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Burke v. Smith, 252 </em>F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">A. The District Court Did Not Err By Denying Rismed\u2019s Rule 60(b)(4) Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) provides a means by which a court can relieve a party from a void judgment or order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4); <em>see Burke, 252 </em>F.3d at 1263, When evaluating a Rule 60(b)(4) motion, the district court possesses no discretion: \u201cthe judgment is either void or it is not.\u201d <em>Burke, 252 </em>F.3d at 1267. The remedy for a void judgment or order is similarly limited\u2014the only relief available is for the court to set it aside. <em>Id. </em>\u201cGenerally, a judgment is void under Rule 60(b)(4) 'if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.\u2019\u201d <em>Burke, </em>252 F.3d at 1263 (quoting <em>In re Edwards, </em>962 F.2d 641, 644 (7th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">Regarding the order from which it seeks relief, Rismed Oncology argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-10\">[t]he claims against the Foreign Defendants could not have been dismissed with prejudice, because the [district court] lacked the authority to effect such a dismissal over the Foreign Defendants, as they were never served. Where service of process is insufficient, the [district court] has no power to render judgment, and the judgment is void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">Rismed further notes that the Foreign Defendants were not parties to the Miami Agreement or Settlement Agreement and never consented to nor presented a position on its motion for dismissal. Boiled down, Rismed\u2019s argument is that the district court could not dismiss the Foreign Defendants because they were neither served nor waived service. The court\u2019s order is therefore void, Rismed claims, and must be set aside. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">This Court has previously stated that' \u201c[generally, where service of process is insufficient, the court has no power to render judgment and the judgment is void.\u201d <em>In re Worldwide Web Sys., Inc., </em>328 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Varnes v. Local 91, Glass Bottle Blowers Ass\u2019n, </em>674 F.2d 1365, 1368 (11th Cir.1982) and <em>Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950)). That is so because insufficient service of process \u201cimplicates personal jurisdiction[,]\u201d and personal jurisdiction \u201c \u2018recognizes and protects an individual liberty interest. It represents a restriction on judicial power' not as a matter of sovereignty, but as a matter of individual liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, </em>456 U.S. 694, 701-03, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">Typically, insufficient service of process on a party operates to prohibit a court from entering a default judgment against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>that party. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 1298-1301 (affirming denial of motion to set aside default because defendant waived objection for insufficient service of process) and <em>Varnes, </em>674 F.2d at 1370 (reversing with directions to vacate default against party not properly served). This is true generally of personal jurisdiction, of which service of process is a subset. A court cannot enter a binding judgment against a party over which it lacks personal jurisdiction. <em>See McGee v. Int\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>355 U.S. 220, 222, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1957) (\u201cSince <em>Pennoyer v. Neff, </em>this Court has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment places some limit on the power of state courts to enter binding judgments against persons not served with process within their boundaries.\u201d) (internal citation omitted); <em>see generally Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. v. Mosseri, </em>736 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir.2013) (affirming denial of 60(b)(4) motion because defendant had sufficient minimum contacts) and <em>Baragona v. Kuwait Gulf Link Transp. Co., </em>594 F.3d 852 (11th Cir.2010) (affirming order vacating judgment for lack of service and minimum contacts).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Rismed Oncology believes these concepts should also extend to prohibit a court from entering an order <em>dismissing </em>claims against a defendant that has not been served. Yet Rismed cites no authority that supports such an application, nor can we find any. In contrast, dictum in <em>Vames </em>implies that a court may dismiss a complaint that was not properly served upon all the parties against which it was filed. 674 F.2d at 1370 (\u201cMoreover, the reason given for dismissal of the complaint against [the served party], if valid, also required dismissal of the complaint as to [the unserved party].\u201d). And in the context of the Prison Litigation Reform Act a district court may, \u201cprior to service of process,\u201d dismiss a complaint that is frivolous, malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such. <em>See, e.g., Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 324, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989) and <em>Caldwell v. Warden, FCI Talladega, </em>748 F.3d 1090, 1096 n. 11 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Further, Rismed\u2019s theory of service and personal jurisdiction conflicts with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(5), and would restrict a plaintiffs ability to dismiss its complaint under Rule 41(a)(2). That is, if a court could only dismiss claims asserted against a party over which it possessed jurisdiction, as Rismed suggests, it would lose the ability to grant a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction or insufficient service of process. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2), (5); <em>cf. PVC Windoors, Inc. v. Babbitbay Beach Constr., N.V., </em>598 F.3d 802 (11th Cir.2010) (affirming grant of motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction) and <em>Prewitt Enters., Inc. v. Org. of Petroleum Exporting Countries, </em>353 F.3d 916 (11th Cir.2003) (affirming grant of motion to dismiss for lack of service of process). And requiring that a court possess jurisdiction over a defendant in order to dismiss claims against that party would engraft an additional element onto Rule 41(a)(2), which permits a court to grant a plaintiffs motion to dismiss its complaint so long as no defendant has pled a counterclaim (or, if one has, so long as the counterclaim can \u201cremain pending for independent adjudication\u201d). Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2); <em>cf. Pontenberg v. Boston Scientific Corp., </em>252 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir.2001) (discussing Rule 41(a)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Finally, the order from which Rismed seeks relief is different in kind from the judgments for which this Court normally requires personal jurisdiction to exist. Here, the district court granted Rismed\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>motion to dismiss <em>its own complaint </em>with prejudice. The court\u2019s order concerns the unserved Foreign Defendants only insofar as it did away with the claims against them, but it does not <em>bind </em>the Foreign Defendants in the same manner as it does Rismed. Notably, until the court ordered them to respond to Rismed\u2019s motion for relief, no defendant had filed an answer, motion to dismiss, or counterclaim or otherwise made an appearance in the case. Thus, by dismissal of the suit against them, the Foreign Defendants lost nothing; to the contrary, their anxiety over litigation, if they had any, was eliminated. <em>Contra Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Office of Unemp\u2019t Compensation &amp; Placement, </em>326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945) (\u201cHistorically the jurisdiction of courts to render judgment in per-sonam is grounded on their de facto power over the defendant\u2019s person. Hence his presence within the territorial jurisdiction of [the] court was prerequisite to its rendition of a judgment personally binding him.\u201d) and <em>Pennoyer v. Neff, </em>95 U.S. 714, 729-34, 24 L.Ed. 565 (1877) (discussing \u201cthe force and effect of judgments rendered against non-residents without personal service of process upon them\u201d), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shaffer v. Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 97 S.Ct. 2569, 53 L.Ed.2d 683 (1977). In short, the district court did not err by denying Rismed Oncology\u2019s Rule 60(b)(4) claims, because its order was not void.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">B. The District Court Did Not Err By Denying Rismed\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Rule 60(b)(6) is a \u201ccatchall provision\u201d; it permits a court to \u201crelieve a party from a final judgment \u2018upon such terms as are just,\u2019 provided that the motion is made within a reasonable time and is not premised on one of the grounds for relief enumerated in clauses (b)(1) through (b)(5).\u201d <em>Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., </em>486 U.S. 847, 863 and n. 11, 108 S.Ct. 2194, 100 L.Ed.2d 855 (1988) (citing <em>Klapprott v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 601, 613, 69 S.Ct. 384, 93 L.Ed. 266 (1949) and 11 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Fed. Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2864 (1973)); <em>Cano v. Baker, </em>435 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Relief under Rule 60(b)(6) \u201c\u2018is an extraordinary remedy which may be invoked only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances[,]\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cabsent such relief, an extreme and unexpected hardship will result.\u201d <em>Crapp v. City of Miami Beach, </em>242 F.3d 1017, 1020 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Griffin v. Swim-Tech Corp., </em>722 F.2d 677, 680 (11th Cir.1984)); <em>Galbert v. </em>W. <em>Caribbean Airways, </em>715 F.3d 1290, 1294 (11th Cir.2013) (same). In other words, the movant \u201c \u2018must demonstrate a justification so compelling that the district court was required to vacate its order.\u2019 \u201d <em>Galbert, </em>715 F.3d at 1294 (quoting <em>Cano, </em>435 F.3d at 1342). However, even under exceptional circumstances, the decision to grant Rule 60(b)(6) relief is a matter for the court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 1294 (citing <em>Cano, </em>435 F.3d at 1342 and <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">Here, Rismed claims an entitlement to relief from the district court\u2019s order because <em>\u201cseveral </em>conflicts of interest [ ] existed between Garlick\u2019s role as facilitator (or mediator) and his relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>with [] Rangel, which extended not only through mediation, but the Settlement Agreement, and dismissal.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Specifically, Rismed notes that Garlick and Daniel Rangel engaged in a for-profit joint venture to sell \u201cBibles, Music, and Biblical Resources\u201d and that Daniel Rangel personally wired Garlick a total of $60,000 ($10,000 of which was a personal gift to help his sick child). Had Garlick disclosed this relationship, Rodriguez claims he would not have participated in the mediation and therefore would not have voluntarily dismissed Rismed\u2019s lawsuit. This bias and prejudice, Rismed believes, entitles it to relief under Rule 60(b)(6). Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">As noted, to obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6) a movant must demonstrate \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that will lead to \u201cextreme and unexpected hardship\u201d without court intervention. <em>Griffin, </em>722 F.2d at 680. The circumstances must be \u201cso compelling that the district court was required to vacate its order.\u201d <em>Galbert, </em>715 F.3d at 1294. The district court below did not abuse its discretion by concluding that Rismed has not identified such circumstances in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">First, Rodriguez claims he relied upon Garlick\u2019s advice and guidance when negotiating the Miami Agreement and Settlement Agreement with Daniel Rangel, and that Garlick led him astray because of the latter\u2019s undisclosed relationship with Ran-gel. However, Rodriguez was represented by counsel throughout the settlement process. Though Garlick \u201cfrequently told the parties to not use their attorneys, [Rodriguez] always used [his] attorney ... because [he] needed [his] attorney\u2019s assurance that the settlement agreement was drafted fair[ly] and accurately], and with the appropriate legal terms understood and accepted in the United States.\u201d Further, Rodriguez \u201crelied on [his] attorney for making all the changes to the [Settlement Agreement,]\u201d who did so \u201cbecause [ ] the initial [ ] agreement did not settle [the parties\u2019] disputes, but only dismissed [Rismed\u2019s] claims in the federal lawsuit.\u201d Nevertheless, despite his continued reliance on his attorneys, and in spite of being twice instructed by them <em>not </em>to sign the Settlement Agreement, Rodriguez did so anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Rodriguez argues that his decision to sign the Settlement Agreement resulted from Garlick\u2019s deception; that is, Garlick told him \u201cthe attorneys had worked into the night finalizing the legalities of the document\u201d and that it had \u201cbeen ... approved .,. and was ready for the parties\u2019 signatures.\u201d Assuming that Rodriguez was so swayed by this representation as to deviate from his practice of conferring with his attorneys and to sign the Agreement without their blessing, Rodriguez and his attorneys had six days from that point until the court granted Rismed\u2019s motion to read the document and confirm it accurately reflected the parties\u2019 agreement. Moreover, Rodriguez used the very same attorneys who warned him not to sign the Settlement Agreement to file <em>both </em>of Rismed\u2019s motions to voluntarily dismiss its case. So if Garlick did pressure or otherwise unduly influence Rodriguez into signing an unfinished Settlement Agreement that did not accurately reflect the parties\u2019 intent, Rodriguez had the opportunity to correct that error, and he failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">Second, even if Rodriguez <em>had </em>relied on Garlick\u2019s advice during the settlement negotiations, he was not unfamiliar with the minister and his connection to Daniel Ran-gel. At the time, Rodriguez had known Garlick for more than ten years and \u201cloved him like a brother.\u201d Garlick stayed at Rodriguez\u2019s home occasionally, and the latter approached the former for guidance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>when experiencing deep personal and family troubles. Further, Rodriguez had his own financial ties to Garliek, providing him with a credit card and making monetary donations to and for Garlick\u2019s ministry over the years\u2014including during the pen-dency of the lawsuit, settlement, and dismissal of Rismed\u2019s action. And Rodriguez encouraged Daniel Rangel to assist Garliek with his sick child and to consider business with the minister. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Related to this latter point, Rismed Oncology asserts that Garliek, as a Christian mediator, should be held to the same disclosure and recusal standards that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) and <em>Liljeberg, </em>486 U.S. 847, 108 S.Ct. 2194, impose upon \u201cjustice[s],. judge[s], [and] magistrate judge[s] of the .United States[.]\u201d In support, Rismed points to <em>CEATS, Inc. v. Cont\u2019l Airlines, Inc., </em>755 F.3d 1356 (Fed.Cir.2014). But in that case a district court ordered the parties before it to engage in mediation, and appointed a magistrate judge as mediator. <em>Id. </em>at 1358, Here, however, there is no suggestion the district court recommended, in any way, that the parties attempt to resolve their dispute through formal mediation, nor was Garliek a court-appointed mediator (let alone a federal justice, judge, or magistrate judge). Rather, Rodriguez and Daniel Rangel, of their own volition, resolved their dispute over a long lunch in Miami with their friend and minister, Garliek, whom they chose to act as facilitator. Rismed Oncology cites no authority that applies the \u00a7 455 and <em>Liljeberg </em>disclosure standards in such circumstances, nor can we find any.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Also, even though the <em>CEATS </em>court held that the mediator there should have disclosed his relationship to the parties involved in the litigation, it nevertheless affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of Rule 60(b) relief. <em>Id, </em>at 1358, 1361-67. Given the above, and even assuming Rodriguez\u2019s ignorance that Garliek might have felt more loyalty to Daniel than to Rodriguez, the <em>CEATS </em>holding provides no support for Rodriguez\u2019s position. In summary, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Rismed has not identified circumstances sufficiently extraordinary to warrant Rule 60(b)(6).. <em>See Liljeberg, </em>486 U.S. at 864, 108 S.Ct. 2194 (\u201cRule 60(b)(6) relief is accordingly neither categorically available nor categorically unavailable for all \u00a7 455(a) violations.\u201d); <em>compare Cano, </em>435 F.3d at 1341-42 (scientific developments and alterations to Supreme Court precedent were not sufficiently compelling justifications that district court was required to vacate its order).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying Rismed Oncology\u2019s request for relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-12\">. The following facts are taken from Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint and Motion to Set Aside the District Court\u2019s Order of Dismissal. We assume them to be true for purposes of our review here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-17\">. The initial order represented 25% of IVSS\u2019s dialysis supplies needs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b824-6\">. To pay invoices, IVSS would wire the funds to Rismed\u2019s bank account in Alabama.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b825-7\">. Before then, though, Rismed, Rodriguez, and two other companies filed suit in Alabama state court against a number of individuals, including Daniel Rangel, Rangel Baron, and Garlick, alleging various fraud claims. After hearing oral argument, the state court dismissed the action in a one paragraph order, which was not appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b829-7\">. We express no view on whether Rismed might be able to pursue an action against the Foreign Defendants. <em>Cf. Norfolk S. Corp. v. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., </em>371 F.3d 1285, 1289 (11th Cir.2004) (res judicata effect of dismissal based on settlement agreement is determined by the terms of the agreement \"as interpreted according to traditional principles of contract law\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
