The district court denied the motion because Delay\u2019s judgment of conviction explicitly stated that his federal sentence was to run consecutively to his state sentence and because the time Delay sought credit for had already been applied to his state sentence. We review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Free v. Miles, </em>333 F.3d 550, 552 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">A defendant is to be given credit toward his term of federal imprisonment for any time he spent in official detention prior to the commencement of his sentence \u201cthat has not been credited against another sentence\u201d and that was the result of either his federal offense or any other charge for which the defendant was arrested after the commission of his federal offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). There was no error in denying Delay prior-custody credit for time spent in state custody when that time had already been credited against his state sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3585(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
