We issued a certificate of appealability to address Williams\u2019s argument that \u201che was denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel when his counsel allegedly dozed or slept during a part of [his] trial.\u201d Because it was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law for the state trial court to conclude that Williams was not prejudiced by counsel \u201c[falling] asleep a couple of times\u201d-while the state replayed a recording of an interview that was cumulative to earlier testimony from the interviewee, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">We divide the discussion into three parts. First, we discuss Williams\u2019s indictment and his trial. Second, we discuss the unsuccessful state postconviction challenges filed by Williams. Third, we discuss the denial of Williams\u2019s federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">\n<em>A. Williams\u2019s Indictment and Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">When Austin Joseph Paine intercepted burglars in his home, they shot and killed him. Chad Michael Leon afterward overdosed on morphine and checked himself into a hospital, where he implicated himself, Williams, and Randy Carter Jr. in Paine\u2019s murder. Leon later showed officers where in the ocean he had discarded a revolver and a semiautomatic firearm used by Williams and Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-13\">A Florida grand jury indicted Williams, Carter, and Leon for first degree murder and for armed burglary. Leon pleaded guilty to the lesser crimes of second-degree murder and armed burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-14\">At trial, the state introduced testimony and forensic evidence that connected Williams to the crimes. Jarod Parrish testified that he introduced Williams to Carter and Leon and overheard the three men planning the burglary at a bar and at his house. Joshua Bartman testified that he saw Williams and Carter with a .38 caliber revolver and a nine millimeter semiautomatic handgun a few days before the murder. Carter\u2019s mother testified about renting a car for Carter, meeting Williams in Pennsylvania, Williams\u2019s relocation to the Carters\u2019 home, and Williams\u2019s exodus after the murder. Paine\u2019s girlfriend described how Paine bounded from bed after hearing the sound of glass breaking and a voice near a sliding door outside their bedroom, and then Rachel Vargas testified that she rented a hotel room on the night of the murder at the behest of Williams and Parrish with money that Williams provided. Leon testified about meetings with Williams and Carter; a botched attempt to burgle Paine\u2019s home; Williams\u2019s and Carter\u2019s admissions to shooting Paine; his role as the getaway driver; his disposal of Williams\u2019s revolver and Carter\u2019s semiautomatic handgun; and his interview with Mike Spadafora, an agent of the Brevard County Sheriffs Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-15\">Defense counsel questioned every witness. Counsel cross-examined Parrish and Paine\u2019s girlfriend about inconsistencies in their testimonies, and counsel elicited from Carter\u2019s mother that Williams planned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>return to Pennsylvania before the murder occurred and from Vargas that she never heard Williams or his cohorts discuss a burglary before asking her to rent the hotel room. Defense counsel objected repeatedly to Bartman\u2019s and Leon\u2019s testimonies, and the trial court allowed defense counsel to question Leon outside the presence of the jury before allowing him to testify about his conversations with Parrish.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Agent Spadafora authenticated the recording of Leon\u2019s interview and the state offered the recording as a prior consistent statement. Defense counsel objected and requested that the trial court examine the recording and allow him to question Leon without the jury present, but counsel later withdrew the objection. When questioned, Williams verified that he agreed with counsel\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">The prosecutor played the recording of Leon\u2019s interview, which consumed about 71 pages of the trial transcript. When the state turned on the audiotape, defense counsel complained that he couldn\u2019t \u201chear it over here.\u201d After the recording ended, defense counsel immediately cross-examined Agent Spadafora. The prosecutor requested a five minute break and defense counsel interjected, \u201cI need to take a break; I fell asleep a couple of times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">The state introduced testimony from its experts and a second agent of the Brevard County Sheriffs Office. A forensic expert testified about discovering Paine\u2019s DNA on the armrest, inside the driver\u2019s door, and on a seatbelt in the back of the rental vehicle. On cross-examination, the forensic expert acknowledged that he had excluded Williams as a contributor of the DNA found in Paine\u2019s fingernail clippings. After a latent print expert testified about matching Williams\u2019s left palm print and thumb print to a handprint discovered on the hood of the rental vehicle, defense counsel elicited from the expert that she had compared the handprint to only four samples. A firearms expert testified that a bullet discovered in the rental car matched ammunition that could be used in a nine millimeter pistol and that two of the three bullets extracted from Paine were fired from the same gun, and on cross-examination, the expert acknowledged that it was common to find bullets with similar class characteristics in semiautomatic weapons and revolvers and that she could not determine whether the bullets extracted from Paine were shot from the same clip. Over defense counsel\u2019s objections, Agent Gary Harrell testified that he interviewed Carter and Leon and that Leon admitted to driving the getaway car and discarding the murder weapons. On cross-examination, Agent Harrell acknowledged that Carter did not implicate Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">Defense counsel argued about inconsistencies in the evidence. Defense counsel recalled Leon and identified discrepancies in the statements that he made to different officers. And during closing statements, defense counsel argued that Leon\u2019s statements conflicted with the forensic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">The jury found Williams guilty of first degree felony murder and armed burglary of a dwelling. Later, the trial court sentenced Williams to imprisonment for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">\u2022 Williams, assisted by new counsel, argued on direct appeal that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress. The Fifth District Court of Appeal affirmed Williams\u2019s conviction and certified a question involving the right to counsel during interrogation to the Supreme Court of Florida. <em>Williams v. State, </em>38 So.3d 188, 190-94 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2010). That court \u201cdecline[d] to exercise [its] jurisdiction\u201d and denied summarily Williams\u2019s petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>for review. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>39 So.3d 1266 (Fla.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">\n<em>B. Williams\u2019s Unsuccessful State Postconviction Filings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Williams petitioned a state appellate court to issue a writ of habeas corpus. Williams argued that his appellate counsel should have argued that trial counsel was ineffective for falling asleep during the trial. The Fifth District Court denied Williams\u2019s petition summarily. <em>Williams v. State, </em>No. 5D11-787 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. June 1, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">Williams next moved for state postcon-viction relief, in part, based on the same claim of ineffectiveness of trial counsel. <em>See </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850. The trial court denied Williams relief under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Although defense counsel had \u201cremark[ed] on the record that he had fallen asleep,\u201d the trial court found that \u201cjust two pages earlier .. .\u2022 he [had been] actively cross-examining a State\u2019s witness.\u201d After a careful examination of the trial transcript, the trial court found \u201cit [was] clear that throughout the entire trial, defense counsel actively and vigorously cross-examined each of the State\u2019s witnesses, asking questions relevant to the testimony they had just offered,\u201d \u201c[h]e interjected appropriate objections, [and] he seemed to be actively engaged in the entire process.\u201d Because Williams did not \u201cpoint to any specific portion of the trial or any specific piece of testimony or evidence that counsel overlooked as the result of his alleged sleeping,\u201d the trial court ruled that Williams \u201cfail[ed] to allege or demonstrate prejudice on [his] claim.\u201d The state appellate court affirmed without opinion. <em>Williams v. State, </em>90 So.3d 304 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">\n<em>C. Williams\u2019s Federal Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">Williams filed in the district court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and argued that he was denied the assistance of counsel because he was \u201csleeping through the trial.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court determined that <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984), did not control the analysis of Williams\u2019s claim because the record did not reflect that \u201ccounsel slept through a substantial portion of the trial.\u201d And the state court did not apply <em>Strickland </em>unreasonably, the district court ruled, because Williams \u201cha[d] not shown that counsel\u2019s actions resulted in prejudice.\u201d The district court based its decision on factual findings that, \u201cAlthough defense counsel indicated that he fell asleep for a portion of the time period during which the taped statement was played,\u201d Williams failed to \u201cpoint to any other instance of counsel sleeping during the trial,\u201d and that a \u201creview[] [of] the entire record\u201d revealed that \u201cdefense counsel appeared] to have been alert during trial, properly responded] to objections and questions, and cross-examin[ed] each witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus that alleges ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Williamson v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>805 F.3d 1009, 1016 (11th Cir.2015). A petitioner is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus only if the state court reached a decision that was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). A state court makes an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law if the court \u201cidentifies the correct governing legal principle from [the] decisions [of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>Supreme Court] but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of petitioner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 520, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 2534-35, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (internal quotations and citation omitted). To establish an unreasonable application of federal law, a petitioner \u201cmust show that the state court\u2019s ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 103, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-87, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Williams maintains that he is entitled to habeas corpus relief. Defense counsel\u2019s admission that he fell asleep twice while the jury listened to Leon\u2019s interview, Williams argues, constituted a denial of counsel and was prejudicial per se under <em>Cronic. </em>Because the state court reasonably evaluated Williams\u2019s claim under <em>Strickland </em>and Williams does not argue that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s conduct, we affirm the denial of Williams\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">Williams failed to establish that the state court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law. \u201c[C]learly established Federal law for purposes of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) includes only the holdings ... of [the Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions.\u201d <em>Woods v. Donald, </em>575 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1372, 1376, 191 L.Ed.2d 464 (2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Supreme Court has not addressed whether the rule in <em>Cronic </em>applies if counsel dozes twice while a recording of an interview that is cumulative of earlier testimony and unobjectionable is played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">Williams cannot establish that the refusal of the state court to apply <em>Cronic </em>to his claim of ineffective assistance \u201cwas so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fair-minded disagreement,\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at 103, 131 S.Ct. at 786-87. A defendant is entitled to a presumption of prejudice if defense counsel\u2019s conduct resulted in a \u201ccomplete denial of counsel ... at a critical stage\u201d of trial or an \u201centire[] failure] to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing,\u201d <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 659-60, 104 S.Ct. at 2047. The Supreme Court has held that <em>Strickland, </em>not <em>Cronic, </em>applies when \u201ccounsel failed to oppose the prosecution ... [only] at specific points.\u201d <em>Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 697, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1851, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002). And the Supreme Court in <em>Woods </em>held that it was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law for a state court to apply <em>Strickland </em>to a claim involving the absence of defense counsel from the courtroom for ten minutes while government witnesses testified about other defendants. <em>Woods, </em>135 S.Ct. at 1377-78. In the absence of controlling precedent, fairminded jurists could disagree about whether a defendant is entitled to a presumption of prejudice because defense counsel, who was otherwise actively engaged in the trial, \u201cfell asleep a couple of times\u201d while the jury listened to a recorded interview that was cumulative to testimony earlier provided by the interviewee.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">Williams has abandoned any challenge that he could have made to the determination that he was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s conduct. The state court ruled that Williams failed to \u201cdemonstrate prejudice,\u201d <em>see Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, and Williams makes no argument about that ruling. Because \u201c[i]ssues not clearly raised in the briefs are considered abandoned,\u201d <em>Marek v. Singletary, </em>62 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>1295, 1298 n. 2 (11th Cir.1995), we need not address whether Williams was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s sleeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">We AFFIRM the denial of Williams\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
