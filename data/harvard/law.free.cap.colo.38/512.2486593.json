Moss and the defendants, Moffat and Ross-Lewin, in order to protect the sheriff in levying this writ, executed and delivered to him an indemnity bond. Plaintiff intervened in the attachment suit, claiming to be the owner of the merchandise attached, and also claiming damages resulting from the attachment- and seizure of the merchan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>dise. He was adjudged to be the owner of this merchandise, but was denied damages, because not properly pleaded. Thereafter he received the merchandise in satisfaction of the judgment rendered in his favor, and subsequently commenced this action to recover damages resulting from the attachment other than for the value of the merchandise attached.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b537-5\">Chief Justice G-abbebt</author>\n<p id=\"Aol\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s right of action was grounded upon the assumption that defendants and Moss were joint tort-feasors. His cause of action in the intervention proceedings was identical with that in the action under consideration. The injury occasioned by the attachment was an entirety, and the damages resulting therefrom could not be apportioned among the several wrong-doers, nor divided into separate demands. The satisfaction of the judgment against Moss was a bar to the action against the defendants, for the reason that the law allows but one satisfaction for the same wrong, and the satisfaction of a judgment against one of several joint tort-feasors, bars an action against the others. \u2014 2 Van Fleet\u2019s Former Adjudications, \u00a7531; <em>Westbrook v.
