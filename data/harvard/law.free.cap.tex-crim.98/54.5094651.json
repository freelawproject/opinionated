They all testified supporting the State\u2019s case. The bill thus reveals that there were none present who could have denied the sale save the appellant. The remark apparently cannot be characterized other than as an indirect reference to the failure of the appellant to take the stand and deny the sale. He contented himself upon the trial with the cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses and by the introduction of other witnesses by whose testimony he sought to raise a reasonable doubt as to the truth of the testimony given against him. The statute, Art. 790, C. C. P., which declares that \u201cthe failure of any defendant to so testify shall not be taken as a circumstance against him, nor shall the same be alluded to or commented on by counsel in the cause,\u201d as well as the statutes on the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt, vested in the appellant the right to have the jury determine whether he was guilty or innocent without reference, either direct or indirect, to his failure to give evidence in his own behalf. The language used in the present case is in no sense different in its effect from that which has been held violative of the statute on many-occasions. See Adams v. State, 87 Texas Crim. Rep., 67. If the record was in a condition to show that there were persons present at the time the alleged sale was made who did not testify, the remarks of counsel would not necessarily imply a comment upon the failure of the appellant to give evidence. Boone v. State, 90 Texas Crim. Rep., 374; Pickerell v. State, 82 Texas Crim. Rep., 68; Ethridge v. State, 74 Texas Crim. Rep., 635. But on the present record, there was no one present at the trial who failed to take the witness-stand who was present at the time the alleged sale took place save the appellant. Therefore, the jury, looking to the evidence, might have sought in vain for any person who might have made the denial save the appellant. It has often been said that the statute is mandatory and its obedience imperative. When counsel has transgressed it and the matter is brought before this court for review, its duty is clear and the responsibility of a reversal must rest upon the prosecution. Haley v. State, 84 Texas Crim. Rep., 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
