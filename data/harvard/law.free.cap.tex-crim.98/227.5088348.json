The count submitted to the jury charged the accused in sufficient form with the offense of manufacturing spirituous liquor capable of producing intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The indictment was returned into court on the 9th of February, 1924, and on. the 12th of the same month appellant was arrested and made bond. The case was tried on March 20th thereafter. On March 17th appellant procured the issuance of subpoenas for a number of witnesses who lived outside of Dallas County. On account of the failure of service of said process upon the witnesses and their consequent absence a motion for continuance was made by the accused. The facts stated above fall short of the diligence which would.be required in order to call for favorable action.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Appellant\u2019s bills of exception Nos. 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 complain of the reception of evidence. The materiality of the errors complained of cannot appear to us in the absence .of a statement of facts. Bill of exceptions No. 11 discloses complaint of the refusal of the court to retire the jury while appellant made a motion for a peremptory instruction of not guilty. The court qualifies said bill by the statement that courisel could have presented his motion for an instructed verdict in writing if he did not want the jury to hear what was said, and that as soon as the court understood appellant\u2019s motion. he promptly overruled it. We observe no error in the action of the trial court, nor what was said by him in the presence of the jury. Complaint of the insufficiency of the evidence cannot be considered by us in view of the absence of a statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
