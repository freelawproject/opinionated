See Crowley v. State, 242 S. W. Rep., 472;Stringer v. State, 241 S. W., 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">According to the State\u2019s evidence, ,appellant .manufactured the whisky. We have discerned no testimony requiring that the intoxicating character of the liquor be submitted in a more specific manner than was done by the court\u2019s charge. No. affirmative testimony is observed to the effect that the liquor manufactured by the appellant was other than intoxicating. It was appellant\u2019s theory that he was preparing to make whisky for medicinal purposes, while that of the State was that whisky had been manufactured by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">There was no error in refusing to instruct the jury to disregard the testimony showing that the appellant was in possession of a large quantity of mash. This was a circumstance available to the State upon the issue presented by the pleading; nor was there error in refusing to instruct the jury that \u201cunless the still was connected by the appellant\u201d an acquittal must result. ' This was a detail which the court was not required to single out for an instruction to the jury. The circumstances surrounding the transaction \u00e1re sufficient to show that the appellant was engaged in the manufacture of whisky, whether he did the physical act of connecting the still or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">It appears that the appellant\u2019s attorney, in -argument, stated to the jury that it would be a shame to send the appellant, who had a wife and four small children, to the penitentiary on the testimony in the case. In reply, State\u2019s counsel said that \u201cthe jury had the right .of other women and children besides that of the defendant\u2019s wife and children to protect, and should consider why defendant should so disregard his obligations to his wife as to make stuff to be distributed over the country to other women and children to wreck and corrupt their morals.\u201d It would be better for both counsel for the appellant. ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>and the State, to confine their discussion within legitimate bounds. There is some question whether we should consider the qualification to the bill. Whether justified or not, the argument of State\u2019s counsel, considered in the light of the argument of appellant\u2019s counsel, the evidence and the verdict, is not of such a nature as to' warrant a reversal. The evidence is sufficient to establish the offense and to connect the appellant with it. The punishment was the lowest permitted by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The fact that the officers did not exhibit a search-warrant would not preclude them from 'testifying to facts which they discovered upon the appellant\u2019s premises. It seems, however, that they did act under search-warrant. The case of Welchek v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep., 271, is in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">AVe think there is no prejudicial error shown by the bill complaining of the fact that one of appellant\u2019s witnesses was asked \u201cif it was not pretty bold to put a still so close to a church.\u201d The surrounding facts are not revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The fact that appellant inquired of the witness Amerson touching the method of making whisky and stating that he intended to make some for medicinal purposes was properly excluded as hearsay. No facts are revealed which would bring it within any of the exceptions to the rule excluding self-serving or hearsay testimony. The proof that there was a still upon the premises was relevant upon the issues involved. The court instructed the jury that the possession of the still was not an offense. It was, however, a circumstance available to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The witness Cooper testified that he observed beer and mash upon the appellant\u2019s premises ready for.distillation; that he did not drink it; that it was stronger than four per cent beer'; that he saw what was in the pot at the still that day; that it was mash used for making whisky. The bill is meagre, but the facts stated warranted the court in permitting the witness to testify that the article was intoxicating.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Appellant complains in Bill of Exceptions No. 11, that the court erred in refusing to grant a new trial in order that he might have the benefit of the testimony of I. L. Hays on the former trial, \u201csuch testimony being very material as it appears by the affidavits by J. P. AVillson and J. M. Keith.\u201d AVhat was in these affidavits is not shown by the bill of exceptions, which was filed October 10, 1923, subsequent to the term of court at which the trial took place which adjourned on July 14th. Attached to the motion for new trial are the affidavits of AVillson and Keith to the effect that Hays had testified on the former trial that it was he who connected the still, and that when he arrived the still was not connected. These affidavits give no information touching the reason for the absence of this tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>timony, if it was material. Moreover, the order of the court in overruling the motion for new trial states that he heard evidence thereon, and in this case of the record the presumption obtains that the evidence heard was contradictory of the affidavits to a degree which supports the ruling of the court on the issue of fact raised by them. Cade v. State, 258 S. W. Rep., 484; Harcrow v. State, No. 8069, recently decided. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b307-7\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AJr\">\u2014 Appellant insists that the testimony does not show that the officers found intoxicating liquor at the still on the occasion of their raid. We quote from the testimony. Ben Chapman testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">\u201cThere was some whisky there. There was some stuff in the pot and a fire under the pot. They had.some whisky there in a fruit jar * * * I saw some whisky there. * * * Mr. Cooper had the whisky out there at the still when I saw it first. I don\u2019t know where Mr. Cooper got the whisky. I don\u2019t know whether it was made by that still or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Mr. Cooper said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">\u201cThey had a complete outfit out here. It was fired up and the still was running whisky in a fruit jar. * * * I saw the whisky running out in a very small stream. I know it was whisky.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Witness Hays testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-13\">\u201cI found that still set up and in operation, a fire was under it and mash in the pot and it was running. I saw a jar sitting under the mouth of the flake stand and a fire under the pot. Directly Mark (appellant) came around and disconnected it and I went back and put it up again and Mark said: \u2018Now, you are making whisky and not me.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-14\">This evidence satisfactorily shows not only the presence of whisky but its manufacture. This court held in many cases that whisky is intoxicating liquor. We are still of the opinion that the finding of another still near the place where appellant was operating one, was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-15\">Appellant complains that we erred in stating that the trial court heard evidence at the time he overruled the motion for new trial. We quote from the order overruling the motion for new trial: \u201cThe court having heard said motion, and the evidence thereon submitted, is of the opinion that the same should be overruled.\u201d We have again reviewed the testimony and regret our inability to agree with appellant\u2019s contention that it was not sufficient to justify the conclusion of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-16\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-17\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
