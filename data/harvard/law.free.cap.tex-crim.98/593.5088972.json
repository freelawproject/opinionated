The only complaint appears to be that evidenced by appellant\u2019s motion for new trial in which he asserts upon his oath that an agreement claimed to have been made between his counsel and that of the State under which it was admitted that the owner of the alleged burglarized premises, if present, would testify that he did not give appellant permission to enter his house or take therefrom property belonging to him, \u2014 was made without his consent. It appears from the record that the State controverted this claim of the appellant and in the affidavit of the county attorney constituting the traverse it is stated that an agreement to the above effect was entered into between appellant\u2019s counsel and the county attorney prior to the beginning of the trial. It is also stated that after the trial was begun when the State\u2019s attorney offered to state to the jury what the testimony of the absent witness would be, according to the agreement referred to, that some dispute arose over the agreement, and he, the county attorney, stated that if the agreement was not honored and the testimony permitted, the State would have to withdraw its announcement of rea_dy, whereupon appellant\u2019s counsel, in the presence and hearing of appellant, stated that the defendant would admit that neither the prosecuting witness nor anyone else gave to defendant permission or consent to enter the burglarized premises or take the property in question; that at the time this statement was made by appellant\u2019s counsel he was within five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>feet of appellant in the court room - and that appellant heard all that was said and saw all that was done and made no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">These matters were primarily for the learned trial judge, and having been heard and acted upon by him, are deemed by us to present no matter calling for our review.
