The State witnesses went at once to the place and found, as they testified, broken fruit jars and sacks from which whisky was dripping and running. The witnesses testified that the liquid which had been in the containers was whisky. Appellant testified that he and Roy Braclcin. went out in a car with Bert Morganson on the occasion in question to a point near where the officers later arrested him. There they left the car and went down in the woods and found two sacks. They picked up the sacks and started to go back over to the car and saw the officers coming, and that Roy hit his sack against a tree and told appellant to hit his, which he did. He averred that he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>know what was in the sacks. We think the facts sufficiently supported the conclusion of the jury that appellant and his companion transported intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">There is a bill of exceptions complaining of the action of the court in permitting the State\u2019s attorney to ask a witness, referring to appellant and Brackin, \u201cDid they have any packages,\u201d to which the witness answered, \u201cThey had a sack apiece on their shoulders.\u201d We arc' unable to perceive how this question was leading, or how it referred to a matter that was either immaterial or irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Another bill complains that one of said witnesses, who was asked by the State\u2019s attorney if appellant and Brackin hit the sacks against a tree, replied \u201cThe whisky, yes.\u201d We see no reasonable ground for objecting to this upon the proposition that the-answer was not responsive. The witness had testified that the sacks contained whisky. By another bill of exceptions complaint is made that a witness testified that when he went up to where the sacks had been struck against a tree he smelled something that smelled like whisky.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Being of opinion that the record does not evidence any error in the trial of the case, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
