The assault is alleged to have been made upon one of his pupils, a small girl ten years old. The facts are so revolting in their nature and detail a crime so unnatural that we can see no good purpose in stating the evidence at length. It is amply sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"A25\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>IBe assaraali 5b sHegEcl ta have ceenrred on the 3d day of February. Cbmplamrat \u00ae\u00aed iofezmiatiarn! were made and. filed on the 5th; on the ame day the eases was set down for trial on February 8th and appellant m mmtiiEecL \"Opon gaffing the ease for trial his attorney requested that appellant he famished \u25a0with, a copy of the information and that he have two days: in -which to prepare for trial. The court appeared tm he under the impression that in misdemeanor eases the law did not require that an aecosed be furnished with a copy of the charges: against Mm amcl the request was denied. From the bill and the: court\u2019s esplanaation in connection therewith it appears that on. Februairy 5th appellant was brought into open court and the complaint and information read to him by the county attorney, and Ms; case set for February 8th; that at this time the judge asked appellant if he had employed counsel to which he replied that his wife: was: attracting to that for him and that he understood she had seen Mr:. T. B. Bidgell,, an attorney, relative to defending him. When the case was called on February 8th, the judge asked appellant if he was represented by counsel and he replied that he thought his wife had employed Ur. Bidgell who at that time was in the rear of the courtroom, talking with appellant\u2019s wife. Under the direction of the court appellant went to where his wife and attorney were \u00a1engaged in. conversation and in a few minutes returned and told the court that he dicl not have counsel and requested the court to appoint one for him. However, a few minutes later .Mr. Bidgell appeared at the bar and informed the court that he would represent the defendant and at that time made the demand for copy of the charges- The alleged error for failure to furnish a copy of the charges was carried forward in the motion for new trial. The State, 'through its county attorney, filed a sworn contraversion of that ground of the motion. In his sworn answer the county attorney asserts that he notified appellant on February 3d of the\" proposed charges wMch were to be filed against him but delayed the actual filing thereof until the 5th of February in order to give appellant an opportunity if he desired, to go before the grand jury which was then in session; that on February 5th attorney BidgeH conferred with the county attorney relative to the case against appellant, but when advised as to the nature of same expressed a disinclination to represent a party charged with that sort of crime; that later upon the same day, said attorney was advised that complaint and information had been filed and that the ease had been set for trial for February 8th; that said attorney at that time and at numerous times between the 5th and 8th conferred with the county attorney with regard to the case attempting to get some kind of agreement relative to the punishment in the event appellant would plead guilty, to which the State declined to agree; that attorney Bidgell told the county attorney that he had talked to appellant\u2019s wife about his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>case and that appellant\u2019s wife conferred with attorney Bidgell many time before the trial with reference to it; that on the day before the trial the county attorney asked Ridgell if he was going to represent appellant and was told at that time that he thought so; that on the day the complaint and information were filed the county attorney discussed with attorney Ridgell the advisibility of making copies of the complaint and information to be furnished appellant and that attorney Ridgell at that time expressed the view that it was not necessary to do so in misdemeanor cases.'</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Article 554, C. C. P. reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">\u201cIn misdemeanors, it shall not be necessary before trial to furnish the defendant with a copy of the indictment or information; but he or his counsel may demand a copy, which shall be given at as early a day as possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">In its language the foregoing provision is quite similar to the one immediately preceding it relating to the right of a defendant on bail in felony cases to demand a copy of the charges against him, and both are intended to make effective section ten of the Bill of Rights wherein it is declared that an accused \u201cshall have the right to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and to have a copy thereof. \u2019 \u2019 The purpose of these provisions is to guard against bringing one to trial in ignorance of the charges against him Avithout opportunity to prepare his defense. No such condition existed in the present instance. Both appellant and his counsel were apprised of the charges. While jealous in demanding compliance with the Constitution and Statutes in the respect mentioned this court has recognized that the right to demand a copy of the charges might be waived. Rice v. State, 49 Texas Crim. Rep., 569, 94 S. W. 1024; Keener v. State, 51 Texas Crim. Rep., 590, 103 S. W. 904; Fletcher v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 193, 39 S. W. 116; Butler v. State, 38 S. W. 787; Wray v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep., 632, 232 S. W. 808; McDuff v. State, 4 Texas Crim. App., 61. In Keener\u2019s case (supra) is found this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">\u201cLet it be conceded that the statute is mandatory in terms, still it must receive a reasonable construction so as to protect appellant\u2019s rights, while at the same time not obstructing or delaying trials. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">The record leaves no doubt that from the time charges Avere filed against appellant Mr. Ridgell was acting in his behalf; while hesitating to represent him in the trial this appears to have been because of the nature of the case, but the attorney was in consultation Avith appellant\u2019s wife relative to his case and repeatedly made efforts to secure some agreement with the county attorney in appellant\u2019s interest, and during this time expressed the opinion that no necessity existed to furnish appellant with a copy of the information. We believe the facts presented are such that we do no violence to the law in reaching the conclusion that a copy was waived. The nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the charges were well known, and we presume appellant was ready for trial as no continuance was requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\">The point is made that no reference in the bill being made to the sworn statement of the county attorney relative to his conferences with Mr. Ridgell it should be regarded simply as an ex parte affidavit and ignored by us in passing upon the question of waiver. To this we do riot agree. When appellant urged as a ground for new trial the alleged error in not furnishing him with a copy of the information the State controverted that ground of the motion by the sworn answer of the county attorney setting up facts constituting the waiver, which facts were within the county attorney\u2019s own knowledge. The controverting answer was on file at the time the motion was acted on. In considering it we are in accord with the holdings in Cade v. State, 96 Texas Crim. Rep., 523, 258 S. W., 484; Harcrow v. State (No. 8069, opinion April 9, 1924). Prom the latter case we copy this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-4\">\u201cWhen proper affidavits are attached to motions for new trial, in support of matters therein relied on which would be otherwise aside from the record, or are attached to written traverse of such motions, if it does not appear from either the order of the trial court on such motion, or from bill of exceptions, or statement of facts filed during the term, that <em>evidence was heard </em>by the court below, then our conclusion will be that the trial court did consider such affidavits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">No affidavit was attached to the traverse of the motion in the present case, but the traverse itself was an affidavit made by one cognizant of the facts. The order of the court overruling the motion does not recite that <em>evidence was heard thereon, </em>hence we are directly in line in concluding that the controverting answer was considered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The objections to the charge of the court can not be considered. Bills of exception one and three,' bringing the matter forward, nowhere state that exceptions to the charge were filed in <em>writing. </em>It is necessary that this be shown before objections thereto can be considered. Article 735, C. C. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Bill of exception number two complained that the court erred in permitting the county attorney to read to the jury the complaint upon which the information was based, the objection being upon the ground that the affidavit was the hearsay statement of the affiant who signed the same. We do not discuss the matter because the qualification to the bill makes it unnecessary. It is certified by the judge that the complaint was first read and that the objection came to the reading of the information, so it would appear that no objection was lodged to the reading of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">There are a number of bills of exception in the record other than those heretofore mentioned, all of which we have carefully examined. One of them is entirely in question and answer form and for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>reason can not be considered. Many authorities upon this point will be found collated in Reese <em>v. </em>State, 94 Texas Crim. Rep., 220, 249 S. W., 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The other bills either within themselves present no error, or such as might appear therefrom become non-av'ailable in view of the explanation attached by the learned trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Finding no error in the record which would demand a reversal of the judgment, an affirmance is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
