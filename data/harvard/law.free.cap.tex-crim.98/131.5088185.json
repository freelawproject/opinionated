It charged swindling by the giving and drawing of a check, with an allegation that appellant, who was the drawer of the check, had no funds in the bank to pay the same, and had no good reason to believe that the check would be paid, etc. We have examined' the authorities cited by appellant and have been unable to see their application to the present case. We do not detect any vice in the information. It appears to sufficiently charge an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\">The motion for rehearing in overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
