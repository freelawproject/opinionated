Appellant insists that the statement of facts is silent upon the subject of the races of the parties. In the brief of the State this is not controverted, and in our examination of the statement of facts we fail to find any evidence upon the subject. The necessity of such proof is obvious. In the absence thereof, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded. Such is the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
