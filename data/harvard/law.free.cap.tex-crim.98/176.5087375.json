The eighty days expired on the 25th day of September. On October 3d application was made and granted, allowing fifteen days additional time in which to file bills of exception and statement of facts. Three bills appear in the record, all bearing file mark of date October 3d. None of them can be considered. A bill of exception filed after the original time allowed by the court, no order of extension having been made within the original time' allowed, is filed too late. Palmer v. State, 92 Tex. Crim. Rep., 640, 245, S. W., 238; Griffin v. State, 59 Tex. Crim. Rep., 424; Fusion v. State, 94 Texas Crim. Rep., 467, 251 S. W., 1076.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-16\">We had examined the bills of exception before observing that the State\u2019s brief called attention to the fact that they had been filed too late, arid even if they could be considered we are of opinion no error is presented in any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-17\">The judgment is. affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-18\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
