According to an affidavit filed by respondent, which has not been refuted by petitioner, subsequent to the trial, his conviction for making and possessing counterfeit securities was set aside and he was sentenced to a term of 36 months in prison on the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Judiciary Law \u00a7 90 (4) (d) defines \u201cserious crime\u201d, in pertinent part, as \u201cany criminal offense denominated a felony under the laws of any state, district or territory of the United States which does not constitute a felony under the laws of this state\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Section 603.12 (b) of the Rules of this Court states, in pertinent part, \u201cThe term \u2018serious crime\u2019 shall include any felony, not resulting in automatic disbarment under the provisions of subdivision 4 of section 90 of the Judiciary Law\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">We find that the crime of which respondent has been convicted, i.e., submitting false tax returns in violation of 26 USC \u00a7 7206 (1), which is a felony under the United States Code, is a \u201cserious crime\u201d within the meaning of Judiciary Law \u00a7 90 (4) (d) and section 603.12 (b) of the Rules of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Respondent does not contest the designation of the offense as a serious crime, nor the imposition of an interim suspension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>pursuant to Judiciary Law \u00a7 90 (4) (f).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> He has instead requested a hearing for the purpose of presenting evidence in mitigation, to which he is entitled pursuant to Judiciary Law \u00a7 90 (4) (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Accordingly, the petition should be granted, the offense of which respondent has been found guilty should be deemed to be a serious crime within the meaning of Judiciary Law \u00a7 90 (4) (d) and Rules of this Court (22 NYCRR) \u00a7 603.12 (b), respondent should be suspended from the practice of law pursuant to Judiciary Law \u00a7 90 (4) (f), and respondent should be directed, pursuant to Judiciary Law \u00a7 90 (4) (g), to show cause before a Referee who shall thereupon hold a hearing and issue a report and recommendation why a final order of censure, suspension or disbarment should not be made.</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-5\">Lerner, P.
