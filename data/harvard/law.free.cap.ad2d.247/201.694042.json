Here, we find that the record adequately demonstrates that defendant waived his rights under <em>People v Antommarchi </em>(80 NY2d 247, 250). The conviction should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AWCA\">Concur \u2014 Milonas, J. P., Rosenberger, Ellerin and Nardelli, JJ.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
