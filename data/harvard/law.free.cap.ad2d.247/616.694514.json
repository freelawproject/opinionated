The conflicting testimony presented at the hearing raised issues of credibility for the Hearing Officer to resolve <em>(see, Matter of Berenhaus v Ward, </em>70 NY2d 436; <em>Matter of Schurr v Wingate, </em>243 AD2d 571; <em>Matter of LaCanfora v Lloyd, </em>229 AD2d 496). This record provides no basis to disturb the Hearing Officer\u2019s resolution of those issues in favor of the respondent. Further, the penalty of dismissal was not so disproportionate to the offenses committed as to be shocking to one\u2019s sense of fairness <em>(see, Matter of Pell v Board of Educ., </em>34 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>NY2d 222).</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
