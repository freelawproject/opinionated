(MAOA), seeks review of a decisiori of the Commissioner of Insurance (commissioner) approving an increase, effective July 1, 1983, in rates charged by Blue Cross of Massachusetts, Inc. (Blue Cross), and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. (Blue Shield),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to persons who subscribe to their \u201cMedex\u201d program. Medex is a form of health insurance which provides supplemental coverage to Medicare beneficiaries (primarily persons age sixty-five and over) for hospital, medical and other health care services which are not covered, or are covered only in part, by Medicare.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">On appeal, MAO A contends that the new Medex rates approved by the commissioner are excessive, in violation of G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 6, and G. L. c. 176B, \u00a7 4. Specifically, MAOA argues that the commissioner erred (1) in excluding an external generic drug reduction factor from rate computation; (2) in failing to adjust the proposed rates to reflect the impact of two changes in Federal Medicare law on Medex costs; and (3) in including in the rate calculation a factor for subscriber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>contribution to general reserves. It also challenges as unfairly discriminatory the commissioner\u2019s tentative approval of a schedule of surcharges to be applied to the Medex premiums paid by persons who enroll in the program after their first year of eligibility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, MAOA asserts that the revised rates could not lawfully take effect until after August 30, 1983, the date on which the commissioner affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s decision, and that Medex subscribers are thus entitled to a rebate for increased rates paid prior to that date. We conclude that the commissioner\u2019s decision should be upheld, and that the revised rates properly became effective on July 1, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">On March 7, 1983, Blue Cross and Blue Shield filed proposed Medex rates with the Division of Insurance (division), seeking a composite increase in rates of 29.1%, tobe effective June 1, 1983. See G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 10; G. L. c. 176B, \u00a7 4. The filing was later revised, and the requested increase reduced to 22.3%. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, MAOA, the division, and the Attorney General participated in a public hearing beginning on April 11, 1983, and lasting eight and one-half days. On June 8, 1983, a deputy commissioner sitting as a hearing officer, see G. L. c. 26, \u00a7 7, issued her findings and order approving the revised Medex rates effective July 1, 1983, one month later than Blue Cross and Blue Shield had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The Attorney General and MAOA, pursuant to G. L. c. 26, \u00a7 7, appealed to the commissioner, who, on August 30, 1983, issued a detailed decision both affirming the deputy commissioner\u2019s approval of the requested rate revision, and specifically endorsing the effective date of July 1, 1983. Further appeal was filed by MAOA under G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 6, and G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>c. 176B, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A single justice of this court allowed a motion by Blue Cross and Blue Shield to intervene as defendants and reserved and reported the appeal for decision by the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">1. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Because our review is premised upon the commissioner\u2019s proper exercise, in the first instance, of his statutory authority, we comment briefly on the scope of that authority. The commissioner does not fix Medex rates; he retains the power to review proposed rates but not to set them. See G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 10; G. L. c. 176B, \u00a7 4. Contrast G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113B (commissioner shall fix and establish automobile insurance rates). The commissioner may not approve proposed rates which are \u201cexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.\u201d G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 6, as amended through St. 1984, c. 199, \u00a7 2. See G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 10; G. L. c. 176B, \u00a7 4. \u201c[H]e may not require that they be at the figures he finds reasonable. Necessarily there is a range of reasonableness and the statute[s] permit disapproval only if the Commissioner finds [the rates] to be outside that range.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Medical Serv. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>344 Mass. 335, 339 (1962).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201c[t]he burden of furnishing evidence to enable the Commissioner to establish a range of reasonableness is on the insurers.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number><em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>366 Mass. 35, 42 (1974). Cf. <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating &amp; Inspection Bureau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>391 Mass. 238, 245 (1984) (burden of proof on insurers to show that workmen\u2019s compensation rates fall within range of reasonableness); <em>Travelers Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>362 Mass. 301, 305 (1972) (burden on automobile insurers to support rates).* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Our review of the commissioner\u2019s decision is governed both by G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 6, and G. L. c. 176B, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 17.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We examine those provisions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">General Laws c. 176A, \u00a7 6, mandates public hearings after which \u201clegal rights ... of specifically named persons\u201d (Blue Cross) are determined. <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>388 Mass. 707, 716, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Formaldehyde Inst., Inc. </em>v. <em>Frechette, </em>464 U.S 936 (1983). Those hearings are thus \u201cadjudicatory proceedings\u201d within the scope of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (1), as amended by St. 1966, c. 497. See <em>Borden, Inc., supra. </em>See also <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>339 Mass. 535, 542 (1959). Cf. <em>Associated Indus. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>356 Mass. 279, 284-285 (1969). In reviewing proceedings under G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 6, then, we are directed to the standards set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), and, consequently, we will not disturb the commissioner\u2019s decision unless it is \u201c[unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Because G. L. c. 176B, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 17, grant a right to review without specifying a standard,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> our review \u201cin these cases is limited to whether the evidence reasonably supports [the commissioner\u2019s] findings that the rates\u201d were within the \u201crange of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating &amp; Inspection Bureau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., supra </em>at 245. <em>See, Insurance Co. of N. Am. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>327 Mass. 745, 752-753 (1951). See generally <em>Swan </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>222 Mass. 542, 546-548 (1916).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cReasonable support in the evidence\u201d and \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d are not \u201cmeaningfully\u201d different. <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating &amp; Inspection Bureau, supra </em>at 244-245. In these circumstances, then, the standard of review required under G. L. c. 176B, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 17, is substantial evidence, the same as that under G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">2. <em>Approval of Rates.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">a. <em>Medex rate setting methodology. </em>Rates for Medex insurance are set using a variant on the \u201cconventional method\u201d which acknowledges the nonprofit status of Blue Cross and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Blue Shield. Cf. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>370 Mass. 791, 796-797 (1976). An allowance for losses is determined by projecting for each Medex benefit the expected cost and frequency of claims. These projections are typically extrapolated from trends in historical (\u201cinternal\u201d) data, derived from actual Medex experience. Such projections are then modified by \u201cexternal\u201d factors in order to account for the impact of forces such as legislative changes not reflected in internal data. The rate charged to consumers is calculated on the basis of a \u201cpure premium\u201d for each benefit, adjusted for anticipated expenses and, in this case, reserve allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">On appeal, MAOA does not dispute the accuracy of the historical data employed by Blue Cross and Blue Shield in their projections. Rather, MAOA contends that the commissioner erred in failing to recognize certain external factors in his review of the proposed pure premiums, and in approving subscriber contributions to reserves. We address these arguments seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">b. <em>Generic drug reduction factor. </em>Medex provides partial coverage of the costs of prescription drugs. Blue Cross and Blue Shield used both internal and external data in estimating the cost of this benefit. First, the internal trend was derived from projecting, on the basis of historical data, the number of such claims per subscriber, the number of prescriptions per claim, and the average charge per prescription. An external \u201creduction factor\u201d was then applied to account for savings expected from an expansion of the list of generic drugs which may be substituted for costlier, brand-name drugs. The deputy commissioner rejected the final cost projection as \u201cinadequate,\u201d finding that previous expansions of the list of interchangeable generic drugs had not consistently eased the increase in the cost of prescription drugs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The commissioner agreed, explaining that \u201c[t]he history of drug charge increases since 1977, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>during which period generic drug lists were introduced and later expanded, does not inspire confidence that future charge increases will be slowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">It is MAOA\u2019s claim that the commissioner\u2019s rejection of the proposed generic drug reduction factor is not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree. The commissioner specifically noted Schedule 16 of the Medex filing, documenting the recent trend of prescription drug charges recorded on Medex claims. The list of interchangeable generic drugs had been expanded twice, first in May, 1979, and again in September, 1981. While the rate of increase did decline after the May, 1979, expansion, the more recent expansion in September, 1981, was followed by a substantial acceleration in the rise of prescription drug charges. Blue Cross and Blue Shield\u2019s actuary noted that \u201cthere is nothing in the numbers that demonstrate[s] that the generic list and the use of generic drugs has abated the increase in cost of prescription drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">We recognize that \u201c[t]he substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.\u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>350 Mass. 246, 253 (1966), quoting <em>Universal Camera Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951). Clearly, no party disputes the demonstrated increase in the cost of prescription drugs. Rather, MAOA merely challenges Blue Cross and Blue Shield\u2019s explanation of that increase. The record, however, need not reveal why a given trend has developed, so long as it supports the conclusion that such a trend in fact has emerged.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">While we have declared that consideration of external factors is desirable in rate reviews, see <em>Massachusetts Auto, Rating &amp; Accident Prevention Bureau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>389 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>824, 840 (1983), we have also emphasized that cost predictions ordinarily must correlate with historical trends. See <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating &amp; Inspection Bureau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>391 Mass. 238, 263-264 (1984). The undisputed evidence before the commissioner showed a substantial likelihood that incorporation of an external generic drug reduction factor would be inconsistent with historical trends. We conclude that the commissioner\u2019s rejection of the proposed generic drug reduction factor was supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">c. <em>Changes in Federal Medicare law. </em>Medex insurance is designed to supplement Medicare; thus, changes in Federal Medicare benefits are reflected in Medex coverage. 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 47.07 (1980). See <em>Blue Gross of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>392 Mass. 178, 179 (1984). In their rate filing, Blue Cross and Blue Shield identified numerous changes which were expected to affect the cost of Medex coverage; several of these were taken into account by Blue Cross and Blue Shield in arriving at the proposed rates. Changes expected to have a small impact on costs \u2014 two of which would yield cost reductions \u2014 were not factored into the rates. At the hearing before the deputy commissioner, MAOA contended that the failure of Blue Cross and Blue Shield to include the expected savings in rate calculations resulted in excessive rates. The deputy commissioner, however, believed that \u201c[i]t is proper that Blue Cross/Blue Shield be given some leeway in judging the importance of minor changes in Medicare provisions.\u201d The commissioner agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">We are asked by MAOA to reconsider this issue. We conclude that the limited \u201cleeway\u201d allowed Blue Cross and Blue Shield did not result in an excessive rate. The parties agree that the combined effect of the two disputed Medicare changes will be a saving of $0.13 per month per contract. An assistant actuary for Blue Cross and Blue Shield testified that these changes were within a range customarily not recognized- in rate determination. He cited several examples of changes in Medicare law expected to cause cost increases too small to be considered in rate computation. Although these cost increases were not quantified, it was nevertheless reasonable for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>commissioner to conclude that they would at least partially offset the Medicare saving identified by MAOA. While the commissioner certainly has discretion to limit the extent to which minor factors may be ignored, see <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating &amp; Inspection Bureau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., supra </em>at 264, we think the evidence here reasonably supported his conclusion that Blue Cross and Blue Shield\u2019s failure to account for these small changes did not bring the over-all rate outside the range of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">d. <em>Contribution to general reserves. </em>The Medex rate proposal filed by Blue Cross and Blue Shield included a 1.25% contribution to general reserves to which MAOA objected on the ground that Blue Cross and Blue Shield had failed to demonstrate a need to augment existing reserves. The commissioner disagreed and approved the inclusion of the reserve contribution. Noting that Medex losses had played a disproportionate role in the recent \u201cdeterioration\u201d of reserve levels, he concluded that Blue Cross and Blue Shield\u2019s request was \u201cboth prudent and justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">On appeal, MAOA does not challenge this finding. At the hearing, the issue was substantial evidence; MAOA now concedes that there is substantial evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s decision. Rather it argues, for the first time, that \u201csurplus funds\u201d, under G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 24, means only those funds which result from an unanticipated excess of rate revenues over expenses and claims paid, and that Blue Cross may augment its reserves only when rate projections have been mistakenly overstated. Because that issue was not raised below, it is not properly before us. See <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Second Dist. Court of E. Middlesex, </em>389 Mass. 508, 515 (1983); <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the City of Boston, </em>388 Mass. 491, 493 (1983). See also <em>Shamrock Liquors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 333, 335 (1979). Nothing in the record suggests that MAOA was precluded from raising this issue below, or that this is an \u201cexceptional case\u201d requiring our consideration even though the issue was not presented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the commissioner.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Albert, supra </em>at 494, quoting <em>Hormel </em>v. <em>Helvering, </em>312 U.S. 552, 557 (1941). In declining to reach this issue, we are \u201cmindful of the deference due the commissioner\u2019s specialized knowledge, technical competence, and experience, regarding issues within the scope of his statutorily delegated authority.\u201d <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating &amp; Inspection Bureau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., supra </em>at 246. <em>See Massachusetts Auto, Rating &amp; Accident Prevention Bureau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>389 Mass. 824, 828 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">3. <em>Effective Date.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">In her June 8, 1983, decision, the deputy commissioner ordered that the approved rate increase go into effect on July 1, 1983.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On review, the commissioner specifically endorsed the July 1 effective date. It is MAOA\u2019s final contention that the revised rates could not properly have taken effect until after August 30, 1983, the date on which the commissioner issued his written opinion affirming the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">General Laws c. 26, \u00a7 7, as amended by St. 1964, c. 174, authorizes the commissioner to appoint deputies and assign to them \u201csuch duties as the commissioner may prescribe; provided, that any person aggrieved by any finding, ruling or decision rendered upon a hearing authorized by law held before a person other than the commissioner, may . . . appeal therefrom to the commissioner who shall review the case and may modify, affirm or reverse such ruling, finding or decision.\u201d Here, the commissioner delegated to his deputy the duty of reviewing rates under G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 6, and G. L. c. 176B, \u00a7 4. There is no indication in the record that the commissioner intended to qualify that power in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>However, MAOA points out that G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 6, provides that Blue Cross rates shall not be charged until they \u201chave been approved in advance by the commissioner.\u201d Thus, MAOA argues that Medex rates are inoperative until they have been personally approved by the commissioner; it claims, in effect, that G. L. c. 26, \u00a7 7, authorizes the deputy commissioner to do no more than make recommendations to the commissioner. To the contrary, however, \u00a7 7 permits the commissioner\u2019s designee to render a \u201cdecision\u201d after presiding over a \u201chearing authorized by law.\u201d Indeed, this provision anticipates that the commissioner need take no action at all until and unless a person aggrieved by the deputy\u2019s decision appeals to the commissioner after the deputy\u2019s decision is rendered.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Where the Legislature has sought to limit the role of a subordinate officer, it has done so expressly. For example, G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 4, permits a hearing officer appointed by the commissioners of the Department of Public Utilities only to \u201cmake a report in writing ... to the commission for its decision thereon.\u201d See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 (civil service appeal may be referred to hearing officer for hearing and preparation of a report to the Civil Service Commission). No similar limitation exists under G. L. c. 26, \u00a7 7, and thus we find a more suitable analogy in the scheme for review of compensation claims under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 39. There, a review examiner acting for the Director of the Division of Employment Security is authorized to render a \u201cdecision,\u201d and unless an appeal is taken, that decision is final. Benefits are \u201cpaid promptly or denied in accordance with\u201d the review examiner\u2019s decision. G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 39 (a), as appearing in St. 1976, c. 473, \u00a7 13. We hold that the same rule obtains under G. L. c. 26, \u00a7 7. Thus, decisions by persons appointed by the commissioner are final unless appealed, and approved rates will take effect on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>date specified therein unless the commissioner specifically orders otherwise.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Previous decisions of this court confirm our interpretation. In <em>Associated Indus, </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>356 Mass. 279, 281 (1969), the chief actuary of the division, acting under G. L. c. 26, \u00a7 7, issued a decision approving workmen\u2019s compensation rates and setting an effective date for the new rates. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 52, governing workmen\u2019s compensation rate reviews, provides that \u201csuch rates shall not become effective until approved by the Commis sioner: \u2019 \u2019 <em>Associated </em>Indus., <em>supra </em>at 283. Although there was nothing in the record to indicate that \u201cthe Commissioner himself adopted the chief actuary\u2019s opinion and approved the rates,\u201d and thus no indication of when he did so, the court assumed that he had, stating that the better practice would be for the commissioner to \u201cissue a document to that effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286. The court nonetheless affirmed \u201cthe Commissioner\u2019s approval\u201d and, at the same time, the effective date set by the chief actuary. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>327 Mass. 745, 751 (1951) (commissioner reversed deputy commissioner\u2019s decision and ordered insurance company to cease and desist from practice approved in deputy\u2019s decision); <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>372 Mass. 554, 558 (1977) (commissioner affirmed deputy\u2019s order, modifying only effective date).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Our reading of G. L. c. 26, \u00a7 7, is also consistent with the commissioner\u2019s own construction of that provision. \u201cThe interpretation of the Commissioner is not binding on us, but is entitled to some weight . . . and the consistent administrative construction of a statute permitting more than one possible interpretation is of added significance.\u201d <em>American Family Life Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>388 Mass. 468, 474-475, cert. denied sub nom. <em>American Family Life Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Hiam, </em>464 U.S. 850 (1983) (quoting <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liab.

Subsequent to argument, however, G. L. c. 176A and c. 176B were amended to prohibit rate classifications based on age. See St. 1984, c. 199, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 6, amending G.

L. c. 176B, \u00a7 4, as appearing in St. 1960, c. 307, \u00a7 1, required approval if the fees were within a \u201crange of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339. This conclusion was expressly based on our observation that the standard of review of such fee schedules was the same as that applicable to review of rates to members. <em>Id. </em>at 338-339. Accordingly, we have often cited the <em>Massachusetts Medical Serv. </em>decision as authority for the application of the \u201crange of reasonableness\u201d standard in other rate review contexts. See, e.g., <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating &amp; Inspection Bureau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>391 Mass. 238, 245 (1984); <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>366 Mass. 35, 42 (1974). Thus, although this case involves rates, rather than fee schedules, the \u201crange of reasonableness\u201d standard announced in the <em>Massachusetts Medical Serv. </em>decision is applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Massachusetts Association of Older Americans asserts that \u201c[i]f a [rate] projection errs by more than 3%, it must be held to be outside the range of reasonableness generally accepted in reviewing rates.\u201d We decline to limit the \u201crang\u00a7 of reasonableness\u201d to a specific percentage because to do so would add to the statute a limitation which the Legislature did not see fit to enact and which might unduly hamper the commissioner\u2019s exercise of discretion.

L. c. 30A, and a standard under a particular statute, the standard set forth in G. L. c. 30A shall govern. Thus, we need not decide whether there is a conflict because, in any event, review under G.

For this reason, we have reserved judgment as to whether G. L. c. 30A applies to proceedings under that provision. <em>Id. </em>at 339-340 &amp; n.1. We have concluded, however, that the standards of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), do apply in so far as review of Medex rates is governed by G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 6.
