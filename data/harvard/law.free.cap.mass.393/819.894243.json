Batchelder, appeals from the Superior Court judge\u2019s denial of his motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. In <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Int'l, Inc., </em>388 Mass. 83 (1983) <em>(Batchelder I), </em>we ordered the Superior Court to enter judgment declaratory of Batchelder\u2019s right under art. 9 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth to solicit nominating signatures \u201cin a reasonable and unobtrusive manner\u201d at the North Shore Shopping Center (North Shore). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number><em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 84, 93. After entry of judgment, the plaintiff moved for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A Superior Court judge denied this motion, stating that our holding only declared Batchelder\u2019s rights under art. 9, and that therefore he did not prevail under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I. We allowed the plaintiff\u2019s application for direct appellate review. For the reasons stated below, we remand this matter to the Superior Court for assessment of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">We briefly state the factual underpinning of <em>Batchelder I. </em>In March, 1980, at North Shore, Batchelder solicited signatures and distributed materials in support of his nomination as a candidate of the Citizens\u2019 party in the Sixth Congressional District and in support of that party\u2019s presidential candidate. Within the first half hour of this solicitation, a North Shore security guard informed Batchelder that North Shore prohibited the solicitation of signatures and the distribution of political circulars at the shopping center. Batchelder objected but left the premises. Batchelder filed a complaint in Superior Court asserting a right to solicit signatures in support of his right to ballot access under arts. 9 and 16 of the Declaration of Rights and under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I. The judge rejected Batchelder\u2019s claims and ordered entry of judgment for North Shore. We vacated the Superior Court\u2019s action in <em>Batchelder I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Batchelder\u2019s right to attorneys\u2019 fees is determined by our interpretation of G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I. General Laws c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>and 11I, comprise the Massachusetts civil rights legislation. Before enactment, these sections were part of 1979 House Bill No. 3135, \u201cAn Act for the protection of the civil rights of persons in the commonwealth.\u201d It was enacted as St. 1979, c. 801. The Legislature passed this statute to respond to a need for civil rights protection under State law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Deprivations of secured rights by private individuals using violence or threats of violence were prevalent at the time that the Legislature considered G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I. See Boston City Council Resolution of November 14, 1979, endorsing House Bill No. 3135 noting \u201cserious problem of racial harassment.\u201d Aggrieved parties often could not succeed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Supp. V 1981), because the Federal statute requires \u201cState action.\u201d See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Hot Shoppes, Inc., </em>293 F.2d 835, 836, 837 (D.C. Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 925 (1962). Criminal prosecutions under State law were also unsatisfactory; convictions were difficult and the victim was not compensated for the harm. Therefore, the Attorney General proposed House Bill No. 3135 to provide enhanced protection of civil rights. The statute encompassed private action where otherwise \u201cState action\u201d would be required. Compare \u201cWhenever any person or persons, whether or not acting under color of law . . . ,\u201d G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H, with \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia . . . ,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Supp. V 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Section 11I authorizes a private cause of action for violations of G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H. It is similar to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 to the extent that both statutes use the term \u201cprevail\u201d to determine a parties\u2019 right to attorneys\u2019 fees. Compare G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (Supp. V. 1981). The Legislature is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>presumed to have been aware of the use and meaning of this term in the Federal statute. 2A Sutherland, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 51.06. We conclude that the Legislature intended \u201cprevail\u201d to have the same meaning as it does in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (Supp. V 1981). <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>380 Mass. 609, 611 (1980). Therefore a party prevails under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I when he or she achieves success on a substantial question of law arising out of a common nucleus of facts that gives rise to a cause of action under the statute. See <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 132 (1980). This result enhances the statutory goal of encouraging private enforcement of civil rights violations. See, e.g., <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 112 (1982) (where damages are recoverable under the statute but awarded under a different theory the statutory attorneys\u2019 fee award was appropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Interpretation of \u201cprevail\u201d in G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, is not dis-positive of Batchelder\u2019s entitlement to attorneys\u2019 fees. We must determine whether his art. 9 claim presented a substantial question of law arising out of a common nucleus of facts which would support a claim under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I. Our decision in <em>Batchelder I </em>indicates that the question of law presented was \u201cone of substantial public interest . . . .\u201d <em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 86. Therefore, we need only determine whether the art. 9 claim was substantially equivalent to the G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, claim and thus arose out of a common nucleus of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The Massachusetts civil rights law, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I, like other civil rights statutes, is remedial. As such, it is entitled to liberal construction of its terms. 3 C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 72.05, at 392 (4th ed. 1974). \u201cThe rule for the construction of remedial statutes is that cases within the reason, though not within the letter, of a statute shall be embraced by its provisions . . . .\u201d 2A Sutherland, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 54.04, at 570 (quoting <em>Traudt </em>v. <em>Hagerman, </em>27 Ind. App. 150 [1901]).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">The Legislature enacted G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I, to provide a State remedy for deprivations of civil rights. The statute extended beyond the limits of its Federal counterpart by incorporating private action within its bounds. We conclude that the Legislature intended to provide a remedy under G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>c. 12, \u00a7 11I, coextensive with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Supp. V 1981), except that the Federal statute requires State action whereas its State counterpart does not. The language requiring interference \u201cby threats, intimidation or coercion, or attempt to interfere by threats, intimidation or coercion . . .\u2019\u2019is addressed to this private action. G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H, as amended by St. 1982, c. 634, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">A uniformed security officer ordered Batchelder to stop soliciting and distributing his political handbills. Though Batch-elder objected, he complied. This was sufficient intimidation or coercion to satisfy the statute. This interpretation is consistent with the liberal construction which should be afforded civil rights statutes and provides the State remedy for civil right violations that the Legislature sought. In <em>Batchelder I, </em>we determined that \u201cart. 9 is not by its terms directed only against governmental action. There is, thus, no \u2018State action\u2019 requirement expressed in art. 9 . . . .\u201d <em>Batchelder I, supra </em>at 88. Therefore, in these limited circumstances, under art. 9 where State action is not required for a party to prevail on an assertion of the underlying civil rights violation, the security guard\u2019s action was sufficient intimidation or coercion under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I. Batchelder has prevailed on a claim substantially equivalent to his claim under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, and therefore he is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees. We vacate the order denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion and remand this case to the Superior Court for a determination of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b832-7\"> This statute authorizes a private cause of action for deprivation of secured rights and an award of attorneys\u2019 fees for the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">General Laws c. 12, \u00a7 111, inserted by St. 1979, c. 801, \u00a7 1, provides: \u201cAny person whose exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the United States, or of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the commonwealth, has been interfered with, or attempted to be interfered with, as described in section 11H, may institute and prosecute in his own name and on his own behalf a civil action for injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief as provided for in said section, including the award of compensatory money damages.
