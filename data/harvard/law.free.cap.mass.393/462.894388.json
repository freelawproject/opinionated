L. c. 273A, the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff, a Pennsylvania resident, filed a petition for nonsupport in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania against the defendant, a resident of Barnstable County. Pursuant to the act, the petition was forwarded to the Barnstable Division of the District Court, where summary judgment was entered for the defendant after an ex parte hearing on the validity of the marriage between the parties. Subsequently, the judge allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Dist. Mun. Cts. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (1975), and stayed further proceedings so that the defendant could bring an action in the Probate Court or the Superior Court to determine the validity of the marriage. The defendant appealed this ruling to the Appellate Division, which decided that the District Court had jurisdiction to determine the validity of the marriage. In addition, the Appellate Division decided that the original judgment had been erroneously vacated by the allowance of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for relief from judgment, and therefore, implicitly, that the stay of proceedings was improper. The Appellate Division then remanded the case to the District Court and ordered the entry of judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s petition on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The plaintiff argues on appeal that the Appellate Division exceeded its authority by deciding questions not properly reported to it, and asks that the District Court\u2019s order vacating the judgment be reinstated. We affirm that portion of the Appellate Division\u2019s order holding that the District Court has jurisdiction to determine the validity of a marriage in an action brought pursuant to G. L. c. 273A, and that the judge\u2019s order to stay the proceedings was improper. We reverse that portion of the order that reinstated the original judgment for the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>ant. We therefore remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings to determine whether the marriage was valid, and, if so, the amount of support, if any, to which the plaintiff is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We summarize the relevant facts. The defendant and one Isabelle Bushnell were married in 1938, and subsequently they became Massachusetts domiciliaries. On May 29,1981, a complaint for divorce between the defendant and Isabelle Bushnell was entered in the Probate and Family Court for Barnstable County, and a separation agreement between the parties was approved pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 1A. On June 3, 1981, the defendant and the plaintiff flew to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, where the defendant received a divorce from Isabelle Bushnell and married the plaintiff on the same day. After residing in Pennsylvania with the plaintiff for a short time, the defendant returned to reside in Massachusetts with Isabelle Bushnell. On September 25, 1981, the divorce complaint between the defendant and Isabelle Bushnell was dismissed at their request.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The plaintiff filed a complaint for nonsupport in the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, Pennsylvania, on September 9, 1981. The complaint was forwarded to the Barnstable Division of the District Court pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6754 (Purdon 1982),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where the defendant entered a special appearance and filed a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment. After an ex parte hearing on these motions, the judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that no marriage existed between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">After the appeal period had run,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiff appeared in the District Court seeking relief from the judgment under mie 60 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>(b). The judge granted this motion, and, because he believed the District Court lacked jurisdiction to determine the validity of the marriage, he stayed proceedings so that the parties could adjudicate this issue in the Probate Court or the Superior Court. The Appellate Division set aside the judge\u2019s rulings and ordered the initial judgment to be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">1. <em>Subject matter jurisdiction. </em>The plaintiff contends that the Appellate Division exceeded its proper scope of review by deciding that the District Court had subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether the marriage between the parties was valid. The plaintiff argues that the Appellate Division should have considered only whether the judge had abused his discretion by granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion for relief from judgment. We conclude that the plaintiff construes the reported issue too narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">It is clear from the judge\u2019s findings that his basis for staying the proceedings was his belief that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine the validity of a marriage in a proceeding commenced under G. L. c. 273A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Appellate Division is required to consider questions of law reported to it, <em>James J. Derba, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamilton Serv., Inc., </em>355 Mass. 127, 130 (1969), and has the duty to consider legal questions necessarily attendant to those reported. See <em>Henry L. Sawyer Co. </em>v. <em>Boyajian, </em>303 Mass. 311, 312 (1939). In the circumstances of this case, the Appellate Division could not have properly reviewed the judge\u2019s ruling without deciding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>whether the judge was correct in concluding that he lacked jurisdiction to consider the marriage\u2019s validity. The issue reported to the Appellate Division was precisely this question of jurisdiction, and the Appellate Division properly reached this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Having determined that the issue of jurisdiction was properly before the Appellate Division, we next address the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the Appellate Division erred in deciding that the District Court had the requisite subject matter jurisdiction to decide whether the marriage of the parties was valid. This contention is anchored on G. L. c. 207, \u00a7 14, governing actions concerning marriage and divorce, and on G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 6, which places jurisdiction of such actions in the Superior and Probate Courts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Appellate Division rejected this argument, holding that, although the District Court does not have general jurisdiction to determine the validity of marriages and divorces, it does have jurisdiction over those matters incidental to its jurisdiction under G. L. c. 273A, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree with the Appellate Division that the District Court does have jurisdiction over such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In G. L. c. 273A, \u00a7 10, the District Court is given the authority to order support if \u201cthe court finds a duty of support\u201d imposed by law. Our duty is to interpret these words according to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>388 Mass. 115, 119 (1983). <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975). For a District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>judge to determine, in accordance with the statute, whether a duty of support exists, it must be determined whether there is a basis for that support, that is, whether a valid marriage exists between the parties. The relation between these two determinations is illustrated by this court\u2019s language in <em>French </em>v. <em>McAnarney, </em>290 Mass. 544 (1935): \u201cThe moment the marriage relation comes into existence, certain rights and duties necessarily incident to that relation spring into being. One of these duties is the obligation imposed by law upon the husband to support his wife.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since the duty of support arises out of the existence of a valid marriage, we hold that the District Court has the implied power to determine that fact in cases brought under G. L. c. 273A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">This conclusion is buttressed by our decision in <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Dorchester Dist., </em>374 Mass. 640 (1978). In that case, we held that the Juvenile Court has the implied power to expunge police records as an ancillary part of its jurisdiction over juvenile issues. <em>Id. </em>at 665-668. We held that \u201cin the appropriate circumstances, courts may consider and decide matters \u2018ancillary or incidental to, or growing out of, the main action\u2019 which, as original causes of action, would not be within the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665 n.18, quoting <em>Morrow </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>417 F.2d 728, 737-738 (D.C. Cir. 1969). The concept of implied or ancillary jurisdiction is not a new one in this Commonwealth. In <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Lobdell, </em>4 Cush. 510, 512 (1849), this court held that the Probate Court could decide questions incidental to a subject over which it had jurisdiction, even if it lacked independent jurisdiction over the incidental matter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>New York Cent. &amp; H.R. R.R., </em>206 Mass. 417, 429 (1910) (\u201ca grant of jurisdiction carries with it by implication power to use the necessary means to exercise and enforce that jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Our decision today is also consistent with our prior interpretations of G. L. c. 273A. In M-v. W-, 352 Mass. 704, 706 (1967), the defendant asserted that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to determine paternity in an action commenced under G. L. c. 273A. Rejecting that contention, we held that the District Court must have jurisdiction to determine paternity \u201cas a basis of finding a \u2018duty of support.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The great majority of State courts faced with the paternity question have also resolved it in this manner.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Furthermore, our holding comports with the Legislature\u2019s directive in G. L. c. 273A, \u00a7 17, to construe this statute to make it \u201csubstantially uniform\u201d with the laws of other States. Addressing the same issue we decide today, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island has held that questions relating to the validity of a marriage may be litigated in an action brought pursuant to the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act. <em>Sar-donis </em>v. <em>Sardonis, </em>106 R.I. 469 (1970). That court noted: \u201cEven a brief reference to the Act\u2019s pertinent provisions makes it obvious that proof of the existence of a marriage . . . [is] indispensable ... to the court\u2019s power to order support payments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Weller </em>v. <em>Weller, </em>14 Ariz. App. 42, 45-46 (1971) (court has power to inquire into validity of Mexican divorce decree). See also <em>People ex rel. Valle </em>v. <em>Valle, </em>113111. App. 3d 682, 683, 685-686 <em>(1983); Amaker\\. Amaker, </em>28 N.C. App. 558, 561 (1976). Cf. <em>Blois </em>v. <em>Blois, </em>138 So. 2d 373, 374 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1962) (evidence of dissolution of a marriage is relevant in determining duty of support); <em>O\u2019Neill </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>420 So. 2d 261, 264 (Ala. Civ. App.) (evidence of cohabitation as ground for termination of alimony germane to the question of the duty of support), aff\u2019d, 420 So. 2d 264 (Ala. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">2. <em>Stay of proceedings. </em>Once the Appellate Division correctly decided that the District Court had jurisdiction, it was implicit that the judge had improperly stayed proceedings in the District Court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">3. <em>Notice. </em>However, we cannot completely affirm the order of the Appellate Division. The defendant moved for summary judgment pursuant to Dist. Mun. Cts. R. Civ. P. 56.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rule 56 (c) specifically requires that \u201c[t]he motion shall be served at least 10 days before the time fixed for the hearing.\u201d The defendant admittedly failed to serve notice on the plaintiff,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> claiming that, because G. L. c. 273A governs the proceeding and has no special provisions for notice, no notice at all was required. We disagree, concluding that, because of the defendant\u2019s failure to serve notice of his motion on the plaintiff, the judge was clearly warranted in vacating the initial judgment, if not required to do so.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">General Laws c. 273A was designed \u201cto provide an effective procedure to compel performance by one under a duty to support defendants in another State.\u201d <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>336 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>561, 562-563 (1958). The uniform act was developed in response to the problems posed for the interstate enforcement of support by the increased mobility of the American population. The drafters of that act observed that \u201c[a] deserting husband was beyond the reach of process in the state where he had abandoned his family and the family had no means to follow him.\u201d Commissioners\u2019 Prefatory Note (1950 Act), 9A U.L.A. (Master ed. 1979). See generally Note, The Uniform Enforcement of Support Act in Massachusetts, 33 B.U.L. Rev. 217 (1953). In the majority of cases brought under the act, no question is raised concerning the obligation of a respondent to provide support; the court in the responding State merely determines the amount of support to which the petitioner is reasonably entitled and acts to ensure that the support payments are, in fact, made. See W.J. Brockelbank &amp; F. Infausto, Interstate Enforcement of Family Support 51 (2d ed. 1971). In these cases, the petitioner, often destitute, rarely appears in the responding State\u2019s court. M-v. W-, 352 Mass. 704, 710 (1967). <em>Lambrou </em>v. <em>Berna, </em>154 Me. 352,361 (1959). W.J. Brockelbank &amp; F. Infausto, <em>supra </em>at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In the present case, however, the defendant has raised a defense sufficient, if proved, to require the plaintiff\u2019s petition to be dismissed on the merits.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In such a case, this court\u2019s observation in M-v. W-, <em>supra, </em>has great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>relevance. There, we noted that when the basis of the duty of support is contested, \u201cthe issues are such that the presence of [both] parties before the trier of fact may be of great importance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710-711. Although both parties were before the District Court in that case, we noted that if both parties were not present, the District Court had the inherent discretionary power to stay the proceeding in order to allow the plaintiff to appear. <em>Id. </em>at 710 n.10. We now hold that, when a defendant files a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff is entitled to the notice required by rule 56 (c), even if the motion judge does not exercise his discretion to stay the proceeding.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The defendant similarly argues that since the judge has discretionary power to appoint counsel for the plaintiff under G. L. c. 273A, \u00a7 15,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but did not do so, the plaintiff cannot now assert her lack of notice. The simple answer to this contention is that the failure of the judge to exercise his discretion under \u00a7 15 does not absolve the defendant of his duties under rule 56 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Although G. L. c. 273A itself contains no notice provisions, we cannot believe that by enacting that law to assist dependents in receiving support, the Legislature intended to isolate the proceedings from the procedural safeguards that would otherwise apply. Indeed, if we were to accept that argument, we essentially would be providing \u201ca procedural field day for defaulting [spouses],\u201d a result we forcefully rejected in <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>338 Mass. 263, 268 (1959). Instead, we choose to follow a path more consonant with the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting this statute \u2014 that the act does not displace the rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>of civil procedure.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>103 N.J. Super. 284, 289-290 (1968). See also <em>Yetter </em>v. <em>Commeau, </em>84 Wash. 2d 155, 163 (1974).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This is obviously what the drafters of the uniform act intended when they stated that \u201c[provisions covering other details of procedure have been kept out of the Act so that the usual rules for obtaining jurisdiction for carrying on the procedure and for appeals may be held to govern.\u201d Commissioners\u2019 Prefatory Note (1950 Act), 9A U.L.A. (Master ed. 1979).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">4. <em>Rule 60 (b) practice. </em>The judge, because of his jurisdictional ruling, did not find it necessary to pass on any of the other grounds asserted by the plaintiff for relief under rule 60 (b).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Generally, the judge should have the opportunity to exercise his discretion in determining whether any of those additional grounds constitute a sufficient reason to vacate the original judgment. After the judge has done so, his rulings could be reviewed by the Appellate Division and set aside if the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>committed an abuse of discretion. <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>389 Mass. 809, 815 (1983). <em>Trustees of the Stigmatine Fathers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>369 Mass. 562, 565-566 (1976). However, this appeal brings before us not only the rulings of law reported to the Appellate Division, but also all questions of law touching the action of the Appellate Division. <em>James J. Derba, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamilton Serv., Inc., </em>355 Mass. 127, 130 (1969). It was found that the plaintiff was not given notice of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Thus, it is clear that the judgment should be vacated for a reason different from those set forth by the judge, but nevertheless argued by the parties, and we see no reason to remand the case for a consideration of other rule 60 (b) grounds.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Rule 60 (b) (1) allows relief from a judgment on grounds of \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d Entry of judgment based on the failure of the plaintiff to be given notice of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment appears to fall within this subsection. See <em>Blois </em>v. <em>Friday, </em>612 F.2d 938 (5th Cir. 1980) (rule applicable where attorney fails to file change of address, leading to lack of notice and default judgment).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Moreover, this court has held that, in some circumstances, lack of notice \u201cconstitutes a sufficiently fundamental flaw\u201d to make it \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment,\u201d within the meaning of rule 60 (b) (6). <em>Chavoor </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>383 Mass. 801, 806 (1981).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>find it unnecessary to decide the exact subsection under which the plaintiff\u2019s motion would be most appropriate,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> except to state that it surely falls within one of the grounds she asserts. We conclude that lack of notice is a proper basis for relief under rule 60 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">5. <em>Validity of the marriage. </em>We now address the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the Appellate Division exceeded its authority by ruling on the validity of the marriage when that issue was not reported to it. We agree that the Appellate Division did erroneously exceed its proper scope of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The Appellate Division was presented only with the question whether the judge improperly allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motion for relief from judgment and stayed the proceedings in the District Court. As we stated earlier, the Appellate Division generally has only the power to decide questions properly reported to it. See <em>James J. Derba, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamilton Serv., Inc., </em>supra; <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Warwick Stores, Inc., </em>329 Mass. 406, 409 (1952); <em>Himelfarb </em>v. <em>Novadel Agene Corp., </em>305 Mass. 446, 448-449 (1940). While Dist. Mun. Cts. R. Civ. P. 64 (i) (1975) gives the Appellate Division the authority to reverse, vacate, or modify rulings, or to order a new trial, that power is given only when there has been prejudicial error <em>in the rulings complained of.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Although reversal of the judge\u2019s order to vacate would thereby reinstate the original judgment, the question whether the factual findings in the original judgment were correct is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>matter separate from, and independent of, the issues presented to the Appellate Division. <em>SeeLoanesw. Gast, </em>216 Mass. 197, 199 (1913). The plaintiff had not appealed from that judgment, and the defendant, even had he been so inclined, could not have sought review of it, since he was not aggrieved by the ruling. Dist. Mun. Cts. R. Civ. P. 64 (c) (2). G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 108. See <em>Circle Lounge &amp; Grille, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>324 Mass. 427, 429-433 (1949); <em>Commercial Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>282 Mass. 316, 321 (1933); <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>Chic-katawbut Club, </em>220 Mass. 146, 148 (1915).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We conclude that the Appellate Division erred in setting aside the judge\u2019s order vacating the initial judgment, and exceeded its authority by directing the District Court to enter judgment for the defendant based on the invalidity of the marriage. Since the Appellate Division was correct in holding that the District Court had jurisdiction and that the judge had improperly stayed proceedings, we remand the case to the District Court. After considering the submissions of both parties, the judge may then determine whether the original entry of summary judgment for the defendant was appropriate. Therefore, the order of the Appellate Division is affirmed in part, and reversed in part, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-6\"> Massachusetts has adopted some of the amendments to the 1950 uniform act, St. 1954, c. 556, \u00a7 1, along with numerous amendments particular to Massachusetts.

However, no additional jurisdiction was conferred which would specifically allow the District Court, in making that determination, to inquire into and rule on subject matter which is clearly within the jurisdiction of the Probate Court; jurisdiction over matters relating to the validity of marriages is expressly awarded to the Probate or Superior Court under the provisions of M.G.L. c. 207, \u00a7 14. Although this issue is necessarily related to the issue of a duty of support, it is one which logically should be independently predetermined in a court having proper jurisdiction, prior to any further proceedings in this court regarding support.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b478-7\">General Laws c. 207, \u00a7 14, as amended by St. 1976, c. 486, \u00a7 19, provides in applicable part: \u201cIf the validity of a marriage is doubted, either party may institute an action for annulling such marriage, or if it is denied or doubted by either party, the other party may institute an action for affirming the marriage. Such action shall be commenced in the same manner as an action for divorce, and all the provisions of chapter two hundred and eight relative to actions for divorce shall, so far as appropriate, apply to actions under this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 6, as amended by St. 1977, c. 183, provides: \u201cActions for divorce shall be filed, heard and determined in the superior court or probate court . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b478-9\">General Laws c. 273A, \u00a7 6, as amended through St. 1965, c. 17, \u00a7 1, states in part: \u201cAny proceeding hereunder shall be commenced in a district court . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\"> Under the statute currently in effect, the court may enter a judgment for either party to pay alimony to the other.

M-v. W-, 352 Mass. 704, 707 (1967). The fact that the plaintiff might have sought relief in the Probate Court is irrelevant. <em>Canty </em>v. <em>Canty, </em>392 Mass. 1004, 1005 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b479-10\">The plaintiff argues that <em>Nevins </em>v. <em>Tinker, </em>384 Mass. 702, 705-706 (1981) stands for the opposite proposition. Our reading of that decision, however, shows that we did not reach the jurisdictional question in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\"> One reason for finding that \u201c[n]o practical considerations preclude\u201d the District Courts from determining paternity was that those courts were already empowered to do so under G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 15, relating to quasi criminal nonsupport prosecutions. M-v. W-, <em>supra </em>at 710 &amp; n.8. We note that the District Court is apparently given a similar power to determine the existence of a marriage under G. L. c. 273. General Laws c. 273, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 848, \u00a7 2, provides: \u201cAny spouse . . . who without just cause deserts his spouse . . . and any spouse . . . who unreasonably neglects or refuses to provide for the support and maintenance of his spouse . . . shall be punished . . . .\u201d Section 7 provides for evidentiary rules to be followed in determining \u201cthe fact of their marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">A principal drafter of the uniform act believes that the act confers no jurisdiction to determine paternity (and presumably marriage) on a court that does not already have independent jurisdiction over such actions. W.J. Brockelbank &amp; F. Infausto, Interstate Enforcement of Family Support 62 (2d ed. 1971). We have already held otherwise in M-v. W-, <em>supra </em>at 711, through our interpretation of G. L. c. 273A, \u00a7 10. In advising that courts which do have independent jurisdiction should decide questions of paternity, Professor Brockelbank observes that otherwise, \u201cdefendants would begin interposing such a defense as a subterfuge merely to avoid their obligations.\u201d W.J. Brockelbank &amp; F. Infausto, <em>supra. </em>We believe this policy extends equally to the situation considered in M-v. W-, <em>supra, </em>and the case now before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b480-15\"> Section 27 of the 1968 revised act specifically allows the adjudication of paternity. 9A U.L.A.

R. Civ. P. 23(c), the Federal District Court had no discretion in vacating judgment, but that an intervener could have the judgment set aside as a matter of right. See <em>Sonus Corp. </em>v. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., </em>61 F.R.D. 644, 647-649 (D.

Thus, while our procedure is somewhat different from that quoted above, it serves the same purpose \u2014 to avoid an ex parte determination of the case on the merits when possible.

In different circumstances not now before us, a different notice requirement may be appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b484-8\"> In applicable part, G.

App. 451, 460-461 (1980). In a proceeding commenced under the uniform act, the defendant asserted a violation of visitation privileges by the plaintiff as vitiating his duty of support. The court held that the defense could be asserted only because of the court\u2019s independent jurisdiction over custody, support, and visitation, which required notice to the plaintiff. While declining to engraft procedural safeguards onto the uniform act, the court noted that without notice and an opportunity to be heard, the plaintiff\u2019s due process rights would be violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\"> The State of Washington has adopted \u00a7 21 (see note 17, <em>supra) </em>and \u00a7 20 of the 1950 version of the uniform act, neither of which have been enacted in Massachusetts.

See W.J. Brockelbank &amp; F. Infausto, <em>supra </em>at 59.
