He was sentenced to terms of eight to twelve years at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole, to be served concurrently with each other and with any sentence then being served. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review of his convictions and of the denial of his motion for a new trial. The defendant alleges that he is entitled to a new trial on four grounds: (1) error by the trial judge in excluding questions on cross-examination designed to impeach the credibility of the rape complainant; (2) newly discovered evidence consisting of the complainant\u2019s subsequent civil claim against the defendant\u2019s employer based upon the assault; (3) conflict of interest on the part of the defendant\u2019s originally retained attorney due to his representation of the complainant in her subsequent civil action; and (4) abuse of discretion by the trial judge in allowing the prosecutor to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior rape conviction for impeachment purposes. We agree that the judge erred in excluding questions intended to show the complainant\u2019s bias and conclude that the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In August, 1980, the defendant was on parole from a rape conviction and was employed as a maintenance man by the Washington Heights apartment complex. In the afternoon of August 25, 1980, he did some painting and repair work in the complainant\u2019s apartment, which was located on the ground floor of the complex. She testified that nothing unusual happened on this occasion; he claimed that she seduced him and that they had sexual intercourse. The complainant stated that in the early morning hours of August 28, 1980, she was awakened by the sound of a door opening and that the defendant then entered her apartment and raped her.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant testified that the complainant had invited him to her apartment and that the two had consensual sexual intercourse. After the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>defendant left her apartment, the complainant drove to the home of her male friend, Grindal Gardner, who called the police. The defendant was arrested in his apartment later that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The defendant\u2019s wife originally retained Attorney Conrad Fisher to represent her husband. Mr. Fisher met once with the defendant at the Worcester County house of correction to discuss the case. However, he withdrew his representation prior to the defendant\u2019s probable cause hearing upon discovering that Gardner would be testifying as a witness under the fresh complaint doctrine. Mr. Fisher knew Gardner, a real estate broker, quite well and had previously represented him and other members of his family in various legal matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The defendant\u2019s trial ended with the return of the jury\u2019s verdicts on Thursday, April 2, 1981. On Monday, April 6, the complainant (accompanied by Gardner) met with Mr. Fisher and discussed the feasibility of filing suit against Washington Heights for negligence in hiring the defendant. On October 14, 1981, Washington Heights received a claim letter from Mr. Fisher demanding compensation for the complainant. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial on October 20, 1982, citing the first three grounds discussed above. An evidentiary hearing was held solely on the issue of Mr. Fisher\u2019s alleged conflict of interest and on March 21, 1983, the defendant\u2019s motion was denied on all grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">1. At trial the defendant sought to impeach the complainant\u2019s credibility by probing into possible financial motives for securing his conviction. Specifically, he inquired into the complainant\u2019s financial difficulties with Washington Heights and asked whether she had instituted a court suit against the apartment complex.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge excluded this line of questioning as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>impermissibly \u201cdiscrediting [the complainant] by showing bad character\u201d and refused the defendant\u2019s offer of proof as to the purpose of the cross-examination and the testimony he sought to elicit. In an affidavit submitted with the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the defendant\u2019s trial attorney stated what he had intended to present as his offer of proof: \u201cI wished to elicit from the witness whether she had a personal financial interest or stake in the outcome of this case, specifically whether she had commenced suit or made a financial claim against The Washington Heights Apartment Complex, the employer of the defendant, on the basis of the alleged incident involved in this case; or whether she had taken any steps to prepare for the commencement of such a suit or to make such a claim; or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>whether she had at the time of trial any intention to commence such a suit or to make such a claim in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">During oral argument before this court the Commonwealth conceded that the judge erred in excluding the defendant\u2019s questions. We agree. However, we disagree with the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that, in light of the complainant\u2019s likely response and the information the defendant was otherwise able to present to the jury, such error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">We are aware of the ordeal rape complainants must undergo in assisting the prosecution of their attackers. The Legislature has shown sensitivity to a complainant\u2019s plight. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 2 IB. At the same time we cannot lose sight of the defendant\u2019s right, guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and by art. 12 of the Commonwealth\u2019s Declaration of Rights, to confront adverse witnesses \u201cby means of cross-examination directed toward revealing possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness as they may relate directly to issues or personalities in the case at hand. \u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. <em>308, 316 (1974). Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 225 (1981). We have stated in the past that \u201c[t]he right to cross-examine a complainant in a rape case to show a false accusation may be the last refuge of an innocent defendant.\u201d <em>Joyce, supra </em>at 229. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>376 Mass. 90, 94 (1978) (where evidence concerning credibility of rape complainant was excluded, the \u201cright to present a full defense\u201d was denied); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 793, 795 (1979) (exclusion of inquiry into rape complainant\u2019s probationary status denied defendant his constitutional right of confrontation).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The institution of a civil suit based upon a criminal offense, while entirely legitimate, can create financial motive for the victim to falsify testimony in order to secure a criminal conviction. Therefore, we have recognized the defendant\u2019s right to probe into such matters to reveal a witness\u2019s bias and personal interest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marcellino, </em>271 Mass. 325, 327 (1930) (exclusion of question regarding assault victim\u2019s civil suit against defendant constituted reversible error); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dutra, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 542, 549 (1983) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>(\u201c[E]vidence of the civil suit was unquestionably relevant to the issue of the [rape] victim\u2019s credibility, inasmuch as it indicated that a guilty verdict in the criminal case might aid her recovery in the civil matter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The Commonwealth claims that in this case the judge\u2019s error was harmless because, had the complainant answered the excluded questions, her testimony would not have had a material effect on the jury. Based upon testimony given at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the judge found that \u201cshe [the complainant] never considered the possibility of a civil action until Gardner mentioned it to her after the trial was over.\u201d Therefore, he concluded, \u201cevidence of the claim or the intention to pursue a claim could not have been uncovered at trial.\u201d There are several problems with such reasoning. According to the transcript of the new trial hearing, the complainant did not testify in the manner attributed to her.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She did state that she did not meet with Mr. Fisher to discuss bringing a civil claim until after the defendant\u2019s conviction. However, she also testified that she had discussed the idea of recovering compensation for the assault with her family and friends without indicating when such discussion took place,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>whether before or after the defendant\u2019s trial. Based upon this record neither we nor the trial judge can know with certainty how the complainant would have answered the defendant\u2019s questions. This is particularly evident in light of the trial attorney\u2019s affidavit, which suggests that had he been permitted to proceed, he would have inquired into the complainant\u2019s intent to pursue a civil claim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graziano, </em>368 Mass. 325, 330 (1975) (defendant is not required to pursue a line of questioning \u201cin the face of the judge\u2019s unequivocal adverse ruling\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>377 Mass. 755 (1979). There we upheld the exclusion of a witness\u2019s arrest record where the arrests occurred after his initial statements to the police incriminating the defendant. On voir dire the trial judge found no inconsistencies between the witness\u2019s pre- and post-arrest statements that would suggest he had falsified testimony to seek government favor. The Commonwealth contends that here too the complainant\u2019s testimony at trial predated any incentive that she might later have had to accuse the defendant falsely. However, as we have already indicated, we do not know when the complainant first entertained the idea of bringing a civil suit. Nor are we faced, as was the trial judge in <em>Haywood, </em>with having to balance the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination against a witness\u2019s interest in the confidentiality of an arrest record. <em>Haywood, supra </em>at 760-763.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">We cannot say in this case that \u201chad the judge admitted the testimony erroneously excluded, it would have been without material effect on the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caldron, </em>383 Mass. 86,93 (1981). Among other relevant facts, the three-way relationship between Mr. Fisher, Gardner, and the complainant; the inconsistencies in their testimony regarding possible contact between Gardner and Mr. Fisher prior to the latter\u2019s withdrawal; and the issues as to when and how the idea of bringing a civil action against Washington Heights arose, all lend support to the defendant\u2019s contention that, had he been allowed to pursue his cross-examination, he could have shown some financial motive on the part of the complainant to secure his conviction. Therefore, we do not regard the judge\u2019s error as harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Alternatively, the Commonwealth argues that the judge\u2019s error was harmless because the information the defendant unsuccessfully sought to elicit on cross-examination reached the jury through other means. The jury did hear witnesses other than the complainant testify that at the time of the assault the complainant was in financial arrears, she was in the process of being evicted, and her account with the telephone company was delinquent. However, because the defendant was not allowed to question the complainant about these matters or about her claim against Washington Heights, the jury could not \u201cmake a discriminating appraisal of the possible biases and motivations\u201d of the complainant. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tracey, </em>675 F.2d 433, 437 (1st Cir. 1982). When we have decided that a trial judge committed no error or only harmless error in striking questions by a defendant designed to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility, it has been because the equivalent information was communicated to the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>370 Mass. 548, 572, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 943 (1976) (no error to exclude questions regarding witness\u2019s motive to seek government favor where his plea agreement with prosecution was recounted to the jury); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>360 Mass. 746, 750 n.3 (1972) (any possible error was harmless because excluded testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>was cumulative, inasmuch as there was other testimony giving the same information); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>346 Mass. 107, 120 (1963) (no prejudice to defendant where excluded question had in substance been covered by previous question and answer); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>327 Mass. 641, 648 (1951) (if there was error, it was immediately cured by permitting witness to answer same or similar question). In this case the judge allowed no other testimony by the complainant regarding her intent to recover financial compensation for the assault she had suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Finally, the Commonwealth asserts that defense counsel was able to \u201cforcefully argue\u201d his theory of bias to the jury in his closing argument. We disagree. Our review of the record leads us to the contrary inference that the defense was inhibited, presumably by the judge\u2019s exclusion of the bias questions, from forthrightly presenting its theory to the jury. On the other hand, on several occasions the prosecutor rhetorically asked the jury what possible motive could cause the complainant to accuse the defendant falsely of rape. This line of argument clearly implicated the excluded inquiries as to bias and bolsters our conclusion that we are not dealing here with harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">2. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention that he was prejudiced by an alleged conflict of interest on the part of his original counsel, Mr. Fisher, due to the latter\u2019s representation of the complainant in her postconviction civil claim. Because of Mr. Fisher\u2019s timely withdrawal from the case prior to the defendant\u2019s probable cause hearing, we draw no inferences of conflict of interest. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>391 Mass. 76, 77 (1984) (conflict of interest resulted from attorney\u2019s representation of both defendant and prosecution witness at time of trial); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>386 Mass. 165 (1982) (where partner of defendant\u2019s attorney represented prosecution witness at time of trial, conflict of interest resulted).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">3. Only one of the other issues raised by the defendant \u2014 the admission in evidence of a 1964 rape conviction of the defendant \u2014 is likely to recur at a new trial. Both prior to and during his trial the defendant moved to bar the Commonwealth from using the conviction to impeach his testimony. The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>fendant argued that the admission of the prior rape conviction would be highly prejudicial while not probative of his credibility. The defendant\u2019s motions were denied and the conviction was admitted in evidence with appropriate limiting instructions by the trial judge. The defendant now contends that the judge\u2019s ruling constituted reversible error under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>392 Mass. 466, 470 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Initially this court held that G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, which states that a criminal conviction of a witness \u201cmay be shown to affect his credibility,\u201d did not grant a trial judge discretion to exclude evidence of a witness\u2019s conviction, once offered by the prosecution. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>West, </em>357 Mass. 245 , 249 (1970). Recognizing the danger of unfair treatment \u201cwhen evidence is admitted of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction of a similar crime, particularly a crime not reflecting previous untruthfulness,\u201d we qualified our position in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>372 Mass. 736, 750 (1977). There we noted that \u201cwe would not deny the right of a judge to avoid any question of unfairness by excluding such evidence in a situation where the likely prejudice to the defendant is most intense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>392 Mass. 466, 470 (1984), we went one step further and granted the defendant the right to appellate review of a judge\u2019s discretionary ruling admitting evidence of a prior conviction. While we indicated that appropriate limiting instructions by the judge and proper use of the evidence by the prosecutor are factors to consider in reviewing the judge\u2019s ruling, we emphasized in <em>Maguire </em>the importance of \u201csubstantial similarity of the crimes\u201d in determining whether the \u201cdanger of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470-471.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">We have not yet had occasion to reverse a conviction due to a judge\u2019s abuse of discretion in admitting a prior conviction. In light of our conclusion that the defendant is entitled to a new trial, we need not and do not decide whether the judge erred in this case. We note, however, that the circumstances in which the defendant\u2019s prior conviction was admitted in evidence posed the very danger of unfairness which has motivated the progression of our thinking on this issue. \u201cThe danger of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>prejudice most clearly arises when the prior convictions are similar in nature to the indictments on trial. ... It is firmly and wisely established in our law that no defendant should be convicted of a crime by proof of his reputation or propensity to commit similar crimes. ... It is reasonable for us to be confident that in most cases limiting instructions accomplish their intended purpose. Nevertheless, in cases like the instant one, where the evidence subject to limitations has an extremely high potential for unfair prejudice, we have a duty to be skeptical as to the effectiveness of limiting instructions. . . . There is only one appropriate remedy when evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction is offered which is highly prejudicial and which has little or no probative value even upon the limited issue for which it is received. That remedy is to exclude it . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMarzo, </em>364 Mass. 669, 680-682 (1974) (Hennessey, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">4. Because there was error in the trial judge\u2019s exclusion of questions on cross-examination designed to demonstrate bias of the rape complainant, we reverse the judgments, set aside the verdicts, and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-6\"> By virtue of his employment, the defendant had master keys to all the apartments.

I depart, however, from the implication that the judge may have abused his discretion in admitting the defendant\u2019s prior rape conviction for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>392 Mass. 466 (1984), we ruled that it is appropriate to grant appellate review of a judge\u2019s ruling admitting evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s prior conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 470. \u201cThe question on appeal will normally be whether there was an abuse of discretion in admitting evidence of a prior conviction because the danger of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of the evidence of a prior conviction for the purposes of impeachment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>eluded that there was no abuse of discretion in <em>Maguire </em>because \u201c[t]he judge twice gave appropriate limiting instructions, and the prosecution did not misuse that evidence in its argument to the jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The majority has now suggested that it might reverse the convictions if upon retrial the judge admits the defendant\u2019s prior conviction of rape. I would conclude that no abuse of discretion would exist if, as in the first trial, the judge gives appropriate and strong limiting instructions and ensures that the prosecutor does not misuse the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Evidence of a prior conviction, especially of a violent crime or one involving dishonesty, is probative as to the defendant\u2019s credibility as a witness. See Advisory Committee Note to First Draft of Proposed Fed. R. Evid. 609(a), reprinted in 46 F.R.D. 161, 297 (1969) (\u201cA demonstrated instance of willingness to engage in conduct in disregard of accepted patterns is translatable into willingness to give false testimony\u201d). A reasonable basis exists, therefore, for the legislative determination that evidence that the defendant has been found guilty of a failure to conform his conduct to the legal norms of society should be brought to the jury\u2019s attention, as an aid in evaluating the defendant\u2019s sincerity and reliability as a witness. The judge\u2019s role should generally be limited to preventing misuse of the evidence, through appropriate limiting instructions and careful monitoring of the prosecutor\u2019s use of the evidence at trial. Only in extreme circumstances, not shown to be present here, would I conclude that the danger of unfair prejudice <em>required </em>the exclusion of such evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
