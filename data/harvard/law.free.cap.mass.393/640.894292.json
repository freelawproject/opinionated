(Systems Corp.). He brought this action in the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>alleging, in \u201cCount One,\u201d that Boston Mutual violated the contract by refusing to pay him long-term disability benefits and alleging, in \u201cCount Two,\u201d that such violations constituted an unfair and deceptive act under G. L. c. 93A. The plaintiff filed a motion for partid summary judgment on his contract claim, together with supporting affidavits. Boston Mutual opposed the motion and submitted its own affidavits. Based upon this record, a judge of the Superior Court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion and granted summary judgment to Boston Mutual on both counts of the complaint. Subsequently the plaintiff filed an application for direct appellate review which we allowed. We now reverse the entry of summary judgment and remand the case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">We summarize the facts as presented in the judge\u2019s findings and affidavits and exhibits of both parties. In June, 1978, Boston Mutual issued a group insurance policy to Systems Corp., the plaintiff\u2019s employer. The group policy provided for payment of long-term disability benefits, as well as for life, accidental death and dismemberment, and accident and sickness insurance to eligible employees. In 1979, the group policy was amended to provide that the effective date of coverage for employees hired after June 25, 1978, with respect to long-term disability and accident and sickness benefits, was \u201cthe 1st day of the insurance month following one year of employment.\u201d The policy\u2019s long-term disability coverage was subject to a 180 day elimination period as well as a \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d exclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Excluded from the policy\u2019s long-term disability coverage was \u201cany disability commencing during the first twelve months that the insurance is in force with respect to the Employee if the disability is caused or contributed to by, or is a consequence of, a disease or injury for which the Employee received medical treatment, or services, or took prescribed drugs or medicines during the three month period immediately prior to the Effective Date of such insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">As self-administrator of the group policy, Systems Corp. assumed such functions as enrolling members, providing claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>information, providing premium reports, and filling out and distributing to eligible employees insurance certificates supplied by Boston Mutual. Systems Corp. also submitted a monthly group transaction report to Boston Mutual informing the insurer of additions to, deletions from, and changes in the coverage of eligible employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The plaintiff began his employment with Systems Corp. on August 11, 1980. He was hospitalized for hepatitis from July 8 to July 24, 1981, and then from July 31 to August 8, 1981. He returned to work on a full-time basis on October 5, 1981, and was terminated due to his continued disability from hepatitis on October 13, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The plaintiff testified in his deposition that he received a group insurance certificate through his employer sometime between July 8 and July 31, 1981. The certificate, issued by Boston Mutual, showed the benefits to which he was entitled under the group policy. At the top of the first page of this certificate, Systems Corp. filled in an erroneous effective date of June 25, 1981, for the plaintiff\u2019s long-term disability and accident and sickness coverage. The subsequent provisions of the certificate contained no further references to the effective date of coverage. However, according to the terms of the group policy, which the plaintiff never received, his effective date was September 1, 1981.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The significance of this conflict of dates is the applicability of the policy\u2019s pre-existing condition exclusion. If the plaintiff\u2019s effective date was June 25, 1981, he was entitled to benefits for his July disability; if his coverage was not effective until September 1, 1981, his disability falls within his three-month exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Systems Corp. paid premiums to Boston Mutual on the plaintiff\u2019s behalf for a period beginning June 25, 1981, and added the plaintiff\u2019s name to its monthly transaction report as eligible for benefits as of that date. On July 31, 1981, the plaintiff filed a claim with Boston Mutual for accident and sickness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>benefits. On his claim form Systems Corp. again supplied the erroneous June 25 effective date. Based upon this date Boston Mutual paid the plaintiff accident and sickness benefits for the twenty-six week period between August 8, 1981, and January 7, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">On March 1, 1982, the plaintiff applied to Boston Mutual for long-term disability benefits. On June 4, 1982, Boston Mutual denied his claim, alleging that the plaintiff\u2019s disability arose within three months of his September 1, 1981, effective date and therefore was excluded from coverage. The plaintiff contends he was due benefits based upon an effective date of June 25, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">On appeal the plaintiff argues: (1) That Systems Corp. acted as an agent of Boston Mutual in filling out his certificate and therefore Boston Mutual is bound by the erroneous effective date appearing on his certificate, and (2) where there is a conflict in the terms of an individual certificate and group policy, that conflict should be resolved in favor of the insured. We are presented with issues of first impression<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> over which courts elsewhere are divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">On a motion for summary judgment \u201cthe inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts . . . must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Hub Assocs. </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>357 Mass. 449, 451 (1970), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Diebold, Inc., </em>369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962). The motion judge should enter summary judgment only if the pleadings and affidavits of the parties demonstrate \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). We will uphold an order for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>summary judgment on review only if \u201ccertain factors converge to convince us that the trial judge was ruling in this case on undisputed facts and, of course, that his ruling was correct as matter of law.\u201d <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 556 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Here, the underlying facts are virtually undisputed. The issue instead is what inferences can be drawn from these facts and whether in light of such inferences a jury \u201ccould find with reason what is required for liability in cases of this type.\u201d <em>Richey v. American Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>380 Mass. 835,838 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Applying these principles, we conclude that the motion judge erred in granting summary judgment to Boston Mutual. The judge ruled that Systems Corp. was not acting as Boston Mutual\u2019s agent in filling out the plaintiff\u2019s certificate; that Boston Mutual therefore could not be held responsible for System Corp. \u2019s error; and that the terms of the plaintiff\u2019s group policy regarding his effective date must prevail over the conflicting provision in his certificate. We conclude that the crucial issue of agency presents a triable question for the jury, and if the jury were to find- such agency, the applicable law is such that a verdict for the plaintiff would be warranted on count one, sounding in contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">1. <em>Agency.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">A conflict of authority exists over whether an employer acts as agent for the insured or the insurer in administering group policies. 1 J.A. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 43 (rev. ed. 1981). In arguing that Systems Corp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>acted solely on behalf of its employees, Boston Mutual relies upon cases following the older \u201cconventional\u201d rule. <em>Id. </em>at 89 n.2, and cases cited. These authorities reason that an employer serves its own interests and those of its employees \u2014 rather than the adverse interests of the insurer \u2014 when it assumes administrative responsibilities. <em>See Norby </em>v. <em>Bankers Life Co., </em>304 Minn. 464, 468-470 (1975) (discussing and rejecting characterization of employer as agent of the insured). With the tremendous expansion of the group insurance market, a growing minority of courts have come to realize that the insurer is equally benefited by employer-administered plans. \u201cIt cannot be said that the employer acts entirely for its own benefit or for the benefit of its employees in undertaking administrative functions. While a reduced premium may result if the employer relieves the insurer of these tasks, and this, of course, is advantageous to both the employer and the employees, the insurer also enjoys significant advantages from the arrangement. The reduction in the premium which results from employer-administration permits the insurer to realize a larger volume of sales, and at the same time the insurer\u2019s own administrative costs are markedly reduced.\u201d <em>Elfstrom </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>67 Cal. 2d 503, 512-513 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">An agency \u201cresults from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 1 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Inferring the existence of an agency, a number of courts have held insurers responsible for administrative errors committed by employers (or other group policyholders) who act on their behalf. See, e.g., <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dorman, </em>108 F.2d 220, 222-223 (9th Cir. 1939); <em>Clauson </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>195 F. Supp. 72, 80 (D. Mass.), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 296 F.2d 76, 79 (1st Cir. 1961) (applying Delaware law); <em>Blue Cross-Blue Shield </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>56 Ala. App. 678, 684 (1975); <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, </em>32 Cal. 3d 649, 659 (1982); <em>Elfstrom, supra </em>at 512-513; <em>Woodard </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>350 So.2d 948, 952 (La. App. 1977); <em>Norby, supra </em>at 470; <em>Hirsch </em>v. <em>Travelers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number><em>Ins. Co., </em>153 N.J. Super. 545, 553 (1977); <em>Baum </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>357 P.2d 960, 964 (Okla. 1960); <em>Paulson </em>v. <em>Western Life Ins. Co., 292 </em>Or. 38, 48 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Whether or not the employer acts as the insurer\u2019s agent is a factual question to be resolved on a case by case basis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Among the criteria to consider are (1) whether the task is expressly delegated to the employer by the insurer; (2) whether the employer\u2019s performance is subject to the insurer\u2019s supervision and control; (3) whether there is any evidence of collusion between employer and employee to defraud the insurer. <em>Norby, supra </em>at 472-473. <em>Paulson, supra </em>at 48-51. Some courts which have addressed the specific issue as to whether a group policyholder acts as an agent when filling out individual insurance certificates have held that an agency does exist for this purpose. See, e.g., <em>Dorman, supra </em>at 222-223; <em>Loubat </em>v. <em>Audubon Life Ins. Co., </em>170 So.2d 745,748 (La. App. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In light of such decisions, we conclude that it is for the jury to decide whether Systems Corp. acted as Boston Mutual\u2019s agent in completing the plaintiff\u2019s insurance certificate. Systems Corp. acted as an intermediary in receiving these certificates from the insurer, filling in names, policy numbers, and effective dates, and distributing the certificates to eligible employees. The certificate was the only part of the insurance contract received by the employees. Systems Corp. also paid premiums to Boston Mutual, submitted claims forms, and transmitted monthly transaction reports all of which, in the plaintiff\u2019s case, carried the incorrect effective date of his coverage. We cannot agree with the motion judge that as a matter of law no agency relationship existed by which Boston Mutual could be charged with Systems Corp.\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>2. <em>Conflict Between Certificate and Policy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Boston Mutual argues that, since it is not bound by the clerical error committed by Systems Corp., the terms of the group policy regarding the plaintiff\u2019s effective date are controlling. The judge agreed, reasoning that the language of the certificate eliminated any ambiguity regarding the plaintiff\u2019s effective date. On its face, the certificate states that it \u201cis issued in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Group Policy. This certificate will in no way void any of the terms and conditions outlined in the Policy but will show the benefits to which the Employee is entitled.\u201d In resolving the conflict between the documents by deferring to the policy\u2019s terms, the judge adopted the rule established in such cases as <em>Page </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>231 Ala. 405, 407-408 (1936); <em>Standard of Am. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Humphreys, </em>257 Ark. 618 (1975); <em>Morrison Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>152 Ga. App. 885 (1980); <em>Adair </em>v. <em>General Am. Life Ins. Co., </em>124 S.W.2d 657 (Mo. App. 1939); <em>Transport Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Karr, </em>491 S.W.2d 446 (Tex. Civ. App. 1973).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by these authorities.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The better view \u2014 and \u201cthe present weight of authority\u201d \u2014 holds that where insurance certificates create ambiguities in the extent of coverage, and particularly where conflicts exist between the terms of the certificate and the group policy, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>language of the certificate, where more favorable to the insured, prevails. Appleman, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 46, at 155-159. See, e.g., <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Crown Life Ins. Co., </em>696 F.2d 1343, 1345 (11th Cir. 1983) (applying Florida law); <em>Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>519 F.2d 475, 478 (6th Cir. 1975) (applying Tennessee law); <em>Lecker </em>v. <em>General Am. Life Ins. Co., </em>55 Hawaii 624, 632 (1974); <em>Davey </em>v. <em>Louisiana Health Serv. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>357 So.2d 1170, 1174-1175 (La. App. 1978); <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Reliance Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>21 Pa. D. &amp; C. 2d 603, 607 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Only two reported cases concern a conflict between certificate and policy terms regarding the effective date of an employee\u2019s coverage. In both the courts resolved the conflict in favor of the insured and found the certificate\u2019s terms controlling. <em>Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y </em>v. <em>Wagoner, </em>269 So.2d 747, 748 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1972). <em>Exstrum </em>v. <em>Union Casualty &amp; Life Ins. Co., </em>167 Neb. 150, 160 (1958) (applying Illinois law). It is noteworthy that this result was reached in the <em>Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y </em>case despite a clause in the certificate notifying the insured that the certificate \u201cis furnished in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Group Policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 748. See also <em>Lecker, supra </em>at 631 (insured entitled to rely on certificate despite proviso that benefits are subject to policy\u2019s terms). The result reached in this line of cases \u201ccan be easily justified upon the ground that the individual certificate is the only instrument which the employee sees at any time, and that if the insurer chooses to draft and to issue these certificates in language selected by it, then it cannot be heard to complain that such language does not express the intention of the parties.\u201d Appleman, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 46, at 158. This principle is equally applicable if the insurer acts through an agent in preparing and issuing the certificates.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">While this court has not had occasion to decide what terms shall apply in cases of conflict between the certificate and policy, it has long held that \u201cambiguities in insurance policies must be construed in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Slater </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>379 Mass. 801, 808 (1980). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>also <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>387 Mass. 142, 146 (1982). In <em>Cody, supra </em>at 148-149, we noted that marketing group insurance policies through the workplace may result in misleading contracts which violate public policy. We also warned insurers of potential liability for misleading insurance literature prepared and distributed by employer-policyholders. <em>Id. </em>at 150 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Boston Mutual contends that in the context of group insurance, no contract arises between the employee and insurer until the effective date of the employee\u2019s coverage as determined by the group policy. According to this reasoning, the plaintiff could not properly accept the insurer\u2019s contract offer until September 1, 1981, and therefore no contract existed in June, 1981, the effective date appearing on the certificate. We do not find this argument persuasive. See <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>292 Mass. 575, 580-581 (1935) (employee becomes party to insurance contract upon application and payment of premiums). See also <em>Krause </em>v. <em>Washington Nat\u2019l Ins., </em>255 Or. 446, 456-457 (1970). Because we agree with the motion judge that the contract formed between the plaintiff and Boston Mutual consisted of both the certificate and policy, we also reject the insurer\u2019s contention that enforcing the June, 1981, effective date would create insurance coverage by estoppel. Courts which deny relief to the insured for this reason do not consider the certificate part of the insurance contract. Accordingly to bind an insurer to errors contained in the certificate would create coverage beyond the contract. See <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>546 S.W.2d 477, 481-486 (Mo. App. 1976) (because insurance contract consists of certificate and policy, general rule as to creation of coverage by estoppel does not apply); <em>Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y, supra </em>at 748 (where contract consists of policy and certificate construed together, conflicts between the two are resolved to provide broadest coverage).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">We conclude that a verdict for the plaintiff on the count in contract would be warranted, if evidence as shown in the affidavits and exhibits of the parties is produced at the trial. We therefore reverse the order entering summary judgment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Boston Mutual and remand the case for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b653-7\"> Neither of these provisions applied to accident and sickness coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\"> Since the plaintiff was not actively at work on September 1, 1981, his effective date, according to the policy, was postponed until his return to full-time employment in October, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\"> We are, however, guided by certain long-standing principles of insurance law. This court was one of the earliest to recognize that a contract of insurance is formed between the individual employee and insurer under a group insurance policy. <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>292 Mass. 575,580-581 (1935). While we have not decided what constitutes this contract, we have looked to an employee\u2019s insurance certificate \u201cwhich took the place of the ordinary insurance policy\u201d to determine contract terms. <em>Wing </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>314 Mass. 269, 271 (1943).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b656-9\"> The judge also ruled that the plaintiff had not relied upon the erroneous effective date in the certificate, and the parties also discuss that concept in their arguments. Presumably they are concerned with certain cases where certificates or employee literature indicated coverage different than the master policy, and the courts of several States have decided in favor of the plaintiffs based on equitable principles of reliance and estop-pel. See, e.g., <em>Krauss </em>v. <em>Manhattan Life Ins. Co., </em>700 F.2d 870 (2d Cir. 1983); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Continental Life &amp; Accident Co., </em>93 Idaho 348 (1969); <em>Riske </em>v. <em>National Casualty Co., </em>268 Wis. 199 (1954). We need not consider whether such reasoning would support a recovery for the plaintiff under Massachusetts law, because the proof offered here falls far short of showing that the plaintiff relied to his detriment upon the representations of the certificate as to effective date of coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\">In <em>Wing </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>314 Mass. 269, 271 (1943), this court found that an employer was not acting as an agent of the insurer-defendant with regard to receiving notice of an employee\u2019s disability. The employee\u2019s certificate stated that such notice was to be received by the insurer. <em>Wing </em>did not pose the question as to whether the employer acted as an agent with regard to preparing and distributing the employees\u2019 certificates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\"> Several of these cases are factually distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>Adair </em>and <em>Page, </em>the certificates did not expressly contradict the policies but simply omitted the relevant terms. The <em>Page, </em>court noted, <em>supra </em>at 408, that \u201c[i]f [the certificate\u2019s] terms definitely contradict those of the master policy on a material point ... the rule of liberal construction should be applied in favor of the certificate holder.\u201d In <em>Standard of Am. Life Ins. Co., supra </em>at 621, the court emphasized the certificate\u2019s explicit reference to the challenged provision of the group policy. In this case the certificate made no reference to the policy\u2019s effective date provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\"> In an influential case relied upon by the motion judge, the court readily admits that \u201cJustice is not well served by this rule of law.\u201d <em>Morrison Assurance Co., supra </em>at 888. Constrained by judicial precedent, the court criticizes the older rule for placing the burden upon the employee to obtain the policy and discover any inconsistencies within its complex provisions thereby violating \u201cthe spirit of the trend toward consumer protection now recognized in all areas of the law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\"> See cases cited <em>supra </em>at 645-646.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\">We need not reach the plaintiff\u2019s G.

Central to the court\u2019s analysis of the issues raised by this appeal is its conclusion \u2014 erroneous in my opinion \u2014 that there is a contract between the plaintiff and Boston Mutual.

Co., </em>237 Mass. 467, 471 (1921). \u201cWhat the contracting parties intended, mutually agreed to, and their minds met upon, is the measure of their obligations.\u201d <em>Elsey </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>262 F.2d 432, 434-435 (10th Cir. 1958), quoting <em>Mofrad </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>206 F.2d 491, 493 (10th Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">In <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>292 Mass. 575 (1935), we held that a plaintiff employee had become a party to the contract between his employer and the insurance company under a group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>insurance policy. We based that holding on an analysis of the facts of the case, the terms of the policy, and the terms of the plaintiff\u2019s application. <em>Id. </em>at 580. In <em>Shea, </em>the master policy held by the employer did not, in and of itself, provide coverage for any employee. Rather, the master policy contemplated that coverage would be offered to any eligible employee on the terms stated in the master policy. Employees could accept that offer by making an application and authorizing deductions from their wages. The employees provided consideration in the form of contributions toward the cost of the premiums. <em>Id. </em>at 581. Those facts clearly support the court\u2019s conclusion that a contract was formed between the employee and the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Today, the court abandons the rationale underlying our decision in <em>Shea, </em>and holds that under <em>any </em>group insurance policy, regardless of the terms of the policy or the intentions of the parties, there is a contract between the insurance company and the employee. By finding such a contract in this case, the court ignores the most basic principles of contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Under the terms of the master policy held by the plaintiff\u2019s employer, all employees of the plaintiff\u2019s class were covered under the policy as soon as they met the requirements for eligibility. The policy did not contemplate any offer to, or acceptance by, individual employees. Although the plaintiff did fill out an application for insurance, under the terms of the contract between Systems Corp. and Boston Mutual that application was not a requisite for coverage under the policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Any employee who met the eligibility requirements was covered, regardless of whether he or she had previously assented to coverage or was even aware that the policy existed. See <em>Bass </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>10 Cal. 3d 792, 797 n.3 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Except in circumstances not relevant here,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cthe formation of a contract requires a bargain in which there is a manifestation of mutual assent to the exchange and a consideration.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 17 (1) (1981). Under no reasonable construction of the terms of the policy or the certificate can a contract between the plaintiff and Boston Mutual be found. The master policy does not call for or require a \u201cmanifestation of assent\u201d to the exchange by the employees. The employees need not even be aware of the policy to be covered. The only \u201cmanifestation of assent\u201d is between the employer and the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Nor does the policy require that employees provide consideration for their coverage under the policy, since the premiums are paid entirely by Systems Corp. Some courts have reasoned that under a noncontributory plan, the employee gives consideration by forgoing other employment and by completing the eligibility waiting period. See, e.g., <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>546 S.W.2d 477, 484 (Mo. App. 1976). However, such reasoning ignores the requirement that the consideration be \u201cbargained for\u201d \u2014 i.e., that it induce the making of the promise and that the promise induce the furnishing of the consideration. Restatement (Second) of Contracts, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 71 comment b. Where the employee has no knowledge of coverage or of the length of the waiting period for eligibility, it cannot be said that he or she forgoes other employment or completes the waiting period in exchange for the promise to insure. Other courts have found consideration in the employer\u2019s payment of premiums, noting that the economic effect is the same as if the employee had received the premium and paid the insurer directly. See, e.g., <em>Morris, supra </em>at 484. See also <em>Lecker </em>v. <em>General Am. Life Ins. Co., </em>55 Hawaii 624, 631 (1974). That reasoning ignores the fact that generally the employee has no right to obtain cash in lieu of the premium payment and therefore the premium payment is not given by the employee \u201cin exchange\u201d for coverage. It is not consideration to give up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>something one does not have. Even if the employer is obligated to provide insurance coverage as part of the employees\u2019 compensation under the terms of the employment contract, that does not create a contract between the insurance company and the employee. In such a case, the employee works in exchange for the employer\u2019s promise to obtain insurance, not the insurer\u2019s promise to insure.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The terms of the master policy indicate an intent by Systems Corp. and Boston Mutual to enter a contract which was com-. p\u00edete in and of itself. Although the policy called for Systems Corp. to deliver certificates to employees, that does not thereby make the employees parties to the contract. I am confident that the court would not hesitate to hold Boston Mutual liable to an employee who was eligible for coverage under the policy regardless of whether he or she had received a certificate from the employer. Such an employee\u2019s rights under the policy derive not from the certificate but from his or her status as a third-party beneficiary to the contract between Systems Corp. and Boston Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Because the plaintiff is only a third-party beneficiary to a contract between Systems Corp. and Boston Mutual, it follows that Systems Corp. could not bind Boston Mutual by erroneously describing the terms of that contract to the plaintiff. The contract called for Boston Mutual to supply certificates to Systems Corp. In filling out those certificates, Systems Corp. was not doing anything on behalf of Boston Mutual. It cannot rightly be said that Systems Corp. was authorized to unilaterally change the terms of its contract with Boston Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">This analysis is consistent with the results, if not the language and the express rationale, of many of the cases cited by the court. If the master policy contemplates the formation of separate contracts with individual employees, and the insurer relies on the employer to solicit employees or to provide information on the terms of the coverage, under principles of agency law the insurer may, in some circumstances, be bound by the erroneous representations of the employer. See, e.g., <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dorman, </em>108 F.2d 220 (9th Cir. 1939); <em>Clauson </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>195 F. Supp. 72 (D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Mass. 1961); <em>Blue Cross-Blue Shield </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>56 Ala. App. 678 (1975); <em>Elfstrom </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>67 Cal. 2d 503 (1967); <em>Paulson </em>v. <em>Western Life Ins. Co., </em>292 Or. 38, 48 (1981). Cf. <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>387 Mass. 142, 149 n.14 (1982). Even when the master policy does not contemplate that employees will enter separate contracts with the insurance company, if the employee relies on representations of the employer, either the employer, the insurance company, or both, may be liable under equitable principles of estoppel. \u201c[T]he crucial consideration in dealing with [a] claim of estoppel is not what [the employer] and [the insurance company] may have thought they were doing, but the impact of their inaction and action upon a reasonable man in [the employee\u2019s] position\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Clauson </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>195 F. Supp. 72, 79 (D. Mass. 1961). See, e.g., <em>Norby </em>v. <em>Bankers Life Co., </em>304 Minn. 464, 468-470 (1975); <em>Hirsch v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>153 N.J. Super. 545, 553 (1977); <em>Baum </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>357 P.2d 960, 964 (Okla. 1960); <em>Boucher </em>v. <em>Valus, </em>298 A.2d 238 (Conn. Cir. Ct. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In a case such as this, however, where there is no contract between the plaintiff and the insurer, and no reliance on the erroneous information supplied by the employer, the terms of the master policy must determine the obligations of the parties. To the extent that the cases cited by the majority are to the contrary, I do not find their analysis persuasive and would decline to follow them.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Because the plaintiff was not eligible for long-term disability benefits under the terms of the policy, and because, as the court acknowledges, there is nothing to suggest that he relied on the erroneous information in the certificate, Boston Mutual was entitled to summary judgment on the contract claim. The Superior Court judge also granted summary judgment to Boston Mutual on the plaintiff\u2019s G. L. c. 93A claim. Rule 56 of Mass. R. Civ. P., 365 Mass. 824 (1974), authorizes a judge to grant summary judgment only upon a motion by a party. Because neither party had moved for summary judgment on the G. L. c. 93A claim, I would reverse the entry of summary judgment on that count and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\"> The relevant portion of the policy states: <em>\u201cEffective Dates of Insurance: </em>If this Policy provides insurance on a contributory basis, eligible employees may become insured only by making written application to the Company through the Policyholder on forms furnished by the Company. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">\u201cIf this Policy provides insurance on a non-contributory basis, the insurance of any employee shall become effective on his eligibility date.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\"> See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 17, 82-94 (1981).
