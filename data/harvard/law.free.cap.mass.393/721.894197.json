L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 (6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Reed Nat\u2019l Corp. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>388 Mass. 336 (1983), this court held that the board of review (board) of the Division of Employment Security, in its first determination of this same issue, did not make findings sufficient to support its conclusion that there was no stoppage. <em>Id. </em>at 340. We therefore remanded the case to the board for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 341. The board, on remand, reviewed the evidence and reaffirmed its original decision allowing the claimants to recover unemployment benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The decision was affirmed by a District Court judge and came here for direct review, pursuant to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">We briefly reiterate some of the principles by which we are guided in reviewing the board\u2019s determination whether there was a \u201cstoppage of work\u201d under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(b). </em>\u201cA \u2018stoppage of work\u2019 begins with a \u2018substantial curtailment\u2019 of the employer\u2019s operations, and the stoppage of work ends when that substantial curtailment no longer exists. \u201d <em>Reed Nat\u2019 l Corp., supra </em>at 338. The question of a \u201csubstantial curtailment of the employer\u2019s operations is. primarily a question of fact for the board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339. In reviewing this decision, we are mindful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>of the deference due the board\u2019s expertise, experience, and technical competence. See <em>id. </em>See also <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec. </em>v. <em>Fingerman, </em>378 Mass. 461,463 (1979). We turn to the corporation\u2019s challenge to the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">On appeal, the corporation claims error in the board\u2019s decision on the grounds that the decision is unsupported by substantial evidence, is erroneous as a matter of law,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and violates the public policy of this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The corporation contends that the board, on remand, made no significant, additional findings to justify its second decision; in the absence of such findings, the company argues, \u201cthe agency\u2019s decision cannot stand even if supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>387 Mass. 776, 779 (1982). In issuing its second decision, the board specifically noted the following findings: (1) five workers at the Westfield plant had been laid off due to lack of work prior to March 4, 1981, the day the strike began; (2) the corporation had relocated \u201ca considerable, but unspecified, amount of work\u201d from the Westfield plant to another of its plants during the disputed period; (3) the twenty-five per cent drop in production pertained to the Westfield plant only; and (4) \u201cthere [was] no evidence that the employing unit exceeded the time reasonably necessary . . . to . . . resume substantially normal production in August 1981 or did anything to continue the stoppage.\u201d The board\u2019s original decision and the additional findings reveal that the board viewed \u201cthe drop in production and the decreased number of employed production workers, as compared with those figures from the previous year, in the context of all the circumstances, including the over-all status of the corporation\u2019s operations\u201d in determining whether there was a stoppage of work. <em>Reed Nat\u2019l Corp., supra </em>at 340. We conclude, therefore, that the board made sufficient findings to warrant its determination that there was no stoppage of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>The corporation next argues that that decision is erroneous as a matter of law because \u201c[i]t is not a large step for the Court to hold that a twenty-five percent decrease in production is a substantial stoppage of work.\u201d However, the \u201cdiversity of factual situations which might arise in future cases,\u201d see <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>378 Mass. 51, 56 (1979), militates against the application of a simple formula in determining the existence of a \u201cstoppage of work.\u201d Thus, the demonstration of a twenty-five per cent drop in production<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> without more does not warrant the conclusion that there was a \u201cstoppage of work\u201d as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s assertions, the decisions in <em>Adomaitis </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>334 Mass. 520 (1956), and <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>349 Mass. 358 (1965), do not establish that the board\u2019s decision was erroneous as a matter of law. In <em>Adomaitis, supra </em>at 522, the disruption in delivery of materials to the company resulted in a thirty-five per cent drop in production. The board found no similar disruption here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>General Elec. Co., supra </em>at 364, the employer was forced to relocate work to an outside entity; here, however, the board found that the plaintiff had relocated work to another of its own plants. See <em>Reed Nat\u2019l Corp., supra </em>at 340 n.8. The plaintiff, in short, failed to convince the board that production was substantially curtailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Last, the plaintiff maintains that the board\u2019s decision violates the public policy of this Commonwealth. That decision, the plaintiff argues, \u201cpermits the intrusion of the state into the collective bargaining process as a direct ally of the Union and forces Reed National to subsidize a strike against itself.\u201d But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>the board did not award benefits until five months after the strike began, by which time the employing unit had returned to substantially normal production. Simply stated, there was no longer any strike which could be financed by the use of unemployment compensation funds. The decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\"> General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(b), </em>as amended through St. 1967, c. 480, \u00a7 3, provides in relevant part: \u201cNo waiting period shall be allowed and no benefits shall be paid to an individual under this chapter for \u2014 ... <em>(b) </em>Any week with respect to which the director finds that his unemployment is due to a stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute at his factory, establishment or other premises at which he was employed. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\"> \u201cOn remand the board of review may [make a determination] on the evidence in the record or on additional evidence.

The plaintiff furnished no evidence suggestive of a drop in production in its entire operation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b736-8\"> Although the plaintiff introduced evidence that \u201c[cjertain truckers\u201d refused to cross picket lines, the record does not indicate that materials failed to reach the Westfield plant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
