The plaintiff appeals.directly to this court pursuant to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42. The plaintiff argues that the division\u2019s decision was improper because the plaintiff was denied sufficient notice of the scope of inquiry at the hearing and because the decision was not supported by substantial evidence. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The plaintiff was hired as a salesman on December 14,1981, by Data Associates, Inc. (Data), a distributor of business forms. His salary was paid solely on a commission basis. During the period of his employment, the plaintiff consistently failed to meet the monthly sales quota set by Data, principally because of the plaintiff\u2019s outside ventures and the state of the economy. Despite the contention of the plaintiff that he was terminated in October, 1982, the review examiner found that in August, 1982, Data terminated the plaintiff\u2019s employment for failure to meet the sales quota.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following his termination by Data, the plaintiff continued to contact his personal business accounts on behalf of Diversified Business Systems (Diversified). The plaintiff\u2019s only compensation for this solicitation was that a $5,700 debt owed to Diversified was reduced by the amount that the plaintiff normally would have earned as commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The plaintiff filed a claim for unemployment compensation benefits on October 7, 1982, and on November 5 the division approved the plaintiff\u2019s application. Pursuant toG.L.c. 151A, \u00a7 39 (\u00a3&gt;), Data requested a hearing on this determination. Notice of the hearing was sent to the parties, stating that the issue to be determined was whether the plaintiff was available for work and had made an adequate search for work. At the hearing Data was represented by its president and the plaintiff represented himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The review examiner (examiner) determined that the plaintiff was ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits. He found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201csearch for work is of such a minimal amount that he is devoting the major portion of his time in self employment. \u201d Therefore the plaintiff was not in \u201ctotal unemployment,\u201d as that term is defined in G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 1 (r), and hence was not entitled to benefits under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 29 <em>(a). </em>The plaintiff\u2019s application for review by the board of review, pursuant to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 41, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">On appeal to the District Court, the plaintiff argued that the notice of hearing failed to inform him adequately that the issue of his self-employment would be considered, and that the examiner\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. The District Court judge rejected these arguments and the plaintiff reasserts them here on further appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">1. <em>Notice. </em>The notice of hearing received by the plaintiff advised him that the issue to be heard would be whether \u201cthe claimant was capable of and available for work and has made an adequate search for work. (Section 24 [b] MGL Chapter 151 A).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that this language failed to provide him with sufficient prior notice that the question of his self-employment would be considered at the hearing; as a result he was unprepared to present evidence or rebut allegations on this issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the plaintiff argues that the decision was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u201cupon unlawful procedure,\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) <em>(d). </em>We conclude that the form notice sufficiently apprised the plaintiff that his self-employment would be an issue at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Logically, a claimant cannot be \u201cavailable for work\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 24 <em>(b) </em>if the claimant is already employed by another or is self-employed. Therefore, one aspect of the determination of the plaintiff\u2019s availability for work must, of necessity, be whether the plaintiff was otherwise employed in some fashion. We hold that the examiner properly inquired into this issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">We note further that at the hearing the plaintiff never objected to the consideration of his availability for work, never expressed surprise that the issue was being considered, and never requested a continuance or additional time to provide evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In fact, the transcript establishes that the plaintiff was satisfied that he had presented all relevant evidence on this issue. The plaintiff cannot now be heard to complain that he was deprived of a fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">2. <em>Substantial evidence. </em>The examiner found that the plaintiff was not in \u201ctotal unemployment,\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 1 <em>(r) </em>(2), because the plaintiff spent \u201cthe major portion of his time in self employment.\u201d The plaintiff contends that this conclusion was not supported by substantial evidence, within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) <em>(e). </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The Legislature has directed that in our review of decisions adopted by the division\u2019s board of review, we are to \u201cgive due weight to the [board\u2019s] experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge ... as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3. The decision that the plaintiff was not \u201cavailable for work\u201d is a question of fact entrusted to the informed judgment of the division. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment </em>Sec., 376 Mass. 551, 555 (1978). When, as here, the examiner decides that the plaintiff has failed to sustain his burden of persuasion in proving eligibility <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>384 Mass. 758, 761 [1981]), we can set aside that finding only if it is unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>Abramowitz </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>390 Mass. 168, 173 (1983). <em>Nantucket Cottage Hosp. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>388 Mass. 1006 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 1 (r) (2), as appearing in St. 1951, c. 763, \u00a7 1, states that an individual is in total unemployment when \u201che performs no wage-earning services whatever, and for which he receives no remuneration, and in which, though capable of and available for work, his is unable to obtain any suitable work.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s claim that there was no evidence as to the amount of time he spent in efforts to generate sales for Diversified is beside the point. From the plaintiff\u2019s own statements at the hearing<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it is apparent that he was performing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>some services for which he received remuneration. Furthermore, from his statement that he called on only about two prospective employers per week, the examiner could have inferred that the plaintiff was spending the major portion of his time in self-employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The plaintiff maintains, however, that since the commissions he would have received from Diversified were applied wholly to reduce a preexisting debt, he received no \u201cremuneration,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1 (r) (2). \u201cRemuneration\u201d is defined by \u00a7 1 (r) (3), as amended through St. 1976, c. 473, \u00a7 3, as \u201cany consideration, whether paid directly or indirectly, including salaries, commissions and bonuses, and reasonable cash value of board, rent, housing, lodging, payment in kind and all payments in any medium other than cash, received by an individual ... (2) as net earnings from self-employment. \u201d The plaintiff asserts that since only his debt was reduced, he had no \u201cnet earnings,\u201d and therefore received no \u201cremuneration.\u201d We cannot accept this interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Our task is to interpret the statute \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975), quoting <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983). The Legislature, by its broad definition of \u201cremuneration,\u201d obviously intended to include all forms of compensation for services rendered, whether in cash or in kind, from which a claimant might derive some benefit, except those specifically excluded by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In other contexts, we have defined \u201cearnings\u201d as \u201crecompense for service or exertion,\u201d and \u201cnot necessarily synonymous with \u2018gains\u2019 or \u2018profits.\u2019\u201d <em>Arey </em>v. <em>George Assocs., </em>299 Mass. 130, 135 (1937). See <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Eastern R.R., </em>138 Mass. 122,128-129 (1884). We have also interpreted the words of this statute according to their ordinary meaning. <em>Worcester Telegram Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>347 Mass. 505, 513-514 (1964). \u201cNet earnings\u201d is commonly defined as \u201cthe excess of earnings over expenses.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1644 (2d ed. 1957). Here, the plaintiff produced no evidence of expenses. As we have often stated, the burden of proving eligibility is on the plaintiff. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra. Stadig </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>379 Mass. 172, 174 n.2 (1979). <em>Sohler </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 785, 788 n.1 (1979). Thus, once the question of self-employment was in issue, the plaintiff had the burden to prove expenses in an effort to show that he lacked net earnings. Having failed to carry this burden, the plaintiff\u2019s contention that he did not receive \u201cremuneration\u201d fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Rather than take the compensation due him as cash commissions, the plaintiff elected to apply it to a preexisting debt. In either case, the plaintiff\u2019s financial position would be enhanced directly as the result of services he performed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>this reduction of debt constitutes \u201cremuneration\u201d under the statute.* ****<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We also conclude that the decision by the examiner was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\"> The examiner found that Data had condoned this activity for several months and therefore found no evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s discharge was \u201cattributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest.\u201d G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 (e) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\">General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 24, as amended through St. 1977, c. 720, \u00a7 26, states: \u201cAn individual, in order to be eligible for benefits under this chapter, shall <em>... (t\u00ed) </em>Be capable of and available for work and unable to obtain work in his usual occupation or any other occupation for which he is reasonably fitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The notice of hearing used by the division is a form that lists several commonly heard issues, along with boxes to check those issues applicable in a given case. The availability issue was the only one so marked on the form received by the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b496-9\">In relevant part, 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.02 (10) (c) (1979) states: \u201cThe notice [of hearing] shall provide sufficient notice of the issues involved so that the Parties may have a reasonable opportunity to prepare and present evidence and argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">\u201cIf the issues cannot be fully stated in advance of the hearing, they shall be fully stated as soon as practicable. In all cases of delayed statement, or where subsequent amendment of the issues is necessary, sufficient time shall be allowed ... to afford all Parties reasonable opportunity to prepare and present evidence and argument respecting the issues.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b497-8\"> The plaintiff contends that the examiner recognized at the hearing that the availability issue was not properly before him. The plaintiff then claims to be prejudiced by the examiner\u2019s consideration of this issue later in the hearing. Our review of the transcript does not support these assertions. However, even if we accept the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of the transcript, we find no prejudice to the plaintiff, since we have already held that the plaintiff received adequate prior notice that his availability for work would be considered. It is therefore irrelevant whether or not the examiner, at some point in the hearing, became confused about the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The examiner did consider another issue for which no advance notice was given to the plaintiff. However, this issue was resolved in favor of the plaintiff, and therefore no prejudice has resulted. See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b497-10\"> On October 28, 1982, the plaintiff signed and submitted to the division a statement of facts addressing this issue. The notice of hearing was dated November 30, 1982. It is clear that the plaintiff was aware that the issue of his self-employment jeopardized his eligibility for benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b498-6\"> We quote from the hearing transcript:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">Examiner: \u201cWhat do you do for Diversified?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">Plaintiff: \u201cAs he has mentioned, on a couple of small accounts I\u2019ve been able to get some business from these accounts because I had no other place to go.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">Examiner: \u201cNow this Diversified Business Systems, you sold business then to two small accounts?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-12\">Plaintiff: \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve gotten a few small \u2014 a couple of small orders from Honeywell.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-14\">Examiner: \u201cWhen did you get those orders?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Plaintiff: \u201cSome time in October or November.

Since the plaintiff failed to present evidence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>this issue, he likewise failed to carry his burden of establishing eligibility for partial unemployment benefits, as provided for in \u00a7 29 <em>(b). </em>See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>384 Mass. 758, 761 (1981). Therefore, there was no need for the examiner to consider the issue of partial unemployment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b501-11\"> The defendant argues that net earnings need not be proved in order to establish self-employment when the claimant has performed \u201cwage-earning services\u201d pursuant to G.
