The Appellate Tax Board (board), on remand from this court, <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Watertown, </em>387 Mass. 298, 308 (1982) <em>(Watertown I), </em>determined to value Edison\u2019s property by giving 97% weight to the property\u2019s net book cost (or rate base value) and 3% to its depreciated reproduction cost (DRC).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The assessors contend that the board\u2019s decision was erroneous as a matter of law and that the board\u2019s original valuation at 95% DRC and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>5% net book cost must be reinstated. We conclude that the board\u2019s determination is not erroneous as a matter of law and therefore we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Pursuant to the remand, the board reopened the case \u201cfor the introduction of further evidence by the parties, a) on the [DRC] methodology of valuation and more particularly pertaining to the basis for the rates of depreciation utilized by the experts; b) on the circumstances in this case that would induce a willing buyer to pay more than the rate base value of the personalty or the value placed on the property by the Board; [and] c) any other evidence which will assist the Board in determining fair market value of the property.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hearings were held on August 1 and 2, 1983, at which Edison presented evidence through seven witnesses; the assessors did not introduce any evidence. On February 3, 1984, the board, in its findings of fact and report, stated that Edison \u201cby persuasive evidence [had] established the absence of . . . special circumstances\u201d which would induce a willing buyer to pay more than rate base value for the personal property held by Edison in Watertown. The board further found that the assessors had failed to sustain their burden to offer \u201csome evidence ... to show that, because of such circumstances, the relevance of rate base value is put in question.\u201d <em>Montaup Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Whitman, </em>390 Mass. 847, 855 (1984). Thus, on remand the board adopted the figures of Edison\u2019s expert \u2014 computed on the rate base approach \u2014 in its final valuation of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">On appeal, the assessors concede that there is substantial evidence for a finding based on either net book cost or DRC or some combination of the two. Their contention, here made for the first time,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is that they had successfully demonstrated \u201ca reasonable basis in logic for ignoring ... the fact that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>potential buyer, if it were a public utility, would be considerably influenced by the return to which it would be limited on whatever investment it made,\u201d <em>Watertown I, supra </em>at 304, and that the board\u2019s original decision, according almost complete weight to the DRC method, was therefore justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The assessors rely on New York law for the proposition that special purpose property must be valued at DRC. The real property tax law of New York provides that a \u201cspecial franchise\u201d be assessed annually at its \u201cfull value.\u201d N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law \u00a7\u00a7 600(1), 606(1) (McKinney 1984). \u201cFull value\u201d has been interpreted to mean DRC in the case of \u201cspecial franchise\u201d property: \u201cIt has consistently been held that the proper and accepted method for the valuation of a \u2018specialty\u2019 is reproduction cost new less depreciation, except in a case where, because of the newness of the property, actual construction cost may adequately and fairly reflect its value.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization &amp; Assessment, </em>101 Misc. 2d 910, 913-914 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1979), modified on other grounds, 83 A.D.2d 355 (N.Y. App. Div. 1981), aff\u2019d, 58 N.Y.2d 710 (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After an extensive study, New York codified its standard in N.Y. Admin. Code tit. 9, \u00a7\u00a7 197-1.1,197-3.2 (1983). Section 197-3.2 mandates that the tangible property of electric corporations be valuated at \u201cthe reproduction cost new, less depreciation of the tangible property.\u201d See generally New York State Board of Equalization &amp; Assessment, Report on Special Franchise Assessment Administration 18-29 (1983) (cases collected).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Massachusetts law, however, requires assessors to base valuation of special purpose property on the \u201cfair cash valuation\u201d of the taxable property. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 38. \u201cFair cash valuation,\u201d as our cases have stated repeatedly, means fair market value. See, e.g., <em>Watertown I, supra </em>at 301. Unlike New York, we have no special study or regulation which compels the board to utilize DRC as the dispositive figure for the valuation of Edison\u2019s Watertown property. Thus, the board did not err as a matter of law in using the Massachusetts standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The assessors next ask us to apply an \u201cintrinsic value\u201d formula to the Edison property on the authority of our decision in <em>Mashpee Wampanoag Indian Tribal Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Mashpee, </em>379 Mass. 420 (1980). We find nothing in <em>Assessors of Mashpee </em>which affects our holdings in <em>Watertown I </em>or in <em>Montaup Elec. Co. </em>In <em>Assessors of Mashpee, supra </em>at 421, we held it \u201cproper to determine fair cash value from the intrinsic value of the property\u201d in circumstances in which land, subject to deed restrictions, was not saleable. We did not, however, abandon the requirement that the assessors strive to determine the fair cash value of the property. <em>Watertown I, supra </em>at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The assessors further contend that (1) nothing in the record establishes the economic obsolescence of Edison\u2019s business or of the Watertown property; (2) a willing purchaser might pay a premium over net book cost; and (3) the Department of Public Utilities (DPU) might allow a rate base greater than net book cost to a purchase.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These assertions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">On remand, Edison introduced evidence through several expert witnesses that DPU\u2019s ceiling on the future stream of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Edison\u2019s earnings constituted economic depreciation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, while the board <em>might </em>have found that a willing purchaser might pay a premium over net book cost, and <em>might </em>have concluded that the DPU might increase the allowed return to a prospective purchaser, Edison again furnished more than ample evidence to support the board\u2019s determinations to the contrary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since the board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, there is no basis to disturb its findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">We are left, in the end, with a record in which the assessors did not avail themselves of the opportunity to explain, \u201cby reference to substantial evidence or to reasoned principle, why a buyer would want to pay more than Edison\u2019s net book value, when by investing the same dollars elsewhere that buyer could obtain a better return.\u201d <em>Watertown I, supra </em>at 304-305. The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-13\"> \u201cThe [DRC] approach involves, for each item of property, a determination of its value based on the current cost of reproducing it, reduced by physical, functional, and economic depreciation. The net book cost, or the rate base value, of property is its cost when first devoted to public use, reduced by accrued depreciation\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Watertown I, supra </em>at 300-301.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\"> The board would \u201cnot admit further testimony on net book cost of [Edison\u2019s] property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b524-8\">General Laws c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as amended through St. 1983, c. 72, \u00a7 2, reads in pertinent part: \u201cThe court shall not consider any issue of law which does not appear to have been raised in the proceedings before the board. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b525-6\"> The assessors also direct us to the \u201cfamous case\u201d of <em>People ex rel. N.Y. Stock Exch. Bldg. Co. </em>v. <em>Cantor, </em>221 A.D. 193, 195 (1927), aff\u2019d mem., 248 N.Y. 533 (1928), where the court valued the New York Stock Exchange building at its DRC, despite the company\u2019s argument that the building did not \u201cenhance the value of the land except \u2018as a tear-down proposition.\u2019\u201d The New York court would not permit the property to escape taxation when \u201cthe market value would be difficult, if not impossible, to find.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197. But even then, the relevant New York statute required that property be assessed \u201cat the full value thereof,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 196, as distinct from G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 38, which demands a determination of the \u201cfair cash valuation\u201d of the taxable property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\"> We noted previously the DPU\u2019s \u201capparently longstanding position . . . that, if a regulated utility sells an asset to another regulated, public utility, the basis of that asset in the hands of the transferee remains the same as that of the transferor for rate-making purposes. Thus, if Edison were to sell any of its taxable personal property in Watertown to another public utility, that other utility would be allowed a return on the transferred property based on that property\u2019s net book . . . value, and not on any higher purchase price it might have paid.\u201d <em>Watertown I, supra </em>at 301.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b527-7\">For example, one of Edison\u2019s expert witnesses testified that: \u201cEconomic depreciation is that part of the cost approach which reflects the realities of the marketplace. Now a utility property has its earnings restricted. And in any approach in the determination of market value, it\u2019s important that I incorporate the realities of the marketplace. So if I ignored the fact that the utilities earnings are restricted by leaving the economic depreciation out of my cost approach, I would have simply determined the physical cost of the property and not what a willing buyer would pay for this property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\"> Another of Edison\u2019s witnesses testified as follows: \u201cMy opinion is that a well informed and willing buyer would have no reason, no economic and rational reason, to pay a premium above net book cost for the property in question. And having no reason, he would not do so.\u201d The witness later added: \u201c[I] have already dismissed before the possibility that the DPU would allow a return higher tiian the fair net book. So that possibility is out.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
