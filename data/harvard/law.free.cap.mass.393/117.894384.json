She alleged four counts: negligence, misrepresentation, assault and battery, and breach of warranty. Pursuant to G. L. c. 231, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u00a7 60B, the Superior Court convened a medical malpractice tribunal which directed dismissal of all counts against the doctors, and of two counts against MGH, unless the plaintiff posted bond. The plaintiff did not post bond, and a Superior Court judge allowed the doctors\u2019 motions to dismiss with prejudice. Two counts against MGH remained viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In July, 1983, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (4) and (6), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), the plaintiff, by new counsel, requested that the Superior Court vacate the judgments in favor of the doctors. Rule 60 (b) provides that \u201c[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party . . . from a final judgment ... for the following reasons: . . . (4) the judgment is void;. . . or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d In her motion the plaintiff contended, inter alla, that because she was not a \u201cpatient who was engaged in treatment\u201d the medical malpractice tribunal \u201cdid not have subject matter jurisdiction over [her] causes of action . . ., and the decision of the Tribunal ... as well as the Judgments which were entered thereon are void and a nullity and should be set aside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Stating that \u201c[u]nder Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (4), the judgment of the Medical Malpractice Tribunal is void,\u201d a Superior Court judge vacated the judgments and reported two questions to the Appeals Court. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111. The judge took no action on the motion in so far as it sought relief under rule 60 (b) (6), nor did his report address the plaintiff\u2019s rule 60 (b) (6) arguments. We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for direct appellate review. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Rule 60 (b) (4) allows relief only from void judgments. A court must vacate a void judgment. It may not vacate a valid one. No discretion is granted by the rule. See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (4), Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Civil Procedure at 586 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The plaintiff argues that because the medical malpractice tribunal \u201cdid not have subject matter jurisdiction\u201d the judgments entered in the Superior Court are void. But she errs, as did the Superior Court judge, by focusing on the <em>tribunal\u2019s </em>authority. Rule 60 (b) (4) concerns the authority of <em>courts. </em>The Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>perior Court had \u2014 and indeed still has \u2014 jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s civil action. \u201cJurisdiction concerns and defines the power of courts, encompassing the power to inquire into facts, apply the law, make decisions and declare judgment.\u201d <em>Police Comm\u2019 r of Boston </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Dorchester Dist., </em>374 Mass. 640, 662 (1978). Since the Superior Court had the authority to declare the judgments, they are not void, and rule 60 (b) (4) affords the plaintiff no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s real complaint is that the Superior Court judge erred by convening the medical malpractice tribunal. We express no opinion about that contention except that it is not relevant to a rule 60 (b) (4) motion. \u201cA void judgment is to be distinguished from an erroneous one . . . .\u201d <em>Lubben </em>v. <em>Selective Serv. Sys. Local Bd. No. 27, </em>453 F.2d 645, 649 (1st Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Because the Superior Court judge did not address the plaintiff\u2019s rule 60 (b) (6) argument, we do not reach it. Nor need we reach the reported questions. See <em>McStowe </em>v. <em>Bornstein, </em>377 Mass. 804, 805 n.2 (1979). We reverse the order of the Superior Court judge vacating the judgments entered in favor of the doctors, and remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
