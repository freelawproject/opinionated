The trial judge found for the sellers, and the defendant (buyer) claimed a report to the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division dismissed the report, and the buyer appeals here. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The sellers owned and operated a business called Reinhardt Signs. On July 1, 1973, they entered into a written agreement with the buyer for the purchase and sale of the business. The buyer\u2019s lawyer drafted the agreement. The sellers had no lawyer. The agreement contained the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201c1. Seller sells to buyer or his nominee, all his right, title and interest in his business of sign manufacture and the like including the good will thereof as a going concern, stock in trade, fixtures, equipment, tools, effects, book accounts and other debts now due and owing to seller upon account or in respect of said business, and all securities for same, and also all contracts and engagements, benefits, and advantages, which have been entered into by seller, or to which he is or can be entitled on account or in respect of said trade or business and the real estate situated at 57 Walnut Street, Fall River, Massachusetts. 66</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">\u201c2. Buyer purchases above described property from seller and agrees to pay therefor to seller Fifty Thousand ($50,000) Dollars payable as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">\u201c(a) Twenty five hundred ($2,500) Dollars upon the execution of the Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">\u201c(b) Twenty-two thousand five hundred ($22,500) Dollars at the time of performance, transfers and conveyances called for by this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-11\">\u201c(c) Balance of Twenty-five Thousand to be paid at the rate of Five Thousand ($5,000) Dollars which includes imputed interest at the rate of 6% per year at the end of each said year if the net profit after taxes accruing each year ending June 30th to the business of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Reinhardt Signs is sufficient in each said year to cover that amount and, if not, in each and every year thereafter when such sufficient amount exists until fully paid. The Buyer shall pay to the Seller six percent (6%) interest per annum each and every year on the unpaid balance on all monies owed for each said year, if any. 66</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">\u201c11. It is further agreed that Stephen Kolakowski and Emil Kolakowski shall work for a period of One (1) year from the date of sale as employees of Leigh D. Finney, or nominee, to aid with the manufacturer [sic], painting, repairing and sale of signs at the following wages and that Emil Kolakowski and Stephen Kolakowski shall be paid the net weekly compensation of One hundred ($100) Dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">In accordance with paragraph 2 the buyer paid the sellers $2,500 when they signed the agreement and $22,500 on August 16, 1973, when they transferred the assets to him. In the agreement the parties assigned a value of $42,400 to the tangible assets transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The sellers received a letter dated April 9, 1974, from the buyer\u2019s lawyer which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">\u201cI have been contacted by the accountant for Finney Advertising Companies, Inc., which is the nominee referred to in the above mentioned agreement. Inasmuch as Finney Advertising Companies, Inc. is fulfilling Mr. Finney\u2019s part of the contract with you, would you kindly acknowledge by signing the enclosed copy of this letter and returning to me in the return envelope that your salaries are being paid by Finney Advertising Companies, Inc. as the nominee superseding Mr. Finney\u2019s position in his agreement with you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">They signed and returned the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">As he recounts in his brief, the buyer testified at trial that Finney Advertising Companies, Inc., \u201cowned and managed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the business known as Reinhardt Signs until it became defunct in early January, 1982 or late December 1981.\u201d Although the District Court judge made no express finding on this issue, we infer from the letter of April 9, 1974, supported by the buyer\u2019s testimony, that sometime before April 9,1974, the buyer transferred the Reinhardt Signs business to Finney Advertising Companies, Inc. The buyer also recounts that he testified that \u201csaid business never in the years of operation made a profit of over $5,000.00 as contemplated by the Agreement.\u201d We will assume, favorably to the buyer, that neither Reinhardt Signs nor Finney Advertising Companies, Inc., made a profit in excess of $5,000 in any year.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">A year after the transfer of the assets the buyer paid $300 in interest to the sellers, but he made no further payment. On August 17, 1976, the sellers brought an action in the District Court for $1,500 in interest. Nearly five years later they amended their complaint. The amended complaint sought $25,000 plus accrued interest. Trial followed on two counts: breach of contract and deceit. The judge found for the sellers on the contract and awarded them $25,000 plus $ 1,703 interest. He ordered judgment for the buyer on the deceit count. The buyer claimed a report to the Appellate Division, and the Appellate Division dismissed the report. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">At trial the buyer requested several rulings that the judge denied. Those requests adequately preserved for appeal the two arguments that the buyer advances here. First, he argues that when the sellers signed the April 9, 1974, letter and returned it to his lawyer, they agreed to release him from his obligation to pay them and to look instead to Finney Advertising Companies, Inc., for payment. Second, he argues that the agreement required him to \u201cpay the balance of $25,000.00 of the purchase price only upon the contingency that he made a profit of $5,000.00 in each succeeding year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Before we address the buyer\u2019s substantive contentions, we briefly consider whether the buyer has a right of appeal to this court. The sellers originally sought $1,500.00, an amount below the threshold for prompt removal to the Superior Court established by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104. Had the sellers not amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>their complaint to assert a $25,000.00 claim, the buyer, within ten days after receipt of notice of the Appellate Division\u2019s decision, could have caused the case to be transferred to the Superior Court for a new trial. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104. <em>Orasz </em>v. <em>Colonial Tavern, Inc., </em>365 Mass. 131, 134-140 (1974). <em>McGloin </em>v. <em>Nilson, </em>348 Mass. 716, 718-719 (1965). There is authority in our cases on both sides of the question whether a defendant in that position may elect to forgo a trial in the Superior Court and instead appeal directly here. See <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>389 Mass. 809, 811 n.4 (1983); <em>Kingsley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>383 Mass. 874 (1981); <em>Pupillo </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>381 Mass. 714, 715 (1980); <em>Fusco </em>v. <em>Springfield Republican Co., </em>367 Mass. 904, 906 (1975); <em>Orasz </em>v. <em>Colonial Tavern, Inc., supra at </em>139. However, we need not now decide that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">A party who, at the time of the Appellate Division\u2019s decision, cannot remove his case to the Superior Court, clearly does have a right of appeal to this court. See <em>Conroy </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>392 Mass. 216, 216 n. 1 (1984). In this case the sellers amended their complaint to assert a claim above G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104\u2019s, threshold. With respect to a claim over its threshold, General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 104, provides that a party may claim a trial in the Superior Court within twenty-five days after \u201cservice of the pleading which asserts the claim ... on which the right to remove is based.\u201d The word \u201cpleading\u201d includes \u201cpapers such as the complaint, answer, and reply which frame the issues.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., </em>320 F. Supp. 1381, 1385 (E.D. Pa. 1969). The amended complaint served precisely the function of the original complaint: it set forth the sellers\u2019 legal theories and the relief sought. It was a pleading. We hold, therefore, that G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104, authorized the buyer to claim a trial in the Superior Court within twenty-five days after service of the sellers\u2019 amended complaint. Because he did not do so, he waived his right to have the case transferred to the Superior Court after the Appellate Division\u2019s decision. Therefore the Appellate Division\u2019s decision was final, and the buyer properly appealed directly to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>We proceed to the merits. The buyer states in his brief that the sellers assented \u201cto the substitution of parties to the Agreement by virtue \u00f3f their assent to [the letter of April <em>9, </em>1974] .... The reference to the fact that the substituted corporation was the entity paying the plaintiffs\u2019 salaries was merely parenthetical.\u201d This interpretation of the letter is untenable. The letter\u2019s opening language, \u201cI have been contacted by the accountant for Finney Advertising Companies, Inc.,\u201d established a context for the subsequent request. The letter dealt with an accounting matter, not a substitution of parties to a $50,000 agreement. It asked the sellers to \u201cacknowledge . . . that your salaries are being paid by Finney Advertising Companies, Inc.\u201d They did that and no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The buyer apparently bases his argument on the letter\u2019s reference to Finney Advertising as \u201cthe nominee superseding Mr. Finney\u2019s position in his agreement with you.\u201d This reference offers the buyer no support. Paragraph 11 of the agreement, which concerns the employment of the sellers, provides that the sellers shall work for one year \u201cas employees of Leigh D. Finney, <em>or </em>nominee\u201d (emphasis added). Paragraph 1 provides that \u201cSeller sells to buyer <em>or his nominee\u201d </em>(emphasis added). But the word \u201cnominee\u201d nowhere appears in paragraph 2, the paragraph concerning the buyer\u2019s obligation to pay the sellers. The sellers obligated themselves to the buyer or his nominee, but they agreed to look for satisfaction to the buyer only. Fairly interpreted, the letter\u2019s reference to \u201cthe nominee superseding Mr. Finney\u2019s position in his agreement with you\u201d referred to paragraph 11, not to the crucial paragraph 2. \u201cThere is no novation until the creditor accepts the new debtor in full substitution for the former one and thus completely releases the old debt.\u201d <em>Tudor Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>University Distrib. Co., 292 </em>Mass. 339, 341 (1935). The sellers did not do that. Their signing and returning the letter in no way affected the buyer\u2019s obligation under paragraph 2 of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">We move, then, to a discussion of that obligation. The buyer asserts in his brief that the agreement requires him to \u201cpay the balance of $25,000.00 of the purchase price only upon the contingency that he made a profit of $5,000.00 in each succeed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>ing year.\u201d \u201cThe purpose of stating a condition in the contract,\u201d he writes, \u201cwas to achieve the effect of a discharge from liability if the event does not happen.\u201d Apparently the buyer takes the position that the sellers\u2019 claim against him must be dismissed because the sellers failed to prove at trial that Reinhardt Signs made a profit exceeding $5,000 in any year. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Paragraph 2 states that the buyer \u201cagrees to pay ... to seller Fifty Thousand ($50,000) Dollars. \u201d Clause (c) of that paragraph provides: \u201cBalance of Twenty-five Thousand <em>to be paid at the rate </em>of Five Thousand ($5,000) Dollars which includes imputed interest at the rate of 6% per year at the end of each said year if the net profit after taxes accruing each year ending June 30th to the business of Reinhardt Signs is sufficient in each said year to cover that amount and, if not, in each and every year thereafter when such sufficient amount exists <em>until fully paid\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The final sentence of clause (c) calls for the buyer to pay six percent interest <em>\u201ceach and every year </em>on the unpaid balance on all monies owed for each such year, if any\u201d (emphasis added). These provisions express the intention that the buyer would pay the sellers $50,000. We think that the parties intended that Reinhardt Signs\u2019 profitability could affect the timing of payments, but not the ultimate obligation to pay. If the buyer continued to operate Reinhardt Signs in good faith, the agreement required him to pay $5,000 to the sellers only in years that the business proved sufficiently profitable. We do not think, however, that the parties intended to allow the buyer to discharge his obligation to the sellers by transferring Reinhardt Signs\u2019 business to a nominee corporation which thereafter became defunct. We cannot believe that the parties intended to transfer for only $25,000 assets which they valued at $42,400! If the agreement be ambiguous in that regard, it is properly construed against the buyer because his lawyer drafted it. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Auth. </em>v. <em>Perini </em>Corp., 349 Mass. 448, 454 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\"><em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Guillow, </em>224 Mass. 1 (1916), relied on by the buyer, does not support his position. In that case, unlike this one, the parties agreed to condition the defendant\u2019s liability on the occurrence of a subsequent event.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
