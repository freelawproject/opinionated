L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C, the \u201clocal mandate\u201d provision of St. 1980, c. 580 (Proposition <em>2Vt). </em>In 1983, the Legislature amended G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1, to require that \u201c[e]ach school committee shall provide transportation for any pupil attending ... an approved private school within the boundaries of the school district, provided, however, that the distance between said pupil\u2019s residence and the private school said pupil attends exceeds two miles or such other minimum distance as may be established by the school committee for transportation of public school students.\u201d St. 1983, c. 663, \u00a7 1 (Chapter 663).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the \u201clocal mandate\u201d provision of Proposition <em>2xh, </em>see <em>infra </em>at 696-698, the Legislature made no appropriations in the same session to cover the additional costs mandated by Chapter 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Chapter 663 took effect on January 1,1984. St. 1983, c. 663, \u00a7 3. Lexington decided not to bus private school students after the enactment of Chapter 663: It estimated the cost of providing Chapter 663 services at $21,750 for February through June,</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">1984, and $51,000 for the 1984-1985 school year. Newton, pursuant to Chapter 663, instituted transportation of an additional 420 private school students at a cost of $64,616 for the second semester of 1983-1984 and an estimated cost of $220,000 for services in 1984-1985.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Lexington and the school committee of Lexington (Lexington) sought a declaratory judgment, G. L. c. 231 A, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County that Chapter 663 was ineffective to require Lexington to furnish such transportation. Newton and the school committee of Newton (Newton) thereafter filed a similar action, and the single justice allowed a motion to consolidate. All parties filed motions for summary judgment. The single justice allowed the parties\u2019 joint motion to reserve and report the consolidated cases without decision for determination by the full court. The core of the dispute is whether Chapter 663 is within the scope of G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C, and, if it is, whether Chapter 663 was enacted in compliance with that section. We conclude that, because there was no specific appropriation at the time Chapter 663 was enacted, there is no obligation on Lexington and Newton to provide private school students with transportation services beyond those required by G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1, prior to the enactment of Chapter 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">1. <em>Statutory background. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s claim for declaratory relief involves three separate but interrelated statutory provisions: G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C; G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1983, c. 663; and G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 7A. We examine each in turn. The \u201clocal mandate\u201d provision of Proposition 2V\u00e1 provides in relevant part: \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of any special or general law to the contrary: (a) Any law taking effect on or after Januaiy first, nineteen hundred and eighty-one, imposing any direct service or cost obligation upon any city or town shall be effective in any city or town only if such law is accepted by vote or by the appropriation of money for such purposes, in the case of a city by the city council in accordance with its charter, and in the case of a town by a town meeting, unless the general court, at the same session in which such law is enacted, provides, by general law and by appropriation, for the assumption by the commonwealth of such cost, exclusive of incidental local administration expenses and unless the general court provides by appropriation in each successive year for such assumption.\u201d G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C, as amended by St. 1981, c. 782, \u00a7 4. Among the concerns thus embraced by Proposition <em>IVz </em>were those of \u201cfreeing cities and towns from expenditures mandated by State law\u201d and of \u201cpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>venting the involuntary imposition on cities and towns of certain direct service or cost obligations resulting from statutes and administrative mies or regulations.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209, 216 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The relevant provision of G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1, was enacted in 1950. Its thrust was \u201cto afford private school students the same transportation as public school students.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 337 (1982). Prior to Chapter 663, G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1, required \u201cthat if the distance between a private school student\u2019s residence and the public school he is entitled to attend exceeds two miles, such child [was] to be afforded transportation to his private school up to the distance from his residence to the public school he is entitled to attend.\u201d G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1972, c. 766, \u00a7 12. Chapter 663, purporting to extend the transportation obligations of the cities and towns, followed on the heels of the <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Last, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 7A, sets forth the general scheme by which towns receive retroactive State reimbursement for expenses incurred in pupil transportation. The amount of reimbursement per pupil for transportation to private schools may not exceed the average per pupil cost for transportation to public schools. Such reimbursement is further limited to costs in excess of $5 per year per pupil and is subject to appropriation of funds by the Legislature as well as to the approval of the Commissioner of Education (Commissioner).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the basis of these several statutory provisions, we address the arguments of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">2. <em>Is Chapter 663 a \u201clocal mandate\u201d within the scope of G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C? </em>The parties stipulate that Chapter 663 \u201cimposes a direct service or cost obligation upon Lexington and Newton.\u201d The Commissioner and the Board of Education contend, however, that Chapter 663 is nonetheless immune from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>the requirements set forth in G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C. The defendants maintain that either: (1) \u201c[t]he Legislature was not imposing a \u2018new\u2019 local mandate in enacting Chapter 663\u201d and thus G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C, is inapposite; or (2) Chapter 663 was a \u201crule or regulation enacted or promulgated as a direct result of\u2019 a decision of this court and is thus an exception within G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C (g); or (3) the Legislature intended that Chapter 663 supersede the requirements of G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">First, the defendants\u2019 contention that Chapter 663 simply \u201crestored the status quo\u201d by reinstating rights in existence when Proposition <em>2lA </em>was passed is plainly wrong. Prior to Chapter 663, private school students had no right to busing beyond the distance to the nearest public school. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, supra </em>at 337. Chapter 663 was, therefore, \u201ca new law changing existing law,\u201d <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>130 Mass. 357, 360 (1881), and thus, lies within the purview of G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Second, we agree that G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C (g), exempts from the requirements of G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C (a), \u201cany costs to cities and towns . . . resulting from a decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, or to any law, rule or regulation enacted or promulgated as a direct result of such a decision.\u201d The defendants argue that Chapter 663 was enacted as a \u201cdirect result\u201d of <em>School Comm. of Essex </em>and is thus exempt from the \u201clocal mandate\u201d requirements. However, the <em>School Comm. of Essex </em>decision did not impose costs on the cities and towns. It merely set forth the extent of the statutory requirement for busing of private school students. If anything, the <em>School Comm. of Essex </em>decision limited the costs required to be expended by cities and towns for the busing of private school students.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The Legislature, in enacting G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C (g), exempted from the constraints of \u00a7 27C (a) any mandated costs or services which were not initiated by the Legislature and over which it has no control. Thus, the \u00a7 27C (g) exception applies to a \u201claw, rule or regulation enacted or promulgated\u201d which in <em>implementing </em>a court decision imposes costs on cities and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>towns. Because the increased costs mandated by Chapter 663 were not required by the <em>School Comm, of Essex </em>decision, Chapter 663 is not a \u201cdirect result\u201d of that decision within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Third, the defendants propose that Chapter 663 escapes Proposition 2 <em>Vi </em>because \u201cif a general and a specific statute cannot be reconciled, the general statute must yield to the specific statute, particularly where the specific statute was enacted after the general.\u201d See <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>New England LNG Co., </em>364 Mass. 109, 118-119 (1973). Reliance on that rule of statutory construction would negate the \u201clocal mandate\u201d provision of Proposition 21/z, the dictates of which pertain \u201c[notwithstanding any provision of any <em>special </em>or general law to the contrary\u201d to \u201c[ajny <em>law </em>imposing any direct service or cost obligation upon any city or town\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C. Nor is there any support for the defendants\u2019 alternative argument that the Legislature impliedly repealed G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C, with respect to Chapter 663. As the defendants themselves concede, Chapter 663 \u201cdoes not indicate any express amendment or repeal of section 27C, and indeed repeal by implication is not favored.\u201d See <em>Emerson College </em>v. <em>Boston, ante </em>303, 306 (1984). See also <em>American Grain Prod. Processing Inst. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, 392 </em>Mass. 309, 322 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>388 Mass. 115, 125 (1983). We conclude that Chapter 663, because it is a \u201claw taking effect on or after January first, nineteen hundred and eighty-one, imposing [a] direct service or cost obligation upon\u201d cities and towns, is subject to G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">3. <em>Did the Legislature enact Chapter 663 in compliance with the requirements of G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C (aft </em>Under G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C <em>(a), </em>a law mandating costs for a city or town must be accompanied, \u201cat the <em>same session </em>in which such law is enacted ... by <em>general law and by appropriation </em>for the assumption by the commonwealth of such cost\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, the law is ineffective \u201cunless the general court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>provides by appropriation in each successive year for such assumption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs assert that th\u00e9se requirements were not met in the case of Chapter 663. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The insistence, in G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C <em>(a), </em>on \u201csame session\u201d appropriation to be followed by appropriations \u201cin each successive year\u201d means that the Legislature envisioned a scheme wherein cities and towns would be reimbursed in advance \u2014 or, at least, contemporaneously \u2014 for costs incurred pursuant to the mandate. In any year in which the Legislature declines to anticipate those costs through a specific appropriation, the mandate lapses. This scheme most convincingly realizes \u201cthe requirement that the Commonwealth assume the cost, at least, of any new law or regulation imposing any direct service or cost obligation on any city or town without its consent.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019 n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209, 221 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The parties agree that St. 1983, c. 663, \u00a7 1, is a \u201cgeneral law\u201d mandating costs on the cities and towns and that there was no \u201csame session\u201d special appropriation by the Legislature to sustain the newly-mandated financial burden. Chapter 663, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 4,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> simply outline a method by which reimbursement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>may be sought by cities and towns after the costs have been incurred, but do not appropriate any funds.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Nor does G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 7A, pass muster as a \u201csame session\u201d appropriation in keeping with G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C <em>(a). </em>First, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 7A, reimbursement to cities and towns is made in the fiscal year after the costs are incurred. Second, such reimbursement is based on a consideration of all transportation expenditures and is not specifically targeted to assumption of Chapter 663 costs. Third, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 7A, payments are \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d; in other words, while G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 7A, may authorize reimbursement of Chapter 663 costs, it, in itself, does not effectuate such payment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The defendants in fact concede that \u201c[djuring the session in which it enacted St. 1983, c. 663, the General Court did not appropriate any money to cover the costs incurred in providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>transportation to private school pupils in accordance with Chapter 663.\u201d The defendants maintain that, because Chapter 663 did not impose any obligation until 1984, legislative appropriation in the 1984 session should satisfy G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C <em>(a). </em>See St. 1984, c. 188, item 7035-0004 (supplemental appropriation of $131,117 to make payments pursuant to \u00a7 2 of Chapter 663 for costs incurred in 1983-1984 school year); St. 1984, c. 234, item 7035-0004 (appropriation of $53,733,756 for reimbursement of cities and towns for fiscal 1984 expenditures for transportation of pupils pursuant to several statutory provisions, including G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 7A). The short answer is that the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C <em>(a), </em>is that funding be provided at the same time that a mandate is imposed on cities and towns.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Finally, the defendants maintain that the \u201csame session\u201d appropriation requirement of G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C <em>(a), </em>is fully met by the annual general appropriations bill containing additional unrestricted financial assistance to cities and towns. Such an approach would render the \u201clocal mandate\u201d provision of Proposition <em>2V2 </em>meaningless, for it would always be possible to attribute undesignated increases in State aid to the local mandate being challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Requiring the specific allocation of funds for each mandated service best effectuates the fiscal protection of local government that Proposition <em>2V2 </em>was designed to achieve. The Legislature is free to decrease unrestricted local aid or to use those funds specifically to implement Chapter 663 or other legislatively mandated costs. That is a legislative, not an agency, determination. Funds not directed by the Legislature to a specific program are discretionary and may be used by local authorities for any municipal purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">We hold that, because the Legislature did not assume the costs of Chapter 663 \u201cby general law and by appropriation\u201d in the 1983 session, the plaintiffs are not obligated to meet the additional transportation costs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They, of course, remain free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>to accept Chapter 663 of their own accord, as provided in G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C (a), and to seek reimbursement under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 7A. The case is remanded to the county court for entry of a judgment that Lexington and Newton are not required to provide private school students with transportation services beyond those required by G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1, prior to the enactment of Chapter 663.
