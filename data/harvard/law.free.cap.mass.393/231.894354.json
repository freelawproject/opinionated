Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion. The plaintiffs argue that the complaint should not have been dismissed because it alleged facts sufficient to support three claims: breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in an employment-at-will contract; defamation; and deceit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), the \u201caccepted rule\u201d is that \u201ca complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977), quoting <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41,45-46 (1957). Moreover, \u201cthe allegations of the complaint, as well as such inferences as may be drawn therefrom in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, are to be taken as true.\u201d <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Taking the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as true, the following events occurred. The plaintiffs are six nonunion, management employees of the defendant, New England Telephone and Telegraph Company (company).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the plaintiffs were employed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>company promised to evaluate the plaintiffs\u2019 job performance and promotability solely on the basis of merit. At some point after the plaintiffs began their employment, the company instituted a policy requiring employee evaluations to conform to a statistically determined distribution curve (Bell Curve). Once the Bell Curve was instituted, the plaintiffs all received poor evaluations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These poor evaluations did not reflect the merit of the plaintiffs\u2019 actual performances. Rather, the plaintiffs received low ratings to satisfy the demand of the Bell Curve that a predetermined percentage of employees receive low ratings. In sum, the plaintiffs claim that use of the Bell Curve resulted in \u201carbitrary, distorted, bad faith, and non-merit related\u201d evaluations of the plaintiffs\u2019 job performances. Due to these poor evaluations, the plaintiffs were either denied promotions or unjustly demoted. All of the plaintiffs suffered the loss of salary increases and corresponding pension benefits which they would have received had they been evaluated in good faith. The plaintiffs also suffered damage to their professional reputations, disruption of their personal lives, and great pain of body and mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">1. <em>Breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. </em>The plaintiffs argue that they have alleged facts sufficient to make a claim that the company is liable to them for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the employment-at-will contracts. See <em>Fortune </em>v. <em>National Cash Register Co., </em>373 Mass. 96 (1977).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not agree. Even if we assume that the company\u2019s use of the Bell Curve resulted in arbitrary, bad faith performance evaluations; that the company\u2019s bad faith actions led to the employees\u2019 constructive termination;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, further, that constructive, rather than ac-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tuai, termination would suffice under the <em>Fortune </em>rule, the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations nonetheless fall short of stating a claim. Cf. <em>Kravetzw. MerchantsDistribs., Inc., </em>387 Mass. 457,462 (1982). The plaintiffs have alleged no damages which they would be entitled to recover under a theory of breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">They assert that the loss of salary increases and corresponding pension benefits constitutes a compensable loss.* *****<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In awarding damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, \u201c[o]ur goal is and has been simply to deny to [the employer] any readily definable, financial windfall resulting from the denial to [the employee] of compensation for past services.\u201d <em>Gram </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>391 Mass. 333, 335 (1984) <em>(Gram II). </em>Thus, in <em>Fortune </em>v. <em>National Cash Register Co., supra, </em>the plaintiff recovered commissions for sales he had already made; in <em>Gram </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>384 Mass. 659 (1981) <em>(Gram </em>I), and in <em>Gram II, supra, </em>the plaintiff was entitled to recover renewal commissions on policies he had already sold; and in <em>Maddaloni </em>v. <em>Western Mass. Bus Lines, Inc., </em>386 Mass. 877 (1982), the plaintiff recovered commissions due him for his past service to the defendant employer (helping to obtain interstate charter rights). In each of these cases the plaintiffs recovered commissions they had already earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 argument seems to be that since the decision whether to promote them was based on an evaluation of their past performances, they had \u201cearned\u201d promotion (and its attendant increase in salary and pension benefits) by work performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>in the past. This argument ignores the impact of our recent decision in <em>Gram II. </em>There we held that, while the employee could recover renewal commissions on past sales because they constituted an \u201cidentifiable, future benefit . . . reflective of past services,\u201d <em>Gram II, supra </em>at 334, quoting <em>Gram I, supra </em>at 673, he could not recover \u201ccareer credits\u201d because they constituted \u201cfuture compensation for future services.\u201d <em>Gram II, supra </em>at 334. This was so even though the number of career credits the employee would have received was based on the length of his past service to the employer. Because the career credits were not specifically related to a particular past service, we held them not \u201c \u2018reflective of past services.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334 &amp; n. 1. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they earned their salary increases and increased pension payments through past work performance simply does not survive our decision in <em>Gram </em>II.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">2. <em>Defamation. </em>The plaintiffs also argue that they alleged facts sufficient to state a claim of defamation. In their brief, they claim that the poor evaluations were defamatory and that these evaluations \u201cwere published to at least one superior.\u201d These allegations do not support a claim of defamation. \u201cAn employer has a conditional privilege to disclose defamatory information concerning an employee when the publication is reasonably necessary to serve the employer\u2019s legitimate interest in the fitness of an employee to perform his or her job.\u201d <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 509 (1984). <em>See Sheehanv. Tobin, </em>326 Mass. 185,190-191 (1950), quoting W. Prosser, Torts \u00a7 94, at 837 (1941) (conditional privilege exists when publisher and recipient have a \u201ccommon interest\u201d and when \u201cthe communication is . . . reasonably calculated to protect or further it\u201d). Here the plaintiffs allege that their immediate supervisors communicated the defamatory material to the department head, in accordance with the company\u2019s stated policy of conducting employee evaluations. Such communication clearly serves \u201cthe employer\u2019s legitimate inter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>estfBratt, supra, </em>and is conditionally privileged. An employer can lose a conditional privilege through \u201cunnecessary, unreasonable or excessive publication\u201d on proof that the defendant acted \u201crecklessly.\u201d <em>Bratt, supra </em>at 515,516. Even if we assume that the immediate supervisor communicated the plaintiffs\u2019 poor evaluations to someone other than the department head, the plaintiffs have alleged no facts at all to prove that such publication was made recklessly. Thus, the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim of defamation because they have alleged nothing to overcome the company\u2019s conditional privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">3. <em>Deceit. </em>Finally, the plaintiffs contend that their complaint set out an actionable claim of deceit. We decline to consider this point, however. On appeal the plaintiffs simply state, in a cursory and conclusory fashion, that their complaint below made out a claim of deceit. They cite no legal authority to support their claim. This is \u201can insufficient appellate argument.\u201d <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, </em>377 Mass. 909, 909 (1979). Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elder, </em>389 Mass. 743, 747 n.9 (1983).'</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">We conclude that the judge properly dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim under which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\"> According to the defendant\u2019s memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss, the complaint before us is the second complaint, the first complaint having been dismissed without prejudice. The judge dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 second complaint \u201cfor the reasons stated in defendant\u2019s memorandum.\u201d The defendant\u2019s memorandum sought dismissal under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1) and (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). However, the defendant\u2019s memorandum contains no arguments to support dismissal under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1) (lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter). Therefore, we consider the complaint dismissed solely under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6) (failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\"> The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint also included allegations of reckless infliction of emotional distress and unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the course of trade or commerce in violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a711. Since the plaintiffs did not raise these claims on appeal, we do not consider them. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\"> The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint states that at all times relevant to the complaint the plaintiffs were employees of the defendant company. However, the plaintiffs\u2019 brief states that five of the six plaintiffs are no longer employed by the defendant and that they were constructively terminated by the defendant\u2019s bad faith actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b245-6\"> The plaintiffs nowhere state that they received poor evaluations, but this is a necessary inference from their complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\"> The plaintiffs nowhere state that their employment contract with the defendant was an \u201cat-will\u201d contract, but we infer that it was. There is no claim that the contract of employment was in writing or for a specified term. The plaintiffs assert principally the claim that their contract contained an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; this theory was developed specifically for \u201cat-will\u201d employment contracts. <em>Fortune, supra </em>at 100-105.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\"> The plaintiffs also argue that the company can be held liable for breach of the implied covenant even if it did not terminate the employees, either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>actually or constructively. The plaintiffs cite no cases to support this proposition, and we know of none in this State. Our cases have held employers liable for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing only when they have terminated an employee. See, e.g., <em>Fortune, supra; Gram </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>384 Mass. 659 (1981) <em>(Gram I); </em>and <em>Maddaloni </em>v. <em>Western Mass. Bus Lines, Inc., </em>386 Mass. 877 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b246-13\"> The plaintiffs also allege damage to their professional reputations, disruption of their personal lives, and great pain of body and mind. However, a suit for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is a suit on the contract, see <em>Fortune, supra </em>at 102; <em>Maddaloni, supra </em>at 883, and these additional damages are not contract damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b247-6\"> We note that the plaintiffs have not alleged that they were deprived of any <em>vested </em>pension rights. Instead, the plaintiffs allege in their brief merely that the company \u201cretain[ed] the increased pension benefits which would have been due the plaintiffs had the evaluation been truly merit related.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
