The plaintiff appeals directly to this court pursuant to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42, and argues that the division\u2019s decision was based on error of law, because the review examiner (examiner) wrongly determined that the plaintiff left work due to his being convicted of a misdemeanor. The plaintiff also contends that because his separation from employment was due solely to an unlawfully excessive sentence of imprisonment, his rights to due process of law and equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the United States Constitution have been violated. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The plaintiff was employed as an instructor by Aireo, Inc. (Aireo), at its Computer Learning Center in Somerville. In December, 1981, prior to the commencement of his employment with Aireo, the defendant was convicted in a nonjury trial in a District Court of threatening to commit a crime, a misdemeanor. G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2. The plaintiff was sentenced to the maximum penalty of six months\u2019 imprisonment, and he appealed to a jury session of the District Court. Pending the jury trial, the plaintiff was incarcerated for sixty-nine days. On January 25, 1983, a jury also found the plaintiff guilty, and he was again sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment. Under G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129B, and G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 33A, the plaintiff should have been credited with the sixty-nine days that he had previously served. However, the judge initially gave the plaintiff credit for only thirteen days. Aireo was notified on January 26 that the plaintiff would not be returning to work. On February 11, the judge correctly reduced the plaintiff \u2019 s sentence to reflect all sixty-nine days that the plaintiff had been imprisoned before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The plaintiff was released on April 21, 1983,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and he filed a claim for unemployment benefits with the division on April 22. On May 1, the division denied the plaintiff\u2019s application, giving as a reason that: \u201cYour leaving of work was due to incarcerated <em>[sic]. </em>Such leaving is subject to disqualification under the above-cited section of the law [G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(3)].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 39 <em>(b), </em>the plaintiff requested a hearing on this determination, which was held on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>June 13, 1983. At the hearing, Aireo did not appear and the plaintiff represented himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The examiner found that the plaintiff\u2019s loss of employment \u201cwas as a result of a conviction of a misdemeanor,\u201d and therefore that the plaintiff was not entitled to benefits because of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s application for review by the division\u2019s board of review, pursuant to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 41, was denied. This decision was affirmed by the District Court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The plaintiff argues that his separation from employment was the direct result not of his conviction, but of an unlawfully excessive sentence imposed upon him. The plaintiff claims that he would have been reinstated in his prior position but for the excessive sentence. Thus, it is argued, G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(3), should not apply, because his separation from employment was not due solely to his conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s argument both misconstrues the statutory language and is unsupported by the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The statute directs the division to deny unemployment compensation benefits whenever the claimant <em>\u201chas left work </em>. . . because of conviction\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e). </em>In this case, the examiner\u2019s finding that \u201cby [the plaintiff\u2019s] incarceration as a result of said conviction he left his work\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>cannot be, and is not, disputed. Had the plaintiff not been convicted, he would have remained an employee of Aireo.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The plaintiff goes on to argue, however, that he would have been rehired by Aireo following his imprisonment if his sentence, as initially determined, had not been unlawfully excessive. This argument misconstrues the statutory language. Our task is to interpret the statute according to the intent of the Legislature, as evidenced by the language used, and considering the purposes and remedies intended to be advanced. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983). <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975). Here, the statute focuses on the reason that the plaintiff initially left his employment, not on the reason why the plaintiff, at a later date, was not reinstated to his previous position.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The examiner also found that the plaintiff\u2019s loss of employment \u201cwas initiated solely by his conviction of a misdemeanor.\u201d Such a finding by the examiner will be set aside only if it is unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>See Abramowitz </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>390 Mass. 168,173 (1983); <em>Dohoney </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 333, 337 n.3 (1979). We conclude that the examiner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Even if we accept the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of the statute, his cause is not advanced. It is well-settled that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving his eligibility for unemployment compensation benefits. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>384 Mass. 758, 761 (1981). <em>Sohler </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 785, 788 n.1 (1979). In practice, this requirement means that the plaintiff must present whatever evidence is necessary to support his claim. See, e.g., <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., ante </em>482, 488 (1984) (claimant\u2019s failure to prove lack of net earnings); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number><em>supra </em>(claimant\u2019s failure to prove discriminatory treatment); <em>Stadig </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>379 Mass. 172, 174 (1979) (claimant\u2019s failure to identify statutory provision showing eligibility); <em>Sohler </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 788 (claimant\u2019s failure to show good cause for leaving work). Under the plaintiff\u2019s theory, then, he had the burden to prove that the judge\u2019s failure, at sentencing, to give proper credit for the time the plaintiff had already been imprisoned at least contributed to the plaintiff\u2019s loss of employment. This the plaintiff has failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Because of the judge\u2019s sentencing error, it appeared at the time of sentencing that the plaintiff would not be released until July, 1983. The examiner found that: \u201cThe employer was unable to keep the position open that long for the claimant and replaced him permanently. The employer would have replaced him temporarily if his release date was earlier.\u201d The plaintiff contends that this finding was inconsistent with the finding that his loss of employment occurred solely because of his conviction. Thus, the plaintiff argues that the case should be remanded to the division for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">We see no necessary inconsistency in these two findings. The plaintiff failed to introduce any evidence showing that a permanent replacement would not have been hired if Aireo knew that the plaintiff would be released in April. The examiner\u2019s finding that the plaintiff would have been replaced temporarily if his release date was earlier, even if warranted, does not satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s burden of showing that the employer would not have provided a permanent replacement if it had known that the release date was April 21 instead of in July. Indeed, there was no evidence from which the examiner could have found the latter fact.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the examiner had before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>him evidence that was inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s argument. In Aireo\u2019s reply to the division\u2019s request for separation information, Aireo replied: \u201cResigned personal reasons.\u201d Aireo provided similar information in a later statement to the division.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The responsibility for deciding the weight to be accorded conflicting evidence properly rests with the examiner. <em>Dowd </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>390 Mass. 767,770 (1984). <em>Keough </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>370 Mass. 1, 3 (1976). His decision will not be reversed unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>Nantucket Cottage Hosp. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>388 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1983). We hold that substantial evidence supported the decision in this case, and that it was unnecessary for the examiner to have made more detailed subsidiary findings of fact.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-6\"> The plaintiff was not imprisoned in excess of the lawfully imposed sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\"> According to the division\u2019s Claims Adjudicators\u2019 Handbook, Part I, EX-16 (rev. ed. Sept. 1982), the plaintiff should have been advised that: \u201cYour leaving of work was due to <em>conviction\u201d </em>(emphasis added). This is because, as the division itself recognizes, \u201c[a]n individual who took steps to notify his employer of his inability to continue in his work because of incarceration and who subsequently <em>is not convicted </em>of the offense charged, will <em>not </em>be subject to any. disqualification under section 25 (e) (3) even though his employer has discharged him because of the incarceration which caused him to remain away from his work\u201d (emphasis in original). In the present case, the plaintiff suffered no prejudice from the misstatement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b588-8\">General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 25, as amended through St. 1982, c. 489, \u00a7 5, states that: \u201c[N]o benefits shall be paid to an individual under this chapter <em>...(e) </em>For the period of unemployment next ensuing and until the individual has had at least four weeks of work and in each of said weeks has earned an amount equivalent to or in excess of his weekly benefit amount after he has left work ... (3) because of conviction of a felony or misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b588-9\"> Although the statute refers only to separation from employment \u201cbecause of conviction,\u201d the plaintiff argues that \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(3) applies only when separation is due <em>solely </em>to a conviction, and is not affected by other matters. As support for this proposition, the plaintiff cites the division\u2019s Claims Adjudicators\u2019 Handbook, <em>supra </em>at IX-14, which, stated in full, interprets the statutory language to mean <em>\u201csolely </em>as a direct result of a conviction and not because of any action by either the claimant or the employing unit which occurred <em>prior </em>to the conviction\u201d (emphasis in original). We need not decide whether the plaintiff\u2019s view of this interpretation is correct, however, since the plaintiff has failed to establish that the excessiveness of his original sentence had <em>any </em>effect on his loss of work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\">This interpretation is consistent with the division\u2019s view. See Claims Adjudicators\u2019 Handbook, <em>supra </em>at IX-15-D\u00cd-16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\"> The plaintiff urges this court to subject the examiner\u2019s findings to de nova review, arguing that the findings relate not to fact, but to law as applied to fact. We decline to so expand our clearly established scope of review. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>replacement, the examiner need not have found it conclusive. The letter was written nearly four months after the plaintiff\u2019s separation from Aireo, contradicted earlier statements by Aireo to the division, and was admittedly written in collaboration with the plaintiff, who at the time faced the denial of his application for benefits. <em>See Alexander </em>v. <em>Employment Sec. Comm\u2019n, 4 </em>Mich. App. 378, 384 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b590-7\"> The plaintiff introduced only a notarized letter from Aireo to the division stating that: \u201cBecause it appeared that Mr. Glasser would not be returning before July, we were forced to employ a permanent replacement.\u201d The letter does not indicate that a late-April release would have resulted in a different decision by the employer. In fact, the plaintiff himself expected to be released on parole within three weeks if given proper credit for time previously served.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Furthermore, even if the letter had specifically stated that the plaintiff\u2019s actual release date would have allowed the employment of a temporary</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b591-10\">This statement, given on May 4, 1983, gave the reason for separation as \u201cIn Prison,\u201d and also noted that the plaintiff had \u201cresigned personal reasons.\u201d It went on to state that: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t full time employee. He came in to talk to me last week about working again. He came in after 3 to 4 days of work and said he had resigned for personal reasons and that\u2019s all I know about it. He\u2019s been in courses since last May but new semester was 3 to 4 days old and he said I don\u2019t want to discuss it.\u201d Aireo claimed in its May 19 letter that these statements were given because of a policy not to discuss the plaintiff\u2019s legal problems. The examiner was not required to give credence to this later explanation. <em>Manias </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>388 Mass. 201, 205 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b591-14\"> Our decision in <em>Svoboda </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>386 Mass. 1004, 1005 (1982), does not require a different result. <em>In Svoboda, </em>we held that in the face of \u201csubstantial and largely uncontradicted evidence,\u201d the examiner should have made subsidiary findings supporting his decision to reject that evidence. In this case, however, the examiner had before him contradictory statements by the employer, as well as evidence showing that the employer\u2019s later \u201cexplanation\u201d was written after consultation with the plaintiff.
