Pursuant to G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, the child was adopted by foster parents. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-18\">The events leading to this appeal are as follows: The child was bom in 1975 and placed in the care of the Department of Social Services (department) in 1978, pursuant to a voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>agreement executed by the child\u2019s mother.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The department placed the child with the A\u2019s, the child\u2019s present adoptive family, with whom the child lived from November, 1978, to April, 1981, almost two and one-half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In July, 1979, the department obtained temporary custody of the child pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23. The grandmother filed a petition for guardianship of the child pursuant to G. L. c. 201, in January, 1980.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In March, 1980, the department filed a petition to dispense with parental consent to the adoption. G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3. The judge allowed the grandmother\u2019s motion for visitation in December, 1980. The child\u2019s natural mother died in January, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In April, 1981, the judge granted the grandmother permission to have the child visit with her for one week in New York. On April 22, two days after taking the child to New York, the grandmother initiated an action in a New York court to obtain custody of the child and also to obtain an ex parte temporary custody order. The department then filed a cross petition seeking return of the child to the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">On May 22, 1981, after allowing the department\u2019s motions to amend its petitions to reflect the death of the natural mother, the judge allowed the department\u2019s petitions for custody and to dispense with consent to adoption.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge also instructed the department to file an adoption petition under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2, forthwith. The grandmother\u2019s attorney was present for this hearing, although her counsel had not been given formal written notice. The judge instructed counsel that the grandmother was welcome to file her own petition for adoption. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Neither the judge nor the grandmother\u2019s attorney recalls a specific date being set for a hearing on adoption proceedings.* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">On May 26, 1981, the judge allowed the department\u2019s petition sponsoring the A\u2019s as adoptive parents of the child. Neither the grandmother nor her attorney was present at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">According to the grandmother, she learned the child had been adopted in June, 1981. No party appealed the adoption judgment. The grandmother filed a civil rights action against the A\u2019s, two department officials, and the child\u2019s attorney, which was dismissed by the New York Supreme Court. The custody action proceeded through the New York courts until it, and the related habeas corpus proceeding, were dismissed in November, 1982.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The child was then returned to the A\u2019s with whom the child has since continuously resided.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The grandmother filed a petition on October 29,1982, in the Probate Court to set aside the adoption on the grounds of fraud and lack of due notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The judge based her denial of the grandmother\u2019s petition on four rulings of law. First, the grandmother was not a party entitled to notice of the adoption proceedings or of the proceedings to dispense with consent under either the applicable statute or rules of the court. \u201cHad [the grandmother] acted upon her Petition to be Appointed Guardian in a timely manner, she might then have become entitled to notice, but she did not.\u201d Second, assuming that the grandmother was entitled to notice, it was received when her attorney was notified. Third, the grandmother waived any claim of prejudice or deprivation of due process from lack of timely notice because she failed to assert those claims until seventeen months following receipt of actual notice. Finally, the judge ruled that by waiting seventeen months after receiving notice of the adoption, a deliberate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>decision based upon litigation strategy, the grandmother was not acting in the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">1. The critical element in child custody cases is a proper determination of the child\u2019s best interests. \u201cThe paramount consideration [must be] the welfare of the child.\u201d <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, 316 </em>Mass. 252, 266 (1978), quoting Adoption <em>ofaMinor, </em>343 Mass. 292, 294 (1961). Although a petition to revoke an adoption is not a custody case, we cannot ignore the importance of the best interests of the child in a revocation proceeding. See <em>Petition for Revocation of a Decree for Adoption of a Minor, </em>345 Mass. 663, 671 (1963). The record reflects the judge\u2019s primary concern with the child\u2019s best interests throughout the custody and adoption and revocation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In entertaining the petition to dispense with consent to adoption, G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, the judge considered the plan proposed by the department for the child. Subsection (c) of c. 210, \u00a7 3, requires a court to determine the best interests of the child by considering the ability, capacity, fitness, and readiness of the persons proposed to take parental responsibility and the persons with whose consent the department is petitioning to dispense. This plan stated in pertinent part that: \u201c[The A\u2019s] have a stable relationship and a healthy family life. [Mr. A] has provided through his consistency and sensitivity the only father image [the child] has experienced. [Mrs. A\u2019s] strength and warmth have enabled [the child] to feel cared for and secure. [The A\u2019s] have provided [the child] with a loving and stable environment. If the pending petition is granted, it is our intention to implement the adoption by the foster parents.\u201d The judge interviewed the child at least once.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The judge ruled that \u201c[b]y waiting as long as [the grandmother] did to file her petition [seventeen months]<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> after receiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ing notice of the granting of the Petition for Adoption, a deliberate, not inadvertent, decision based upon a litigation strategy (New York proceeding), the Petitioner was not acting in the best interests of the child.\u201d The grandmother\u2019s argument that the judge improperly based her denial on loches or unclean hands is thus inapposite because the child\u2019s welfare, rather than the grandmother\u2019s litigation strategy, was the focus of the judge\u2019s concern. The judge could conclude that the delay adversely affected the child\u2019s best interests. <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. to Dispense With Consent to Adoption, </em>391 Mass. 113, 118 n.7 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">2. The grandmother\u2019s next argument relates to an allegation of lack of notice. The statutory notice provision sets forth who is to be notified. No notice of or consent to a judgment for adoption is required for a grandparent. Only the child to be adopted if over age twelve, the child\u2019s spouse, if any, the lawful parents, or the mother, if the child was bom out of wedlock and not previously adopted, are accorded rights of consent and notice. G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2.* **<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is no question that the grandmother does not fit into any of these categories and therefore is not entitled to notice under the statute. Statutes \u201crelating to adoption are in alteration of the common law and must be strictly followed in all essential particulars.\u201d <em>Petition for Revocation of a Decree for Adoption of a Minor, </em>350 Mass. 302, 304 (1966), quoting <em>Purinton </em>v. <em>Jamrock, </em>195 Mass. 187, 197 (1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The grandmother does not rely on the statutory notice provision, but rather upon the fact that she had filed a guardianship petition. But that alone did not make her a party to the adoption proceedings entitled to notice. As the department correctly states, prior to 1972, G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2, <em>had </em>required that notice be given to any guardian of the child.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But in rewriting this section, the Legislature removed the language requiring such notice. St. 1972, c. 800, \u00a7 1. The Legislature has not reinstituted any notice requirement for guardians in either its 1974 or 1978 amendments to this section. Since the language clearly and unambiguously fails to provide for notice to guardians, we should not interpret the statute so as to find such a provision. <em>Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Kokofsky, </em>373 Mass. 778, 781 (1977). However, even if we were to read such a notice requirement into the statute, the grandmother\u2019s argument would fail since she had merely filed for guardianship but had not yet received it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The grandmother also argues that we should substitute the next of kin in the case of parentless children. However, in this case, the child is not parentless. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>Thus, there is no justification for us to interpret the statute as including a person not specified by the Legislature but who may be entitled to notice as a matter of constitutional law. See <em>Caban </em>v. <em>Mohammed, </em>441 U.S. 380, 391-394 (1979). See also <em>Adoption of a Minor (No. 2), </em>367 Mass. 684, 687 (1975). <em>Farnsworth </em>v. <em>Goebel, </em>240 Mass. 18, 22 (1921). Other jurisdictions also have interpreted strictly statutes concerned with notice and consent requirements for adoption. See, e.g., <em>Barriner </em>v. <em>Sted-man, </em>580 P.2d 514, 518 (Okla. 1978) (notice of adoption to grandmother not required even though she had filed a guardianship petition). Strict interpretation is appropriate to avoid complexity and delay in the adoption process that would result from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>recognizing a prior claim by the extended family to the child. <em>In re Peter L., </em>59 N.Y.2d 513, 520 (1983). But see <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Family Servs. Div., </em>554 P.2d 227 (Utah 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Furthermore, even if we were to substitute the grandmother for the parents, her claim would fail because she waited longer than the maximum one year after <em>actual </em>notice of the adoption to petition for revocation of the judgment. G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 11. To allow the grandmother more than a year under the statute would place her in a more favorable position than even the natural parents. We recognize that grandparents have a legitimate and important interest in their grandchildren.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494 (1977); <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Chaplic, </em>388 Mass. 398, 408 (1983). See also <em>Petition for Revocation of a Decree for Adoption of a Minor, </em>345 Mass. 663, 671 (1963). In <em>Freeman, </em>we said that \u201cconsiderable weight [is accorded] to the importance of the child\u2019s being reared in a normal family relationship with her own next of kin.\u201d <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 408, quoting <em>Bezio </em>v. <em>Patenaude, </em>381 Mass. 563, 572-573 (1980). The judge in this case gave careful consideration to the grandmother\u2019s interest but found that the child\u2019s best interests outweighed that factor. That finding is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The judge recognized that \u201c[t]he welfare of the child is normally the controlling consideration in a proceeding to revoke or vacate\u201d and granted the A\u2019s custody. We conclude that there was no error in the judge\u2019s determination that it was not in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>child\u2019s best interest to revoke the adoption of the child by the A\u2019s. Thus, there is no reason to set aside the adoption.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\"> This fact and all others that follow, unless otherwise noted, were agreed to in writing by all parties on January 3, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b569-9\"> In a letter to the court, the grandmother stated, \u201cI do not wish to request a hearing [on the guardianship petition] at this time.

L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 (c), which created a \u201cpresumption that the best interests of the child will be served by granting a petition for adoption.\u201d <em>Petitions of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>389 Mass. 793, 802-803 (1983). The fact that the judge incorrectly cited this statutory presumption in her findings does not void her decision, however, because she did not rely on the presumption in her rulings. Rather, the judge relied on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>independent determination of the child\u2019s best interests, the adequacy of the notice, and the delay in the grandmother\u2019s filing of the petition for revocation of the judgment of adoption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b572-9\">General Laws c. 210, \u00a7 2, as amended through St. 1978, c. 552, \u00a7 33, provides,' in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">\u201cA decree of adoption shall not be made, except as provided in this chapter, without the written consent of the child to be adopted, if above the age of twelve; of the child\u2019s spouse, if any; of the lawful parents, who may be previous adoptive parents, or surviving parent; or of the mother only if the child was bom out of wedlock and not previously adopted. A person whose consent is hereby required shall not be prevented from being the adoptive parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">We express no view as to whether the statute could survive a constitutional challenge by the natural father.

Where these issues were not raised below, we do not consider them on appeal. <em>Petition of the Dep't of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>392 Mass. 696, 697 (1984). <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub.

App. Ct. 872 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">We add that, at the hearing on the grandmother\u2019s petition to revoke the judgment of adoption, the judge said that she thought that notice to the grandmother was inadequate. On reflection, however, the judge decided that because the grandmother had actual notice of the hearing within a month, the notice was adequate. On appeal, the grandmother asserts that she relied on the remarks and hence limited the issues at trial to lack of notice. Her petition for reconsideration did not raise any issue of reliance based on the judge\u2019s remarks. \u201cThe theory of law on which by assent a case is tried cannot be disregarded when the case comes before an appellate court for review of the acts of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Santa Maria </em>v. <em>Trotto, </em>297 Mass. 442, 447 (1937).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
