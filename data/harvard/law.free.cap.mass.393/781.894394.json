L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a). Following the appointment of new counsel, he filed a motion for postconviction relief. This motion was subsequently denied, and the defendant appealed. The Appeals Court reversed the Superior Court judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion, and ordered that a new trial be held on both indictments. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 717, 726 (1984). This matter comes before us on further appellate review. The primary issue on appeal concerns whether the defendant\u2019s contention that he lacked criminal responsibility was prejudicially undermined by violations of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 23B. See <em>Blaisdell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>372 Mass. 753 (1977). For the reasons stated below, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>we reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand this matter for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">We summarize briefly the facts relative to the issue before us.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 18, 1981, the Pittsfield police found the victim, John Fontaine, lying dead near his automobile, outside a pizza parlor. Several spent shell casings and an open buck knife were found near the victim. The knife was later identified as the property of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">According to witnesses, the victim drove to the pizza parlor on the night of the shooting, left his automobile, and called out to the defendant. A brief confrontation between the pair ensued, and several gunshots were heard. The defendant then drove away in his automobile. He was arrested the following day in Albany, New York. The handgun used in the shooting was never recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">The defendant was indicted for murder in the first degree and for carrying a firearm without legal authority. He subsequently was committed to Bridgewater State Hospital for examinations to determine competency and criminal responsibility. See G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 15 <em>(b). </em>After examining the defendant, Dr. William S. James concluded that the defendant was competent to stand trial but was not criminally responsible for his actions at the time of the shooting due to mental illness. In his written report, Dr. James noted that the defendant refused to discuss the shooting beyond the point when the victim called out to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">After the defendant indicated that he intended to assert his lack of criminal responsibility as a defense, the Commonwealth sought and was granted an order which required the defendant to submit to a second psychiatric examination by Dr. Marc A. Whaley. This second examination was to be conducted in accordance with the terms of a detailed protective order. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (b) (2) (B), 378Mass. 878-880 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>On the basis of his examination, Dr. Whaley was unable to reach a conclusion as to whether the defendant\u2019s mental illness rendered him criminally insane at the time of the shooting. Dr. Whaley requested that the prosecutor\u2019s office arrange to have the defendant examined by a psychologist. The Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a psychological examination of the defendant by Dr. William Rafferty subsequently was allowed. Dr. Whaley received the results of Dr. Rafferty\u2019s report. Dr. Whaley then submitted a written report to the court, in which he concluded that, although the defendant was mentally ill, he was able to appreciate the nature of his acts and to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. This report contained statements by the defendant with respect to his thought processes at the time of the shooting. In part, the report stated that the defendant \u201crecalls Mr. Fontaine standing there with his hand on his chest and Mr. Martin believing that Mr. Fontaine had a knife in his hand .... At this particular moment, Mr. Martin described his mental state as being T felt like a new person . . . there was a hot feeling going through my body, and I never felt so good in my life. \u2019 At that moment, he recalls shooting Mr. Fontaine eight times, emptying the gun, and T felt good ... I knew I would get arrested, and I didn\u2019t care, and I didn\u2019t want to get arrested there because they had friends in the police department and in the courts . . . and they might even kill me. \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In this report, Dr. Whaley considered whether the defendant was suffering from a mental disease at the time of the alleged crime, and whether the disease had caused his criminal behavior. In analyzing these issues, Dr. Whaley relied, in part, upon what he termed the defendant\u2019s \u201cdescription of his mental state precisely at the time of the shooting.\u201d Based upon the defendant\u2019s statements, Dr. Whaley concluded that the defendant\u2019s behavior at the time of the shooting stemmed from \u201chis reassertion of masculine prowess,\u201d rather than a diagnosable mental disease.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In an apparent violation of the protective order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>the prosecutor\u2019s office received a complete copy of Dr. Whaley\u2019s report shortly after it was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">At trial, the Commonwealth presented testimony concerning the details of the shooting, the defendant\u2019s arrest in Albany, and his obsessive fear of the victim. The defense offered the testimony of Dr. James, who opined that the defendant\u2019s mental illness substantially diminished his ability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his acts. Dr. James was asked whether the defendant was \u201cable to control substantially his acts as a result of his mental illness.\u201d Dr. James\u2019 response was that \u201c[o]ther than that [the defendant] would have had some difficulty in knowing what was an appropriate act, I believe he was \u2014 Dr. James further testified that, in his opinion, the defendant was not criminally responsible on February 18 for John Fon-taine\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The Commonwealth offered the testimony of Dr. Whaley to rebut Dr. James\u2019 conclusions.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Whaley described his examination of the defendant and stated that in evaluating the defendant\u2019s condition he had considered the results of psychological tests that had been administered to the defendant by a psychologist. Dr. Whaley concluded that at the time of the shooting the defendant suffered from a mental disease, but was able substantially to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. Dr. Whaley asserted that the defendant\u2019s mental illness did not cause him to have a substantial incapacity to appreciate the criminality of his acts on the date of the shooting. He testified that in arriving at this conclusion he considered the defendant\u2019s statements to him concerning the time period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>immediately prior to and following the shooting. He repeated several of the defendant\u2019s statements in the course of his testimony. In his testimony, Dr. Whaley repeated some, but not all, of the statements contained in the written report from which we have quoted above. Because Dr. Whaley\u2019s testimony forms the basis for our disposition of this appeal, we set forth pertinent excerpts from the transcript below.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>In his closing argument, the prosecutor noted the difference between the testimony of the two expert witnesses. He emphasized the fact that the defendant did not discuss the shooting with Dr. James. He stated that the defendant \u201ctalked to Whaley at great length and in minute detail about everything that he did in the course of that shooting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"><em>Introduction of testimony by Dr. Whaley in violation of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 23B. </em>The defendant did not object to Dr. Whaley\u2019s testimony concerning statements made by the defendant with respect to his mental state at the time prior to and following the shooting. We consider, therefore, whether there exists a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>358 Mass. 233, 236 (1970). We conclude that such a risk exists, because Dr. Whaley\u2019s testimony included statements that should not have been introduced in evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>view of the prohibitions contained in G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 23B,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as explicated in <em>Blaisdell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>372 Mass. 753 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">In <em>Blaisdell, </em>we construed the statutory term \u201cconfession\u201d \u201cto include inculpatory statements constituting admissions short of a full acknowledgment of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763; see <em>Commonwealth v. Callahan, </em>386 Mass. 784,788 (1982). The Commonwealth argues that the statements at issue were not admissions, contending that they did not discuss the defendant\u2019s actions or identify the shooter even though they include statements by the defendant that he expected to be either arrested or killed by the victim\u2019s friends. We cannot accept the Commonwealth\u2019s categorization of these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>386 Mass. 784, 787 (1982), a psychiatrist testified that during a court-ordered examination the defendant told him that \u201che was being thrown, quote, the hell out of the house, was enraged, picked up the gun and shot her, with the thought beforehand that \u2018shoot her, Callahan, and you\u2019re . . . you\u2019re going to jail for murder.\u2019\u201d We decided that these statements constituted an inadmissible confession of guilt under \u00a7 23B, not only because of the defendant\u2019s admission that he shot the victim, but also because they tended to show deliberate premeditation. <em>Id. </em>at 788. In the instant case, Dr. Whaley did not testify that the defendant specifically stated that he shot the victim. However, the statements that he did repeat in front of the jury do constitute the type of inculpatory statements that \u00a7 23B prohibits. In particular, we note the defendant\u2019s statement that \u201che knew that he would get arrested\u201d as tending to show that the defendant shot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">We conclude that the admission of these statements constituted the introduction of testimony proscribed by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 23B, and <em>Blaisdell. </em>This error cannot be viewed as harmless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>particularly in light of the prosecutor\u2019s reference to Dr. Whaley\u2019s testimony in his summation to the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>386 Mass. 784, 790 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The judgments of the Superior Court are reversed, the verdicts are set aside, and the defendant must stand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-9\"> The opinion of the Appeals Court contains a more detailed description of the factual background of this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 718-722.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Dr. Whaley interpreted the defendant\u2019s statements as follows: \u201c[I]n his description of his mental state precisely at the time of the shooting, it is apparent that Mr. Martin was motivated by reestablishing his sense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>masculinity in the social sphere, as well as psychological sphere. That is, he did not want to be seen as someone who walked away from Mr. Fontaine, and his description of the hot feeling coursing throughout his body and his never feeling so good in his life at the precise instant of the shooting, is interpreted by this examiner as stemming from his reassertion of masculine prowess, as opposed to paranoid distortions which would be considered stemming from a diagnosable mental illness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b796-9\"> Prior to Dr. Whaley\u2019s testimony, a conference was held at the side bar with respect to the restrictions upon Dr. Whaley\u2019s testimony mandated by G.

In other words, he was describing something about his own self image as perhaps perceived by others as well. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-15\">The prosecutor: \u201cDid Mr. Martin describe to you, sir, just prior to the shooting his own mental state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-16\">The witness: \u201cYes, he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-17\">The prosecutor: \u201cCan you tell us what he said?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-18\">The witness: \u201cHe described himself as not feeling particularly angry or emotional at the time, although as I indicated, he did believe that he was in some danger based on some gestures that the victim made at the time. \u201d The prosecutor: \u201cNow, did he say something about feeling like a new man?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-19\">The witness: \u201cHe did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-20\">The prosecutor: \u201cCan you tell us just in terms of his description of his mental state, what he said?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-21\">The witness: \u201cYes.
