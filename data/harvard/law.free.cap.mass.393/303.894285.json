A judge of the Land Court heard both cases by interdepartmental assignment. See G. L. c. 21 IB, \u00a7 9, inserted by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 110. On the basis of stipulations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>parties and documentary evidence, the judge affirmed the decision of the board of appeal and declared that the Boston Zoning Code was not repealed and thus is the current zoning law in Boston. We allowed the plaintiff\u2019s application for direct appellate review and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We summarize the facts found by the judge. Emerson College is a four-year degree-granting college that owns 527-529 Beacon Street in Boston. The city\u2019s building commissioner denied the college\u2019s application to have the city\u2019s zoning records for this property changed from apartment to dormitory use because, since this was a conditional use, it violated the Boston Zoning Code. See Boston Zoning Code &amp; Enabling Act, \u00a7\u00a7 8-3 &amp; 8-7 (13). The plaintiff then appealed to the board of appeal to seek a conditional use permit. After a hearing, the board of appeal dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, concluding \u201cthat the specific site is not an appropriate location for the use, that the proposed use will adversely affect the neighborhood, that this will be a hazard to vehicles and pedestrians, that a nuisance will be created by the proposed use in that adequate and appropriate facilities cannot be provided on this locus for the proper operation of the intended use.\u201d The plaintiff also seeks a declaration that c. 808 of the Acts of 1975, as amended (the 1975 zoning act), the current G. L. c. 40A, repeals by implication the Boston Zoning Code and Enabling Act, St. 1956, c. 665 (the Boston Zoning Code).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The crux of the plaintiff \u2019 s argument is that the Boston Zoning Code, which was authorized by St. 1956, c. 665, was repealed by St. 1975, c. 808, an amended zoning act for all cities and towns in the Commonwealth, enacted by the Legislature, and which the plaintiff contends impliedly repealed Boston\u2019s special zoning type statute. See St. 1956, c. 665. If St. 1956, c. 665, has been impliedly repealed, then the language in G. L. c. 40A, prohibiting cities and towns from regulating the use of land owned by nonprofit educational institutions, would apply to Boston,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a result which the plaintiff seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>In its argument, the plaintiff asserts that because the city of Boston was explicitly excluded from the operation of the previous general zoning act, G. L. c. 40A, as amended through St. 1959, c. 607, \u00a7 1, but not by St. 1975, c. 808, no such exclusion was intended in the amended version. The plaintiff states that the policy underlying the 1975 zoning act, i.e., the \u201cmodernization of zoning ordinances,\u201d and the provision of \u201cstandardized procedures for the administration and promulgation of municipal zoning laws,\u201d reveals the Legislature\u2019s intention that the 1975 zoning act apply to Boston. St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 2A. Further, the plaintiff argues that references to \u201ceach respective city or town\u201d and \u201call zoning ordinances and bylaws\u201d in St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 7,* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> indicate that the Legislature intended the 1975 zoning act to apply to all cities and towns, including Boston. The plaintiff asks us to hold that the Legislature, by failing to include explicit words of exclusion, intended to repeal Boston\u2019s special zoning status, a status which has been in effect since 1924. See St. 1924, c. 488; St. 1933, c. 269; St. 1975, c. 808. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Boston has had unique zoning regulations for a long time, due to the city\u2019s concentrated population and intense land use by religious, educational, business, and government entities. See <em>McNeely </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>358 Mass. 94, 107 (1970); <em>Begley </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>349 Mass. 458, 460 (1965); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>341 Mass. 760, 782 (1960). As noted by the judge, the current Boston Zoning Code and the previous c. 40A coexisted without causing disruption from 1956 to 1975, and there is no reason to assume that the 1975 zoning act and the Boston Zoning Code would conflict, particularly in light of the fact that they have been coexisting without problems since 1976.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Repeals of statutes by implication \u201chave never been favored by our law. Unless the prior statute is so repugnant to and inconsistent with the later enactment that both cannot stand, then the former is not deemed to have been repealed. \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bloomberg, </em>302 Mass. 349, 352 (1939), and cases cited. \u201cIt was said in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>8 Met. 172,174 [1844], that strong terms are required to show a legislative intent to supersede by a general act a special act which \u2018may be made in regard to a place, growing out of its peculiar wants, condition, and circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Haffner </em>v. <em>Director of Pub. Safety of Lawrence, </em>329 Mass. 709, 714 (1953). See <em>Colt v. Fradkin, </em>361 Mass. 447, 449-450 (1972); <em>Gregoire, petitioner, </em>355 Mass. 399,400 (1969); <em>Shelist v. Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>350 Mass. 530, 533 (1966); <em>Hartnett Beverage Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>350 Mass. 619, 622 (1966). Furthermore, local regulations are presumed valid unless a sharp conflict exists between the local and the State regulation. <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>383 Mass. 693, 701 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">We turn to the language of the statute. The preamble to St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 2A, as amended by St. 1977, c. 829, \u00a7 4, states that \u201c[t]his act is designed to provide standardized procedures for the administration and promulgation of municipal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>zoning laws.\u201d The judge found that this language is not sufficiently expressive of a clear legislative intent to repeal the Boston Zoning Code. The Legislature\u2019s failure expressly to exclude Boston from the application of the 1975 zoning act, although it had done so in the previous zoning act, also is not determinative. Silence by the Legislature is not sufficient evidence to repeal a zoning code which has been in effect for sixty years and which was concerned with the unique problems of a large and congested capital city. See <em>Colt </em>v. <em>Fradkin, </em>361 Mass. 447, 449-450 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The 1975 act also provides: \u201cZoning ordinances and by-laws in effect on [the date the new law takes effect] <em>shall continue to be governed by the </em>provisions of chapter forty A of the General Laws in effect prior to said date until this act is accepted . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). St. 1977, c. 829, \u00a7 4. Because zoning in Boston was never governed by the prior c. 40A, it could not continue to be so governed. We agree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he implication of the aforesaid transitional sentence is that Boston was not intended to be governed by the \u2018new\u2019 Chapter 40A since, in Boston, if construed otherwise, the transition would not be covered.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additional evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent not to include Boston in the general scheme is revealed by the use of the words \u201c[z]oning <em>ordinances </em>and by-laws\u201d (emphasis supplied) in the 1975 zoning act. In Boston, zoning requirements are \u201cregulations,\u201d not \u201cordinances and by-laws.\u201d St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 7, as amended by St. 1977, c. 829, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The plaintiff next argues that the 1975 zoning act would violate art. 89 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Commonwealth (the Home Rule Amendment) if it did not apply to Boston because \u00a7 8 of the Home Rule Amendment mandates that the Legislature not pass general laws that apply to only one city or town.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the 1975 zoning act does not apply to Boston, the plaintiff asserts, then the legislation would illegally establish sub silentio a class of one city. See <em>Mayor of Boston </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>384 Mass. 718, 723 (1981); <em>Belin </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>362 Mass. 530, 533-535 (1972). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s argument turns on its head the purpose of the Home Rule Amendment: \u201cto reaffirm the customary and traditional liberties of the people with respect to the conduct of their local government, and to grant and confirm to the people of every city and town the right of self-government in local matters . . . .\u201d Art. 89, \u00a7 1. Section 9 of the Home Rule Amendment mandates that existing special laws relating to cities and towns shall have the status of city or town charters and requires either a home rule petition or a law of general applicability in conformity with the requirements of \u00a7 8, note 5, <em>supra, </em>to amend or repeal such special laws.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A ruling that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>1975 zoning act does not impliedly repeal the Boston Zoning Code leaves intact Boston\u2019s sixty-year-old independent zoning powers and imposes no new obligations on the city. Such a conclusion is consistent with the Home Rule Amendment. Cf. <em>Belin </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 534 (holding unconstitutional under Home Rule Amendment act that was \u201cdirectly and solely concerned with altering a crucial feature of [Cambridge] municipal government\u201d). Again, in <em>Mayor of Boston </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>384 Mass. 718, 723 (1981), we held an act was violative of the Amendment because the act imposed unique burdens on the city of Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We conclude that St. 1956, c. 665, has not been impliedly repealed and that such a conclusion is consistent with the letter and the spirit of the Home Rule Amendment. The declaration by the judge that the Boston Zoning Code was not repealed by the 1975 zoning act, and his ruling that there was no error in the dismissal by the city\u2019s board of appeal of the plaintiff\u2019s application on appeal to change the use of the Beacon Street building, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\"> General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 3, as amended through St. 1982, c. 40, provides that \u201c[n]o zoning ordinance or by-law shall. . . regulate or restrict the use of land or structures ... for educational purposes on land owned or leased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>... by a nonprofit educational corporation.\u201d The Boston Zoning Code does not contain such a provision. Regulation of educational institutions was similarly restricted under the previous c. 40A. In <em>McNeely </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>358 Mass. 94, 107 (1970), we held that \u201cthe omission of the proviso from the Boston zoning enabling act is not an invidious discrimination against educational institutions within the city but rather is a delegation of reasonable control of all land use to the authorities of the capital city where the concentration of the population is most dense, where land use is most intense, and where educational, religious and other institutional use of land is and historically has been greatest.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-6\"> Section 7 of St. 1975, c. 808, as amended by St. 1977, c. 829, \u00a7 4, provides: \u201cThis act shall take effect on January first, nineteen hundred and seventy-six as to zoning ordinances and by-laws and amendments, other than zoning map amendments, adopted after said date. Zoning ordinances and by-laws in effect on said date shall continue to be governed by the provisions of chapter forty A of the General Laws in effect prior to said date until this act is accepted by each respective city or town, provided that no later than June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and seventy-eight all zoning ordinances and by-laws shall be brought into conformity with the provisions of this chapter and shall be governed hereby, and thereafter no provisions of chapter forty A in effect prior to January first, nineteen hundred and seventy-six shall govern zoning ordinances and by-laws.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\"> For some of the differences between the Boston Zoning Code and the 1975 zoning act, compare St. 1956, c. 665, \u00a7\u00a71,2, with G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 5; St. 1956, c. 665, \u00a7 11, as amended by St. 1974, c. 669, \u00a7 1, with G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17; and St. 1956, c. 665, \u00a7 9, with G.

There is no legislative history as to why this exclusion did not appear in c. 808 as enacted. The plaintiff\u2019s argument that failure to exclude Boston indicates that the Legislature intended the 1975 zoning act to apply to Boston is not persuasive. <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. 745, 773 (1984), and cases cited. Because \u00a7 9 of the Home Rule Amendment, see note 6, <em>infra, </em>leaves special laws intact, the mere failure to exclude Boston from the operation of the 1975 zoning act does not indicate legislative intent to repeal the Boston Zoning Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\"> Section 8 of the Home Rule Amendment provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe general court shall have the power to act in relation to cities and towns, but only by general laws which apply alike to all cities, or to all towns, or to all cities and towns, or to a class of not fewer than two, and by special laws enacted (1) on petition filed or approved by the voters of a city or town, or the mayor and city council, or other legislative body, of a city, or the town meeting of a town, with respect to a law relating to that city or town; (2) by a two-thirds vote of each branch of the general court following a recommendation by the governor; (3) to erect and constitute metropolitan or regional entities, embracing any two or more cities or towns, or established with other than existing city or town boundaries, for any general or special public purpose or purposes, and to grant to these entities such powers, privileges and immunities as the general court shall deem necessary or expedient for the regulation and government thereof; or (4) solely for the incorporation or dissolution of cities or towns as corporate entities, alteration of city or town boundaries, and merger or consolidation of cities and towns, or any of these matters.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b320-7\"> Section 9 of the Home Rule Amendment provides: \u201cAll special laws relating to individual cities or towns shall remain in effect and have the force of an existing city or town charter, but shall be subject to amendment or repeal through the adoption, revision or amendment of a charter by a city or town in accordance with the provisions of sections three and four and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>shall be subject to amendment or repeal by laws enacted by the general court in conformity with the powers reserved to the general court by section eight.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
