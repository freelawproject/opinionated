After a hearing, a judge in the Superior Court allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of oral statements the defendant had made to State police officers on April 2 and 5, 1982. The Commonwealth subsequently filed an application for interlocutory appeal of this decision, and the defendant filed a cross application for interlocutory appeal of the judge\u2019s decision not to dismiss the indictment for prosecutorial misconduct. Mass. R. Grim. P. 15 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 882 (1979). A single justice of this court granted both applications and referred them to the full bench for determination. We conclude that there was no error in the judge\u2019s suppression of a \u201cMiranda card\u201d and admissions made by the defendant on April 5, and no error in the judge\u2019s refusal to dismiss the indictment. However, there was error in the judge\u2019s suppression of admissions made by the defendant on April 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The facts are summarized as follows. Preliminary investigation into the death of Angel Figueroa led State police to suspect that the defendant had been involved in the killing. On April 2, 1982, in response to a message from police left with his wife, the defendant went alone to the State Police Crime Prevention and Control Office (CPAC) in Worcester. There the defendant was taken into an interview room where initially four officers were present: Lieutenant DeFuria, Sergeant Doheny, and Troopers McDonald and Farrell. Prior to interrogation Trooper McDonald read the defendant his Miranda rights from a printed card. The card contained the warnings police are required to give prior to custodial interrogation under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478-479 (1966), and indicated a place for the defendant to sign signifying his voluntary waiver of those rights. The judge found that the defendant made a voluntary, intelligent, and noncoerced oral waiver of his rights. At that point, Sergeant Doheny left the room. The remaining three officers testified that the defendant then signed the Miranda card in their presence, thereby confirming his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>previous voluntary waiver of rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the motion judge found that the signature on the card, purporting to be that of \u201cJohn Hine,\u201d was not written by the defendant. The defendant was subsequently questioned by Troopers McDonald and Farrell for about one hour. In the course of this interview he denied any involvement in the murder but made statements that would be inculpatory if admitted at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge found that the defendant was not in \u201cpolice custody\u201d during the interrogation on April 2 and left the CPAC office of his own volition. Before the defendant departed, he was asked but refused to sign notes taken by Trooper McDonald containing the defendant\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The police then advised the defendant\u2019s parole office of the substance of his April 2 admissions and a parole violation warrant was issued. Pursuant to that warrant, the defendant was questioned again by Troopers McDonald and Farrell on April 5 at the CPAC office. The motion judge found that the defendant was in custody on this occasion but that he was not advised of his Miranda rights. The defendant was accompanied to the interrogation by his attorney at the time, Mr. Walter A. Rojcewicz. Relying upon Trooper McDonald\u2019s notes of April 2, Mr. Rojcewicz asked the defendant if the statements attributed to him were accurate. The defendant allegedly verified his April 2 statements. The parole revocation warrant was then served upon the defendant and he was taken to the Worcester County house of correction. He was subsequently indicted for the murder of Figueroa.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">At the motion hearing the defense produced a handwriting expert, Catherine A. Cusack. She testified, based upon a comparison of the signature on the April 2 Miranda card with six random samples of the defendant\u2019s signature, that in her opinion \u201cJohn M. Hine did not sign the Miranda warnings.\u201d She char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>acterized the signature on the April 2 card as \u201can attempt to copy [the defendant\u2019s] signature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Finding the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s handwriting expert \u201clargely supportive\u201d of Cusack\u2019s conclusions, the motion judge found that the signature on the card was \u201cnot placed there by the defendant. \u201d As a result of the \u201cserious impropriety\u201d of the police with regard to the Miranda card, the judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of his April 2 admissions. He did not, however, credit the defendant\u2019s allegations that he had neither received nor waived his Miranda rights during the April 2 encounter. The judge found that the defendant was advised of his Miranda rights before he made the admissions of April 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Despite contrary testimony of Troopers McDonald and Farrell, the judge found that the defendant was not advised of and did not waive his Miranda rights prior to the April 5 interrogation. For that reason and because the judge found the defendant\u2019s April 5 adoption of his prior statements to be \u201ctainted\u201d by the \u201cMiranda card misadventure,\u201d he suppressed the April 5 admissions as well. In issuing his rulings the judge conceded that \u201cin the totality of these findings, no prejudice to the defendant may be directly pointed out.\u201d He explained that he chose to suppress the defendant\u2019s admissions, rather than impose a lesser or greater sanction, in an attempt \u201cto strike a balance between the competing interests of the citizenry in the enforcement of the criminal law, and the absolute requirement that that enforcement be fair and without the taint which I have been compelled to find here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">On appeal the Commonwealth contends that: (1) the judge erred in finding that the signature on the April 2 Miranda card was not that of the defendant, and (2) even if the evidence warranted that finding, the statements are admissible because they were obtained after the defendant had received and validly waived his Miranda rights. The Commonwealth also challenges the judge\u2019s findings that the defendant was not advised of and did not waive his Miranda rights prior to his custodial interrogation on April 5, 1982. The Commonwealth concedes that if we accept these findings, the judge\u2019s decision to exclude the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>defendant\u2019s April 5 admissions, as required by <em>Miranda, </em>must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">1. <em>The Judge\u2019s Subsidiary Findings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The Commonwealth claims error in the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings as to both the April 2 and April 5 interrogations. At the same time, the Commonwealth recognizes the well-established principle of appellate review that subsidiary findings of fact by the judge below will be accepted absent clear error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aarhus, </em>387 Mass. 735, 742 (1982). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>374 Mass. 132, 137 (1977), aff\u2019d by an equally divided Court, 439 U.S. 280 (1978). We have often stated that \u201c[t]he determination of the weight and credibility of the testimony is the function and responsibility of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses, and not of this court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>380 Mass. 751, 756 (1980), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">As to the April 2 interview, the Commonwealth claims the evidence did not warrant the judge\u2019s finding that the defendant did not sign the Miranda card. According to the Commonwealth, the judge misconstrued the testimony of its handwriting expert, John Swanson, which the judge characterized as \u201clargely supportive\u201d of defense expert Cusack\u2019s testimony. While in Cusack\u2019s opinion the defendant\u2019s signature was forged, Swanson stated that he could not express an opinion as to the authenticity of the signature because a faulty pen was used which could have distorted the writing. Swanson, however, did testify that he agreed with Cusack\u2019s comparison of the writing samples in all respects but one.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We perceive no \u201cclear error\u201d in the judge\u2019s characterization of Swanson\u2019s testimony and his conclusion that the defendant did not sign the Miranda card.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">We are also urged by the Commonwealth to set aside the judge\u2019s assessment of the conflicting testimony regarding the events of April 5. Under the well-established principles shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>above, it is clear that the judge, in accordance with his duties, assessed the credibility of the witnesses and was warranted in reaching the factual conclusions that he entered in the record. Accordingly, there was no error in the judge\u2019s conclusion that, on April 5, Miranda warnings had not been given to the defendant and that the defendant\u2019s admissions on that date must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">2. <em>The Exclusion of the Admissions of April 2.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">We agree with the Commonwealth that it was error for the judge to exclude the admissions made by the defendant on April 2. We note at the outset that, according to the judge\u2019s findings, the defendant was not in custody on April 2, 1982. Therefore, the interrogating officers were not required to issue Miranda warnings. <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 494-495 (1977). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Bryant, 390 Mass. 729, 736 (1984). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. 545, 551-552 (1977). Nonetheless, the judge found that the defendant was advised of and did validly waive his Miranda rights. Even if we were to assume that it was a custodial interrogation, the fact that the defendant did not sign the Miranda card does not vitiate his oral waiver. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>389 Mass. 359,368 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>371 Mass. 46, 54 (1976). For these reasons alone the police misconduct with regard to the April 2 Miranda card does not warrant the suppression of the defendant\u2019s statements of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The judge erred in suppressing the defendant\u2019s admissions despite finding that the April 2 \u201cMiranda card misadventure\u201d did not prejudice the defendant\u2019s rights. The purpose of the exclusionary role is to deter official misconduct by barring the use of evidence obtained as a result of the illegal action. The role is predicated on a causal relationship between the acquisition of the evidence and the official transgression. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews, </em>445 U.S. 463, 470-471 (1980). <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471,484-485 (1963). The exclusionary role prevents the introduction of evidence obtained \u201cas a result\u201d of custodial interrogation where the police have not advised the defendant of his rights against self-incrimination and the defendant has not voluntary waived those rights. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 479 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The decisions of this court are to the same effect. We exclude only that evidence obtained as the \u201cfruit of the constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>382 Mass. 210, 217 (1981) . \u201cWhere the nexus between the conduct of the police deemed illegal and the discovery of the challenged evidence is so attenuated as to dissipate the taint, such evidence is admissible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>386 Mass. 354, 362 (1982) , quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. 545, 556 (1977). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saia, </em>372 Mass. 53, 58 (1977) (evidence sought to be suppressed must be shown to be \u201can \u2018exploitation\u2019 of the primary illegality\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In this case, the judge found that the police forgery of the defendant\u2019s Miranda card resulted in \u201cno prejudice to the defendant.\u201d Before the card was presented to the defendant, he had received and orally waived his Miranda rights. The card itself did not assist the police in obtaining the defendant\u2019s statements. His admissions were therefore not the \u201cfruit\u201d of the alleged illegality. Without this nexus, the judge was not justified in suppressing the defendant\u2019s statements despite the seriousness of the police misconduct. \u201c[W]e believe that a trial court judge is required to consider not only the degree of misconduct, but also the closeness of the link between that misconduct and the eventual testimony sought to be suppressed. If the connection is sufficiently attenuated, the testimony must be admitted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caso, </em>377 Mass. 236, 241-242 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The judge was clearly correct in suppressing the Miranda card, based upon his subsidiary finding that the defendant did not sign the card. We express no opinion as to the admissibility of the card at trial for any purpose if offered by the defendant. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>364 Mass. 236 (1973) (statements elicited by police in violation of Miranda safeguards are admissible for impeachment purposes); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>New York, </em>401 U.S. 222 (1971) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">3. <em>The Motion to Dismiss the Indictment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">The defendant, relying upon <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>373 Mass. 438 (1977), contends that the judge erred in failing to dismiss the indictment for prosecutorial misconduct. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>disagree. The facts in this case establish neither the same level of egregious misconduct nor the prejudice to the defendant\u2019s rights which combined to require dismissal of the indictment in <em>Manning.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contentions, <em>Manning </em>did not establish a per se rule mandating the dismissal of indictments where government agents have intentionally violated a defendant\u2019s rights. <em>Id. </em>at 444. In <em>Manning, </em>we confronted misconduct by Federal agents amounting to \u201ca deliberate and intentional attack... on the relationship between Manning and his counsel in a calculated attempt to coerce the defendant into abandoning his defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443. We ordered the exceptional remedy of dismissal because the defendant \u201chad in fact been prejudiced to some extent\u201d by the impairment of his right to the assistance of counsel and \u201cthe officers\u2019 misconduct was so pervasive as to preclude any confident assumption that proceedings at a new trial could be free of the taint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443-444. The police misconduct in this case, while deliberate and deplorable, did not so violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights as to call into question his ability to obtain a fair trial. The judge did not find that the \u201cMiranda card misadventure\u201d cast such doubt on the credibility of the offending officers as to poison the entire investigation and subsequent indictment. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, supra </em>at 444 (\u201c[t]he indictment itself is so inextricably interwoven with the misconduct which preceded it that the only appropriate remedy ... is to dismiss\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salman, </em>387 Mass. 160, 166-167 (1982) (knowing use of false testimony by police to obtain indictment is ground for dismissal). In fact, the judge specifically found that the defendant\u2019s rights had not been prejudiced, and the judge accepted as true the police testimony as to the admissions of the defendant. Suppressing the evidence of the April 2 Miranda card sufficiently purged the proceedings of the taint of the illegally obtained evidence. As a result, \u201c[w]e are left with a record which fails to show that the behavior of the police strengthened the prosecution\u2019s case against the defendant, or weakened his position.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 52, 59-60 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>389 Mass. 287, 295 (1983) (failure of police to inform defendant of attorney\u2019s request to be present at interrogation fell short of conduct condemned in <em>Manning).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Our <em>post-Manning </em>decisions underscore the exceptional circumstances in which dismissal of an indictment is the proper prophylactic remedy for prosecutorial misconduct. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, </em>389 Mass. 197, 209-211 (1983), we held that, although police officers acted improperly by conducting a postarraignment interview without defense counsel, dismissal was not warranted in the absence of prejudice to the defendant. Summarizing the guiding principles of <em>Manning, </em>we stated that, \u201c[ajbsent egregious misconduct or at least a serious threat of prejudice, the remedy of dismissal infringes too severely on the public interest in bringing guilty persons to justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, supra </em>at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, </em>391 Mass. 301 (1984), we reviewed an order by a Superior Court judge dismissing a murder indictment due to the Commonwealth\u2019s late disclosure of exculpatory evidence. We noted that whether an indictment should be dismissed \u201cturns primarily on the ability of the defendant to obtain a fair trial after, and in light of, the impropriety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312-313. To determine whether this criterion was satisfied we remanded the case to the trial court for findings as to whether the late disclosure \u201cso prejudiced the defendant that he will be unable to obtain a fair trial in any subsequent proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>391 Mass. 749, 754-755 (1984) (pretrial publicity did not require dismissal where defendant\u2019s rights to fair trial were not impaired).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">We conclude that, in light of the suppression of the Miranda card, the misconduct alleged in this case has neither caused prejudice to the defendant nor impaired his ability to receive a fair trial. Therefore, we agree with the motion judge that dismissal of the indictment is unwarranted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Basic to our conclusions in this and similar cases is that our courts should not adopt prophylactic remedies for police misconduct which needlessly frustrate law enforcement and the public interests in that sphere. Our emphasis has always been that any remedy should be tailored to cure the prejudice to the defendant. That such remedies may not be adequate to deter official misconduct is well stated by the motion judge. In obvious appreciation that he was entering a punitive order, he stated that in the enforcement of the criminal law there is an \u201cabsolute requirement that that enforcement be fair and without the taint which I have been compelled to find here.\u201d Because judicial responses should be limited to truly remedial, and not punitive, measures, the absolute necessity for integrity in law enforcement recommends, in appropriate cases, recourse to civil remedies and departmental police discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We reverse the judge\u2019s suppression of the defendant\u2019s April 2 statements, affirm his suppression of the defendant\u2019s April 2 Miranda card and April 5 statements, and affirm his denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\"> Lieutenant DeFuria testified that he left the room after seeing the defendant sign the card and Trooper McDonald sign as a witness. According to Troopers McDonald and Farrell, the latter then signed the card as a second witness to the defendant\u2019s signature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-8\"> The defendant admitted to inducing the victim from his home and delivering him to one Eddy Rivera in exchange for \u201ca spoon and a half of heroin. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b580-9\">In Swanson\u2019s opinion, the signature on the card and the defendant\u2019s signature contained some of the same \u201cunconscious writing strokes.\u201d However, he agreed the signature differed as to slants, stops, extra strokes, and spacing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\"> As an alternative to dismissal of the indictment, the defendant urges us to bar the offending police officers from testifying at trial. The defendant argues that by allowing their testimony we force him to disclose the suppressed statements in order to impeach their credibility effectively. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>since we have ruled that the April 2 statements are admissible, this objection lacks a foundation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
