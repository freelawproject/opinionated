And afterward, to wit,, on or about the 1st day of December\u2019, 1867, the said commissioners of said county of Ashtabula entered into a contract, and commenced the repairing of said highway, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>rebuilding of said bridge on said highway, near the line of said counties of Lake and Ashtabula, which said repairs- and said bridge so commenced were completed on or about the 1st day of July, in the year 1868, and they say that the costs of said repairs and the erecting of said bridge amounted to'the sum of $9,344.61, which said sum has been fully paid therefor by the said commissioners of Ashtabulacounty. And the said commissioners of said county of Ashtabula, acting for and on the behalf of said county of Ashtabula, afterward, to wit, on the 2d day of March, 1869, at the March session of the commissioners of said county of Lake, then and there being held at the court-house in Painesville, in said county of Lake, and while said commissioners of said county of Lake were in open session, presented their claim and demanded that the said commissioners of the said county of Lake should pay to the said county of Ashtabula one-half the amount so expended in repairing-said highway and rebuilding said bridge, to wit, the sum of $4,672.30, which said claim and demand was then and there rejected by the said commissioners of said county of Lake, and they then and there refused to allow or to pay the same or any part thereof, from which decision and refusal to allow or to pay said claim the said commissioners of the said county of Ashtabula appeal to this court, and they ask that the said county of Lake may, by the order and judgment of the court, be compelled to pay the said sum of $4,672.30 to the said county of Ashtabula.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">The commissioners of Lake county demurred to the petition on the ground that it did not contain facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-6\">The Court of Common Pleas sustained the demurrer and dismissed the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-7\">On error, the District Court reversed the judgment, on the ground that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-8\">The present petition in error is prosecuted to reverse the-judgment of the District Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>Estep Burke, </em>and <em>J.

It is their joint discretion, and not that of any one board.

The statute passed March 30, 1868, S. &amp; S. 89, gives - county commissioners ample power to sue for any claim due their county, and would seem to be broad enough to-' embrace a claim of this kind.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-7\">2. Did the commissioners of Ashtabula county pursue the-proper remedy ? Section 9 (1 S. &amp; C. 251) compelled us to \u25a0 first present our claim to the commissioners of Lake county. It was so presented. The commissioners of Lake county rejected it. Then our course was to appeal to the Common Pleas. See sec. 18, 1 S. <em>&amp; </em>C. 247; 5 Ohio, 490; 8 Ohio St. 357.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-9\">This is not a claim where the \u201c amount due \u201d is fixed by law or authorized specially to be fixed by any other person or tribunal; hence this was our proper remedy, and it seems to us our only remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-10\">It is an invariable rule of construction that'statutes which affect public interests are mandatory, and the word \u201c may \u201d ' in all such cases is construed to mean \u201c shall.\u201d 50 Maine, 518, 529; 39 N. H. 435; 3 Hill, (N. Y.) 612; 9 How. (U. S.) 248.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-11\">But in this case the statute in its own terms is as positively mandatory as language can make it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao2\">The,petition states and the demurrer concedes the facts, constituting just such a case as is contemplated by the act above quoted. It is a maxim, that for every wrong there - is a remedy. The plaintiffs \"in error concede the wrong,., but deny that we have any remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\u2019 The construction of this act, as claimed by counsel for plaintiffs in error, makes it \u2014 the act \u2014 a dead letter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-5\">It is the universal rule of all courts to so construe statutes that the will and intention of the legislature shall be \u2022carried out, and never, if possible, will the courts permit \u25a0that intention to be defeated. 3 Hammond, (O.) 198; 3 Cow. (N. Y.) 89; 15 Johns. 358; 1 Pet. <em>64; 2 </em>Pet. 662; 3 Mass. 523; 12 Mass. 383, 385; 15 Mass. 205; 30 Vt. 746; 28 Vt. 354; 6 Ind. 354.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-6\">\u201c When a statute directs a thing to be done, it authorizes the performance of whatever is necessary to execute its commands. Thus an act increasing salaries imposes the burden, though no provision is made to meet it.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>New </em>York, 2 Hilt. N. Y. Com. Pl. 203; 20 U. S. Dig. 886, sec. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-7\">Now, what was the intension of the legislature ? Manifestly this : that the public travel should not be impeded \u25a0or rendered unsafe, and to impose the positive duty upon the commissioners of each county of providing for such contingencies, and also to impose upon each county the <em>positive obligation </em>to me\u00e9t the necessary expense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-8\">The plaintiffs in error cite the case of <em>The Comm\u2019rs of Hamilton Co. </em>v. <em>Mighels, </em>7 Ohio St. 109, and claim that the county of Lake can not be charged with this liability, for the reason that there was no contract entered into by the-\u25a0commissioners of that county.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-9\">In reply, we say that the law having declared the posi-tive duty and positively fixed the liability, then, in default of performance of the duty, an implied contract or obligation to pay and discharge that liability necessarily arises.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b410-10\">White, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APl\">The cause of action in this case is claimed to-arise on the act of April 4, 1866, amending section 3 of the act further to. prescribe the duties of county commis\u2022sioners, passed April 8,1856. 63 Ohio L. 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">In the passage of the amendatory act, the proviso, doubtless by inadvertence, is made to precede the main body of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the section. The transposition, however, does not affect the sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In the main body of the section, it is provided that the county commissioners shall not thereafter make any purchase, or enter into any contract or engagement for the erection of any infirmary, court-house, jail, bridge, culvert, or :any other public building or improvement, by which the \u25a0expenditure of a larger amount of money is involved than ten thousand dollars, without first submitting the policy of \u2022such outlay to the voters of the county at an election in the mode prescribed. And it is declared that all purchases made, or contracts entered into, contrary to the above provision, shall be absolutely void as against the county, unless the policy of such outlay shall first have been approved by a majority of -the votes cast at such election.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Then follows a proviso which it is not necessary to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The proviso containing the clause in controversy is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">\u201c Provided, also, that in all cases where, by freshet, fire, tempest, or other casualty, any bridge or bridges in any county has been or shall be destroyed, in whole or in part, so as to impede or render unsafe the public travel, and, in the opinion of the county commissioners of such county, the exigencies of the public and the safety of public travel will not admit of the delay in building or restoring such bridge or bridges as may be required for the purpose of submitting the question to the voters of such county, as is above provided, then, and in such cases, it shall be lawful for the commissioners of such county, .without first submitting the same to the voters of the county, to borrow any sum of money which maybe necessary to rebuild or restore such bridge or bridges, not exceeding the sum of fifteen thousand dollars.\u201d Then follows authority to issue bonds for the debt so contracted, and to levy an extra tax to pay them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Next comes the clause on which the action is founded. It is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\u201c That whenever any one or more of the principal public-highways have been so greatly damaged, or entirely destroyed, by freshet, land-slide, wearing or changing of water-course, or other unavoidable casualty, on or near the lines of two or more counties, which said counties shall be-traversed by the road or roads so damaged, the commissioners of said counties interested shall repair such damages by erecting a bridge or bridges, changing said road,, or by earth-work, as said commissioners may deem expedient, to be paid for in equal proportions by said commissioners.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The fourth section of the original act declares, that \u201c it shall be essential to the validity of every contract entered, into by the county commissioners, or order made by them,, that the same shall have been assented to at a regular or special session thereof, and entered in the minutes of their proceedings by the auditor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">By the act establishing boards of county commissioners,, and px-escribing their duties, power is given to such boards to make any necessary order or contract in relation to the-building and repairing of bridges within their respective-counties; and if any bridge or bridges within any county shall be destroyed, authority is given the commissioners to have the same rebuilt, if they believe the public interest will be subserved thereby. 1 S. &amp; C. 245, sec. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The act of May 1, 1852, authorizing the commissioners-of two or more counties to build bridges jointly, in certain cases, provides, \u201c That whenever it shall become necessary for the public convenience to bridge any stream of water which shall be on or near the lines of two or more counties,, which said counties shall be traversed by the road or roads on which said bridge is needed, it shall be lawful for the commissioners of such counties interested to build or authorize the building of such bridge jointly, to be paid for in proportion as said commissioners may agree upon.\u201d 1 S. &amp; C. 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The foregoing being the state of legislation bearing on the subject, the question is : Does the petition show a cause of actiou ?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>No argument is necessary to show that a suit can not be brought by one county against another, except for a cause authorized by statute. The counties themselves being the creatures of the statute, all their rights and liabilities must, originate from the same source.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Authority is conferred upon the commissioners to build or repair bridges in their respective counties, when the same is required by the public interest. So, also, when it is necessary for the public convenience to bridge a stream which is on or near the lines of several counties, traversed by the roads on which the bridge is needed, the commissioners of such counties are authorized by their joint action to build such bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In these cases no liability is created against the county,, except for work which has been authorized to be done by the commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">In the case before us, the bridge was built solely under the authority and direction of the commissioners of Ashtabula county.</p>\n<p id=\"AOO\">The clauses of the statute relied on to support the action,, contemplates, under the circumstances therein described,, the joint action of the commissioners of the several counties interested in repairing the highway. But before the duty of making the repairs attaches, under this clause, to the commissioners of either couuty, their concurrence is\u00a1 required as to the expediency of the work proposed to be done. The determination of such expediency requiresthe exercise of judgment and discretion on the part of the commissioners of each county, of which they can not be deprived-</p>\n<p id=\"ALM\">\u25a0 \"Where it is the duty of a board to exercise its discretion,, and it refuses to act, it may be compelled to do so by mandamus; but the writ can not be used to control the discretion of the board. Whether resort could have been had to this remedy to compel the commissioners of Lake county to act in reference to the repairing of the highway in question, it is unnecessary here to inquire.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">The fact that they refused to concur in the doing of th&amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>work that was done, precl udes any right of recovery against them on account thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the District Court reversed, and that of the 'Court of Common Pleas affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b414-6\">Day, C.
