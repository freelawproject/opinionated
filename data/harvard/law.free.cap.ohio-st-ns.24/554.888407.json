The act of April 18, 1870, amending section 557 of the code, in so far as it authorizes a purchaser of real estate, in possession under a conveyance containing covenants of title and general warranty, in an action by the vendor against him to recover the purchase money, to make the claimant of an estate in fee simple, adverse to the title acquired by the purchaser, a party to such action, and if the adverse estate be adjudged in favor of the claimant, to counterclaim against the vendor the breach of the covenants of his title, is remedial merely, and does not impair the obligation of the contract between the vendor and vendee, nor in any manner affect the causes of action existing in favor of the-parties thereto, at the time of the passage of the amendatory act.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b566-11\">2. Under the grant of legislative power in the constitution, the general assembly has complete control over the remedies which are to be afforded to parties in the courts of the state; and if the remedies provided do not interfere with vested rights, such effect must be given them as will carry out the intent of the law-making power.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Error to the District Court of Hardin county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-5\">On the 12th day of November, 1868, the plaintiff, Wallace W. Templeton, sold and conveyed to the defendant, Solomon Kraner, by deed in fee simple, with covenants of general warranty, certain real estate situate in Hardin county, containing 159 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-6\">On the same day, Kraner, in payment of the purchase money, made and delivered to Templeton his promissory note for $1,900.94, payable on the 1st day of January,. 1869, with interest from date, to secure the payment of which, Kraner and wife executed and delivered to Temple-ton a mortgage on the real estate sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-7\">Kraner took possession of the whole of the real estate, at the time the conveyance was made, and up to the time of filing his answer herein, remained in the quiet and undisturbed possession thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-8\">On the 1st day of January, 1871, the note not having been fully paid, Templeton commenced an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Hardin county, against Kraner and wife, to ascertain the amount due on the note, to foreclose the mortgage, and sell the mortgaged premises to pay the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-9\">Kraner answered, setting up, by way of counter-claim, an outstanding title to a portion of the mortgaged premises -in one Allen E. McArthur, alleging that such title, if valid, will be a breach of the covenants of title contained in the deed from Templeton to him, to his injury in the sum of $1,500, and asked that McArthur be made a party defendant to the action, aud be required to set out the nature and extent of his title to the premises or any part thereof; that the validity of such outstanding title be determined, and if found valid, that the damages sustained by the defendant by reason of such outstanding title, be allowed him against the plaintiff. To this answer the plaintiff filed a demurrer, which was overruled by the court, and the ruling excepted to by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-10\">McArthur, by order of the court, was made a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>defendant to the action, and filed his answer, claiming to be seized of the legal title to 4fV acres, describing them by metes and bounds, of the real estate conveyed by Temple--ton to Kraner, and entitled to the immediate possession \u2022thereof, alleging that the same is wrongfully detained from .him by Kraner, and asking judgment against Kraner for the recovery of the possession thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-5\">The plaintiff replied to the answer of McArthur, denying his title and his right to the possession of the land claimed therein. At the February term, 1872, the court, upon the \u2022submission of the cause, found for the plaintiff on the issue joined between him and the defendant McArthur, and as against the defendant Kraner, that there was due from him to the plaintiff upon the note the sum of $&gt;553.35; .and ordered Kraner to pay the same, with the costs of suit, in ten days from the close of the term, and in default, that the mortgaged premises be sold, and the proceeds applied to the payment thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-6\">The defendants each demanded a second trial, which was .allowed to them separately, and both second trials were perfected. On the second trial in the Court of Common Pleas, the cause was, by consent of parties, again submitted to the court, and on the issue joined between the plaintiff .and the defendant McArthur, the court found, 'as against the plaintiff and those claiming under him, the title and the right to the possession of 4,% acres of the land conveyed by Templeton to Kraner to be in McArthur, and adjudged the same to him; and as to Kraner and wife, the cause was continued, and judgment rendered against the plaintiff, in favor of Kraner and McArthur, for the costs accrued since the filing of Kraner\u2019s answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-7\">At the March term, 1874, of the District Court of Hardin county, on a petition in error filed therein by the plaintiff Templeton, against the defendants Kraner and wife and McArthur, to reverse the rulings and judgment of the 'Court of Common Pleas, the District Court affirmed the same, at the costs of the plaintiff; whereupon the plaintiff filed a petition in error in this court, against the same de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>fendants, to reverse the judgment of the District Court, upon? the following grounds, which are assigned for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-5\">\u201c 1.

Questions as to the validity of the title to the premises\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>conveyed by the plaintiff to the defendant, cau not be tried and adjudicated in this action. Defect in the title, if true, without an averment in the- answer showing eviction or something equivalent thereto, constitutes no defense to the plaintiff\u2019s action. <em>Hill and wife </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>6 Ohio St. 207; <em>Stock Co. </em>v. <em>Saas, </em>1 Superior Court Rep. <em>21; Picket\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Picket\u2019s Adm\u2019r, </em>6 Ohio St. 525; Rawle on Covenants, 658-661, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-5\">Section 557 of the code, as amended April 18, 1870 (67 -Ohio L. 116), is inapplicable, because the contract upon which this action is founded, and the right of action thereon, accrued to the plaintiff prior to the passage and taking effect of this amendatory section. <em>Steamboat Monarch </em>v. <em>Findlay, </em>10 Ohio, 384; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Kelso, </em>5 Ohio St. 198; <em>Seamans </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>15 Wis. 548; 1 Superior Court Rep. 21; Ordinance of 1787, Statutes of 1841-46; Swan &amp; Sayler, 1; sec. 28, art. 2, Constitution of Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-6\">2. If we were to concede that the legislature intended this amended section of the code to have a retrospective operation, then we insist that it is unconstitutional and \u25a0void, because it interferes with vested rights, and so \u201cimpairs the validity of contracts.\u201d Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 128.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-7\">Any legislation which makes that a breach of the contract or covenant, which was not so at the time of the making of the contract or covenant, is to change the terms and construction of the covenant. This amended section, if applicable, makes the covenantor liable for a breach of his covenants at a time and in a manner to which he never \u2022agreed. It is therefore inapplicable or void. 2 Story on Constitution, 277, sec. 1385; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>1 Ohio, 236; <em>Von Baumbaugh </em>v. <em>Bade, </em>9 Wis. 590; <em>Cornell </em>v. <em>Hitchins, </em>11 Wis. 370; <em>Cargill </em>v. <em>Power, </em>1 Mich. 369.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-8\">When the defendant accepted the deed of the plaintiff', containing the covenant of warranty, he doubtless regarded it as sufficient and ample indemnity against all lawful claims \u2022of all persons whomsoever. Such was, and is, the contract between the parties. And it is now too late for the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>fendant, or the legislature either, to say that he shall not rstill rely on it and be bound by it. <em>Talmage </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>25 Wend. 115; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>6 Ohio St. 220.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b571-5\"><em>John JD. King, </em>attorney for Solomon Kraner:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-6\">The original section 557 of the code provides for a proceeding <em>quia timet. </em>This original section gives an express \u25a0sanction to a remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-7\">This section of the code, as amended, does not change the contract between the parties; it does not \u201cimpair the \u25a0obligation of the contract;\u201d it does not alter the rights of the parties; but it does change and alter the mode by which the existing contract shall be enforced and the existing rights vindicated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-8\">In other words, it changes and enlarges the remedy of the parties under the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-9\">The case of <em>Hill et ux. </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>6 Ohio St., was in many respects similar to this one ; but those principles all apply to the remedy and only to the remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-10\">Eor the express purpose of overcoming the technical barrier established in the case of <em>Hill et ux. </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>and some other cases of like import, and for the purpose of enlarging and furnishing a full and adequate remedy for the existing rights of the parties, section 557 of the code was amended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-11\">The contract or deed is to be construed and interpreted according to the law in force when the contract or deed was made. This, and this alone, is the effect and meaning of the clause of article 1, section 10, of the federal constitution, providing that \u201cno state shall . . . pass any <em>ex -post facto </em>law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-13\">But it is clearly the province of the legislature to enlarge, restrict, change, modify, or entirely destroy the <em>remedy </em>which a party may have on his contract at the time the contract is made. It may also create a remedy for an existing contract upon which previously there was no remedy. Potter\u2019s Dwarris on Statutes, 471; <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Goold, </em>11 N.

In this case, however, the adverse estate set up by the mortgagor, is a title prior and paramount to the title acquired by the defendant from the plaintiff, by virtue of which the owner claims to be entitled to the immediate possession of a part of the premises conveyed by the plaintiff to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Before the passage of the act in question, under' this state of facts, the defendant, by a petition to quiet his title, could have brought the vendor and claimant into -court, required them to litigate as to the title, invoked the power of the chancellor to stay proceedings in the action by the vendor against him to recover the purchase money, until the question of title should be determined; and in the event of his eviction in the proceeding to quiet title, would have been entitled to recoup the damages sustained by him, by- reason of such eviction, against the claim of the vendor for the unpaid purchase money. The act, therefore, in so far as it permits an outstanding adverse title in fee simple to be set up by way of counter-claim, in an action by the vendor against the vendee to recover purchase money, and authorizes the claimant of the adverse estate to be made a party in the action, for the purpose of determining the rights and liabilities of all the parties in one and the same action, is remedial merely, and not in conflict with the constitutional provision before cited. The cause of action existing in favor of the vendor, at the time of the passage of the act, is not in any way changed or affected by it; but it gives to the vendee a new and additional remedy for a right which then existed \u2014 a right to demand of his grantor the performance of the covenants of his deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The principle, that the legislative power of the state has complete control over the remedies which shall be afforded to parties in the courts of the state, is so well' settled that argument is deemed unnecessary in support of it. The authorities relied upon as conclusive on this point, are <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>7 Ohio, 248; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Sterling et al., </em>10 Ohio, 357; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Bentley et al., </em>16 Ohio, 97; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>McElvain, </em>16 Ohio, 347; <em>Trustees of Cuyahoga Falls R.
