Boehman, but whose real name was then Anna K. Brenning, and who was then-the Wife of John Brenning, but living separately from him ; that said deed purported to be for a consideration of $700, but was in fact without any consideration whatever; that nothing whatever was paid for said deed; that the same was executed and delivered by this defendant to said Anna K. Boehman, apparently and upon its face as an absolute deed, yet it was then and afterward understood to be, and was in fact, in trust for and to secure the same for this defendant, and for no other purpose, and to be reconveyed to this defendant on demand; that said deed was on the same day put to record, but this defendant collected the rents of said real estate and exei\u2019cised ownership and control over the same with the knowledge of, and without any objection from said Anna N. Boehman, until on or about the \u2014 day of May, 1868, when said Anna K. Boehman combined and confederated with her mother, one Dorothea Boehman, and her father, one George Boehman, to cheat and defraud this defendant and deprive him of the use and benefit of said real estate; and they assumed and claimed that the real name of said Dorothea Boehman, wife of said George Boehman, and mother of said Anna K. Boehman, was Anna K. Boehman; and that said deed had been executed and delivered to her, the wife of said George Boehman, and not to said Anna K. Boehman, wife of John Brenning; and said wife of said George Boehman, without the consent and against the will and protestations of this defendant, for a time thereafter assumed control of said real estate, and she and her said daughter, against the will of this defendant, for a time collected some of the rents of said real estate, up to and until October 8, 1868, since which time this defendant has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>receiving the rents thereof, and as ever before, claims the right to do so; that said deed was never executed or delivered to said wife of said George Bochman; that she never paid any consideration therefor; that neither she nor her daughter ever became the absolute owner of said real estate, or any part thereof; nor did said George Bochman ever lawfully accpfire any interest in, or title to, said real estate; that on the 8th day of December, a. d. 1868, said wife of said John Brenning, by the decree of this court, was divorced from said John Brenning, and on January 7,1869, she was married to said plaintiff and is now his wife; that by the further combination of said George Bochman, and wife and daughter, to defraud this defendant, and by confederating also with said plaintiff for that purpose, said George Bochman and wife, on the 28th day of January, A. d. 1869, pretended to convey said real estate to said plaintiff', by deed of that date, by them executed and since put to record, for an expressed consideration of one dollar and other unnamed considerations and by covenants of general warranty; but this defendant charges and avers, that said last-named deed was wholly without consideration, and that said plaintiff well knew at the time of the making and delivery thereof, that said grantor had no title thereto, nor right to convey the same, and was fully advised in the premises.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-5\">The cross-petition also sets forth that a reconveyance had been demanded before the marriage of the grantee to Mathews, as well as since that time; that she expressed at first a willingness to reconvey, but now refuses to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-6\">George Bochman and Dorothea, his wife, and Anna K.

Bochman, for a good and sufficient consideration, the premises described in the petition; and that on the 28th day of January, 18.69, for a good and valuable consideration, the said George Bochman and Anna E.

The finding on the cross-petition is as follows : \u201cAnd in further consideration of the premises as to said cross-petition, the court find for said Thomas Leaman, the plaintiff therein, and that the facts stated in said cross-petition are true; that said Thomas Leaman conveyed'the real estate in said petition described, by deed to said defendant, Anna E. Bochman, who was then known also by the name of Anna E. Brenning, and Anna E. Brenninger, and who has since become, and now is, the wife of.said plaintiff, Henry A. Mathews; that said deed was wholly without consideration, and in trust to be reconveyed by her to said Thomas Leaman, on demand; that a deed of reconveyance has been demanded from her before her marriage with said plaintiff, and from her and said plaintiff since their marriage, but they have failed to make such deed; that the claim of said defendants, Doro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>thea Bochman and George Bochman, and that of said plaintiff, under them, are wholly without consideration and without right, and void; that said deed of said Leaman to said Anna X.

Bochman \u2014 nor said George Bochman, nor his said wife, Dorothea Bochman, have any title, right, or interest in said real estate, or any part thereof, but the same, of right, belongs to, and should be vested in, said Thomas Leaman as the owner thereof in fee simple.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-5\">On this finding a decree was entered in favor of Leaman for the premises. A bill of exceptions was taken on the trial, which, after stating that the several deeds referred to in the pleadings, and the lease and the assignment thereof, had been given in evidence by the plaintiff, proceeds as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-6\">\u201cAnd thereupon the defendant, Thomas Leaman, to maintain the issues on his part arising upon the answers and cross-petition filed herein by said Leaman, and the answers and replies and pleadings filed by the plaintiff and the other several defendants herein thereto, being sworn as a witness in his own behalf, and not having or offering in evidence any memorandum, declaration, paper, writing, or other written evidence tending to prove any of the facts alleged in his cross-petition, did offer parol evidence, <em>tending </em>to prove that previous to, and at the time of, the execution and delivery of the deed marked \u2018 Exhibit B,\u2019 by him, the defendant, Anna X. Mathews was a married woman, the wife of one John Brenning, but living separate and apart from him; that her maiden name was Anna X. Bochman, and that she was known by this name as well as by the name of Anna X. Brenning; that Dorothea Bochman was the name of her mother, with whom she was then living; that the defendant, Thomas Leaman, at this time was a married man, but living separate and apart from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>wife, was boarding in the same house with Anna E. Brenning, and was cohabiting with her; that she solicited and importuned him to deed her the property described in the petition, and a large amount of personal property; that in compliance with her request, and to keep up a good understanding with her, he executed and delivered to her the deed and a bill of sale; but that she promised at the same time to give him back the property whenever he wanted it; that at that time he was having misunderstandings and disagreements with his wife; that the deed, though absolute on its face, and in consideration of seven hundred dollars, was, in fact, without any consideration whatsoever; that subsequently, and when he became reconciled to his wife, he requested her to give him back the property, and that she did give him back the personal property; and that she at first agreed to give him back the real estate, but subsequently refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-5\"><em>\u201c </em>To all of which evidence tending to establish a trust by parol, the plaintiff and the other several defendants to said cross-petition objected; and the court, on consideration, did overrule said objection, and admit said testimony to be given, to which opinion of the court the said plaintiff and the other several defendants to said cross-petition, by their counsel, excepted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-6\">The following errors are assigned:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-7\">1.

W e confidently claim that such evidence has always been received and considered by the courts in Ohio. <em>Fleming et al. </em>v. <em>Donahue et al., </em>5 Ohio, 255; <em>Miller and wife </em>v. <em>Stokely et al., </em>5 Ohio St. 194; 2 Redfield\u2019s Story\u2019s Eq.

Bochman was executed upon an illegal consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">This objection can not avail. The bill of exceptions does not undertake to set out all the evidence. It merely shows that there was evidence <em>tending </em>to prove the consideration to have been illegal. If the fact was not proved, it could have no legal effect. Whether it was proved or not, is not stated. No such defense was set up in the pleading. Whether it ought to have been, to he available, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>we need not now inquire. \"We may remark, however, that in <em>Haigh </em>v. <em>Kaye, </em>L. R., 7 Chan. App. 473, it was decided that such matter ought to he pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> It appears from the pleadings that Leaman owned the premises in question up to the time of his deed of August 7, 1867. George Bochman and wife claim that by that deed the premises were conveyed to her. Mathews claims solely through the conveyance from Bochman and wife. The averments of the cross-petition are that the deed from Leaman was not made or delivered to the wife of George Bochman, but to the wife of the plaintiff, Anna K. Mathews, then known as Anna K. Bochman. Mrs. Mathews, in her separate answer, which was sworn to by her, denies the averment in the cross-petition, that the deed was made and delivered to her. The first defense in the answer of Mathews leaves it somewhat doubtful whether he means to deny the fact of the making of the deed to his wife, or whether he merely intends to deny that it was made without consideration and in trust. But as he claims the property under a conveyance from Bochman and wife, and sets up no other right or claim, it is fair to infer that he means, like his wife, to deny the fact of a conveyance to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The -court found, upon the testimony, which must be presumed to have warranted the finding, that the property was not conveyed to the wife of Bochman; consequently the plaintiff could acquire no title by the deed from them. The grantee in the deed of Leaman was found by the court to be the wife of the plaintiff. She, in her answer, denied not only the alleged trust, but the fact that the property had been conveyed to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">It is.contended that the court erred in allowing the facts alleged in the cross-petition to be established by parol evidence; and the statute of frauds is relied on as a bax; to the introduction of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The circumstances of the case are peculiar. There can be no objection to the competency of parol evidence to show that Mrs. Bochman was not the grantee in the Lea-man deed. This fact the court found to be proved. Now, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>the real grantee in the deed, Mrs. Mathews, set up no claim under it. The court found the fact to be that the property was conveyed to her, but that the deed was without consideration, and, although apparently an absolute deed, that it was understood to be, and was, in fact, in trust solely to secure the property for the defendant, and was to be reconveyed to him on demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">If these facts are capable of being proved by parol evidence, there is no ground for disturbing the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Our .statute of frauds omits the seventh, eighth, and ninth sections in relation to trusts contained in the English statute. \"We do not deem it necessary now to consider the effect of such omission. The fourth section of our statute is taken from the third section of the English statute, and in terms ha3 reference to the assigning or granting of <em>legal </em>interests. The fifth section of our statute corresponds with the fourth section of the English statute, and prohibits the bringing of <em>actions </em>in the cases specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Although equitable rights and suits in equity are not named, courts of equity, equally with courts of law, are bound by the statute, in so far as it is applicable to the peculiar jurisdiction exercised by those courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Eraud, and the absence of any other adequate remedy, is one of the principal grounds of equity jurisdiction; and the doctrines of courts of equity in regard to trusts, grow largely out of fraud, express or implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">It is said \u201c fraud in equity is an exception to every rule.\u201d And the principle has often been announced by courts of equity, that the statute of frauds was not made to cover fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">In the present case, the trust does not arise on the mere agreement, but on the conveyance of the property, for which the trust assumed was the sole consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">The trust is not raised so much because of the fraud in the original acquisition of the property as in the subsequent refusal to execute the trust. <em>Page </em>v. <em>Page, </em>8 N. H. 194; Tif. &amp; B. Tr. 189. As said by Bell, J., in <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Herrick, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>18 Penn. St. 128, \u201cthe attempted denial of the confidence is such a fraud as will operate to. convert the purchaser into a trustee <em>ex maleficio.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The case may be brought within the third class of cases, as defined by Lord Hardwicke, in which the court had declared resulting trusts, namely, \u201ccases of fraud, and where the transactions have been carried on <em>mala fide.\u201d Loyd </em>v. <em>Spellet, </em>2 Atk. 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The transaction may not be such as would sustain an action for deceit. But equity deals more liberally than courts of law in matters of fraud, and regards the transaction as incomplete while the trust remains unexecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">It is upon this principle that courts of equity, on parol evidence, establish an equity of redemption against an absolute deed; or declare a trust in property devised against the devisee; or, as in <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>7 Conn. 342, require the grantee of an absolute deed in fee, to execute to a third person a lease for life in the premises conveyed, although the agreement for the lease was made exclusively between the grantor and grantee, in part consideration of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Our present holding is in accordance with the former decisions of this court, in so far as it has been found necessary to consider the question. <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>5 Ohio, 256, which arose before the enactment of our statute of frauds; <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Dille, </em>11 Ohio, 456; <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Melendy, </em>Ib. 355; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Stokely, </em>5 Ohio St. 194; <em>Stall </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>16 Ohio St. 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">No question arises in this case as to the sufficiency of the evidence. If the evidence was competent, it must be presumed to have been sufficient. In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Stokely, supra, </em>the rule as to the amount of evidence required in such cases, is thus laid dowu: \u201cTo establish an express trust, in the case of a conveyance, by deed absolute on its face, it is requisite that the evidence should be <em>clear, certain, </em>and <em>conclusive </em>in proof, not only of the existence of the trust, and that, too, at the time of the conveyance, but also as to its terms and conditions.\u201d The same rule was applied in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number><em>Stall </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>supra. In both cases, the proof was; held to be insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\"><em>Judgment affirmed. </em>.</p>\n<judges id=\"AXK\">Day, C.
