If corporations in Ohio are not indictable for maintaining a nuisance, then any number of persons, not less than five, can, by forming themselves into a corporation, escape liability for acts for which they would be punished as private persons.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b625-6\"><em>W. B. Caldwell, </em>for the defense:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-7\">That a corporate body can be charged with a crime, and tried as a, criminal, is contrary to all our reasoning on the subject. It sets aside the very fundamental principle on which criminal law is founded. A-corporation is incapable of reasoning as to right or wrong, and hence can not be a criminal. That a corporation has no soul, although stale from frequent repetition, is, nevertheless, true, <em>Orr </em>v. <em>The Bank of the United States, </em>1 Ohio, 36; <em>Foote </em>v. <em>The City of Cincinnati, </em>9 Ohio, 31.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-8\">The idea of prosecuting a corporation by indictment we have received from the common law, and yet in Ohio we have repudiated the whole common-law definition of crimes. Whatever is not defined in our statute-book, can not be punished as a crime.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-9\">There is nothing in the statute of 1857 that indicates that the legislature intended to include within its provisions a corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-10\">The word \u201c person \u201d means a human being, and nothing else. Webster\u2019s Dictionary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-11\">A corporation, by figure of speech, may be called a person, but it is' an artificial person. When the word \u201c persons\u201d is spoken of in legislative acts, natural persons will be intended, unless something appear in the context to show that it applies to artificial persons. 1 Scam. 178.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-12\">No provision is made in the statute for making effectual a prosecution against a corporate company. The company could not come into court. The legislature could devise nc means that would bring it. They could bring in the charter, but it would lie there inanimate, as any other piece of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>paper. No officer or member of tbe company is required or authorized to plead. Without further legislation, according to all our ideas of judicial proceeding, trial, conviction, and judgment are impossible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-5\">When we consider that most of our criminal laws can not, by possibility, be applied to a corporate body, it would certainly be a novel state of things if our courts had, in each case, without other criterion, to determine whether a particular statute applied to corporations or not.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b626-6\">Welch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHlG\">We think the court below was right. Criminal laws are to be construed strictly in favor of the accused. In its primary sense, the word \u201cperson\u201d means a natural person only. I know of no criminal statute in Ohio where the word has been held to apply to a corpora-ration; nor do I know of any case where an attempt has before been made in this state to indict a corporation. We have no common-law crimes in Ohio, and the whole theory and machinery of our administration of criminal law seem adapted only to the prosecution and punishment of natural persons. There is no provision of law for bringing an indicted party into court by summons, or otherwise than by actual arrest of his person. Under such a state of legislation and practice, the legislature could not have intended, in the use of the word \u201c person,\u201d which is found in almost every criminal law of the state, to authorize an indictment against a corporation for this particular offense, without any special or further provision as to the liability of corporations, or the mode of proceeding against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b626-8\">Hay, C.
