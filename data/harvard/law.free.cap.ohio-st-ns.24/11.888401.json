Mrs. Cone, a widow at the time of her intermarriage with the defendant, had one child, Mrs. \u2022Jones, a married woman, and was seized of sundry parcels of real estate; she was the owner, in her own right, of moneys, choses in action, and other personal property. \u25a0She had, during coverture, advanced and loaned to her husband, the defendant, certain moneys, and to the defend.ant and a third party (bis brother) certain other moneys. Eor the moneys so loaned to her husband, the defendant, she received from him his separate promissory note; .and for the other moneys she received the joint note of her husband and said third party. These notes, together with the personal chattels referred to, were in her possession at the time of making her wiLl hereinafter referred to, and at the'time of her death. She held and claimed them independently of her husband, and he made no adverse claim to them. She had no children by Cone, and she had none by the former marriage except the daughter before referred to, who had children, and who continued under \u2022coverture at the time of making the will. Under these \u25a0circumstances, on the 11th of March, 1858, Mrs. Cone, in due form of law, made and executed her last will and testament, and the same has been proven and admitted to probate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-7\">The parts of the will material to be considered are as \u2022follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-8\">I. <em>\u201c </em>I give and devise all my messuages, lands, and tenements, wheresoever situated, to my daughter, Elvira A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Jones, and her heirs forever; and I do hereby nominate,, constitute, and 'appoint my brother, James S.

If my daughter should die leaving no heirs of her own body, in that event happening, I will, devise, and bequeath all my estate, both real and personal, to my brothers, James S.

He could not consistently do both, and an attempt to do both was itself, in legal effect, an act of election to take under the will. <em>Birmingham, </em>v. <em>Kirwan, </em>2 Sch. &amp; Lefr. 452; <em>Butcher </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>5 Madd. 61; <em>Chalmers </em>v. <em>Stoul, </em>2 V. &amp; B. 222; <em>Dickinson </em>v.

The doctine of election does not prevail, in Ohio, except with regard to the right of dower; and, <em>as to that, </em>only to the extent, and in the manner, prescribed by statute. <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Collier, </em>3 Ohio St. 376, 377; <em>Stilley </em>v. <em>Folger, </em>14 Ohio, 646, 647; Birchard, J., <em>Morningstar </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>15 Ohio, 366; 3 Curwen\u2019s Rev.

There being no words of exclusion, would the will of Mrs. Cone be disappointed <em>in a technical sense, </em>unless the defendant were put to an election as between the bequest therein made to him and his estate by the curtesy?</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-9\">The presumption of the law is in the negative:</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-10\">1.

It can not be said that Mrs. Cone <em>intended </em>to exclude \u2022the estate of her husband by the curtesy, because it does mot appear, <em>by the terms of the will, </em>that she was aware of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>his right to such an estate. <em>Forrester </em>v.

A devise to others, <em>in general loords, </em>of the estate in which curtesy or dower is claimed, affords no indication of a design that there should be any election. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Telford, </em>1 R. &amp; Mylne, 244; <em>Forrester </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>Ambler, 390; <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>1 Drewry, 42; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>3 Ib. 697; 1 De Gex &amp; Jones, 62; <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Maxwell, 2 </em>De Gex, Macnaghten &amp; Gordon, 705; <em>Bull </em>v. <em>Church, </em>5 Hill, 206-208; <em>Church </em>v. <em>Bull, in error, 2 </em>Denio, 430; <em>Adsit </em>v. <em>Adsit, 2 </em>Johns.

Postponing the enjoyment of a devise or gift to others, by admitting an estate of dower or curtesy, does not, in a legal sense, disappoint or disturb the will. <em>Adsit </em>v. <em>Adsit, 2 </em>Johns.

The abstract question is quite settled that an annuity out of the estate is now held not to have the effect of barring the wife of her dower, as inconsistent with it. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>1 Conner &amp; Lawson, 129; <em>Pitts </em>v. <em>Snowden, </em>cited in 2 Roper on Leg. 418, 419; <em>Lord Dorchester </em>v. <em>Earl of Effingham, </em>Cooper\u2019s Ch.

Does the will make a beneficial provision for defendant? 2. Does it assume to dispose of his life estate in the land devised ? 3. Has defendant made his election? We answer the first and second of these questions in the affirmative, and the third one in the negative. We think the provision made in the will for defendant is beneficial, and that it was manifestly the purpose of the testatrix to dispose of his life estate; but we do not think he has made any election by which he ought to be bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">The question whether the will makes a beneficial provision for the defendant, is simply the question whether he was equitably indebted to his wife at the time of her death, in the amount of his notes given to her. We think he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>was. He borrowed the money of his wife, and at the time it first came into his hands, promised to repay it to her. This constituted him in equity a trustee, to hold the money for her use, and he is bound as such trustee to account foi it to her estate. The fiction of the law, that the husband and wife are one person, and the dotrine that she is incapable of making a- valid contract with her husband, are, in such cases, disregarded in equity, so far as may be necessary to carry into effect the real intentions of the parties. Eor such a purpose they may be regarded as separate persons, and the husband considered as sustaining the character of trustee, as well as that of husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">As to the second question, namely, whether the will assumes to dispose of the life estate, I need perhaps say but little. A bare reading of its several provisions, we think, will show that it admits of no other construction than the one indicated. It is true, as counsel claim, that if it will reasonably admit of a construction not involving a disposition of the life estate, that construction must prevail. This is the rule of the common law, and it is only as to the widow\u2019s right to dower that the reverse rule has been established in Ohio. Under our statute the will is to be regarded as assuming to dispose of the dower estate, unless the contrary clearly appears. In the present case the common law rule prevails, that is, we are bound to hold that the life estate is <em>not </em>disposed of, unless the contrary clearly appeal\u2019s. Without going into details of its provisions, suffice it to say, that, in our judgment, the contrary, here does clearly appear, and that no reasonable or admissible construction can be put upon this will, which does not make it intend a disposition of a present estate in the lands devised. The authorities cited by counsel are inapplicable. They relate mainly to cases of dower and annuities. Were it a dower interest, or an annuity, that was in controversy here, it might be saved to the owner without defeating the plain objects of the will. A right of dower, or an annuity, is a mere incumbrance, and necessarily implies a present estate in another person than the widow or annuitant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The repugnancy here is in the fact that the testratrix assumes to dispose of a present subsisting estate, when she owns only a reversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The claim that the defendant has made his election is utterly without foundation. The assumption is that he elected to take under the will. There is just as. much ground for saying that he elected not to take under the will. An election by him implies the taking of one thing and the rejection of the other. The defendant has \u201c elected \u201d to take <em>both. </em>To be binding on a party in such case, the election must be made understandingly \u2014 that is, with a knowledge both of the facts and of his rights under the will. No such election has been made by the defendant, and he yet has the right, and is bound to make such election.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b34-7\">Hat, C.
