Where a life policy is made and accepted, upon the expressed condition that if the annual premium is not fully paid within the time specified, the policy \u201c shall be null and void, and wholly forfeited,\u201d the failure to pay the premium avoids the policy.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b79-11\">3. Where the policy also provides that no agent of the company, except the president and secretary, can waive such forfeiture, authority conferred upon an agent before the premiums became due to collect them, does not impliedly invest him with authority to waive the forfeiture.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b79-13\">4. Notwithstanding the limitation upon the power of agents, declared in the policy in respect to waiving the forfeiture, the company is competent to invest such authority in any of its agents. The authority may be express, or it may be implied from circumstances, but the burden of showing it in either case, is on the party claiming the benefit of its exercise.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>5. An agent, having no authority to waive the forfeiture, acting in the-interest of the assured, received the unpaid part of a premium on a forfeited policy, after the life insured had ended, for which he gave a receipt antedated, and forwarded the money to the company, concealing the facts as to such payment: <em>Held, </em>that the receiving of the-money by the company, in ignorance of such facts, was no ratification of the act of the agent in receiving the money.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b80-6\">6. The fact that the company, on tendering back the money so received,. omitted to return certain notes given in part payment of premiums,, but which the forfeiture of the policy rendered uncollectible, will not affect the rights of the parties in a suit on the policy; nor is the fact, that the notes are payable to order material, where they show on their face the consideration for which they were given.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-8\">Error to the Court of Common Pleas of Logan county..

Durkee was the agent of the company at Bellefon\u2022taine during the transactions in question. It does not appear at what time the policy was delivered by the agent, nor at what time he received the first premium. It does appear from his testimony that the first premium was reported to the company as settled in his report made the 15th of De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>cember, 1868-, and that the first premium note and the remainder of the first premium in cash were' then transmitted to the company, the receipt of which was duly acknowledged. No reference was made in this report to the premium, which became due December 1, 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\">Durkee was a witness for the plaintiff. It also appears from his testimony that, on the 1st of December, 1868, when the premium for the second year became payable, he was absent. On the 11th of the same montbq a few days after the agent\u2019s return, MeMillen came to him and executed the premium note for $16, and the cash note for $8, dating both as of the 1st of December, but no. money was paid. MeMillen requested the agent, when he was about to remit to the company, to call on him at the post-office and get the money, which the agent promised to do. When the agent was about to make his next remittance, he called on MeMillen aud said to him he would like to have the cash part of his renewal for 1869 \u2014 $8.32. Mc-Millen remarked that he was busy making up the mails, and had not then time to stop, and asked the agent if he would not be remitting again in a few days. The agent answered that he would be, and said that when he next remitted he would let MeMillen know. This was the last conversation between them. The agent states that when he made his next remittance he never thought of MeMillen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-6\">MeMillen died on the 2d day of March, 1869. On the morning of that day, and while MeMillen was in a dying condition, the policy in question became the subject of conversation between Durkee, the agent, and some others who were friends of MeMillen. Durkee informed them of the facts in l\u2019egard to the last premium. On one of them expressing regret that the money had not been paid, Durkee stated that he did not think it would make any difference whether the money was paid at that time or not; that he considered it his fault, and not McMillen\u2019s. One of them remarked, that if he had the money, he would pay the amount of the unpaid premium, and expressed a desire to borrow the money for the purpose. Durkee handed him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>;$10, and gave him directions to deposit it in bank to Dorkee\u2019s credit. The $10 was on the same day so deposited, but before the deposit was made, McMillen died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-5\">On the same day, Lyman Dow paid Durkee $10, for which he took a receipt, antedated to February. 2d.

The report of this .renewal was made by adding it to his previous monthly report of February, which had been returned to him by the company for certain corrections. At the same time, he advised the company of McMillen\u2019s death, and in explanation of the omission to include the renewal of this policy in his former reports he said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-7\">\u201c On the 11th of December he came to my house and executed the notes I here inclose, and it was my fault their not being put in a former report, he saying to me, \u201c When you want the cash, call at the post-office,\u201d he being chief clerk there.

He further states that Durkee was not authorized to receive it <em>then; </em>and that the policy was not in force March 2d, when McMillen is reported to have died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-9\">A correspondence followed between the president of the company and Durkee, on the subject of this policy, which it is not deemed necessary here to notice,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-10\">On the 25th of May, 1869, the superintendent of agencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>of the company went to Bellefontaine to investigate the facts in regard to the payment of the premiums on the policy. On ascertaining them to be as before stated, he tendered back the money paid on the last premium; 'but the tender was refused.

The prohibition in the statute is against persons acting for companies that have not complied with the prescribed conditions. Such persons alone are made subject to the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Whether the statute was meant to invalidate policies issued by companies in contravention of its provisions, is to he determined from a consideration of the statute as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">The object of the act is not to make the business of life insurance unlawful. The statute is designed for the protection of policy-holders and others dealing with insurance companies. To this end, it is made unlawful for persons to act on behalf of such companies until the provisions of the statute have been complied with. But we do not think it was intended to devolve on persons dealing with the companies the duty and risk of ascertaining whether they had complied with the statute. On the contrary, it seems to have been the intention of the legislature to rely on the penalties imposed as sufficient to insure such compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>In regard to the claim that, notwithstanding, the company is bound by the policy, yet the other party is excused from performing its condition, it is only necessary to say that if the policy operates at all, it must operate according to its terms. The plaintiff\u2019s action is founded on the policy, and was brought to enforce it against the company. The' liability of the company, under the agreement, can not be-separated from the conditions on which it was made; and in undertaking to enforce it, the plaintiff is bound to show that these conditions have been performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">As the statute does not render the policy void, the main questions arising in the case are :</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">1. Was the policy, at the time of the death of McMillen,. a valid and subsisting obligation against the company ?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">2. If it was not, did the company by its subsequent conduct ratify the previously unauthorized acts of the agent in receiving payment of the premium which became due on the 1st of December, 1868 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">In considering the first question it is to be observed that, the body of the policy contains a provision which declares that the policy is made and accepted upon the express condition that if the amount of any annual premium is not <em>fully paid, </em>on the day provided for, then the policy shall become null aud void, and wholly forfeited; and also that no-agent of the company, except the president or secretary, can waive such forfeiture, or alter that or any other condition, of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The parties were at liberty to contract in their own terms; and where no rule of law or of public policy is contravened, the terms thus employed must furnish the standard for determining their rights under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">By the terms of this policy, full payment of the annual premium on the day provided for, was necessary to its renewal or continuance. As a consequence of the failure to make such payment, it is expressly declared that the policy shall become \u201c null and void, and wholly forfeited.\u201d Hence,, if there was no authorized extension of the time of pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>xnent, the policy had ceased to be operative long before the termination of the life insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">This brings us to the question as to whether Durkee, the agent, had authority from the company to extend the time for paying the premium, or to bind the company by receiving it after default. -v</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">It is declared in the policy that no agent of the company, except the president or secretary, can exercise such authority. Nevertheless, it was competent for the company to invest Durkee, or any other of its subordinate agents, with like authority, if it saw fit to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">But the authority must exist before effect can be given to-the act of the agent vai\u2019ying an express condition of the-policy, after it has once taken effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">The authority may be express, or it may be implied from the previous dealing between the company and its agent, or from other -circumstances. But in whatever form its existence is asserted, the burden of proving it is on the party claiming the benefit of its exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">The evidence as to the mode of doing business between the company and the agent, is limited to what appears in the statement. Nor is there any evidence shoeing the-system or method adopted by the company for conducting-its business from which the authority claimed for the agent can be inferred. And after careful consideration of all the evidence in the case, we are unable to discover any sufficient ground to warrant the conclusion that the agent was authorized to extend the time of payment, or to bind theeompany by waiving the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">We have no hesitation in saying that there is sufficient in the case to show that it was the duty of the company to-afford the policy-holder the opportunity of paying the premium at Bellefontaine, where the agency was established and the policy taken. And although the agent was absent at the time the premium became due, it does not appear-that IMcMillen was ready or desirous to pay it during his-absence. On the contrary, on the agent\u2019s return, which oc~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>curred within a few days, McMillen had the opportunity to make the payment. He gave his notes for part of the premium, but neglected then to pay the part that was due in money, as he also did on one or more subsequent occasions when called on for it. The consequence was that the policy, at the time of his death, did not subsist as a valid obligation of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Nor do we think the company, under the circumstances, can be held to have ratified the act of the agent in receiving payment after the policy had lapsed, and the life insured had ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Ratification by the company implies a knowledge on its part of the facts, or a case in which it was its duty to know them.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Durkee was evidently acting in the interest of , the plaintiff in concealing the facts from the company. This is apparent from the circumstances connected with the receiving \u25a0of the money, from the antedating of the receipt, and from his report to the company. There was no change of circumstances between the time the money was received, and the time it was tendered back, that can affect the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">We think there is nothing, therefore, to <em>estop </em>the company from showing the facts, and it is apparent that as soon -as the truth became known the company tendered back the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">Neither do we think the retaining of the notes by the \u2022company to the time of trial, can be held to give effect to the policy. The notes and the policy are to be taken together as parts of the same transaction. The policy is expressly referred to in the notes. In the premium notes, it is stipulated that their acceptance is in no way to affect the condition of the policy respecting the forfeiture thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">The other note is stated to be given in <em>part payment </em>of the annual premium on the policy ; while the policy itself provides that it is to become void, if the annual premium is not <em>fully paid </em>at the specified time. On the forfeiture of the policy the consideration of the notes failed, and they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>ceased to be collectible. The failure of the company to tender them back was, therefore, a matter of no materiality to the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">There are cases, no doubt, in which equity would relieve against the forfeiture of a policy, or the company would be estopped from insisting upon it. But the evidence does not bring this ease within either class. And while it is true that in life policies, punctuality in the payment of the premiums is of the substance of the contract, yet it is also true that it is a contract eminently requiring good faith both on the part \u2022of the company and of the policy-holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The motion for a new trial ought to have been granted. 'The j udgment will therefore, be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-7\">Day, C.
