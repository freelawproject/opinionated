Gizoni.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">Steven Easley was employed by Southern Shipyards for approximately twenty years. At the time of his accident, Easley was working as a mechanic. His duties included repairing land-based locomotive cranes, stationary cranes, and yard equipment; cutting grass; working in the compressor room; and maintaining Southern\u2019s dry dock. Easley also worked occasionally as a substitute deck hand aboard the D/B SOUTHERN NO. 6 (the NO. 6), a derrick barge owned by Southern and most often used in salvage operations. Easley claims to have worked \u2014 and for purposes of this appeal we assume that he did work \u2014 eleven and a half percent of his time on the NO. 6. Easley was injured in May of 1989 while substituting for a regular crewman as a deck hand on the NO. 6 on a one-day salvage job on the Mississippi River.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-21\">Easley filed suit against Southern, alleging that he was a seaman and entitled to recover under the Jones Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for injuries received as a result of Southern\u2019s negligence. In granting Southern\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the question of seaman status, the district court reasoned that as Easley did not perform a substantial part of his work on a vessel he was not eligible for seaman status. Easley then amended his complaint, claiming negligence under \u00a7 905(b) of the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court granted Southern\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the \u00a7 905(b) claim too, finding that Eas-ley was a ship repairer, one of several classes of workers expressly excluded from negligent actions against employer-shipowners under \u00a7 905(b). We affirmed the district court, and Easley applied to the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. When the Court released its opinion in <em>Gi-zoni, </em>it granted Easley\u2019s writ and remanded the case to us for reconsideration consistent with that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-22\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-23\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b70-24\">Our affirmation in <em>Easley I </em>of the district court\u2019s limitation on Easley\u2019s recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>followed two parallel lines of reasoning. One line involved the relationship between Easley\u2019s status under the LHWCA and his asserted status as a seaman under the Jones Act. The second line involved the relationship between Easley\u2019s regular job as a ship repairer and his desire to proceed with a negligence action against Southern under \u00a7 905(b) of the LHWCA. We discuss these two lines of reasoning below in inverse order, determining the effect of <em>Gizoni </em>on each.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><em>A.Analysis Unaffected by </em>Gizoni</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Our second line of reasoning in <em>Easley I </em>\u2014 concerning the ability of a ship repairer to bring a negligence action under \u00a7 905(b) of the LHWCA \u2014 was unaffected by the <em>Gizoni </em>decision. This court has stated in the context of the LHWCA that \u201c[i]f the employee\u2019s permanent duties, or his interim duties over an appreciable period of time, are such that he would be a covered ship repairer within the meaning of \u00a7 902(3) of the LHWCA, then he is barred from bringing [a negligence] suit against his employer under \u00a7 905(b).\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When, in a situation involving an employer who is the shipowner, there has been a primary determination that the worker is not a seaman for purposes of the Jones Act but that he is covered by the LHWCA, and a secondary determination that the worker\u2019s trade is that of ship repairer or any of the other occupations listed in \u00a7 905(b), the worker is barred by the terms of that section from maintaining a negligence action against his employer, assuming that \u201cthe injury was caused by the negligence of persons engaged in providing shipbuilding or repair services.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This analysis remains correct; it was not affected by <em>Gizoni.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">B. <em>Analysis Overruled by </em>Gizoni</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">By contrast, the <em>Gizoni </em>decision overruled this circuit\u2019s position on the inability of a worker whose job description is listed in \u00a7 902(3) of the LHWCA to claim Jones Act coverage as a seaman. We had held, in <em>Pizzitolo v. Electro-Coal Transfer Corp.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that if a worker\u2019s occupation was one \u201cexpressly enumerated in the [LHWCA]\u201d and the worker met the Act\u2019s situs requirement, no inquiry would be made into the worker\u2019s status as a seaman; thus, there could be no negligence action under the Jones Act. The worker would be limited to compensation under the LHWCA because, as discussed earlier, these workers cannot bring a negligence action under \u00a7 905(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">When, in <em>Gizoni, </em>the Supreme Court held that a worker whose occupation was listed in \u00a7 902(3) was not automatically barred from claiming coverage under the Jones Act, it overruled <em>Pizzitolo. </em>The district court in <em>Gizoni </em>had granted ' summary judgment because \u201cGizoni was a harbor worker precluded from bringing his action by the exclusive remedy provisions of the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a).\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Supreme Court stated that the district court\u2019s holding, though \u201cin line with Fifth Circuit precedent, ... ignores the fact that some maritime workers may be Jones Act seaman performing a job specifically enumerated under the LHWCA.\u201d The Court stated further that \u201c \u2018[i]t is not the employee\u2019s particular job that is determinative, but the employee\u2019s connection to a vessel.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-14\">C. <em>Easley\u2019s Status</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-15\">The <em>Gizoni </em>decision nullifies the facet of our <em>Easley I </em>analysis which held that because Easley\u2019s position was one listed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u00a7 902(3) of the LHWCA, he could not be covered by the Jones Act. <em>Gizoni </em>does not, however, foreclose the ability of the district court to grant summary judgment regarding seaman status for workers whose jobs, like Easley\u2019s, are thus listed, when undisputed facts (other than such a listing) support granting summary judgment. <em>Gizoni </em>relies extensively on <em>McDermott International, Inc. v. Wilander,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which the Supreme Court stated that, although the jury is to find the facts and apply the legal standard of seaman status to the facts thus found, the trial court \u201cmust not abdicate its duty to determine if there is a reasonable basis to support\u201d a jury\u2019s conclusion that seaman status existed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The <em>Wilander </em>Court continued, \u201csummary judgment or a directed verdict is mandated where the facts and the law will reasonably support only one conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, after <em>Gizoni, </em>the question for this court in our plenary review of a grant of summary judgment on the issue of seaman status \u2014 ultimately an issue of fact \u2014 is whether application of the legal standard set out in Wilander<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to the undisputed historical facts of the case under consideration makes summary judgment for the defendant proper because the law will not reasonably support another conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The <em>Wilander </em>Court declared that the key to the issue of \u201cseaman status is <em>employment-related connection to a vessel in navigation.\" </em><footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To grant summary judgment for the defendant, a court must determine that there is no reasonable basis in fact to support a jury verdict that the plaintiff\u2019s connection to the vessel in question is sufficient to bestow seaman status.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Although the Court did not precisely define the boundaries of the seaman status, it held that \u201ca necessary element of the connection is that a seaman perform the work of the vessel.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court also quoted <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Lawson, </em>stating that \u201c \u2018[tjhere is implied a definite and permanent connection with the vessel, an obligation to forward her enterprise.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the instant case, the district court held as a matter of law that Easley could not be a seaman. For the purposes of its consideration, the court assumed the truth of Eas-ley\u2019s allegation that he worked eleven and a half percent of his time on the NO. 6 and spent his remaining time performing his primary responsibilities of land-based work. On that basis the court held that, as Easley failed to perform a \u201csubstantial part of his work on a vessel,\u201d he was not a seaman as a matter of law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">This court reviews the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>using the same criteria relied on by the district court in the first instance.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> For the purposes of the case <em>sub judice, </em>we must decide whether, as a matter of law, summary judgment is proper when a permanently assigned land-based worker nevertheless works eleven and a half percent of his employment time on one of his employer\u2019s vessels, performing traditional seaman duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">For purposes of this inquiry, it is important to note that just as the worker\u2019s performance of non-maritime work does not prohibit seaman status, his performance of traditional maritime work does not confer seaman status. Based on the summary judgment evidence in the record of this case, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant, we find that as to the NO. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>6 Easley did not have the \u201cemployment-related connection to a vessel in navigation\u201d required by <em>Wilander, </em>and therefore could not be deemed a seaman for purposes of coverage under the Jones Act. Irrespective of the traditional maritime nature of Easley\u2019s work on the occasions when he was aboard the NO. 6, the irregularity of his intermittent stints of short duration on that vessel, sporadically interspersed between long periods of performing his regular land-based functions, eschews the substantial and enduring relationship to the vessel envisioned in <em>Gizoni, Wilander, </em>and <em>Lawson. </em>Easley\u2019s connection to the NO. 6 was simply too attenuated to constitute seaman status.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">To understand fully the concept of \u201cemployment-related connection to a vessel in navigation,\u201d we look to this circuit\u2019s traditional definition of a Jones Act seaman announced decades ago in <em>Offshore Co. v. Robison.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To be covered as a seaman under the Jones Act, a worker must: (1) be permanently assigned to a vessel in navigation <em>or </em>perform a substantial part of his work on the vessel; and (2) contribute to the mission of the vessel. Easley was not permanently assigned to the NO. 6; he was a land-based employee. Neither did he perform a substantial part of his work on the vessel. Clearly neither <em>Robison </em>nor <em>Wilander </em>and <em>Gizoni </em>envision a \u201csnapshot\u201d test for seaman status, inspecting only the situation as it exists at the instant of injury; a much more enduring relationship is contemplated in the jurisprudence. At least three cases in this circuit involved workers who spent greater percentages of their employment time on vessels than did Easley, yet the worker in each case was held not to be seaman as a matter of law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We do not imply that the quantum or percentage of a worker\u2019s time spent on a vessel in navigation is either the sole factor or the determinative factor in the search for seaman status. But considering this circuit\u2019s consistent precedent, it is impossible for us to conclude that Easley, who spent at most eleven and a half percent of his time on a vessel, was a seaman for purposes of the Jones Act, particularly when viewed in light of other factors affecting his connection with the subject vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Upon revisiting this appeal as instructed by the Supreme Court on remand following the Court\u2019s <em>Gizoni </em>decision, we still find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s summary judgment to the extent that it held that Easley was not a Jones Act seaman. Consequently, the holding of the district court that Easley is not entitled to bring a negligence action either as a seaman under the Jones Act or as a ship repairer under \u00a7 905(b) of the LHWCA is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-16\">. <em>Easley </em>v. <em>Southern Shipbuilding Corp.
