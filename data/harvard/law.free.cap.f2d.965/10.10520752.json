We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">This case is already the subject of two published opinions by this court. Briggs challenged the validity of her 1986 conviction by a plea of guilty to two counts of bank fraud pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court denied the motion and an appeal ensued. Initially, this court reversed Briggs\u2019 conviction and remanded for entry of a new plea. <em>United States v. Briggs, </em>920 F.2d 287, 296 (5th Cir.1991). Thereafter, we <em>sua sponte </em>granted rehearing, withdrew our prior opinion, and remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Briggs\u2019 guilty plea was knowing and intelligent. <em>United States v. Briggs, </em>939 F.2d 222, 228-29 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Following the hearing on remand, the magistrate judge recommended that the \u00a7 2255 motion be denied because Briggs\u2019 conduct involved \u201cimplied\u201d misrepresentations. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations and held that Briggs\u2019 implied misrepresentations were sufficient to support a conviction under applicable provisions of the bank fraud statute; therefore, her plea was knowing and intelligent. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(a)(2). Briggs appeals that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">From 1981 to 1986, Briggs worked first in the Treasury Department of Electronic Data Systems (\u201cEDS\u201d) and later as an Assistant Cash Manager for Southmark Corporation (\u201cSouthmark\u201d). Her day-to-day responsibilities at EDS and Southmark involved the investment of surplus cash in company accounts at financial institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">Between 1984 and 1986, Briggs initiated over a dozen unauthorized transfers from bank accounts at Texas Commerce Bank and San Jacinto Savings and Loan Association belonging to an EDS subsidiary and to Southmark, respectively. These transfers, totalling more than five million dollars, were made to Dallas accounts belonging to Briggs, her two sons, and a friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-16\">In perpetrating her scheme, Briggs never made any overt misrepresentations, false promises, or false statements to any financial institution. She would, however, purposefully mislead the bank employees by submerging the unauthorized transfers in the midst of and for the same amounts as authorized ones. She did not disclose her lack of authority to make the unauthorized transfers. She admitted that she believed, at the time she caused the unauthorized transfers, that the bank employees who handled her telephone calls thought she was making legitimate business transfers. She pretended to have authority to transfer the money and did \u201ceverything possible to make it sound like those transfers were the same as\u201d the authorized transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b79-18\">Briggs raises two issues on appeal. First, the district court erred when it found that she had entered her guilty plea knowingly and intelligently. Second, she did not put the transferring banks at risk when she transferred funds from her employer\u2019s accounts; therefore, she did not violate the bank fraud statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-19\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b79-20\">Briggs contends that she pleaded guilty to bank fraud under the mistaken belief that her conduct, in initiating wire transfers from her employers\u2019 accounts at financial institutions to her own accounts and others, constituted false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises under the bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(a)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, she argues, her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>guilty plea was not knowingly and intelligently entered and was procured in violation of her due process rights under the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">In its opinion, this court carefully delineated the basis for its holding that the record did not reveal whether Briggs executed her scheme by means of any false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises and described the specific facts which should be developed on remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">We do not hold that the ordering of a wire transfer can never involve misrepresentation, only that the act <em>itself </em>does not constitute misrepresentation. For example, our precedent makes clear that \u00a7 1344(a)(2) would encompass a wire transfer order containing an <em>actual </em>misrepresentation (e.g., a false recitation of the authority for its issuance). Thus, where the defendant falsely represents that she is acting under her employer\u2019s authority, we would have little trouble concluding that such conduct is squarely prohibited by the statute. Nor do we suggest that there can never be an <em>implied misrepresentation </em>of authority in such circumstances....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\"><em>Briggs, </em>939 F.2d at 227 (italics in original, footnote omitted, underscore added). In other words, an implicit misrepresentation by Briggs that she was acting under her employer\u2019s authority would be sufficient to establish the misrepresentation element of section 1344(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u201cWe review the district court's factual findings in a section 2255 proceeding for clear error. The clear error standard applies equally to findings made by the magistrate judge and adopted by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Cates, </em>952 F.2d 149, 153 (5th Cir.1992) (citations omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 2319, 119 L.Ed.2d 238. The magistrate judge found that Briggs\u2019 conduct impliedly misrepresented her authority to make the wire transfers. After a review of the record, we cannot say that this finding was clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, it is clear that Briggs falsely held herself out to have authority, which she in fact did not have. This conduct constitutes a false pretense within the meaning of the statute. Briggs failed to meet her burden of proving that her plea was unknowing and unintelligent. <em>Briggs, </em>939 F.2d at 228-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-14\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b80-15\">Briggs also argues that a person cannot commit bank fraud without exposing a bank to risk. She cites <em>Tanner v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 107, 107 S.Ct. 2739, 97 L.Ed.2d 90 (1987), and <em>United States v. Lemons, </em>941 F.2d 309, 316 (5th Cir.1991). According to Briggs, the bank must be a target or victim of the fraud. Briggs testified that EDS and Southmark were the targets of her fraud and that she never intended to steal from Texas Commerce Bank or San Jacinto Savings and Loan Association. It is established that a perpetrator\u2019s fraud need not cause a financial institution to suffer an actual loss for a valid conviction under \u00a7 1344. <em>Lemons, </em>941 F.2d at 315-16; <em>Morgenstern, </em>933 F.2d at 1112-14; <em>United States v. Church, </em>888 F.2d 20, 24 (5th Cir.1989). In a section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>1344(a)(2) case, it is only necessary that the custodial bank be exposed to the risk of loss, i.e., exposed to civil liability. <em>See Lemons, </em>941 F.2d at 315-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-2\">Although the record does not disclose whether the banks were ever threatened with a civil action by EDS, Southmark or one of the banks to which Briggs transferred funds, her conduct clearly put those institutions at risk. <em>See Morgenstem, </em>933 F.2d at 1114 (\u201cBy falling prey to this scheme the bank lost custody over its ac-countholder\u2019s money, exposing the bank to the real threat of civil liability for having succumbed to Morgenstern\u2019s fraudulent conduct\u201d); <em>see, generally, Bradford Trust Co. v. Texas American Bank-Houston, </em>790 F.2d 407 (5th Cir.1986) (as between initiating bank and receiving bank, initiating bank was liable for losses resulting from fraudulently induced wire transfer (applying Texas law)).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-12\">. Briggs did not appeal from her conviction or sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b79-21\">. As enacted in 1984, and as applicable to this case, the bank fraud statute provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>(a) Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">(1) to defraud a federally chartered or insured financial institution; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">(2) to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities or other property owned by or under the custody or control of a federally chartered or insured financial institution by means of <em>false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, </em>shall be [fined or imprisoned],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(a) (1988) (emphasis added). The bank fraud statute was amended in 1989; the amendment does not affect the analysis of this case. <em>See Briggs, </em>939 F.2d at 225 n. 6. This court has already concluded that section 1344(a)(1) does not apply to this case. <em>Id. </em>at 225.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b80-17\">. <em>See United States v.
