GEFT believed Westfield's relevant sign standards ordinance contains unconstitutional content-based speech restrictions and that this invalidity renders the ordinance nonexistent. GEFT only stopped installing the billboard when a contract attorney for Westfield threatened to arrest GEFT's representatives if the installation work continued. After this confrontation, Westfield and GEFT filed dueling injunction motions. GEFT asked for an injunction preventing Westfield from violating its due process rights; Westfield asked the district court to enjoin GEFT from installing the billboard pending the outcome of this litigation. The district court denied GEFT's motion and granted Westfield's motion, and GEFT filed this interlocutory appeal. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. GEFT's Billboard &amp; Westfield's Sign Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff-appellant GEFT buys and leases land upon which it builds, maintains, and operates signs. It holds a valid leasehold interest in property located in Westfield (the \"Esler Property\"), and it initiated this lawsuit because it sought to build a digital billboard (the \"Billboard\") on this leased property. To do so, it needed a permit from both the State of Indiana and the City of Westfield.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ind. Dep't of Transp., Outdoor Advertising Control Manual 46 (2014), https://www.in.gov/indot/files/Permits_OutdoorAdvertisingControlManual_2014.pdf (Indiana permitting requirements \"are in addition to any permit or licensing requirements of local governing bodies\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant-appellee Westfield adopted the Westfield-Washington Township Unified Development Ordinance in 2014.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Westfield-Washington Township, Ind. Ordinance (\"UDO\"). The UDO regulates a broad range of development activities in Westfield, including the design, placement, and maintenance of signs within the city.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. 6.17 (the \"Sign Standards\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Sign Standards require a permit for most signs, but thirteen categories are exempt from that requirement (the \"Permit\n   Exceptions\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. 6.17(C)-(D).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Sign Standards also prohibit twelve types of signs entirely, two of which the parties discuss here.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   art. 6.17(E). \"Off-premise Signs\" are not allowed in Westfield, \"except as otherwise permitted by\" the UDO (the \"Off-Premises Ban\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. 6.17(E)(5). An off-premises sign is \"[a] Sign directing attention to a specific business, product, service, entertainment, or any other activity offered, sold, or conducted elsewhere than upon the lot where the Sign is displayed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. 12.1. Westfield also bars \"Pole Signs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. 6.17(E)(4). A pole sign is \"[a] Sign which is supported by one or more poles, posts, or braces upon the ground, in excess of six (6) feet in height, not attached to or supported by any building.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. 12.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The UDO treats signs erected in violation of its provisions (including signs erected without permits) as common nuisances.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. 11.2. To remedy such a nuisance, Westfield \"may issue a stop work order and shall advise the Property Owner of the sign ... in writing of a violation of this Chapter and specify a date for compliance. The written notice shall describe the violation, appeal process, and enforcement provisions including penalties that may be assessed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. 11.5(A). The city may also obtain an injunction in state court to restrain UDO violations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. 11.5(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   GEFT obtained the requisite sign permit from Indiana in October 2017. However, it never obtained (or even applied for) a sign permit from Westfield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. GEFT's Billboard &amp; Federal Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Notwithstanding its lack of permit, GEFT began to erect the Billboard on the Esler Property on November 2, 2017. Specifically, GEFT installed a steel pole in the ground to serve as the Billboard's foundation and built a forty-square-foot \"No Trespassing\" sign nearby. The next day, GEFT sued Westfield in the Southern District of Indiana, challenging two portions of the Sign Standards-the Permit Exceptions and the Off-Premises Ban-as unconstitutional content-based speech restrictions. GEFT specifically alleged the Permit Exceptions and the Off-Premises Ban violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 9 of the Indiana Constitution, and that the Sign Standards did not comply with Indiana Home Rule requirements. GEFT sought as relief a declaratory judgment that the UDO's Sign Standards chapter was unconstitutional on its face and as applied, an order enjoining Westfield from enforcing the chapter, and damages pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 7, Westfield posted a \"Stop Work Notice\" on the steel pole on the Esler Property. The notice listed two UDO violations: \"Installation of an accessory structure without a permit\" and \"Installation of a sign without a permit.\" GEFT responded to this development by letter on November 21, informing Westfield that it \"intend[ed] to move forward with the erection of the Billboard\" within the next thirty days. GEFT also informed the city that in its view, the Sign Standards simply did not apply to this planned work:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The City's Sign Standards purport to preclude the erection of the Billboard. However, the Sign Standards are unconstitutional under applicable law, as they restrict GEFT's right to free speech under\n   the First Amendment. Because they are unconstitutional, it is as if the Sign Standards do not exist.... Because the Sign Standards are void due to their unconstitutionality ... there are no local sign regulations governing GEFT's erection of the Billboard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In turn, Westfield sent another letter on November 22, elaborating on the UDO violations identified on its earlier Stop Work Notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, Westfield stated that the steel pole constituted an \"Accessory Building\" under the UDO, and GEFT should have obtained an improvement location permit (separate from and in addition to a sign permit) before installing it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Westfield informed GEFT that if the steel pole was intended to be part of a sign, there were two further issues: GEFT should have applied for a sign permit before commencing installation, and in any event, the UDO bans all pole signs. Finally, Westfield informed GEFT that \"[t]his letter is being provided as a warning to notify you of these violations ... Please remedy this violation within thirty (30) days from the issuance of this letter (December 22\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   ) in order to avoid further enforcement action.\" Westfield then posted two more Stop Work Notices (identical to the first) on the steel pole, on November 27 and December 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Despite these notices, GEFT mobilized a construction team on December 16 to finish erecting the Billboard by placing an \"advertising head\" on the steel pole. At approximately 8:15 AM, GEFT's contractors began their work by offloading steel components at the site, on the ground near the pole. GEFT's founder and owner Jeffrey Lee was onsite that morning, along with GEFT representative John Kisiel, two contractors hired to perform sign erector work on the sign head installation (Marshall Heath Brock and Phillip Finn), a crane operator, and others. At around 10:15 AM, Westfield City Inspector Matthew Skelton arrived at the Esler Property along with two Westfield police officers. They demanded that all work stop, and one of the police officers told Lee that if construction continued, GEFT would be \"asking for trouble.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   While the City Inspector and the officers were still onsite, counsel for Westfield e-mailed GEFT's counsel, informing them that \"GEFT or its agents ... appear to be attempting to continue to build a structure without a permit in violation of the Westfield UDO and the Stop Work Order. Law enforcement has been called and the City will use its police powers as necessary to enforce the stop work order.\" Counsel for GEFT responded that Westfield had no legal basis to cease activity at the Esler Property; Westfield's counsel in turn cited the UDO and noted that the city \"has the authority to abate a common nuisance by using its police powers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Back at the Esler Property, Skelton spoke with each of GEFT's onsite contractors, including Brock and Finn, informing them that they would be fined if they continued to do any work on the Billboard in violation of the Stop Work Orders. The crane operator demobilized the crane and the contractors stopped all their work. But approximately five minutes after Skelton and the police officers left the site, the contractors resumed installation of the Billboard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   About twenty minutes later, Brian Zaiger (a partner at a private law firm representing the city) arrived at the site. Zaiger identified himself as a \"City Attorney\" and advised Lee that \"the police were on their way.\" Zaiger then pointed at Lee and Kisiel and said that if work was not stopped immediately, he would have them arrested along with GEFT's onsite contractors. When Lee said that this was a civil matter rather than a criminal one, Zaiger responded that Lee was in violation of the Stop Work Orders, any continued work was a nuisance, and the only way to abate the nuisance was to \"throw you two in jail and then figure it out from there.\" During his exchange with Zaiger, Lee called GEFT's attorney and offered the phone to Zaiger; Zaiger, however, said he \"wasn't interested\" in speaking with him. According to Zaiger, he did not know it was counsel for GEFT that was on the call, as Lee had \"just said he had a lawyer on the phone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Zaiger also approached the crane operator and three other contractors to tell them that they would be arrested if they continued to do work at the site. The crane operator demobilized the crane and the contractors stopped performing any work. Lee also instructed GEFT's contractors to cease further work on putting the advertising head onto the Billboard. Lee observed Zaiger tell a police officer who had returned to the site that, because work had stopped on the sign, there was no need to arrest anyone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Westfield posted another Stop Work Notice on GEFT's pole on December 18, and it posted more comprehensive Stop Work Orders on the pole on January 19 and January 26, 2018. According to Lee, though, GEFT stopped work on the Billboard only because of Zaiger's December 16 arrest threats, not because of the city's Stop Work Notices or Orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Preliminary Injunction &amp; Restraining Order Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Three days after this confrontation at the Esler Property, Westfield filed a motion for a restraining order compelling GEFT to immediately stop work on the installation of its sign pending the outcome of its federal lawsuit. According to the city, this was necessary to maintain the status quo during the litigation, and it was warranted because GEFT had demonstrated its refusal to adhere to the UDO's permit requirements and pole-sign ban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   GEFT then filed an amended complaint and its own preliminary injunction motion. GEFT's First Amended Complaint, which is the operative version for purposes of appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   included the three causes of action in the original complaint: (1) the Permit Exceptions violate the First Amendment and Article I, \u00a7 9 of the Indiana Constitution ; (2) the Off-Premises Ban violates the same provisions; and (3) the Sign Standards are void for not fulfilling the requirements of Indiana's Home Rule. GEFT also added two new causes of action\n   to its complaint based on the events of December 16: (4) a due process claim pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (5) a claim for abuse of process. In its contemporaneous preliminary injunction motion, GEFT requested that the court enjoin Westfield from (a) \"Taking any further actions to enforce the Stop Work Notice;\" (b) \"Taking any further actions to prevent GEFT from enjoying the use of its property without due process of law;\" and (c) \"Threatening GEFT and/or its representatives with imprisonment, or imprisoning them, for violation of the UDO and/or the Stop Work Notice (or any similar order) when GEFT finishes construction of the ... Billboard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After a hearing on both motions, the court denied GEFT's motion and granted Westfield's motion on September 28, 2018. It ordered GEFT \"to not continue any work on its pole and digital sign in Westfield until after resolution of this case on the merits.\" This interlocutory appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   When reviewing a district court's grant or denial of a preliminary injunction, \"legal conclusions are reviewed de novo, findings of historical or evidentiary fact for clear error, and the balancing of the injunction factors for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Christian Legal Soc'y v. Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3336938\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/853/#p859\">\n    453 F.3d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 859 (7th Cir. 2006). To obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff \"must establish that it has some likelihood of success on the merits; that it has no adequate remedy at law; that without relief it will suffer irreparable harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Ind. &amp; Ky., Inc. v. Comm'r of Ind. State Dep't of Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517771\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/809/#p816\">\n    896 F.3d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 816 (7th Cir. 2018). If the plaintiff fails to meet any of these threshold requirements, the court \"must deny the injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Girl Scouts of Manitou Council, Inc. v. Girl Scouts of U.S. of Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734916\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/1079/#p1086\">\n    549 F.3d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1086 (7th Cir. 2008). However, if the plaintiff passes that threshold, \"the court must weigh the harm that the plaintiff will suffer absent an injunction against the harm to the defendant from an injunction, and consider whether an injunction is in the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517771\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/809/#p816\">\n    896 F.3d at 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Circuit \"employs a sliding scale approach\" for this balancing: if a plaintiff is more likely to win, the balance of harms can weigh less heavily in its favor, but the less likely a plaintiff is to win the more that balance would need to weigh in its favor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517771\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/809/#p816\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Like the district court, we begin our analysis with GEFT's preliminary injunction motion before turning to Westfield's motion. We note that our analysis of these motions need not involve any discussion of GEFT's First Amendment challenges to specific Sign Standards provisions. While GEFT has indisputably challenged the constitutionality of the Sign Standards in its complaint, its preliminary injunction motion focuses solely on its due process claim and does not request a ruling on the Sign Standards' compliance with the First Amendment. In fact, GEFT informed the district court that \"[r]esolution of these [First Amendment] constitutional issues is not necessary for resolution of GEFT's preliminary injunction.\" Westfield's motion also did not ask the district court to definitively rule on the Sign Standards' constitutionality. The district court thus did not address the merits of GEFT's First Amendment challenge to the Sign Standards, and we will not reach them here in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Fed. Crop Ins.

GEFT's Preliminary Injunction Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The district court denied GEFT's preliminary injunction motion for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   It first held that GEFT had not shown it was reasonably likely to succeed on the merits of its due process claim. The district court also concluded that a preliminary injunction in GEFT's favor was unwarranted \"based upon the timing and procedural history of GEFT's and Westfield's legal steps taken.\" More specifically, \"GEFT's actions of knowingly violating the UDO, then later seeking this [c]ourt's intervention, and then again undertaking work in violation of the UDO, undermines the propriety of equitable relief before the case can be fully adjudicated.\" We consider each of these rationales in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    1. GEFT's Due Process Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause provides that \"[n]o State shall ... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" U.S. Const. amend.

To determine whether such a violation occurred, we first ask whether GEFT has been deprived of a protected liberty or property interest; and second, we ask whether that deprivation occurred without due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Black Earth Meat Mkt., LLC v.

GEFT's leasehold in the Esler Property is a protected interest that can support a procedural due process claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    River Park, Inc. v. City of Highland Park\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504627\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/164/#p166\">\n    23 F.3d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 166 (7th Cir. 1994).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The next part of this inquiry asks whether GEFT has been deprived of this property right without due process of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hudson v. City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9234996\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/554/#p559\">\n    374 F.3d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 559 (7th Cir. 2004). GEFT asserts two different theories of how it suffered a deprivation because of Westfield's actions. First, GEFT claims that the city deprived it of its property right in its lease by enforcing an \"invalid\" stop work notice against it without notice or a hearing. According to GEFT, the UDO requires that certain information be included in a \"Stop Work Order\" from Westfield-a description of the violation and the appeals process,\n   the applicable enforcement provisions of the UDO including penalties that may be assessed, and a date for compliance. UDO art. 11.5(A). But the November 7 Stop Work Notice did not contain all this information, nor did Westfield's November 22 letter. Thus, GEFT says, the Stop Work Notice was not enforceable and provided no basis to order GEFT to stop putting up its Billboard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This theory cannot support a procedural due process claim. As an initial matter, GEFT's own evidence submitted in support of its motion demonstrates that it stopped constructing the Billboard only because of Zaiger's arrest threats, not because of notices it received from Westfield. Lee states in his affidavit that \"GEFT contractors stopped working because of the threat of incarceration, not because of a stop work order\" and that \"[b]ut for the threats of arrest noted above, the work on the ... Billboard that was planned for December 16, 2017 ... would have been completed.\" Kisiel agreed with Lee's recitation of the facts of what happened on December 16. And both Brock and Finn, the two contractors onsite that day, said in affidavits that \"[w]ere it not for the threats of arrest ... we would have been able to complete the work that was planned for December 16, 2017 to erect the sign head for the ... Billboard.\" The Stop Work Notices therefore could not have deprived GEFT of its property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Even if the Stop Work Notices themselves halted further work on the Billboard, and assuming this work stoppage \"deprived\" GEFT of its leasehold interest, GEFT's only complaint about these notices is that they did not comply with the UDO's requirements. But there is no constitutional procedural due process right to state-mandated procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Charleston v.

According to GEFT, it could not be at fault for refusing to apply for or obtain a permit before it started construction on the Billboard. GEFT argues that because the Sign Standards are, in its view, unconstitutional, it is as if they never existed, and GEFT \"cannot have unclean hands for not complying with a non-existent law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   GEFT's argument is premised on a misunderstanding about who has the authority to declare a law void; GEFT itself does not have that power. After a court holds that a statute or ordinance is unconstitutional, that legislation is void.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    GEFT Outdoor LLC v. Consol. City of Indianapolis &amp; County of Marion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12139790\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/187/1002/#p1012\">\n    187 F.Supp.3d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1012 (S.D. Ind. 2016) (noting that because the court had ruled the ordinance at issue was unconstitutional,\n   the plaintiff could derive no rights from it). But the court's ruling that the law is invalid is the crucial trigger for voiding it. Parties who believe that a statute or ordinance is unconstitutional must wait for that to happen before treating the challenged law as nonexistent. They do not have free rein to invoke a court's jurisdiction over a challenge to an ordinance, but to then act like the law does not exist before the court reaches the merits of its challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The constitutionality of the Permit Exceptions and the Off-Premises Ban in the Sign Standards is one of the main issues raised in GEFT's complaint against Westfield. We express no opinion on the merits of these First Amendment claims; it may be that GEFT eventually prevails and the district court will declare these portions of the Sign Standards unconstitutional and void. The court might also conclude that these portions are not severable from the rest of the Sign Standards, as GEFT argues, and that entire chapter of the UDO must be declared void. But the district court has not considered or accepted any of these arguments yet, so various outcomes of GEFT's challenge are still possible. The Sign Standards are still in force until that happens. This is the basic principle the district court applied in its decision to assess the equity of GEFT's actions in the context of this lawsuit-until a court declares that the Sign Standards are unconstitutional, GEFT must presume that this chapter of the UDO is a valid enactment of the city's legislature that applies to its conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   GEFT argues this is the wrong way to approach its own challenge, though. It says that the Sign Standards are content based, and courts must presume that a content-based law is unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed v. Town of Gilbert\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2226\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2226,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2226\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). But GEFT confuses the issue: the presumption from\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   applies when a court actually reviews a law for its compliance with the First Amendment. That is not what either party asked the court to do in the context of these injunction motions. Instead, GEFT sought an injunction because of alleged due process violations, and Westfield sought one to maintain the status quo pending the ultimate resolution of the case. Neither GEFT nor Westfield asked the district court to rule on the Sign Standards' constitutionality, so\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   's presumption did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The district court, faced with a situation where GEFT had invoked the court's power over its dispute with Westfield, but then unilaterally acted in violation of a still-valid ordinance, did not abuse its discretion in determining that these actions supported denying GEFT's motion for equitable relief. Once GEFT filed its lawsuit seeking a judicial determination on the Sign Standards' validity, it needed to let that process unfold before treating them as nonexistent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Westfield's Motion for a Restraining Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   After denying GEFT its requested injunctive relief, the district court stated that \"[i]n light of\" its ruling on that motion, it would grant Westfield's motion for a restraining order \"to the extent that it requests an order prohibiting GEFT from continuing any work on its pole and digital sign until after the [c]ourt rules on the constitutionality of the UDO and resolves this litigation on the merits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The district court did not conduct a separate analysis on Westfield's motion, but such an analysis was unnecessary considering its denial of GEFT's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   GEFT had asked the district court for an order enjoining Westfield from taking any further actions to enforce the Sign Standards against them, via the Stop Work Notices or otherwise. The court determined that GEFT was not entitled to this relief both because it had no likelihood of success on the merits of its due process claim, and because GEFT could not ignore the Sign Standards just because it thought they were unconstitutional. Considering that ruling, Westfield's motion for an order requiring that GEFT stop work on the Billboard pending the outcome of the litigation on the merits sought no more from the district court than the logical consequence of its first decision-preventing further actions by GEFT in contravention of the Sign Standards. It was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to prevent GEFT from continuing any construction until the court ruled on whether it would have needed a sign permit under the Sign Standards to erect its Billboard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benisek v.

Westfield provided both before GEFT stopped erecting the Billboard. The November 7 Stop Work Notice informed GEFT of how the steel pole installation allegedly violated the UDO; Westfield's November 22 letter provided even more details about those violations, gave a proposed date for compliance, and warned that \"further enforcement action\" could follow if GEFT did not comply with Westfield's ordinances. And \"[a]ny decision ... in enforcement or application of [the UDO] may be appealed to the [Board of Zoning Appeals] by any person claiming to be adversely affected by such decision.\" UDO art. 3.2(B)(1). GEFT could have taken advantage of that process before or after December 16 and received the opportunity to be heard regarding Westfield's contentions that its Billboard violated the Sign Standards.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     River Park\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504627\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/164/#p166\">\n     23 F.3d at 167\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (procedural due process requirements for property owner's loss were satisfied where owner had \"ample means to contest the runaround it was receiving at the hands of\" the defendant through state law processes).

GEFT does not take issue with the procedural adequacies of any of these processes available to it to challenge Westfield's decision preventing continued work on the Billboard.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    We note that is not clear GEFT was even deprived of anything: its leasehold interest in the Esler Property is subject to state and local regulations, such as the UDO.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     River Park\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504627\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/164/#p166\">\n     23 F.3d at 167\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"State and local governments may regulate and even take property; they must\n    <em>\n     pay\n    </em>\n    for what they take but are free to use the land as they please.\").

GEFT argues there is no nexus here between its conduct and the activities it sought to enjoin because \"GEFT has not taken any action inconsistent with its request to exercise its First Amendment rights.\" But again, GEFT misconstrues the scope of its preliminary injunction motion. GEFT did not ask for First Amendment-related injunctive relief; it asked the court for an order allowing it to continue constructing the Billboard without interference from Westfield, despite its failure to comply with the still-valid Sign Standards.
