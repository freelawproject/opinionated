We affirm Wijegoonaratna's conviction, and we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hospice care is designed for patients with terminal illnesses who choose to forgo active treatment of their terminal condition and instead receive palliative care, including pain relief and family bereavement services. Hospice care may be provided in the patient's home or in a facility such as a nursing home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For eligible Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare pays around $ 200-250 per day for hospice care. To be eligible, a patient must be certified as terminally ill by two licensed physicians. \"Terminally ill\" means that the patient's prognosis is less than six months if the disease runs its normal course. The two licensed physicians are typically the hospice medical director or staff physician and the patient's attending physician. Patients are initially certified for ninety days of service. If a patient requires hospice care beyond those ninety days, the patient can be recertified for an additional period. Recertification requires just one physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   About 85% of hospice patients die in hospice care (the remaining 15% end hospice care alive). Patients receive hospice care for an average of sixty-six days, but about half receive hospice care for fewer than twenty days before dying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Priscilla Villabroza acquired California Hospice Care (\"CHC\") in 2008. Sharon Patrow, her daughter, handled business operations; Erwin Castillo, a registered nurse, handled medical matters. Dr. Violeta Atiga worked as the medical director.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Patient admission at CHC required three documents: (1) a nursing assessment, completed by a nurse during a visit; (2) a history and physical, completed by a physician during a visit; and (3) a patient intake form, completed by CHC office staff. At trial, the parties disputed the order in which these documents were completed. Once a patient's file was complete, the patient's attending physician and Dr. Atiga would certify that the patient was terminally ill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to trial testimony, CHC's practice was to fraudulently bill Medicare and Medi-Cal for hospice care given to patients who had been falsely certified as terminally ill. CHC illegally paid recruiters to refer patients to CHC. CHC also falsified records and even paid some patients to be on hospice. Although CHC certified its patients as terminally ill, the majority of CHC patients did not die within six months of admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Wijegoonaratna filled several roles at CHC from November 2009 to May 2013. For most CHC patients, Wijegoonaratna was the attending physician-the physician who completed the \"history and physical,\" certified the patient as hospice-eligible (along with Dr. Atiga), and remained responsible for the patient's care. Wijegoonaratna\n   also recruited around half of CHC's patients, participated in team meetings, and served as its associate medical director. He continued in these roles even after he was indicted and placed on pretrial release in a different criminal case. All told, CHC paid Wijegoonaratna over $ 325,000 while he worked with CHC, not including any cash payments he received, e.g., for illegal kickbacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After investigators discovered CHC's fraud, Wijegoonaratna was charged with nine counts of healthcare fraud in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201347\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He was charged along with Villabroza, Patrow, a nurse, a patient recruiter, and another doctor (Boyao Huang). Castillo was charged separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Wijegoonaratna and Huang went to trial. Wijegoonaratna was tried on seven counts, each one representing a patient Wijegoonaratna had fraudulently certified as terminally ill and for whose care CHC had billed Medicare or Medi-Cal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The government presented the testimony of family members, doctors, a hospice expert, and the patients to show that none of the seven patients was in fact terminally ill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defense argued that Wijegoonaratna's diagnoses merely confirmed earlier assessments made by the nurses. The defense attempted to show that Wijegoonaratna's diagnoses were legitimate-that is, that the patients were actually eligible for hospice care-because another medical professional made the same diagnoses. At a minimum, the defense hoped that the jury would conclude that Wijegoonaratna was lazy, but not criminal: that he did not perform his own review, and instead negligently, but without intent to defraud, copied the nurse's earlier assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To support that theory, during closing argument the defense highlighted one piece of evidence: an intake form in a patient's file that listed a terminal illness. Defense counsel referred to the document as the patient's nursing assessment (which was to be completed by a nurse during a visit), but the document that defense counsel described was in fact the intake form (completed by CHC office staff). By contrast, the nursing assessment contained a non-terminal diagnosis; it was the intake form that contained the terminal illness. Wijegoonaratna's history and physical contained the same diagnosis as the intake form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ignoring the differences between the two documents and who was to prepare them, defense counsel argued that Wijegoonaratna had merely copied the intake form diagnosis into his history and physical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In its rebuttal, the government emphasized Wijegoonaratna's independent duty to assess patients medically and his deep involvement in CHC. The government also addressed the specific document highlighted by the defense. First, the government pointed out that the nursing assessment in the patient's file contained a non-terminal diagnosis. Second, the government suggested that the office staff who filled out the intake form had copied Wijegoonaratna's diagnosis, and not the other way around.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At that point, defense counsel objected that there was \"no such evidence\" that the office staff copied Wijegoonaratna's diagnosis. The court overruled the objection. The government continued its rebuttal, emphasizing that \"the intake form is not the nurse's assessment.\" At the end of closing arguments, Wijegoonaratna moved for a mistrial based on those statements, but the court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The jury convicted Wijegoonaratna on all seven counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The presentence report calculated two guideline ranges: one for the six counts (counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8) committed while the 2010 Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual was in effect, and one for the remaining count (count 9), which was committed after the 2010 Guidelines Manual was revised to Wijegoonaratna's detriment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the 2010 Guidelines Manual, Wijegoonaratna's offense level was 29 and the guideline range was 87-108 months. In 2011, the Sentencing Commission added a two-level specific offense characteristic for a loss greater than $ 1 million to a government healthcare program. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(7) (2016). Because of those additional two levels, for count 9, Wijegoonaratna's offense level was 31 and the guideline range was 108-135 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under both versions of the Guidelines Manual, an 18-level loss enhancement applied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(J) &amp; cmt. 3(A) (2010); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(J) &amp; cmt. 3(F)(viii) (2016). The loss enhancement was based on the amount CHC billed (and Medicare paid) for Wijegoonaratna's patients, excluding those patients who died while receiving CHC hospice care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   CHC billed $ 4,014,989, and Medicare paid $ 3,384,202, for Wijegoonaratna's patients who were alive when they were discharged from hospice care. Under both versions of the Guidelines Manual, Wijegoonaratna was also subject to a three-level increase for committing an offense while on pretrial release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.3 (2010) ; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.3 (2016). In his sentencing memorandum, Wijegoonaratna challenged the loss amount calculation as lacking evidentiary and legal support. He also argued that his age and deteriorating health justified a downward variance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, Wijegoonaratna did not raise any new objections. Addressing Wijegoonaratna's request for a shorter sentence based on his health condition, the court noted that Wijegoonaratna \"made the decision for 130 persons that their underlying health conditions should not be treated, that they should go into hospice and waive and give up their right to treatment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The district court overruled Wijegoonaratna's objection to the loss amount calculation. The court then stated that Wijegoonaratna's total offense level is 31 and guideline range is 108-135 months. The court then imposed a 108-month prison sentence: 78 months on the first six counts and 30 months on the remaining count, to be served concurrently, with an additional 30 months based on the sentencing enhancement, to be served consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Wijegoonaratna challenges his conviction on the ground that the prosecutor committed misconduct when he represented that the nurses completing the intake form copied Wijegoonaratna's assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We usually review for abuse of discretion a district court's overruling of an objection to prosecutorial misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Tucker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206712\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/1110/#p1120\">\n    641 F.3d 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1120 (9th Cir. 2011) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, Wijegoonaratna points out that\n   in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Perlaza\n   </em>\n   we stated that we \"review whether closing argument constitutes misconduct\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31255\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/1149/\">\n    439 F.3d 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1169 n.22 (9th Cir. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Perlaza\n   </em>\n   appears to have mistaken the standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Perlaza\n   </em>\n   cites\n   <em>\n    United States v. Santiago\n   </em>\n   , where we reviewed \"the court's overruling of the objection\" to the prosecutor's comments at trial \"for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412674\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/46/885/#p892\">\n    46 F.3d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 892 (9th Cir. 1995). But to the extent that\n   <em>\n    Perlaza\n   </em>\n   created an intracircuit conflict, here \"[w]e are not prompted to call for our court to revisit the broader issue en banc\" because \"in the end\" applying either standard of review \"would not alter [the] outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266952\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/1089/#p1107\">\n    869 F.3d 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1107 (9th Cir. 2017) (Clifton, J., concurring). Because we reach the same results under review for abuse of discretion and de novo review, we need not and decline to weigh in on the intra circuit conflict that appellant asserts exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In reviewing alleged prosecutorial misconduct, we \"focus[ ] on its asserted impropriety and substantial prejudicial effect.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Weatherspoon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8956467\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/410/1142/#p1145\">\n    410 F.3d 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1145 (9th Cir. 2005). \"We must ... determine at the outset whether the prosecutor made improper statements. ...\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8956467\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/410/1142/#p1145\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"During closing argument, a prosecutor may do no more than comment on facts in evidence and make reasonable inferences based on the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hermanek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9436582\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/289/1076/#p1101\">\n    289 F.3d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1101 (9th Cir. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Here, we conclude that the prosecutor's statement-that the office staff completing the intake form copied Wijegoonaratna's history and physical-was not improper. Although no witness directly testified to that fact, the proposition is reasonably inferred from the evidence. Trial testimony established that at CHC the intake forms were not sent to the doctors performing the history and physical; thus, it is a reasonable inference that the staff copied Wijegoonaratna's diagnosis, rather than the other way around. Also, the nursing assessment in the patient's file contained a different, non-terminal diagnosis, so Wijegoonaratna could not have copied his terminal diagnosis from that document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Wijegoonaratna also contends that even if the prosecutor's statement was a fair inference as to one patient, it was inappropriate as a more sweeping statement of CHC's usual practice. Read in context, however, the prosecutor's statement referred only to the specific documents that the defense had highlighted in its closing. The district court did not err in overruling Wijegoonaratna's objection to the prosecutor's statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Wijegoonaratna challenges his sentence on several grounds. First, he argues that the district court did not make Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32's required factual findings on the disputed loss calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Generally, we review de novo the sentencing court's compliance with Rule 32.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Burkholder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3504476\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/590/1071/#p1076\">\n    590 F.3d 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1076 (9th Cir. 2010). But where a defendant does not object at sentencing to a district court's compliance with the Rule, we review for plain error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Wijegoonaratna argues that we should review de novo under the \"pure questions of law\" exception to plain error review, but that exception does not apply to review of mixed questions of law and fact such as\n   this one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Wijegoonaratna objected to the presentence report's assumption that the patients who lived longer than six months or were alive at discharge were fraudulently certified. He also argued that it was not reasonably foreseeable that CHC would continue to bill for patients after Wijegoonaratna's initial ninety-day certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Nonetheless, we conclude that the district court satisfied Rule 32's requirements. The district court described Wijegoonaratna's objection on the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   There is a specific objection to the 18-level increase or enhancement for amount of loss. The claim that the government has failed to prove the loss by clear and convincing evidence.

Wijegoonaratna contends that the government should not have assumed that every patient alive at discharge had been fraudulently certified as hospice eligible. After all, about 15% of patients properly\n   admitted to hospice care are alive at discharge. But at trial, the district court heard clear and convincing evidence to support the proposition that all of the patients that Wijegoonaratna certified were fraudulently certified. That some of those patients happened to die within six months-by coincidence or because they stopped receiving essential care for their non-terminal illnesses-does not undermine that evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Wijegoonaratna also argues that he should not be held responsible for billing that occurred after the initial 90-day hospice certification. Wijegoonaratna contends that he did not participate in the recertifications. But even if that is true, the evidence at trial strongly suggested that he was well aware that CHC continued to bill for those patients. Indeed, Wijegoonaratna was deeply involved with CHC: he participated in at least some recertifications, served as attending physician for many patients, and attended team meetings as an associate medical director at CHC. Sufficient evidence supports the district court's finding that Wijegoonaratna intended the loss amounts underlying his sentencing enhancements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    D\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Based on the language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203147\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Wijegoonaratna also contends that the sentencing enhancement for committing a crime while on supervised release was improper.

That is the case here. The question presented is purely legal: Does applying the revised Guidelines Manual to all of Wijegoonaratna's counts violate the ex post facto clause? And we have previously held that \"the government is not prejudiced by our requirement that the district court correctly calculate the Guidelines sentencing range before it imposes a sentence, even though [the defendant] did not raise the issue below.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We consider Wijegoonaratna's ex-post-facto-clause challenge de novo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   At the outset, we reject the government's argument that the district court in fact sentenced Wijegoonaratna separately under the 2010 Guidelines Manual and the 2016 Guidelines Manual. The parties did not mention the separate ranges in their sentencing memoranda or at sentencing. The district court noted only one guidelines range, \"108 to 135 months,\" which is the range provided by the 2016 Guidelines Manual. Finally, the district court sentenced Wijegoonaratna to 78 months on counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, plus an additional 30 months on count 9, for a total of 108 months. In doing so, the court commented that the sentence was at \"the low end of the Guideline range.\" That statement is accurate only if the district court was relying on the 2016 Guidelines Manual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Because we conclude from this record that the district court sentenced Wijegoonaratna based on the 2016 Guidelines Manual, we next consider whether doing so violated the ex post facto clause. Using a Guidelines Manual revised after an offense occurred to calculate a Guidelines range for that offense violates the ex post facto clause if the revision leads to a higher punishment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For this reason, a defendant must generally be sentenced under the Guidelines Manual that was in effect when the offense occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Where different counts involve different conduct occurring under different Guidelines Manuals, \"different Guidelines ranges for those counts are appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Anekwu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3526985\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/967/#p989\">\n    695 F.3d 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 989-90 (9th Cir. 2012). But where the conduct is a \"continuing offense\" spanning a period before and after a Guidelines Manual revision, the later Guidelines Manual applies without violating the ex post facto clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The crux of the issue, then, is whether Wijegoonaratna was charged with a continuing offense. If so, application of the 2016 Guidelines Manual to all counts would not violate the ex post facto clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We have previously held that the government may decide to charge health care fraud schemes as a single count (one continuing offense) or as multiple counts (individual executions of a scheme).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Holden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358643\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/1227/#p1231\">\n    806 F.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1231-32 (9th Cir. 2015) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That decision has its natural consequences. For example, it affects whether a defendant may be charged for conduct that falls outside the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, where a health care fraud scheme is charged in a single count as a continuing offense, we have held that it may encompass acts that fall outside the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5751302\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/551/930/#p937\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But where the government charges each fraudulent act as a separate count, counts concerning conduct outside the statute of limitations must be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1230, 1231-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Here, too, the government's decision to charge Wijegoonaratna with multiple counts has consequences. The government could have charged Wijegoonaratna's offense as a continuing offense, but it chose not to do so. For that reason, the ex post facto rule that applies to continuing offenses-just like the statute of limitations rule for continuing offenses-does not apply here, where the health care fraud was charged as multiple counts. Instead, the district court was required to calculate and apply the guideline ranges from the Guidelines Manual in effect at the time of each count. It did not.
