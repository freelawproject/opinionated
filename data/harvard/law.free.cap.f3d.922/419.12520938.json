In 1987, a jury found Washington guilty of six crimes involving the robbery and murder of Sterleen Hill in her Arizona home. The court sentenced Washington to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   In his habeas corpus petition, Washington challenges his conviction and sentence on the first-degree murder charge. He asserts that he is entitled to habeas relief on several grounds, the majority of which are addressed in a separate memorandum disposition filed concurrently with this opinion. This opinion solely addresses Washington's certified claim for ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Washington contends that his counsel did not investigate and present mitigating evidence at the penalty phase, including evidence of diffuse brain damage, childhood abuse, and substance abuse. The Arizona court previously considered and rejected this claim on post-conviction review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Because review under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.

Instead, we apply the familiar standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , and assess the state court record to determine whether Washington's counsel was constitutionally deficient and whether the deficient performance resulted in prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bobby v. Van Hook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638939\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/4/#p7\">\n    558 U.S. 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638939\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/4/#p7\">\n    130 S.Ct. 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638939\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/4/#p7\">\n    175 L.Ed.2d 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (applying the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   analysis in a pre-AEDPA case). Because Washington's counsel did not properly investigate Washington's background, the trial court at the penalty phase was not presented with substantial mitigation evidence regarding Washington's education and incarceration, his diffuse brain damage, and his history of substance abuse. This raises a reasonable probability that, had the court been presented with the mitigation evidence in the first instance, the outcome would have been different. The sentencing judge might have decided that Washington should be spared death and be imprisoned for life.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reverse the district court's denial of habeas relief and remand with instructions to grant habeas relief against the death penalty, unless within a reasonable time the state retries the penalty phase or decides to modify the sentence to life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At around 11:45 p.m. on the night of June 8, 1987, two men forced their way into Ralph and Sterleen Hill's Yuma, Arizona\n   home in what turned out to be a disastrously violent home invasion. The men forced the Hills to lie face down on the floor of the master bedroom and bound their hands behind their backs. One of the men intermittently \"screwed\" a pistol in Ralph's ear while both men yelled at the couple demanding that the Hills give them drugs or money. Ralph glimpsed one of the assailants as he ransacked the drawers and closets in the room. The Hills were discovered lying face down in their bedroom. Both had been shot in the back of the head. Ralph survived the horrendous shot to his head, but was seriously injured. Sterleen did not survive the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Police arrested Fred Robinson shortly after the incident. Robinson was the common law husband of Susan Hill, Ralph Hill's daughter from a prior marriage. Police also arrested Jimmy Mathers and Theodore Washington in connection with the crimes. The state charged the three men with (1) first degree murder for the death of Sterleen Hill, (2) attempted first degree murder, (3) aggravated assault causing serious physical injury, (4) aggravated assault using a deadly weapon, (5) burglary in the first degree, and (6) armed robbery. The three men were tried together, and the jury convicted on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The penalty phase of the trial commenced on January 8, 1988. In this appeal, we are concerned with the penalty phase of Washington's trial and the death penalty sentence he received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Washington's trial counsel, Robert Clarke, called three witnesses to testify on Washington's behalf: Washington's friend, Steve Thomas; Washington's mother, Willa Mae Skinner; and Washington's half-brother, John Mondy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Steve Thomas testified that he knew Washington for two years. He testified that Washington was easily influenced but not violent. He also testified that Washington was a dedicated father. When asked if Washington had a drug problem, Thomas testified that he had not noticed one. Willa Mae Skinner testified that Washington was a good child and that he dropped out of school when he was in high school. She also testified that Washington was a good father, and that he was gentle and \"liked to party.\" Finally, John Mondy reiterated that Washington was affable but easily led. He also confirmed that Washington had trouble in school as a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During closing argument, Clarke focused primarily on attacking the sufficiency of the court's findings under\n   <em>\n    Enmund v. Florida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636586\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/782/\">\n    458 U.S. 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636586\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/782/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636586\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/782/\">\n    73 L.Ed.2d 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982), and\n   <em>\n    Tison v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211931\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/137/\">\n    481 U.S. 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211931\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/137/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211931\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/137/\">\n    95 L.Ed.2d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). Regarding mitigation, Clarke did not entirely ignore all mitigation, but rather urged the court to consider Washington's age, his relatively minor criminal record, his good relationship with his son, and his general demeanor as a caring individual. This appeal is concerned primarily with the mitigation evidence and argument that Clarke did not present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court found that the state had established two aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that the murder was committed in an especially cruel, heinous, or depraved manner, and (2) that the murder was committed for, or motivated by, pecuniary gain. With respect to mitigation, the court found that Washington's age was not a mitigating factor and that the remaining mitigating factors did not outweigh the aggravating factors. The court sentenced all three defendants to death on the first-degree murder charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Washington, Robinson, and Mathers each appealed their convictions and sentences\n   to the Arizona Supreme Court. The state high court affirmed Washington and Robinson's convictions and sentences,\n   <em>\n    State v. Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1542648\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/165/51/\">\n    165 Ariz. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1542648\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/165/51/\">\n    796 P.2d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 865 (Ariz. 1990), but found insufficient evidence to convict James Mathers and vacated his conviction,\n   <em>\n    State v. Mathers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1542682\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/165/64/\">\n    165 Ariz. 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1542682\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/165/64/\">\n    796 P.2d 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ariz. 1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the direct appeal process, Washington and Robinson challenged their convictions and sentences on post-conviction review (\"PCR\"). The court held a joint PCR hearing on September 8, 1993. The Honorable Stewart Bradshaw, the same judge who presided over the trial, also presided over the post-conviction review proceeding. Washington, through his appellate counsel, argued that Clarke was ineffective at the penalty phase due to his failure to present mitigating evidence. Specifically, Washington argued that Clarke erred by failing to conduct a more thorough review of his school, medical, and incarceration records. He also argued that Clarke should have obtained a psychological evaluation and presented the results to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The bulk of the new evidence presented at the PCR hearing was elicited through the testimony of Dr. Roy, the defense counsel's retained psychologist. Dr. Roy evaluated Washington in 1992. He conducted clinical interviews and several psychological tests. Dr. Roy's interviews with Washington revealed that he suffered abuse as a child in the form of daily whippings with straps and belts and that adults in the home used alcohol as a means to sedate him as a child. His review of Washington's school and Department of Corrections (\"DOC\") records revealed that he was placed in classes for the \"educable mentally retarded\" when he was five years old and that he had been marked as low-IQ while incarcerated. However, Dr. Roy testified that these records conflicted with his own clinical findings because Washington tested at a low-average IQ of 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dr. Roy's interviews with Washington also revealed that Washington had substance abuse problems relating to alcohol and cocaine use. Washington told Dr. Roy that he began drinking recreationally at age eight and was a functional alcoholic by age fourteen. He also told Dr. Roy that he was heavily intoxicated on the night of the murder. Washington also said that he was a heavy cocaine user and that he consumed about $ 175 in cocaine per day at the time of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, Dr. Roy testified that he believed that Washington suffered from diffuse brain damage resulting from early and prolonged drug and alcohol use and numerous traumatic head injuries. Dr. Roy testified that diffuse brain damage can result in disinhibition and poor social judgment as well as poor impulse control and an inability to appreciate the long-term consequences of one's actions. Dr. Roy testified that, in his opinion, Washington's cocaine addiction and his impaired impulse control likely contributed to his ability to be manipulated by others into making poor decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The state called Dr. Eva McCullars, a psychiatrist who also evaluated Washington. Dr. McCullars reviewed Dr. Roy's report and conducted clinical interviews with Washington in June 1993. Dr. McCullars testified that she did not review Washington's DOC records, school records, or adult incarceration records. Dr. McCullars agreed that Washington suffered from diffuse brain damage, but concluded that Washington also suffered from antisocial personality disorder. On direct examination, the state asked Dr. McCullars whether diffuse brain damage could cause hyperkenesis (hyperactive behavior or attention deficit disorder ). Dr. McCullars explained that \"[hyperkenesis] is one example\n   of diffuse brain damage.\" She went on to explain that several prominent individuals including Walt Disney and Thomas Edison exhibited hyperkinetic behavior as children. When questioned on cross examination, Dr. McCullars acknowledged that Washington came from a \"significantly dysfunctional family.\" She also admitted that several of the markers for antisocial personality disorder, such as early truancy and an inability to maintain employment, were more frequently associated with lower socio-economic status black adolescents when compared to the general population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Robert Clarke, Washington's trial counsel, also testified at the PCR hearing. Clarke testified that he did not request Washington's education or corrections records because he believed his interviews with Washington, Skinner, Mondy and Bryant were sufficient. Clarke testified that he had \"very extensive discussions\" with Washington about what his life was like and any possible substance abuse issues. He also testified that he had \"relatively extensive\" discussions with Washington's mother, half-brother, and girlfriend. Clarke testified that, based on these interviews, \"there wasn't anything that clued me in that there was a special problem that would suggest I should obtain those types of records.\" With respect to Washington's drug use, Clarke testified that Washington never told him that he was addicted to cocaine or that he was using cocaine on the night of the murder. When questioned on the matter, Clarke acknowledged that Bryant had told Clarke that Washington had a \"cocaine problem,\" but that he did not investigate further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In a written order, Judge Bradshaw held that Washington was not entitled to relief for ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase. Judge Bradshaw credited Dr. McCullars's findings that Washington had antisocial personality disorder and was poorly adjusted to living in society. However, Judge Bradshaw concluded that \"there is nothing ... which lessened his ability to differentiate right from wrong or conform his actions with the law.\" Judge Bradshaw also explained that he had been aware at the time of sentencing that Washington had been doing well while incarcerated. Judge Bradshaw further reasoned that any drug and alcohol dependency \"taken separately or with any other mitigating circumstance or circumstances would [not] have mitigated against the sentence [Washington] has received.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On April 25, 1995, the Arizona Supreme Court summarily denied Washington's petition for review of the PCR court's decision. Washington then commenced his habeas action in the federal district court, culminating in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In his amended federal habeas corpus petition, Washington raised 17 claims. The district court determined that claims 1, 2, 3 (in part), 6, 7, 8 (in part), 9, 11 (in part), 12, 14 (in part), 16, and 17 were procedurally barred. On April 22, 2005, the district court rejected the remaining claims on their merits and dismissed the petition. Washington filed a motion to alter the judgment on May 5, 2005, which the district court denied on June 8, 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On July 11, 2005, Washington filed an untimely notice of appeal from the district court's denial of habeas relief. A three-judge panel of this court held that it lacked jurisdiction and affirmed the district court's denial of Rule 60(b) relief.\n   <em>\n    Washington v. Ryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4234092\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/1041/\">\n    789 F.3d 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2015).

In a 6-5 decision, the en banc panel\n   held that Washington was entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(1) and (6) from his untimely notice of appeal and ordered the district court to \"vacate and reenter its judgment denying Washington's petition for writ of habeas corpus,\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   , June 9, 2005,\" to render the notice of appeal timely.\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

We conclude that an objectively reasonable lawyer would have done so. If Clarke had reviewed Washington's education and incarceration records, he would have seen that Washington's elementary school had placed Washington in classes for the educable mentally retarded and that the DOC had indicated that Washington had a low IQ. Although the Supreme Court had not yet recognized that the Eighth Amendment bars the execution of mentally retarded individuals at the time of Washington's penalty trial,\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/\">\n    536 U.S. at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court had made clear that evidence of mental retardation was\n   important mitigation evidence that should be presented at the penalty phase,\n   <em>\n    Penry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214810\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/302/#p318\">\n    492 U.S. at 322-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214810\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/302/#p318\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that evidence of a defendant's mental retardation may render him less culpable for his crime).

As discussed below, these errors prevented Washington from presenting substantial mitigation evidence at the penalty phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Washington also argues that Clarke erred by not investigating and presenting evidence of his childhood abuse. Through his conversations with Dr. Roy, Washington revealed that he suffered physical abuse as a child in the form of daily whippings and beatings. Roy was also told that Washington was given alcohol as a child to control his behavior. None of this information later given to Dr. Roy had come to Clarke's attention during the trial. By contrast, both psychological experts who testified at the PCR hearing agreed that Washington's childhood was significantly dysfunctional. Unlike other categories of information that are easily verified through documentary evidence, Clarke had to rely entirely on the word of Washington and his family members in determining whether Washington suffered childhood abuse. Because neither Washington nor his family members had then indicated that Washington suffered abuse as a child, Clarke did not err by not further investigating Washington's childhood abuse, to the extent that he could have, or by not presenting the information he did not have regarding abuse at the sentencing hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful, counsel's failure to pursue those investigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, Washington alleges that Clarke erred by not investigating and presenting evidence of his substance abuse. Again, Clarke did not err by failing to investigate Washington's substance abuse, because Clarke reasonably relied on his conversations with Washington and his friends and family, wherein substance abuse was not indicated. Washington had told Clarke that he was heavily intoxicated on the night of the crimes, but he denied that he had any ongoing problems with drugs or with alcohol. Similarly, Washington's mother described him as someone who \"liked to party,\" but also did not say that Washington had problems with addiction. Perhaps the single clue Clarke had that might have raised his suspicions about substance abuse was the statement of Washington's girlfriend that Washington had a \"cocaine problem.\" However, when set against Washington's own statements and those of his family members, Clarke's decision not to further investigate Washington's drug abuse was not objectively unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In summary, Clarke performed ineffectively by not reviewing Washington's education and incarceration records.

Washington faces a significant obstacle in doing so, because we need not guess at whether the outcome would have been different if that evidence had been available to the court at sentencing. The sentencing judge, Judge Bradshaw, considered that evidence during the PCR proceeding and concluded in a written order that those materials would not have made a difference. Judge Bradshaw's unequivocal ruling might ordinarily persuade us that Washington cannot show prejudice. The materials that Clarke missed, though they undoubtedly had mitigating value, were not so overwhelming that they influenced Judge Bradshaw's no-prejudice finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   However, the case of Washington's co-defendant, Fred Robinson, casts a long shadow on our prejudice analysis here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

That case is important here because Washington and Robinson were tried and sentenced together, and their convictions and sentences were affirmed in state court following\n   joint PCR proceedings, in nearly identical written orders. Like Washington, Robinson alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel based on his trial counsel's failure to present mitigation evidence at the penalty phase.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216699\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/1086/#p1108\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216699\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/1086/#p1108\">\n    at 1108-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Our majority opinion discusses and applies the\n    <em>\n     Strickland\n    </em>\n    standard. Second, the dissent relies on Judge Bradshaw's conclusion that the new evidence would not have made a difference. But this ignores Supreme Court precedent that made clear the Arizona sentencing judge could not have constitutionally required a causal nexus between the mitigation evidence and the crimes. As explained\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 431-32, that erroneous premise almost certainly affected Judge Bradshaw's assessment.

First, in second-guessing the performance of Theodore Washington's trial counsel, the majority uses a standard for gross incompetence that doesn't square with precedent. A post-conviction petition can always point to something that trial counsel should have done differently. Here, more than 30 years after Washington was sentenced to death, the majority grants Washington relief because his trial counsel failed to investigate Washington's education and incarceration records. But trial counsel's performance was reasonable because his extensive discussions with Washington and Washington's family and friends gave him no reason to suspect that those records contained helpful information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, the majority doesn't hold Washington to his heavy burden of showing prejudice. Instead, the majority erroneously presumes prejudice. The evidence that the majority concludes Washington's trial counsel should have unearthed would not have fundamentally altered the narrative counsel competently (even if not perfectly) presented at sentencing. Indeed, we need not guess whether the new evidence would have made a difference at sentencing because the same judge who sentenced Washington to death (Judge Bradshaw) later presided over the post-conviction review proceedings. Judge Bradshaw unequivocally concluded the new evidence would not have made a difference. His \"unique knowledge of the trial proceedings\"-including his front-row seat to the\n   presentation of evidence showing brutality of the execution-style murder of Sterleen Hill-\"render[ed] him 'ideally situated' \" to evaluate Washington's claim at post-conviction review.\n   <em>\n    Murray v.

As this case wound its way through the courts, what has been lost is the cruelty and senselessness of the defendants' acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The victims, Sterleen and Ralph Hill, were bound, and forced to lie face down on their bedroom floor in preparation to be shot, execution-style, with a shotgun. Sterleen was forced to listen helplessly as her husband was shot first and then wait as the shotgun was reloaded, knowing that she would be next. Had the Hills' teenage son, LeSean, not run off, it is evident that he would have suffered the same fate. (Ralph testified he heard a voice in the background say, \"We better get the kid.\").

I agree with the majority's conclusion that much of the alleged deficiencies of counsel do not amount to gross incompetence. The majority is wrong, however, in concluding that Washington's trial counsel, Robert Clarke, provided constitutionally deficient performance by failing to obtain and review Washington's education and incarceration records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   First, the record does not support the majority's implicit suggestion that the education records themselves contain meaningful mitigation evidence. The majority states that the sentencing court did not hear evidence concerning Washington's \"possible mental retardation.\" Maj. Op. at 431. The only conceivable evidence for such a possibility is a notation in a 1965 education record (from when Washington was five years old) of the need for placement in special classes for the \"educable mentally retarded.\" But that single, decades-old notation is inconsequential when compared with more than ten additional years of schooling in the general population. And any suggestion that the school records showed a low IQ is contradicted by later IQ testing by Washington's own expert, Dr. Roy. Washington has never even suggested the possibility of mental retardation. In short, the district court was correct in observing that Washington \"presented no evidence that either his school records or his California incarceration records would have revealed potential mitigation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Second, even assuming it were proper to conclude so reflexively that the failure to\n   obtain the education records was categorically incompetent, that conclusion alone wouldn't justify the majority's finding of incompetence. Instead, the majority's holding necessarily requires a second layer of attorney deficiency. To the majority, if Clarke had reviewed Washington's education records, he would have seen the 1965 notation about the need for placement in special classes. Upon seeing that notation, the majority reasons, all but the grossly incompetent lawyer would obtain a psychological evaluation-even absent any other indications from Washington's life since kindergarten of subnormal mental capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The majority is too quick to find gross incompetence. If Clarke had obtained the education records and seen the single notation from over twenty years earlier indicating a need for placement in special education classes, that notation would have been considered in context with everything else Clarke learned about Washington's background. Clarke's investigation included \"extensive discussions\" with Washington and Washington's family and friends. Clarke asked Washington and his family members about whether Washington \"had any propensity to violence,\" \"about his drug use,\" \"about his alcohol intake,\" \"about whether or not he was abused, growing up,\" about \"what discipline was like,\" and \"things of that nature.\" For example, from his interviews, Clarke knew that Washington went to school in the general population and that he struggled in high school, dropping out in tenth or eleventh grade.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the post-conviction review hearing, Clarke testified that, in all the interviews with Washington and his family, nothing triggered any red flags signaling that further investigation would have been fruitful. Clarke stated that he considered that Washington's family members would make better witnesses than a psychologist who might examine Washington for a relatively brief period. The majority's conclusion that only the grossly incompetent lawyer would not have obtained a psychological evaluation under these circumstances cannot be squared with\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's deferential standard for determining the competence of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yarborough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896672\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/1/#p8\">\n    540 U.S. at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896672\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/1/#p8\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Sixth Amendment guarantees reasonable competence, not perfect advocacy judged with the benefit of hindsight.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Under the deferential standard required by\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, Clarke's investigation was thorough and his performance was reasonable.

Because a sentencing judge (or jury) has the power of leniency in\n    <em>\n     every\n    </em>\n    capital case, it's always possible that, as the majority states, \"[t]he sentencing judge might have decided that [the defendant] should be spared death and imprisoned for life.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 423. That is true even if the hypothetical second trial were a redo of the first without any new evidence. Of course, in engaging in the\n    <em>\n     Strickland\n    </em>\n    prejudice analysis, we have to control for that. In other words, because we are rejecting Washington's other challenges to his sentence (i.e., he was properly convicted and sentenced to death), we must presume that he would have received the same sentence upon the same evidence. That is easier said than done; but we must do so to analyze properly whether Washington has met his burden of showing prejudice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Counsel presented testimony from Williams' mother and two neighbors who briefly described Williams as a \"nice boy\" and non-violent.\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/\">\n     529 U.S. at 369\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/\">\n     120 S.Ct. 1495\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Had Judge Bradshaw said nothing more, it could be inferred that he failed to consider Washington's evidence for purposes of non-statutory mitigation. But Judge Bradshaw didn't stop there; the very next sentence in his order shows that he in fact considered the evidence. He concluded that the evidence of substance abuse, considered alone or together with other mitigation evidence, would not \"have mitigated against the sentence [Washington] has received.\" The conclusion that the evidence of substance abuse lacked a causal nexus to the crime was thus appropriate because \"a court is free to assign less weight to mitigating factors that did not influence a defendant's conduct at the time of the crime.\"\n    <em>\n     Hedlund v.
