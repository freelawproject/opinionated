The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   granted summary judgment for LM General, concluding there was no UM coverage because any liability of the uninsured motorist and his occupants to Patel did not \"arise out of the use\" of the uninsured motor vehicle. \"Maulik's injury was not caused by an uninsured vehicle,\" the district court explained; \"the shots just happened to come from an uninsured vehicle.\" Applying Missouri law, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After the drive-by shooting, Maulik's widow, Ripal, sued LM General to recover the Policy's UM coverage limits, $ 250,000. In submitting LM General's motion for summary judgment, the parties agreed the following facts are undisputed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"On January 11, 2016, Maulik ... was killed by gun fire while stopped in traffic ... near Goodfellow Boulevard and Interstate 70 in St. Louis, Missouri.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The occupants of an unknown vehicle fired several shots from the unknown vehicle, hitting Maulik and his 2011 Hyundai Sonata. Maulik exited his vehicle and was shot again outside of the vehicle.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The Policy provides UM coverage limits of $ 250,000 for each person. Both Maulik and Ripal are \"insureds\" under the UM Coverage part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The unidentified vehicle that the shooters occupied never hit or otherwise\n   made physical contact with Maulik or his vehicle.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties agree that Missouri law governs the UM coverage issue in this diversity action. The Missouri insurance statutes provide in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   No automobile liability insurance covering liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle shall be delivered or issued ... unless coverage is provided [in not less than required minimum limits] for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury ... resulting therefrom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20379.203\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 379.203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). Consistent with this statute, LM General's Policy issued to Maulik and Ripal Patel included a UM Coverage part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    INSURING AGREEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n   We will pay compensatory damages which an \"insured\" is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an \"uninsured motor vehicle\" because of \"bodily injury\":\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n   Sustained by an \"insured\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n   Caused by an accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The owner's or operator's liability for these damages must arise out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the \"uninsured motor vehicle\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thus, the Policy provided UM coverage to Maulik if the owner or operator of the unidentified vehicle that the shooters occupied is liable for his damages, an issue the district court did not address,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   if that liability \"arise[s] out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the 'uninsured motor vehicle.' \" Whether the insured's injury arose out of the use of a vehicle is a question of law.\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

Many cases have turned on whether the\n   <em>\n    insured's\n   </em>\n   liability to a third party was covered by an automobile liability policy because the third party's injuries arose out of the insured's use of an insured auto, including the leading case of\n   <em>\n    Schmidt v.

App. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This case raises the question whether injury intentionally inflicted by the occupants of an uninsured automobile was covered because the uninsured motorist's liability arose out of use of the uninsured auto. This issue would not arise in a typical auto liability coverage case like\n   <em>\n    Schmidt\n   </em>\n   because the\n   <em>\n    insured's\n   </em>\n   intentional acts are excluded from coverage, exclusions which are upheld on public policy grounds. But \u00a7 379.203 requires UM coverage whenever an uninsured motorist is liable for injury\n   <em>\n    to the insured\n   </em>\n   arising out of the motorist's use of his uninsured auto. Thus, this coverage applies whether the motorist's tortious acts were negligent or intentional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keeler v. Farmers &amp; Merchs. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11293997\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/724/307/#p311\">\n    724 S.W.2d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311 (Mo. App. 1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Missouri Court of Appeals decided this UM coverage issue in\n   <em>\n    Ward v. International Indemnity\n   </em>\n   , a drive-by shooting case nearly on all-fours with this case. In\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   , the insured while driving his car was shot and killed by a passenger in another, unidentified vehicle. The insured's mother argued that the other vehicle \"was an instrumentality of the shooting, that ... aided and abetted the shooter.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10016301\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/897/627/#p629\">\n    897 S.W.2d at 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court rejected this argument. \"Injuries inflicted on a victim of a drive-by shooting by the occupant of a motor vehicle are not injuries which arise out of the 'use' of the motor vehicle because the motor vehicle is merely the 'situs' or 'locus' of the cause of the victim's injuries and the discharge of the gun is unconnected to the inherent use of the motor vehicle.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10016301\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/897/627/#p629\">\n    Id. at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court of Appeals applied the same reasoning in denying UM coverage for damages caused by intentional tortious acts in other cases. In\n   <em>\n    Ford v.

App. 1977), the insured's passenger sued the auto insurer for UM coverage for injury caused by a drive-by shooter. The Court denied coverage in part because the bullet injury was not one \"arising out of the ... use of such uninsured automobile.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9952811\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/559/759/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9952811\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/559/759/\">\n    at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, that case is materially distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Schmidt\n   </em>\n   , a coal company's drivers used wedge-shaped blocks as ramps to back their trucks from the street onto a sidewalk to complete delivery of coal to a hospital. After putting coal into the hospital's bin under the sidewalk, the drivers used the blocks to move the trucks back to the street and then\n   placed the blocks on the sidewalk for future use, where a pedestrian later tripped over them and was injured.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1914808\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/353/213/\">\n    182 S.W.2d at 181-82, 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In concluding the pedestrian's claim was covered by the coal company's automobile liability policy, the Supreme Court held that the injury arose out of the use of the insured trucks because the drivers' actions in leaving the blocks on the sidewalk were \"directly connected with and necessarily incident to the operation and use of the trucks as motor vehicles in the transportation and delivery of coal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1914808\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/353/213/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 185 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut.

As in\n   <em>\n    Cameron\n   </em>\n   and the above-cited drive-by shooting cases, \"human conduct wholly independent of the operation or use of the vehicle caused\" the insured's injury.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9925002\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/599/13/#p15\">\n    599 S.W.2d at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ripal further argues that the drive-by shooting in fact arose out of the use of the uninsured vehicle because a detective investigating the shooting testified that \"[t]ypically, in a drive by shooting, these suspects will use one vehicle ... for conveyance to the location, typically stay within that vehicle, commit the crime and then continue on.\" However, as the Court of Appeals reasoned in\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   , \"Injuries inflicted on a victim of a drive-by shooting by the occupant of a motor vehicle are not injuries which arise out of the 'use' of the motor vehicle because ... the discharge of the gun is unconnected to the inherent use of the motor vehicle.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10016301\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/897/627/#p629\">\n    897 S.W.2d at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The Honorable Ronnie L.
