In addition, the jury heard testimony that Mr. Mendoza spoke to the agents about a \"next time,\" a statement consistent with an intended narcotics arrangement, not extortion payments.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20R.%20980\">\n    3 R. 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the jurors heard contrary testimony that Mr. Montijo had no knowledge\n   that the transaction involved narcotics, it was within their province to credit one of two conflicting accounts.\n   <em>\n    See United States v.

Similarly, although Mr. Mendoza explained that he and Mr. Montijo drove around the parking lot because of a misunderstanding as to the meeting spot,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20R.%201424\">\n    3 R. 1424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the agents described their driving as reflecting a \"countersurveillance\" pattern.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1207-10.

The government argues for plain error review, contending that Mr. Montijo made a different argument before the district court, namely that he had provided complete and truthful testimony notwithstanding the verdict.\n   <em>\n    Montijo\n   </em>\n   Aplee. Br. at 20-21. We have reviewed the arguments below and conclude that Mr. Montijo did argue that a jury's verdict should not have preclusive effect on safety-valve eligibility. Accordingly, we review the district court's denial of safety-valve relief for clear error, and, to the extent Mr. Montijo argues that the district court misunderstood the applicable sentencing statutes, we review its interpretation de novo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mr. Montijo points to the court's statement that \"if [it] concluded that the defendant had fully and completely and truthfully debriefed, [it] would essentially find contrary to the jury verdict.\" He argues that a jury's finding against a defendant does not foreclose relief under \u00a7 3553(f), even when the defendant maintains his innocence as to one or more elements of the underlying offense. He thus challenges the court's factual determination that Mr. Montijo's truthfulness was inconsistent with the jury's verdict, and the court's legal interpretation of \u00a7 3553(f) as precluding safety-valve relief upon a guilty jury verdict. In response, the government argues a finding that Mr. Montijo had \"truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense,\" \u00a7 3553(f)(5), would have been contrary to and entirely inconsistent with the jury's verdict, and that the denial of safety-valve relief was warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err in Determining That the Jury Found Mr. Montijo's Testimony to be Untruthful\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Mr. Montijo argues that the jury could plausibly have credited his testimony as truthful despite its guilty verdict, stating that \"it is impossible to determine what evidence the jury relied upon to determine the guilty verdict and the weight of the evidence that it placed upon Montijo's testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Montijo\n   </em>\n   Aplt. Br. at 23. Yet he fails to explain how the jury could have credited his testimony that he had no knowledge of the nature of the transaction, yet still convict him of knowingly conspiring with Mr. Mendoza. Instead, the jury necessarily must have found that Mr. Montijo knowingly participated in a conspiracy with Mr. Mendoza. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in its finding\n   that the jury found his testimony to be untruthful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The District Court Properly Interpreted \u00a7 3553(f)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Mr. Montijo next argues that the district court committed legal error when it stated that, despite its reservations about Mr. Montijo's guilty verdict, safety-valve relief would be \"contrary to the jury verdict.\" According to Mr. Montijo, the court's statement evinced its misunderstanding that \u00a7 3553(f) required a finding by the jury, not the judge, of Mr. Montijo's eligibility for safety-valve treatment.\n   <em>\n    Montijo\n   </em>\n   Aplt.

Br. at 18-19, 21-22. In\n   <em>\n    Sherpa\n   </em>\n   , the jury found a purportedly ignorant defendant guilty for knowingly possessing heroin with intent to distribute and for knowingly importing heroin.\n   <em>\n    Sherpa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"694945\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/110/656/\">\n    110 F.3d at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
