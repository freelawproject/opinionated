The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conceded at oral argument that we may consider LULAC's request as a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus, and it had a full opportunity to respond. In view of the circumstances presented by the petition, we exercise our discretion to construe the opening brief as a request for mandamus relief.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   Pub. Utils.

EPA is hereby ordered to issue, no later than 90 days after the filing of this order, a full and final decision on LULAC's objections pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 346a(g)(2)(C). Given this resolution, we need not-and do not-decide any other issue urged by the parties. The en banc court shall retain jurisdiction over this and any related cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    PETITION GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
