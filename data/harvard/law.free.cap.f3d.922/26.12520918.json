Gen. Laws ch. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 131M (the Act). The plaintiffs assert that they have an unfettered Second Amendment right to possess the proscribed assault weapons and LCMs in their homes for self-defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants (a phalanx of state officials).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Worman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Healey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523670\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/251/#p271\">\n    293 F.Supp.3d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 271 (D. Mass. 2018). Although our reasoning differs in certain respects from that of the court below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We assume, without deciding, that the proscribed weapons have some degree of protection under the Second Amendment. We further assume, again without deciding, that the Act implicates the core Second Amendment right of self-defense in the home by law-abiding, responsible individuals. We hold, however, that the Act's burden on that core right is minimal and,\n   thus, the Act need only withstand intermediate scrutiny - which it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We start by rehearsing the background and travel of the case. The Massachusetts legislature modeled the Act on the 1994 federal Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act (the federal regulation), Pub. L. No. 103-322, \u00a7\u00a7 110101-06,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n    108 Stat. 1796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1996-2010 (1994), which is no longer in effect. The federal regulation prohibited the manufacture, transfer, and possession of \"semiautomatic assault weapons\" and the transfer and possession of \"large capacity ammunition feeding devices.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 110102-03, 108 Stat. at 1996-2000. For purposes of the federal regulation, the term \"semiautomatic assault weapon\" was defined to include nineteen specific models, as well as any semiautomatic rifle, pistol, or shotgun with two or more combat-style features or the ability to accept a detachable magazine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 110102(b), 108 Stat. at 1997-98. The term \"large capacity ammunition feeding device\" encompassed any magazine or other feeding device that could accept more than ten rounds of ammunition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 110103(b), 108 Stat. at 1999. The federal regulation specifically exempted, inter alia, assault weapons that were lawfully possessed on the date of its enactment (September 13, 1994), semiautomatic rifles that could not hold more than five rounds of ammunition or accept a detachable magazine holding more than five rounds of ammunition, and a specific list of \"long guns most commonly used in hunting and recreational sports.\" H.R. Rep. No. 103-489, at 20 (1994);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 103-322, \u00a7 110102(a), 108 Stat. at 1996-97. In explicating the purpose of the federal regulation, Congress stated that semiautomatic assault weapons have \"a capability for lethality - more wounds, more serious, in more victims - far beyond that of other firearms in general, including other semiautomatic guns.\" H.R. Rep. No. 103-489, at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Four years after Congress enacted the federal regulation, the Massachusetts legislature passed a counterpart statute, which made it a crime to sell, transfer, or possess semiautomatic assault weapons as defined by the federal regulation, copies or duplicates of those weapons, and LCMs capable of holding more than ten rounds of ammunition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20140%2C%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20121\">\n    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 131M. The Act contained the same exceptions as the federal regulation, including free passes for weapons lawfully owned on September 13, 1994, and for sundry automatic rifles commonly used for hunting and sport.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20140%2C%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20121\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Congress allowed the federal regulation to expire in 2004, but the Massachusetts legislature struck out in a different direction and made the Massachusetts assault weapons regulation permanent that year. In signing the bill into law, then-Governor Romney declared that semiautomatic assault weapons and LCMs \"are not made for recreation or self-defense. They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We fast-forward to 2016 when the Massachusetts Attorney General, Maura Healey, issued a public enforcement notice designed to \"provide[ ] guidance on the identification of weapons that are 'copies' or 'duplicates' of the enumerated Assault weapons that are banned under Massachusetts law.\" Approximately six months later, the plaintiffs - a diverse group consisting of Massachusetts firearm owners, prospective firearm owners, firearm dealers, and a firearm advocacy association - brought suit in the federal district court, alleging constitutional violations and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. They named an array of defendants\n   including (as relevant here) various state officials in their representative capacities; claimed that the Act, as interpreted and enforced by those officials, abridged both the Second Amendment and the Due Process Clause; and prayed for declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After some procedural skirmishing, not relevant here, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court heard arguments of counsel and reserved decision. The court subsequently handed down a rescript in which it rejected the plaintiffs' challenges and explained why it was granting the defendants' summary judgment motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Worman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523670\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/251/#p271\">\n    293 F.Supp.3d at 258-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This timely appeal ensued. In it, the plaintiffs challenge only the district court's rejection of their Second Amendment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

This standard applies unabated to appeals - like this one - arising out of a district court's disposition of cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blackie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"830\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/75/716/#p720\">\n    75 F.3d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 720-21 (1st Cir. 1996). In applying the standard here, we have the benefit not only of able briefing by the parties but also of a myriad of thoughtful amicus briefs (for which we are grateful).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Legal Framework\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Second Amendment states that \"[a] well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" U.S. Const. amend.

Although the Court did not have occasion to examine \"the full scope of the Second Amendment\" right, it cautioned that the right \"is not unlimited.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p592\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p592\">\n    at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p592\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In furtherance of this cautionary language, the Court admonished that \"nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of\n   firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p592\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p592\">\n    at 626-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p592\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Refined to bare essence, its message is that the Second Amendment \"elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p592\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p592\">\n    at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p592\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As applied here, this message checks off the first three data points. It is undisputed that the individual plaintiffs are not prohibited persons but, rather, law-abiding, responsible citizens. Similarly, it is undisputed that they seek to use the proscribed assault weapons and LCMs for self-defense. And, finally, it is undisputed that they seek to effectuate this usage in their homes. We are, therefore, left to focus on the fourth data point: the arms proscribed and the extent (if at all) that those arms are protected by the Second Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In conducting this inquiry, we do not write on an entirely pristine page.

As an initial matter, the Act does not ban all semiautomatic weapons and magazines. Instead, it proscribes only a set of specifically enumerated semiautomatic assault weapons, magazines of a particular capacity, and semiautomatic assault weapons that have certain combat-style features. Furthermore, the record shows that semiautomatic assault weapons do not share the features that make handguns well-suited to self-defense in the home.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p592\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p592\">\n    at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p592\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"a citizen may prefer a handgun for home defense\" because, inter alia, \"[i]t is easier to store in a location that is readily accessible in an emergency; it cannot easily be redirected or wrestled away by an attacker; it is easier to use for those without the upper-body strength to lift and aim a long gun; it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police\"). Equally as important is what the record does not show: it offers no indication that the proscribed weapons have commonly been used for home self-defense purposes. In fact, when asked directly, not one of the plaintiffs or their six experts could identify even a single example of the use of an assault weapon for home self-defense, nor could they identify even a single example of a self-defense episode in which ten or more shots were fired. Viewed as a whole, the record suggests that wielding the proscribed weapons for self-defense within the home is tantamount to using a sledgehammer to crack open the shell of a peanut. Thus, we conclude that the Act does not heavily burden the core Second Amendment right of self-defense within the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This conclusion fits seamlessly with our decision in\n   <em>\n    Hightower\n   </em>\n   . Although that opinion did not directly address what restrictions may be deemed to heavily burden the core Second Amendment right, we stated that the fact that the plaintiff sought a license that \"allowed carrying of large capacity weapons weaken[ed] the Second Amendment claim, as [\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ] was concerned with weapons of the type characteristically used to protect the home.\"\n   <em>\n    Hightower\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3518015\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/61/#p70\">\n    693 F.3d at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that revocation of license to carry concealed, large-capacity firearm based on false statements in renewal application did not violate Second Amendment). So, too, our conclusion is reinforced by the fact that - unlike the use of handguns - the use of semiautomatic assault weapons, even in the home, does not \"implicate[ ] the safety only of those who live or visit there.\"\n   <em>\n    Gould\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519059\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/907/659/#p668\">\n    907 F.3d at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

What is more, it strains credulity to argue that the fit between the Act and the asserted governmental interest is unreasonable. As we have said, the Act does not outlaw all semiautomatic firearms and magazines. Nor does it circumscribe in any way the fundamental right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to possess handguns in their homes for self-defense. Accordingly, we hold that although the Act may well \"touch[ ] the right to keep and bear arms,\"\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6138036\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/307/174/#p179\">\n    307 U.S. at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6138036\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/307/174/#p179\">\n    59 S.Ct. 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it does not impermissibly intrude upon that right because it withstands intermediate scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This case concerns an issue of paramount importance. In the wake of increasingly frequent acts of mass violence committed with semiautomatic assault weapons and LCMs, the interests of state and local governments in regulating the possession and use of such weapons are entitled to great weight. Even so, we recognize that such interests must be balanced against the time-honored right of individuals to bear arms in self-defense - a right that is protected in varying degrees by the Second Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Holding this delicate balance steady and true is difficult but necessary work. Here, we find that even if the Act implicates the core of the Second Amendment right, it (at most) minimally burdens that right. Consequently, we are obliged to cede some degree of deference to the decision of the Massachusetts legislature about how best to regulate the possession and use of the proscribed weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In this instance, that decision rests on a web of compelling governmental interests, and the fit between those interests and the restrictions imposed by the Act is both close and reasonable. It follows that the Act withstands intermediate scrutiny - and no more is exigible to blunt the plaintiffs' Second Amendment challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, the judgment of the district court is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Affirmed\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Throughout this opinion, we use the terms \"proscribed assault weapons and LCMs\" and \"proscribed weapons\" interchangeably to describe the semiautomatic assault weapons and LCMs targeted by the Act.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Although the present plaintiffs attempt to characterize the Act as an \"absolute prohibition\" on an entire class of firearms, that characterization is inapt. The Act applies only to a set of enumerated semiautomatic assault weapons, to semiautomatic assault weapons with particular features, and to magazines of a specific capacity. Seen in this light, the plaintiffs' \"absolute prohibition\" argument is circular: essentially, it amounts to a suggestion that whatever group of weapons a regulation prohibits may be deemed a \"class.\" By this logic - which we squarely reject - virtually any regulation could be considered an \"absolute prohibition\" of a class of weapons.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    One of the amici advances the clever argument that LCMs, like other magazines, are not \"arms\" at all because they are not themselves \"[w]eapons of offense, or armour of defence.\"\n    <em>\n     Heller\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p592\">\n     554 U.S. at 581\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p592\">\n     128 S.Ct. 2783\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (alteration in original) (quoting 1\n    <em>\n     Dictionary of the English Language\n    </em>\n    106 (4th ed.)
