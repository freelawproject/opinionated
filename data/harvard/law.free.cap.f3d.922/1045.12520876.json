Holmes\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Circuit Judge\n   </em>\n   .\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   In this appeal, David James Burns and Robin Burns (as representatives of Tyler Burns) (collectively, the \"Burnses\") seek review of a district court order granting summary judgment in favor of American National Property and Casualty Company (\"American National\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In October 2014, then-sixteen-year-old Phillip Sam shot and killed Tyler Burns. The Burnses brought a wrongful death action in state court against, among others, Phillip's mother, Dora Sam, alleging that she had negligently stored the handgun used in the shooting. Dora was a named policyholder of an American National homeowner's policy (the \"Policy\") effective at the time of the shooting, and she demanded that American National indemnify and defend her in the wrongful death action. American National then filed an action in federal court seeking a declaration that there was no coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The district court granted summary judgment for American National. In relevant part, it concluded first that Phillip was a \"resident\" of Dora's home at the time of the shooting. And because the Policy defines \"insureds\" to include relatives who were \"resident[s]\" of a named insured's home, and excludes personal liability coverage for intentional and criminal actions by \"any insured,\" the district court determined that there was no coverage as to Dora for the shooting. The court also ruled that this result was not unsettled by the Policy's inclusion of a severability clause, concluding that to determine otherwise would render the \"any insured\" exclusion meaningless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Burnses now raise two claims of error. First, they argue that Phillip was not a resident of Dora's household at the time of the shooting because he had been staying with his father, Nathan Sam, at that time and, relatedly, had expressed an intent or desire to live with Nathan. Second, they argue that there is an ambiguity introduced by including both an \"any insured\" exclusion and a severability clause in the same policy, and that this ambiguity must be construed in favor of coverage for Dora. The Burnses have also filed two motions - one a motion to certify issues presented in this case to the Wyoming Supreme Court, and the other to seal Volume VIII of the Appendix.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons explained below, we conclude that \"resident\" as contained in the Policy is an ambiguous term that might reasonably be construed in favor of coverage for Dora, and we reverse and remand on this basis. Further, we deny both the motion to certify and the motion to seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Dora and Nathan divorced in 2013, a decree gave them joint legal custody of their minor children, including Phillip, with Dora listed as the \"primary residential\n   custodian.\" Aplts.' App. at 370 (Divorce Decree, filed Sept. 10, 2013). In deference to Nathan's itinerant work schedule, Nathan was to have physical custody of the children when he was in Cheyenne, Wyoming; Dora was to have the children \"all other times.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Consistent with the decree, Dora testified that Phillip lived with her and \"sometimes lived with his dad.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 225 (Dora Sam Dep., filed Oct. 6, 2017). Nathan also discussed this arrangement at his deposition, confirming that the children would \"come over and spend time with [him] when [he was] in town.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 234 (Nathan Sam Dep., filed Oct. 6, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   From roughly October 1 to October 5, 2014, Phillip, then sixteen years old, stayed with Nathan, who had returned to Cheyenne from a work trip. At one point on October 5, Nathan dropped Phillip off at Dora's house for five or six minutes so Phillip could pick up his work uniform. Though Dora was out of town, Nathan and Phillip nevertheless \"texted [her] ahead of time[]\" before Phillip entered the house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 237. While he was inside, Phillip did not just grab his work uniform; he also stole Dora's boyfriend's semi-automatic pistol from the master bedroom closet. Phillip and Nathan then returned to Nathan's house for about an hour, at which time Nathan dropped Phillip off at a friend's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Early the following morning, Phillip shot and killed Tyler Burns with the pistol he took from Dora's house. When he was subsequently booked into jail, Phillip provided Nathan's address as his residence. Phillip was ultimately convicted of first-degree murder and related crimes.\n   <em>\n    See Sam v.

Dora, facing a claim for negligent storage of a handgun, demanded that American National indemnify and defend her under her homeowner's policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   American National thereafter filed this action in federal court, naming Dora and the Burnses as defendants and seeking a declaration that insurance coverage did not exist. Moving for summary judgment, American National noted that the Policy's personal liability coverage does not apply to intentional or criminal actions by \"any insured,\" Aplts.' App. at 26, 28 (Ex. 1 to Compl., filed Dec. 15, 2016), and, furthermore, that \"insured[s]\" under the Policy include the named policyholder \"and the following\n   <em>\n    residents\n   </em>\n   of [their] household: a. [their] relatives[;] b. any other person under the age of 21 who is in the care of any person named above,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (emphasis added). Though the Policy does not further define \"resident,\" American National relied on these provisions to argue that Phillip was an \"insured\" - and thus (in its view) no coverage existed as to Dora for the shooting - because he was Dora's minor son who resided with her and was \"in [her] care.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 196-97 (Pl.'s Br. in Supp., filed Sep. 14, 2017). American National also argued that the Policy's severability clause, which states that \"[t]his insurance applies separately to each insured,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30, did not preclude exclusions of coverage to Dora for the intentional actions of\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   insureds. The Burnses opposed, arguing that Phillip was not a resident of Dora's home at the time of the shooting and that the severability clause created an ambiguity that had to be construed in favor of coverage for Dora.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court granted American National's motion, ruling first that Phillip was a \"resident\" of Dora's home at the time of the shooting because,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   Dora was\n   the \"primary residential parent\"; a person can have more than one residence at a time and can temporarily leave home without changing residences; and it is unclear whether a minor can form the intent to change residences, if such intent is necessary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 349-50 (Order Granting Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J., dated Jan. 3, 2018). And because Phillip was a \"resident\" of Dora's household and also her relative, he was an insured under the Policy, and there was thus no coverage as to Dora for Phillip's intentional or criminal actions. The district court further concluded that the Policy's severability clause did not create an ambiguity that had to be construed in favor of coverage, reasoning that to hold otherwise would \"basically render the exclusions meaningless.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 357.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following the district court's entry of judgment, the Burnses timely filed a notice of appeal, arguing that Phillip was not a \"resident\" of Dora's household at the time of the shooting and that the Policy's severability clause created an ambiguity that had to be construed in favor of coverage for Dora.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We \"review the district court's entry of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Bekkem v.

Based on statements from the Wyoming Supreme Court, we conclude that it is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Two cases primarily inform this conclusion, the first being\n   <em>\n    Wyoming Insurance Guaranty Ass'n v.

There, the Wyoming Supreme Court considered whether an individual claimant under the Wyoming Insurance Guaranty Association Act (\"the Act\") can have multiple residences within the context of the Act. This question was relevant since a \"covered claim\" under the Act is one involving,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   a claimant who was a \"\n   <em>\n    resident of this state at the time of the insured event.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10347660\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/888/192/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10347660\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/888/192/\">\n    at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting WYO.

This fact suggests that there was a shared understanding that Phillip at that time was to be with Nathan as a resident of Nathan's home, and, correspondingly, would not enter Dora's home without authorization, or at least without notice. Another manifestation of this understanding is the fact that Phillip wrote down Nathan's home as his residence when he was booked immediately following the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Our decision today should not be understood as a definitive pronouncement on the\n   <em>\n    best\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    most reasonable\n   </em>\n   reading of the term \"resident\"; instead, our interpretation of this term here reflects our adherence to Wyoming law's command for courts to construe ambiguities in insurance policies strictly in favor of coverage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., T.M.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9382371\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/59/721/#p726\">\n    59 P.3d at 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Doctors' Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10356852\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/864/1018/#p1024\">\n    864 P.2d at 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that regard, our reading of the Policy term \"resident\"-to the effect that an individual may only have one residence at a time, and further that an individual periodically alternating between his parents' homes would be, at a given point in time, a resident of the home he or she is staying at-is a fair and reasonable one. And it is an interpretation that in fact favors coverage for Dora: because Phillip was not a \"resident[] of [Dora's] household\" under the Policy at the time of the shooting, Aplts.' App. at 15, he was not a Policy \"insured,\" and his intentional, criminal actions would thus not fall within the \"any insured\" exclusion when determining Dora's coverage eligibility,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26, 28.

This rule reasons that ambiguity in an insurance policy should not defeat a claim for coverage because \"insurance policies represent contracts of adhesion where the insured has little or no bargaining power to vary the terms\" but where the insurance company has wide latitude to alter terms and clarify any potential ambiguities in its favor when drafting the policy.\n    <em>\n     Century Sur.

In other words, an insurance company cannot rely on ambiguity to defeat coverage when it was exclusively empowered to clarify that ambiguity in advance, and courts should follow this principle even if it requires interpreting the same ambiguous policy term differently in different cases based solely on what would promote coverage in each case for the individual claiming it.\n    <em>\n     See Vanguard Ins.
