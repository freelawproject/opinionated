And for five years, these cases have languished at the pleading stage. The cases are now before this Court for a second time, after the district court again denied leave to amend and dismissed with prejudice. We again reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2014, Malibu sued Defendants for copyright infringement. Malibu alleges it owns copyrights for two lace designs, consisting of flowers, vines, leaves, and other elements arranged in a pattern. Malibu refers to these two designs collectively as the Subject Work and alleges Defendants infringed on both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The first appeal came after the district court dismissed the cases with prejudice for failure to state a claim. This Court reversed, stating that \"[d]ismissal with prejudice is appropriate only if the complaint 'could not be saved by any amendment.' \"\n   <em>\n    Malibu Textiles, Inc. v.

This Court concluded that Malibu could fix its Complaints by adding more allegations of similarity between the Subject Work and Defendants' works and how Defendants had access to the Subject Work.\n   <em>\n    Label Lane\n   </em>\n   , 668 F. App'x at 803-04 ;\n   <em>\n    H&amp;M\n   </em>\n   , 668 F.

But the Malibu attorneys mistakenly omitted new access allegations. When they realized their error, the parties filed a joint stipulation seeking leave to file amended versions\n   of the post-remand Complaints. Malibu included a declaration explaining the mistake and provided the district court with redlined copies of the new Complaints with the missing access allegations. In a one-sentence, handwritten order, the district court denied leave to amend: \"Denied[,] no good cause is shown.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants again moved to dismiss, and the district court again dismissed with prejudice. The district court determined that most of the similarities between Malibu's designs and Defendants' designs consisted of non-protectable elements, such as \"the natural appearance of a Bengal Clockvine flower.\" The district court identified differences in the side-by-side images, concluding that the designs were not strikingly similar. The district court further held that Malibu failed to plausibly allege access, without mentioning whether the proposed amendments would have cured this deficiency. H&amp;M moved for attorney fees, which the district court denied. These appeals followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This Court reviews dismissals under Federal Civil Rule 12(b)(6) de novo, accepting the plaintiff's allegations as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Zucco Partners, LLC v.

But Defendants argue that Malibu's case is not based upon either of these copyrights, but rather upon some third work called the \"Subject Work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants mischaracterize Malibu's allegations.

Two works are strikingly similar when the similarities between them are so great that they are \"highly unlikely to have been the product of independent creation.\"\n   <em>\n    Rentmeester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516041\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/1111/#p1116\">\n    883 F.3d at 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Here, the similarities between the lace patterns go well beyond their mutual inclusion of the Bengal Clockvine flower. The works contain nearly identical floral, leaf, boteh, and dot elements, and those elements are arranged in virtually the same way. The post-remand Complaints state that the patterns are \"identically arranged\" and that the elements \"are arranged exactly the same in relation to each other.\" They describe, in detail, some of the similarities between the patterns. And most importantly, they provide side-by-side pictures that make the similarities apparent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appendix,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To be sure, the pictures do show some minor differences between the Subject Work and Defendants' works, such as in color, netting, and shape curvature. \"But a rational jury could find that these differences result from the fabric-printing process generally and are 'inconsequential,' or could credit [Malibu]'s assertion that these differences result in part from 'print[ing] using cruder, lower-quality techniques and machinery.' \"\n   <em>\n    L.A.

Alternatively, a jury could find these to be knowing modifications, which could be evidence of willful copying.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Concord Fabrics, Inc. v. Marcus Bros. Textile Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2200007\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/409/1315/#p1316\">\n    409 F.2d 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1316 (2d Cir. 1969) (per curiam) (\"While the trial court placed great emphasis on\n   the minor differences between the two patterns, we feel that the very nature of these differences only tends to emphasize the extent to which the defendant has deliberately copied from the plaintiff.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As for the differences pointed out by the district court in its dismissal order, those appear to result from the cropping and angle of the images rather than any real differences in the designs. And to the extent Defendants contend the similarities are \"required by the medium of lace\" and are merely \"functional choices ... dictated by the lace medium,\" those arguments are better suited for summary judgment, after discovery and perhaps with the aid of expert testimony. For this stage, Malibu successfully pled striking similarity in the post-remand Complaints, and the district court erred in dismissal on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Substantial Similarity.\n   </em>\n   But striking similarity was not the only theory Malibu sought to plead.
