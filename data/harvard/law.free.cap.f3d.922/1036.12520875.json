In 2009, Dr. Nielsen was diagnosed with cancer, and shortly thereafter he and his family moved to Kansas. He formed NCF in 2013, after he was unable to continue working as a physician. Dr. Nielsen was NCF's sole member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Dr. Dunlap loaned $150,000 to NCF in October 2014, and loaned it an additional $50,000 the following month. Both loans were memorialized with documents signed by Dr. Nielsen and, purportedly, by his wife, Karin Nielsen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Dr. Nielsen died in December 2015. On May 24, 2016, Dustin Wiemers, one of Dr. Nielsen's creditors, filed a Petition for Appointment of Special Administrator for the Estate of Tyghe Nielsen in the District Court of Miami County, Kansas, Probate Division [hereinafter \"Probate Case\"].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the same day, the state court appointed a Special Administrator for the Estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Wiemers published a \"Notice to Creditors\" regarding the May 24, 2016, Petition once a week for three weeks in the Kansas City Star beginning on June 2, 2016, and in the Miami County Republic beginning on June 8, 2016 [hereinafter \"Notices\"].

The state district court admitted the Will and substituted Ms. Nielsen as the Estate's Executor on July 14, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June 2016, shortly after the Notices were first published, Dr. Dunlap, a resident of Arkansas, filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, asserting breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims against Ms. Nielsen, the Estate and NCF (collectively \"Defendants\") for the amounts due on his loans to NCF. The Arkansas federal court immediately transferred this action to the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, in part based on Dr. Dunlap's allegations that the Estate was in probate in Kansas state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In July 2017, Defendants moved for summary judgment on Dr. Dunlap's promissory estoppel claims and his breach of contract claims against Ms. Nielsen and the Estate. As relevant to this appeal, Defendants argued Dr. Dunlap's breach of contract claim against the Estate was barred because he had failed to make a timely claim in the Probate Case as required by Kansas' nonclaim statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2059-2239\">\n    Kan.

After the court entered judgment in favor of the Defendants, Dr. Dunlap timely filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dr. Dunlap challenges the district court's final decision regarding his breach of contract claim against the Estate on two grounds. First, he asserts for the first time that the district court lacked jurisdiction to decide whether his claim was barred by Kansas' nonclaim statute because this question falls within the probate exception to diversity jurisdiction. And in the event the court had jurisdiction to decide this issue, Dr. Dunlap argues the district court erred in concluding he received actual notice of the applicable limitations period as required for his claim to be barred under the statute. For the reasons stated below, we conclude the district court had jurisdiction to decide whether\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2059-2239\">\n    Kan.

But, inconsistently, he claims the probate exception deprived the district court of jurisdiction to rule on Defendants' affirmative defense that this claim was barred by Kansas' nonclaim statute, because the district court's ruling \"directly interferes with the Probate Court's control of [E]state assets.\" Aplt. Opening Br. at 14. As just described, this is not the test for assessing whether the probate exception applies. The district court's judgment that Dr. Dunlap failed to present his demand in the Probate Case, while it may affect the distribution of Estate assets, does not constitute the disposal of Estate assets in the custody of the Kansas state court. As a result, the probate exception does not apply on this basis.\n   <em>\n    See Marshall,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276570\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/293/#p299\">\n    547 U.S. at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2814930,3276570\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/126/1735/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding probate exception does not apply where party is not \"seek[ing] to reach a\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   in the custody of the state court\");\n   <em>\n    Lee Graham,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986426\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/678/\">\n    777 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   681 &amp; n.4 (holding that resolving a question that may affect the distribution of estate assets does not constitute a distribution of estate assets subject to the probate exception).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dr. Dunlap also asserts that the district court's ruling that his claims are time-barred constitutes administration of the Estate, because, he argues, notification of creditors and management of their claims is part of estate administration. But even if the latter assertion is true, the district court did not perform either of these estate administration functions. It simply determined that Dr. Dunlap's claims were barred for failure to timely present them in the Probate Case. That this determination may affect future Estate administration does not bring it within the probate exception.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Lee Graham,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986426\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/678/\">\n    777 F.3d at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (after\n   <em>\n    Marshall,\n   </em>\n   a matter \"does not fall under the probate exception if it merely impacts a state court's performance of one of [the] tasks\"\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   reserved to the probate court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Dr. Dunlap also asserts the probate exception applies here because the nonclaim statute is located in Kansas' probate code, but this is precisely the kind of over-broad reading of the exception that the Supreme Court rejected in\n   <em>\n    Marshall.\n   </em>\n   And even assuming Kansas law grants its state courts exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate the state's nonclaim statute, as Dr. Dunlap suggests with scant support, this would not limit otherwise existing federal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See Marshall,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276570\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/293/#p299\">\n    547 U.S. at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2814930,3276570\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/126/1735/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he jurisdiction of the federal courts, having existed from the beginning of the Federal government, cannot be impaired by subsequent state legislation creating courts of probate.\" (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).

Accordingly, to preserve a claim against the Estate under \u00a7 59-2239(1), Dr. Dunlap was required to present his claim in the Probate Case within four months of the published notice to creditors or within 30 days of receiving actual notice of the statute's limitation periods, whichever was later.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2059-2237\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Dunlap did not make a demand against the Estate in the Probate Case until October 10, 2017, after summary judgment briefing was concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants argued on summary judgment that the four-month period for asserting a claim against the Estate began to run when the Notices were published in June 2016 and that Dr. Dunlap had received actual notice of the applicable limitations period: when Mr. Wiemers first published the Notices; when Defendants asserted\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2059-2239\">\n    Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 59-2239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   as an affirmative defense in their answers; and/or when they served Dr. Dunlap with hard copies of the Notices as part of their Rule 26(a)(1) disclosures. In its summary judgment decision, the district court agreed with Defendants that publication of notice as referenced in \u00a7 59-2239(1)(a) occurred in June 2016, when Mr. Wiemers published the Notices, and that the four-month period for presenting a claim following publication of the Notices had therefore expired. But it held Dr. Dunlap's claims against the Estate nonetheless were not barred because the actions cited by Defendants had not provided Dr. Dunlap with actual notice of the statutory limitation period, and thus the alternate 30-day period for timely bringing a claim provided in \u00a7 59-2239(1)(b) had not yet begun to run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The district court based this conclusion on Kansas authority holding that a known creditor \"must receive notice that is reasonably calculated under the circumstances to apprise an interested party of the pendency of the action and afford the party an opportunity to present its claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Reynolds,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"534169\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/266/449/\">\n    970 P.2d at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court concluded that the first two events cited by Defendants had not included the information necessary to provide such notice. And while Defendants' production of the Notices as part of its Rule 26(a) disclosures provided this information, the district court concluded this event \"was not reasonably calculated to apprise [Dr. Dunlap] of his rights in the Probate Case\" because the Notices were \"buried within a volume of discovery.\" Aplt. App. Vol. II at 518.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   At the conclusion of the bench trial that followed, Defendants asked the district court to take judicial notice of an additional event, Dr. Dunlap's response to their motion for summary judgment, filed August 28, 2017. In this filing, Defendants argued, Dr. Dunlap had demonstrated that he had actual notice of the limitations period established by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2059-2239\">\n    Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 59-2239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for claims against the Estate. The district court took judicial notice as requested and concluded Dr. Dunlap's references to the published Notices in his summary judgment response indeed established that he had received actual notice of them and of \u00a7 59-2239's claim presentation requirements no later than the response's August 28, 2017 filing date. And because Dr. Dunlap had not presented his claim in the Probate Case within 30 days of this date, the District Court concluded his claims against the Estate were time-barred under \u00a7 59-2239(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Dr. Dunlap challenges the district court's finding that he received actual notice no later than August 28, 2017. He first\n   argues Defendants' summary judgment motion did not provide actual notice of his rights in the Probate Case because Defendants did not intend to provide him with the required notice through this vehicle. But Dr. Dunlap cites no evidence regarding Defendants' intent or lack of intent to provide notice through the summary judgment process or, more importantly, any authority that a lack of such intent would negate his receipt of actual notice through this process. Nor does he cite authority supporting his implication that Kansas law limits the means by which actual notice can be provided and that such notice cannot be provided through court filings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2059-2236\">\n    Kan.

This argument ignores that the limitation periods established by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2059-2239\">\n    Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 59-2239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) were front and center in Defendants' summary judgment briefing. In fact, Defendants quoted both the statute and the Notices in their argument and/or their statements of uncontroverted material facts, in addition to providing copies of the Notices as exhibits to these materials. Defendants' summary judgment motion and related argument and exhibits thereby clearly informed Dr. Dunlap of the statutory limitation periods for claims against the Estate. Further, Dr. Dunlap's August 28 response brief demonstrates he received actual notice of these limitation periods and when the Notices were published, as he discussed both in arguing that neither publication nor actual notice had been provided as required to start the clock on \u00a7 59-2239's limitation periods. Under these circumstances, the district court's finding that Dr. Dunlap had actual notice of these limitation periods no later than August 28, 2017 is amply supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, Dr. Dunlap at times appears to argue that actual notice to a known creditor is only effective under \u00a7 59-2239 if it is given during the four-month period following publication of the notices of this information. He cites no case law in support of this contention and instead bases it on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2059-709\">\n    Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 59-709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), which requires that the personal representative of an estate \"give actual notice to known or reasonably ascertainable\n   creditors prior to the expiration of the nonclaim statute.\" But as noted above, the nonclaim statute, \u00a7 59-2239, includes two limitations periods, the second of which does not expire until 30 days after actual notice is given.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2059-709\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 59-2239(1)(a) &amp; (b);\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Powell,\n   </em>\n   No. 113,839,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201719842\">\n    2016 WL 1719842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Kan. Ct. App. Apr. 29, 2016) (unpublished) (explaining that under \u00a7 59-2239(1) \"the 4-month time limit is the default for all claims, but a special, second time period applies to known or reasonably ascertainable creditors who receive no notice of that period and must instead rely on actual notice\"). Further, if this theory was correct, the period for a known creditor to present a claim against an estate could extend forever if actual notice was not given during the initial four-month limitation period, because any notice given thereafter would be ineffective and not start the clock on the 30-day post-notice limitation period. This result is contrary to the nonclaim statute's purpose, which is to protect against stale claims and enable the speedy and final settlement of estates,\n   <em>\n    see Nelson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718440\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/288/570/\">\n    205 P.3d at 730-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Kansas Supreme Court's recognition that a known creditor's claim can be barred once actual notice is given,\n   <em>\n    see Reynolds,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"534169\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/266/449/\">\n    970 P.2d at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Failure to give a known creditor notice of the statute of limitations ... will not bar the claim\n   <em>\n    until actual notice is given\n   </em>\n   to the known or reasonably ascertainable creditor.\" (emphasis added)). As a result, we conclude that actual notice sufficient to start the 30-day limitations period in \u00a7 59-2239(1)(b) can be given after expiration of the initial four-month limitation period provided by \u00a7 59-2239(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In sum, we find no error in the district court's finding that Dr. Dunlap had actual notice of the statutory deadlines for presenting claims against the Estate no later than August 28, 2017.
