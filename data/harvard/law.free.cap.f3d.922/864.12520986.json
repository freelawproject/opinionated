In determining that Jones qualified for an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), the court relied on his prior convictions for first-degree robbery and second-degree assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirmed on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Subsequently, the Court held that\n   <em>\n    Samuel Johnson\n   </em>\n   announced a \"new rule\" that is retroactive on collateral review.\n   <em>\n    Welch v.

As a result, in October 2016, we granted Jones authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 petition. He claimed that his robbery and assault convictions are not violent felonies without the residual clause, that he no longer qualifies as an armed career criminal, and that his 293-month sentence exceeds the statutory maximum of 120 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   , however, it is not sufficient for a \u00a7 2255 movant to show that his original sentence relied on the unconstitutional residual clause. He must also show that his prior convictions do not qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA's force clause or enumerated-offenses clause, which remain constitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/#p1268\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The district court concluded that Jones's prior Missouri convictions are violent felonies under the force clause and denied relief. We granted a certificate of appealability and review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   whether his prior convictions qualify as violent felonies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We therefore need only consider whether Jones's two convictions under the first-degree robbery statute in effect at the time,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20560.120\">\n    Mo.

Stat. \u00a7 560.120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1969), had \"as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" In making this determination, we apply the categorical approach, looking \"only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Shockley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175357\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/1058/#p1062\">\n    816 F.3d at 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Section 560.120 prohibited \"feloniously taking the property of another from his person, or in his presence, and against his will, by violence to his person, or by putting him in fear of some immediate injury to his person.\" Thus, robbery could be proved \"in either of two ways,-namely, by\n   <em>\n    violence\n   </em>\n   to the person\n   <em>\n    or by putting\n   </em>\n   him or her\n   <em>\n    in fear\n   </em>\n   of some immediate injury. The State need not prove both.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Curtis Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that, \"in the context of a statutory definition of '\n   <em>\n    violent\n   </em>\n   felony,' the phrase 'physical force' means\n   <em>\n    violent\n   </em>\n   force-that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    559 U.S. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1265/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1265/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Jones argues that section 560.120 did not require this degree of force. In particular, he points out that the Missouri Supreme Court held that section 560.120 required only the degree of force sufficient to overcome a victim's resistance or to detach an article fastened to a victim's clothing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10137356\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/406/608/#p611\">\n    406 S.W.2d 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 611 (Mo. 1966) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Broderick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"935437\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/59/318/#p320\">\n    59 Mo. 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 320-21 (1875). Jones argues that section 560.120 thus does not meet the threshold for violent physical force set forth in\n   <em>\n    Curtis Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   But the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Stokeling v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623291\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/544/\">\n    139 S.Ct. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623291\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/544/\">\n    202 L.Ed.2d 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019), forecloses Jones's argument. The Florida statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   defines robbery as \"the taking of money or other property... from the person or custody of another, ... when in the course of the taking there is the use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623291\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/544/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623291\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/544/\">\n    at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20812.13\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) ). Like the Missouri Supreme Court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10137356\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/406/608/#p611\">\n    406 S.W.2d at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Florida Supreme Court \"made clear that this statute requires 'resistance by the victim that is overcome by the physical force of the offender,' \"\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623291\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/544/\">\n    139 S.Ct. at 554-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12024988\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/692/883/#p886\">\n    692 So.2d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 886 (Fla. 1997) ). In turn, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, consistent with\n   <em>\n    Curtis Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the force clause \"encompasses robbery offenses that require the criminal to overcome the victim's resistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 550.\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   thus dictates that section 560.120 qualifies as a violent felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At oral argument, Jones attempted to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   by pointing to the Supreme Court's observation that \"a defendant who steals a gold chain does not use force, within the meaning of the [Florida] robbery statute, simply because the victim fe[els] his fingers on the back of her neck.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 555 (internal quotation marks omitted and second alteration in original). But we see no reason to believe that the Missouri Supreme Court would have interpreted section 560.120 to criminalize such conduct. As the court explained in\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , a defendant had to overcome the victim's resistance or exercise force in detaching the article taken, not merely snatch an article from the victim's hand.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10137356\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/406/608/#p611\">\n    406 S.W.2d at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For this reason, mere contact of fingers to the neck would have been insufficient to sustain a robbery conviction under section 560.120 because this conduct alone does not overcome the victim's resistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Jones also argues that section 560.120's \"putting him in fear of some immediate injury to his person\" language precludes application of the ACCA. The Florida robbery statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   includes similar \"putting in fear\" language. While the Supreme Court did not specifically address this language, we previously have held that statutes that involve \"knowingly placing another person in fear of imminent bodily harm\" or intentionally \"caus[ing] fear in another of immediate bodily harm or death\" satisfy the force clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Schaffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251371\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/796/#p798\">\n    818 F.3d 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 798 (8th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Salido-Rosas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3850434\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/662/1254/#p1256\">\n    662 F.3d 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1256 (8th Cir. 2011) ). Jones nevertheless argues that section 560.120 differed from these similar statutes because the Missouri Supreme Court required a subjective inquiry that turned on whether or not victims \"were actually put in fear.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hawkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10145536\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/418/921/#p924\">\n    418 S.W.2d at 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because we have explained that \"the knowledge and mental state of the victim ... is not the proper focus for the force clause,\" Jones argues that section 560.120 does not qualify as a violent felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schaffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251371\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/796/#p798\">\n    818 F.3d at 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   But Missouri courts expressly rejected this interpretation and mandated an objective rather than a subjective standard.\n   <em>\n    State v. Vandament\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10178123\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/299/532/#p535\">\n    299 S.W.2d 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535 (Mo. 1957) (\"The fear essential to robbery must be caused by [the] accused, intentionally, and not arise from the mere temperamental timidity of the victim.\");\n   <em>\n    State v. Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775578\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/262/169/\">\n    262 Mo. 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=170%20S.W.%201121\">\n    170 S.W. 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1123 (1914) (\"The fright of him who is robbed must be under the law an objective fright, as contradistinguished from subjective fright ....\");\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 1974). Thus, to the extent that\n   <em>\n    Stokeling\n   </em>\n   left this question open, we conclude that a conviction under section 560.120 that involved putting a victim in fear of immediate injury qualifies as a violent felony because it has as an element the \"threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schaffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251371\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/796/#p798\">\n    818 F.3d at 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Because a conviction under section 560.120 categorically satisfies the force clause, we affirm the district court's order denying Jones's successive \u00a7 2255 motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    The Honorable Dean Whipple, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The ACCA applies to defendants convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm or ammunition who have three or more prior convictions for a \"violent felony\" or a \"serious drug offense.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(1).
