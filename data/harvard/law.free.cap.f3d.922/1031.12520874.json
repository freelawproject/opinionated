Cook's foray into Chapter 11 was by most standards a resounding success. It culminated with the Second Amended Joint Debtors' Plan of Reorganization (\"Amended Plan\"), which paid all creditors in full and provided for Cook to continue as a going concern. The Amended Plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   But now the United States Trustee (\"Trustee\") asks that the Amended Plan go up in smoke, because one of the Cook companies leases property to N.T. Pawloski, LLC (\"Green Haven\"), which uses the property to grow marijuana. The Trustee complains that, even if Green Haven's business complies with Washington law, the lease itself violates federal drug law. The Trustee reasons that this violation proves the Amended Plan was \"proposed ... by ... means forbidden by law\" and is thus unconfirmable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The problem with the Trustee's theory is that it ignores the plain text of \u00a7 1129(a)(3), which directs bankruptcy courts to police the means of a reorganization plan's\n   <em>\n    proposal\n   </em>\n   , not its substantive provisions. Resolution of this appeal rests on a straightforward question of statutory interpretation rather than on any conflict between federal and state drug laws. We affirm confirmation of the Amended Plan because it was not proposed \"by any means forbidden by law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Cook Investments NW, DARR, LLC (\"Cook DARR\"), one of the Cook companies, owns commercial real estate in Darrington, Washington (the \"Darrington Property\"). Cook DARR leased the Darrington Property to two tenants, one of which was Green Haven. The lease with Green Haven (the \"Green Haven Lease\") provides that Green Haven will use the Darrington Property exclusively as a marijuana establishment. Although Green Haven appears to be in compliance with Washington law, the Green Haven Lease puts Cook in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20801\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 971, which prohibits \"knowingly ... leas[ing] ... any place ... for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using any controlled substance,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20801\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 856(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2009, one of the Cook companies defaulted on a loan from Columbia State Bank. The loan was secured by Cook's real estate holdings, including the Darrington Property. The bank won default judgments against Cook in state court. Although Cook and the bank reached forbearance agreements, Cook failed to fulfill the agreements' terms. The bank then obtained state-court orders appointing receivers for Cook's properties. At that point, all of the Cook companies filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions, which the bankruptcy court ordered jointly administered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Trustee filed a motion to dismiss Cook DARR's Chapter 11 case, asserting that the Green Haven Lease constituted gross mismanagement and thus cause to dismiss under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201112\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The bankruptcy court denied the motion to dismiss, but with leave to renew at the plan confirmation hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Cook filed the Amended Plan, which provides for repayment of all creditors' claims in full and for Cook to continue as a going concern. The Amended Plan incorporates\n   by reference an earlier Chapter 11 Plan Agreement between Cook and Columbia State Bank, but in the Amended Plan Cook rejected the Green Haven lease and structured the plan so that his monthly obligations would be paid without revenue from Green Haven. Cook's counsel also explained at argument that, pursuant to the Amended Plan, Cook's other tenants pay their rent directly to Columbia State Bank in satisfaction of its claim, while Green Haven rents were presumably paid directly to Cook.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The bankruptcy court confirmed the Amended Plan, over the Trustee's objection that it violated \u00a7 1129(a)(3)'s requirement that a plan be \"proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law.\" The Trustee was the only objector; Cook's creditors fully supported the Amended Plan, which satisfactorily provided for their repayment. Because the Trustee failed to renew its motion to dismiss at the confirmation hearing, the district court affirmed the denial of the motion to dismiss Cook DARR's case. Following confirmation, the Trustee moved for a stay, but the district court denied the request. As a result, Cook has continued to make payments pursuant to the Amended Plan during the pendency of this appeal. The unsecured creditors have been repaid and the secured creditor, Columbia State Bank, is in the process of being repaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, the Trustee first challenges the bankruptcy court's refusal to dismiss Cook DARR under \u00a7 1112(b) for \"gross mismanagement of the estate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201112\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)(B). We need not decide the merits of this issue because, like the district court, we conclude the Trustee waived the argument by failing to renew its motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The bankruptcy court initially denied the motion to dismiss but explicitly invited the Trustee to renew the motion at the plan confirmation hearing. The Trustee chose, at its peril, not to do so. As the district court put it: \"The Trustee failed to renew the motion or subsequently raise the gross mismanagement argument. Although the Debtors fail to raise waiver, it seems to be plain error for this Court to reverse the bankruptcy court's denial when the Trustee failed to renew its motion.\" This failure was especially significant because it meant the bankruptcy court had no opportunity to consider whether the claimed gross mismanagement had been \"cured.\" As a consequence, neither the bankruptcy court, nor the district court, nor this court could properly determine the applicability of the exception to dismissal for \"unusual circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201112\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) (exception to dismissal for unusual circumstances applies only if,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , cause for dismissal \"will be cured within a reasonable period of time\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walsh v. Nev. Dep't of Human Res.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5251886\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/471/1033/#p1037\">\n    471 F.3d 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1037 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that a claim raised in the complaint was waived when it was not re-raised in response to a motion to dismiss, because \"the district court had no reason to consider the contention that the claim ... could not be dismissed\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We therefore turn to the issue of confirmation. To be confirmed, the Amended Plan had to satisfy \u00a7 1129(a), which provides that \"[t]he court shall confirm a plan only if\" sixteen enumerated requirements are met. The third requirement is that \"[t]he plan has been proposed in good faith\n   and not by any means forbidden by law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). Only the second prong is at issue here. Because it appears that Cook continues to receive rent payments from Green Haven, which provides at least indirect support for the Amended Plan, the Trustee asserts that it was \"proposed ... by ... means forbidden by law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We determine de novo the proper interpretation of \u00a7 1129(a)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tighe v. Celebrity Home Entm't, Inc.

Whether the Amended Plan was confirmable depends on whether \u00a7 1129(a)(3) forbids confirmation of a plan that is proposed in an unlawful manner as opposed to a plan with substantive provisions that depend on illegality, an issue of first impression in the Ninth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Like the First Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, we conclude that \u00a7 1129(a)(3) directs courts to look only to the proposal of a plan, not the terms of the plan.\n   <em>\n    Irving TanningCo. v. Me. Superintendent of Ins.

B.A.P. 2013). This reading accords with both the statutory text, which does not refer to the substance of the plan, and the weight of persuasive authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gen. Dev. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6508948\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/135/1002/#p1007\">\n    135 B.R. 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1007 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 1991) (\"Courts addressing the issue have uniformly held that Section 1129(a)(3) does not require that the contents of a plan comply in all respects with the provisions of all nonbankruptcy laws and regulations.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   It is true that some bankruptcy courts have accepted the Trustee's interpretation. In concluding that a bankruptcy case should be dismissed \"[b]ecause a significant portion of the Debtor's income [wa]s derived from an illegal activity,\" the Bankruptcy Court of Colorado stated that \" \u00a7 1129(a)(3) forecloses any possibility of this Debtor obtaining confirmation of a plan that relies in any part on income derived from a criminal activity.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Rent-Rite Super Kegs W.

Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312991\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/167/#p174\">\n    533 U.S. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312991\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/167/#p174\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312991\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/167/#p174\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) (\"It is our duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A contrary interpretation not only renders the words \"has been proposed\" meaningless, but makes other provisions of \u00a7 1129(a) redundant. For example, \u00a7 1129(a)(1) requires that \"[t]he plan complies with the applicable provisions of this title.\" If \u00a7 1129(a)(3) is read to mean that the plan must comply with all applicable law, there would be no need for a separate requirement that the plan comply with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code specifically.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We do not believe that the interpretation compelled by the text will result in bankruptcy proceedings being used to facilitate legal violations. To begin, absent waiver, as in this case, courts may consider gross mismanagement issues under \u00a7 1112(b). And confirmation of a plan does not insulate debtors from prosecution for criminal activity, even if that activity is part of the plan itself.\n   <em>\n    In re Food City, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6116279\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/110/808/#p812\">\n    110 B.R. 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 812 (Bankr.
