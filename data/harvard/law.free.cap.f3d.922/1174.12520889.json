R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-6\">\n   <strong>\n    Per Curiam\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   This matter is before us on the Motion of the United States for Summary Affirmance. The United States moves for summary affirmance based on this court's recent published decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pullen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519752\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1270/\">\n    913 F.3d 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2019),\n   <em>\n    en banc rev. denied\n   </em>\n   April 15, 2019, and the\n   court's earlier decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Greer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275435\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1241/\">\n    881 F.3d 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2018). While the appellant does not dispute that\n   <em>\n    Greer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pullen\n   </em>\n   control the outcome of this appeal and does not contest summary affirmance of the district court's judgment, he reserves the right to petition the United States Supreme Court for further review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In light of the foregoing, the abatement of proceedings in this appeal is lifted, and the appellee's motion for summary affirmance is granted. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
