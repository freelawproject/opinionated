Human Services investigated this allegation, which it considered a violation of the City's anti-discrimination laws. When the agencies confirmed that, because of their religious views on marriage, they would not work with gay couples, Human Services ceased referring foster children to them. One of those agencies, Catholic Social Services (sometimes abbreviated to \"CSS\"), brought this action claiming that the City has violated its rights under the First Amendment's Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech Clauses, as well as under Pennsylvania's Religious Freedom Protection Act. It seeks an order requiring the City to renew their contractual relationship while permitting it to turn away same-sex couples who wish to be foster parents. CSS sought preliminary injunctive relief to this effect from the District Court. When it denied the request after a three-day hearing,\n   <em>\n    Fulton v. City of Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526229\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/320/661/\">\n    320 F.Supp.3d 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Pa. 2018), CSS appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Our question is not whether the City or CSS has behaved reasonably. Nor is our task to mediate a mutually agreeable compromise between the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is to determine\n   whether the City's actions were lawful. Did it have the authority to insist, consistent with the First Amendment and Pennsylvania law, that CSS not discriminate against same-sex couples as a condition of working with it to provide foster care services? Or, inversely, has CSS demonstrated that the City transgressed fundamental guarantees of religious liberty?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At this stage and on this record, we conclude that CSS is not entitled to a preliminary injunction. The City's nondiscrimination policy is a neutral, generally applicable law, and the religious views of CSS do not entitle it to an exception from that policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Emp't Div. v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4852\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/872/#p877\">\n    494 U.S. 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 877-78,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4852\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/872/#p877\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4852\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/872/#p877\">\n    108 L.Ed.2d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). It has failed to make a persuasive showing that the City targeted it for its religious beliefs, or is motivated by ill will against its religion, rather than sincere opposition to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Thus we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Catholic Social Services is a religious non-profit organization affiliated with the Archdiocese of Philadelphia that provides foster care services in Philadelphia. Created in 1917 as the Catholic Children's Bureau, it is part of a tradition of caring for children in need that stretches back even further, to the yellow fever outbreak of 1797. As an affiliate of the Catholic Church, CSS sees caring for vulnerable children as a core value of the Christian faith and therefore views its foster care work as part of its religious mission and ministry. When the Catholic Children's Bureau was founded, foster care was handled on a private basis, but over the following century that changed. Today that care is comprehensively regulated both by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and by the City of Philadelphia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Commonwealth, the City, and the private foster care agencies each play a role in the Philadelphia foster care system. State regulations set the criteria people or families must meet to become foster parents, as well as the duties of both foster parents and foster care agencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203700.62\">\n    55 Pa. Code \u00a7 3700.62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . Those agencies then develop relationships with individual foster families, which begin when a family approaches an agency seeking to become foster parents. It must evaluate the applicants under the Commonwealth's criteria to determine whether they would be suitable candidates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%206344\">\n    23 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 6344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203700.64\">\n    55 Pa. Code \u00a7 3700.64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One criterion concerns the \"[e]xisting family relationships, attitudes and expectations regarding the applicant's own children and parent/child relationship, especially as they might affect a foster child.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%206344\">\n    23 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 6344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(iv) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203700.64\">\n    55 Pa. Code \u00a7 3700.64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   When a child in need of foster care comes into the City's custody, Human Services refers that child to one of the foster care agencies with which it has a contractual relationship. Once the City refers a child to an agency, that agency selects an appropriate foster parent for the child, although Human Services can oppose a child's placement with a particular foster parent if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At the outset of this litigation, the City of Philadelphia had contracts with 30 foster care agencies, including CSS. These are one-year contracts renewed on an annual basis. Agencies are compensated by the City for their services; CSS's contract provided for a\n   <em>\n    per diem\n   </em>\n   rate for each child\n   placed in one of its affiliated foster homes. This payment did not cover its full expenses, meaning that CSS operated at a loss. The contract required it to certify its foster parents in accord with state regulations, but did not otherwise impose conditions on the certification process. It did, however, include language prohibiting CSS from discriminating due to race, color, religion, or national origin, and it incorporated the City's Fair Practices Ordinance, which in part prohibits sexual orientation discrimination in public accommodations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This last requirement, and the parties' differing understandings of it, led to this controversy. CSS takes the position that it cannot certify a same-sex married couple as foster parents consistent with its religious views. As an affiliate of the Catholic Church, CSS adheres to the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. It is not unwilling to work with LGBTQ individuals as foster parents. However, state regulations require it to consider an applicant's \"existing family relationships\" as part of the certification process. In applying this criterion, CSS will only certify foster parents who are either married or single; it will not certify cohabitating unmarried couples, and it considers all same-sex couples to be unmarried. So far as the record reflects, no same-sex couples have approached CSS seeking to become foster parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On March 9, 2018, a reporter from the\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Inquirer\n   </em>\n   called Human Services and stated that two of the City's foster care agencies, CSS and Bethany Christian Services, would not work with same-sex couples as foster parents. The\n   <em>\n    Inquirer\n   </em>\n   published an article to this effect on March 13, 2018. In response, the Commissioner of Human Services, Cynthia Figueroa, called officials at both CSS and Bethany Christian asking if this report was true. Both organizations confirmed the report. James Amato, the Secretary of CSS, told Commissioner Figueroa that his agency would not certify same-sex couples because it was against the Church's views on marriage and, when told this was discrimination, replied that he was merely following the teachings of the Catholic Church. Commissioner Figueroa then called a number of other foster care agencies asking whether they had similar policies; none did. All but one of the other agencies Figueroa called were religiously affiliated. As for the one secular agency, she testified that she had a \"good relationship\" with its CEO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Amato attended a meeting with Figueroa in an unsuccessful attempt to resolve the impasse. At this meeting, Amato invoked CSS's hundred-year history of providing services to the City. Figueroa responded by noting that times had changed over the course of that relationship, that women and African-Americans did not have the same rights when it started, and that she herself would likely not have been in her position a century earlier. Figueroa, who is Catholic and Jesuit-educated, also remarked to Amato that it would be great if CSS could follow the teachings of Pope Francis. Amato later testified that Figueroa specifically stated that CSS should follow Pope Francis as opposed to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia or its Archbishop Charles J. Chaput; Figueroa denied mentioning anyone other than Pope Francis. Figueroa also indicated to Amato that the matter had the attention of the highest levels of City government, by which she testified she meant herself, her chain of command, and ultimately Mayor James Kenney. She also testified that prior to this meeting she spoke briefly with the Mayor; she told him that she was working to address the issue and would brief him after more decisions had been made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Immediately after his meeting with Figueroa, Amato received a phone call from a representative of Human Services who informed him that it would no longer refer new foster children to CSS, a policy known as an \"intake freeze.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Figueroa testified that she implemented the freeze because of her serious concern that CSS's relationship with Human Services might end in the near future. Given the preference for stability in placing foster care children, she did not want to send any new children to an agency they might well have to leave in a matter of months. This was not the first time Human Services had instituted an intake freeze out of a concern that it might not be able to continue working with a given agency. The freeze nonetheless did not affect children already placed with CSS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Nor did it affect other aspects of CSS's relationship with the City. Family foster care is only one component of Philadelphia's framework for at-risk children. The City also employs private agencies to operate \"congregate care\" facilities, or group homes, for children in state custody who have not been assigned to a foster family for one reason or another. And it partners with \"Community Umbrella Agencies\" that work with children in the community to address problems in their home environment that might prevent them from remaining at home. CSS operates as a congregate care provider and a Community Umbrella Agency, and its services in those capacities were not affected by the intake freeze or any subsequent developments in this dispute pertaining to foster care. Indeed, in each unrelated area it continues working with the City to this day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On several occasions Human Services granted exceptions to the intake freeze where there were particularly strong reasons why CSS would be the best placement for an individual child-for example, if one of that child's siblings had already been placed with a CSS family. It does not appear that any exemption requests were denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Meanwhile, on March 15, 2018, two days after the\n   <em>\n    Inquirer\n   </em>\n   article, the City Council passed a resolution authorizing the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations to \"investigate Department of Human Services' policies on contracting with social services agencies that ... discriminate against prospective LGBTQ foster parents.\" The resolution stated that \"the City of Philadelphia has laws in place to protect its people from discrimination that occurs under the guise of religious freedom,\" and declared that any \"agency which violates City contract rules in addition to the Fair Practices Ordinance should have their contract with the City terminated with all deliberate speed.\" The following day (March 16), lawyers for the Commission wrote to CSS with a battery of questions regarding its policies about working with same-sex couples or LGBTQ individuals. It responded on April 16, 2018, challenging both the legal basis for what it termed the \"City's unlawful suspension\" of its contract and the Commission's jurisdiction over the matter. Centrally, CSS argued that its screening of would-be foster parents was not a public accommodation and hence not subject to the Fair Practices Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Lawyers from the City wrote back separately on the jurisdictional and substantive points on May 7, 2018. As to substance, the City asserted that its contract with CSS had not been formally suspended, and that\n   it did not require any referrals to that agency. Therefore the City could not possibly have breached the contract by suspending referrals. The letter noted several provisions of the contract that, it argued, forbade CSS's policy of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After setting out the City's legal interpretation of the contract, the letter stated its plan going forward:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Please also note that CSS's current contract expires on June 30, 2018, and the City is under no legal obligation to enter into a new contract for any period thereafter. We are hopeful that we can work out any differences before then, but please be advised that-except where the best interests of a child demands otherwise-the City does not plan to agree to any further referrals to CSS, and the City intends to assist with the transition of foster families to other agencies, absent assurances that CSS is prepared to adhere to its contractual obligations and, in implementing its City contract, to comply with all applicable laws, including those related to non-discrimination. We believe our current contract with CSS is quite clear that this is our right, but please be advised that any further contracts with CSS will be explicit in this regard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The letter underscored \"respect [for CSS's] sincere religious beliefs, but your freedom to express them is not at issue here where you have chosen voluntarily to partner with us in providing government-funded, secular social services.\" It stressed the importance of equality as \"both a legal requirement, and an important City policy and value that must be embodied in our contractual relationships.\" In addition, the City reaffirmed that it did not want to see its \"valuable relationship with CSS ... come to an end,\" but instead hoped that CSS would agree to comply going forward with the terms of the Fair Practices Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As to jurisdiction, the City further asserted that foster care is a public accommodation, triggering both the Ordinance's mandate and the Commission's jurisdiction. The City requested a response to the questions in its March 16 letter within 10 days and threatened subpoenas if CSS did not comply. The latter responded by filing this lawsuit, alleging 16 causes of action against the City, Human Services, and the Human Relations Commission. Three individuals who had worked with CSS as foster parents-Sharonell Fulton, Cecilia Paul,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Toni Lynn Simms-Busch-were also listed as plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 5, 2018,\n   plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. Their proposed order would have required the City to \"resume providing foster care referrals to [CSS] and permitting children to be placed with the foster families it has certified without delay,\" to \"rescind its prior directive prohibiting any foster care referrals to [CSS,] ... to resume all dealings with [it] on the same terms as they had proceeded prior to March 2018,\" and also to \"resume and to continue operating under the current Contract, without breach, termination, or expiration, or to enter into a new Contract identical in all material respects to the current Contract, while this matter remains pending.\" Doc. #13-1 to\n   <em>\n    Fulton et al. v.

(As noted below, that contractual arrangement has lapsed in any event.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The District Court promptly held a hearing on plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief. The hearing, which spanned three days, included testimony from plaintiffs Simms-Busch, Paul, and Fulton, as well as from Amato,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Deputy Commissioner of Human Services Kimberly Ali, Commissioner Figueroa, and Frank Cervone, a child advocate who testified as an expert witness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (It was after this hearing that lawyers for the City informed the Court that it had resumed foster care operations with Bethany Christian when the latter agreed to cease discriminating against same-sex couples.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The District Court denied the application for preliminary injunctive relief in a memorandum opinion, and plaintiffs appealed the same day.

City of Newark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11586043\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/359/\">\n    170 F.3d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 1999), we held unconstitutional the Newark Police Department's policy that officers could not have facial hair. The Department had granted exceptions to this policy due to medical need, but would not grant similar exceptions to Sunni Muslims whose religion forbade them to shave their beards.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 360. This was \"sufficiently suggestive of discriminatory intent ... to trigger heightened scrutiny[,]\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 365, which the policy could not survive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Similarly in\n   <em>\n    Tenafly Eruv Association v. Borough of Tenafly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11404389\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/309/144/#p156\">\n    309 F.3d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2002), the Borough of Tenafly had on its books an ordinance prohibiting the affixing of \"any sign or advertisement, or other matter upon,\" among other things, telephone poles.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 151. In practice, this ordinance was almost never enforced, and it was common to see house number signs, lost animal signs, commemorative ribbons, holiday displays, wreaths, and various other fixtures on the town's telephone poles. But when Orthodox Jewish residents sought to erect an\n   <em>\n    eruv\n   </em>\n   by placing\n   <em>\n    lechis\n   </em>\n   on utility poles,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Borough refused to grant them a similar exemption and sought to enforce the ordinance. We held that the Borough thereby violated the Free Exercise Clause. Although the ordinance itself was general and neutral, such that\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   might apply, it had not been enforced evenhandedly. Instead, the Borough had an apparent practice of granting\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   exceptions but refused to make one for the Orthodox Jews' religious practice. This system of discretionary exemptions called for strict scrutiny (meaning they must be justified by a compelling government interest and narrowly tailored to achieve that compelling interest), and the Borough's actions could not survive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   These cases have in common that religiously motivated conduct was treated worse than otherwise similar conduct with secular motives. The ordinance in\n   <em>\n    Lukumi\n   </em>\n   was pretzeled to prohibit only Santeria ritual sacrifices and no other animal killings, even those no more humane or necessary. In\n   <em>\n    Fraternal Order of Police\n   </em>\n   the City of Newark granted exemptions to its facial hair policy for medical reasons but not for religious ones. In\n   <em>\n    Tenafly\n   </em>\n   an ordinance virtually never enforced was exacted exclusively on the religious practice of Orthodox Jews. And in\n   <em>\n    Masterpiece\n   </em>\n   the comments of Commission members, along with the disparate treatment of other bakers' secular claims of conscience, raised suspicion that Phillips had been treated more harshly because the Commission found his religious views offensive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The question in our case, then, is whether CSS was treated differently because of its religious beliefs. Put another way, was the City appropriately neutral, or did it treat CSS worse than it would have treated another organization that did not work with same-sex couples as foster parents but had different religious beliefs? Based on the record before us, that question has a clear answer: no. The City has acted only to enforce its non-discrimination policy in the face of what it considers a clear violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As evidence that the City acted out of religious hostility, CSS first points to the City Council's resolution authorizing the Commission on Human Relations' inquiry, which stated that \"Philadelphia has laws\n   in place to protect its people from discrimination that occurs under the guise of religious freedom.\" But this comment falls into the grey zone identified by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Masterpiece\n   </em>\n   -a remark that could express contempt for religion or could merely state the well-established legal principle that religious belief will not excuse compliance with general civil rights laws. Unlike the commissioner in\n   <em>\n    Masterpiece\n   </em>\n   who suggested that religious justifications for discrimination are merely rhetorical, here City officials repeatedly emphasized that they respected CSS's beliefs as sincere and deeply held. The Commission's May 7, 2018 letter, for instance, stated that \"[w]e respect your sincere religious beliefs, but your freedom to express them is not at issue here where you have chosen voluntarily to partner with us in providing government-funded, secular social services.\" This is the kind of respectful consideration found lacking in\n   <em>\n    Masterpiece\n   </em>\n   , and nowhere in the record did the City depart from this respectful posture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   CSS next points to Commissioner Figueroa's statements during her meeting with Amato that \"it would be great if we could follow the teachings of Pope Francis.\" Taken out of context, some might think this remark improper, as it has clear religious overtones. But context is important: the comment was made during a negotiation attempting to find a mutually agreeable solution to this controversy. In that light, Figueroa's statement is best viewed as an effort to reach common ground with Amato by appealing to an authority within their shared religious tradition. The First Amendment does not prohibit government officials working with religious organizations in this kind of partnership from speaking those organizations' language and making arguments they may find compelling from within their own faith's perspective. And though these attempts to persuade CSS were ultimately unsuccessful, the record does not suggest that the City then sought to punish it for this disagreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   CSS also argues that Commissioner Figueroa's decision to call mostly religious foster care agencies to ask if they had a similar policy is evidence that the City impermissibly targeted religion. But focusing her inquiries on religious agencies made sense: the only agencies Figueroa knew that refused to work with same-sex couples-CSS and Bethany Christian-did so for religious reasons. She had little reason to think that nonreligious agencies might have a similar policy. In fact, no other religious agency besides the two mentioned by the reporter had this policy, and Figueroa did call one secular agency as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, CSS points to several public statements (the most recent of which occurred in 2015) made by Mayor Kenney critical of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and of Archbishop Chaput. No doubt the Mayor expressed concerns toward the local Catholic Church, with a particular focus on the Church's stance on gay rights. But CSS's claim that he \"prompted\" Human Services' 2018 inquiry in this case misstates the record. Figueroa testified that she discussed the issue with the Mayor prior to meeting with Amato and told the Mayor she would brief him once a decision had been made. There is nothing in the record before us suggesting that he played a direct role, or even a significant role, in the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The evidence CSS offers of religious bias or hostility appears significantly less than what was present in\n   <em>\n    Lukumi\n   </em>\n   or even in\n   <em>\n    Masterpiece\n   </em>\n   . Nor is there much to suggest that the City treated CSS differently because of its religion. It argues that it has been subject to selective enforcement, akin\n   to that in\n   <em>\n    Tenafly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fraternal Order of Police\n   </em>\n   , because the City adopted what CSS sees as novel legal arguments invented during this controversy to justify its actions against CSS. First, it claims that the City had never previously taken the position that the Fair Practices Ordinance applies to the screening of foster parents. But nothing before us suggests that the City took this position disingenuously or as a pretext for persecuting CSS. Its interpretation of the Ordinance, with which the District Court agreed, was hardly frivolous. Nor is it suspicious that the City had never previously taken this position: the record contains no evidence of any foster care agencies discriminating in ways that would violate the Fair Practices Ordinance prior to this controversy. The issue simply seems not to have come up previously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Second, CSS argues that the City created what CSS calls a \"must-certify policy\" as a justification for the actions against it. The City's position, according to CSS, is that foster agencies must at least evaluate any applicants who come to them seeking to become foster parents rather than referring them to a different agency-although agencies would retain their discretion whether to certify an applicant as fit after evaluation. CSS perceives that the City would object to any referral, and it argues that this was a novel position adopted during this controversy. Amato testified that referrals from one agency to another are a routine way of finding the best fit for a given applicant. But the record here is unclear, both as to the City's current position and as to its policy prior to this case. The former is not necessarily an objection to any referrals at all so much as an objection to referrals made for an improper basis,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the referring agency refuses to work with members of a protected class. As to the latter, the referrals Amato described may have only involved an agency suggesting that a family might prefer a different agency rather than refusing to work with a particular applicant outright. It would be consistent for the City to insist that, while agencies are free to inform applicants if they believe a different agency would be a better fit, they must leave the ultimate decision up to the applicants. In any case, this dispute does not indicate improper religious hostility on the City's part, only a routine regulatory disagreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Third, CSS argues that the City has acted inconsistently because Human Services will consider factors such as race or disability when placing foster children with foster parents. But there are many differences between CSS's behavior and the City's consideration of race or disability when placing a foster child. Most significantly, unlike CSS, Human Services never refuses to work with individuals because of their membership in a protected class. Instead it seeks to find the best fit for each child, taking the whole of that child's life and circumstances into account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   And there is no instance in the record of Human Services knowingly permitting any other foster agency to discriminate against members of a protected class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In sum, at the preliminary injunction stage CSS shows insufficient evidence that the City violated the Free Exercise Clause. The Fair Practices Ordinance has not been gerrymandered as in\n   <em>\n    Lukumi\n   </em>\n   , and there is no history of ignoring widespread secular violations as in\n   <em>\n    Tenafly\n   </em>\n   or\n   the kind of animosity against religion found in\n   <em>\n    Masterpiece\n   </em>\n   . Here the City has been working with CSS for many decades fully aware of its religious character. It continues to work with CSS as a congregate care provider and as a Community Umbrella Agency even to this day despite CSS's religious views regarding marriage. And the City has expressed a constant desire to renew its relationship with CSS as a foster care agency if it will comply with the City's non-discrimination policies protecting same-sex couples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   CSS sees the City's non-discrimination policy as a pretext to exclude it from public life because of its religious character, and invokes\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia v. Comer\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605129\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2012/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 2012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605129\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2012/\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), in which the Supreme Court held unconstitutional rules excluding religious organizations from a public grant program. CSS's counsel at oral argument described the proposed contract language expressly forbidding discrimination on the basis of orientation as a \"poison pill.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. at 61. CSS likewise states in its brief that \"[t]he City thus proposes to change its foster care contract specifically to prohibit [CSS's] religious exercise.\" Appellant's Reply Br. at 3. But it can point to no specific evidence demonstrating that the City acted other than out of a sincere commitment to equality and non-discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   CSS's theme devolves to this: the City is targeting CSS because it discriminates against same-sex couples; CSS is discriminating against same-sex couples because of its religious beliefs; therefore the City is targeting CSS for its religious beliefs. But this syllogism is as flawed as it is dangerous. It runs directly counter to the premise of\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   that, while religious belief is always protected, religiously motivated conduct enjoys no special protections or exemption from general, neutrally applied legal requirements. That CSS's conduct springs from sincerely held and strongly felt religious beliefs does not imply that the City's desire to regulate that conduct springs from antipathy to those beliefs. If all comment on religiously motivated conduct by those enforcing neutral, generally applicable laws against discrimination is construed as ill will against the religious belief itself, then\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   is a dead letter, and the nation's civil rights laws might be as well. As the Intervenors rightly state, the \"fact that CSS's non-compliance with the City's non-discrimination requirements is based on its religious beliefs does not mean that the City's enforcement of its requirements constitutes anti-religious hostility.\" Intervenor's Br. at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   We thus believe the District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that CSS has failed to demonstrate a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits of its Free Exercise Clause claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Establishment Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   CSS argues that the City's actions violated not only the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause but also its Establishment Clause. \"The clearest command of the ... [Establishment] Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another.\"\n   <em>\n    Larson v. Valente\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185638\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/228/#p244\">\n    456 U.S. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 244,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185638\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/228/#p244\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185638\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/228/#p244\">\n    72 L.Ed.2d 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982). In this case, the two Religion Clauses largely run together: insofar as CSS alleges that it has been blacklisted for its religious beliefs, it is alleging both a Free Exercise violation (persecution for its religious views) and an Establishment Clause violation (the City declaring some religious viewpoints favored and others disfavored).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Insofar as the Establishment claim here is analytically independent of the Free Exercise claim, CSS contends the City has dictated its preferred religious viewpoint-that\n   religious institutions should recognize the marriage of same-sex couples-and has conditioned CSS's future contract on adherence to that perspective.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lee v. Weisman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480868\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/577/#p588\">\n    505 U.S. 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 588,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480868\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/577/#p588\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480868\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/577/#p588\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) (prayer at public high school graduation violated the First Amendment, in part because the government not only chose the clergyman but imposed guidelines on the composition of his prayer). To support this claim it focuses primarily on Commissioner Figueroa's statement in her meeting with Amato that \"it would be great if we could follow the teachings of Pope Francis.\" CSS sees this as the City telling it which religious leaders to follow and how to interpret their teachings, and then \"punishing\" it when it refused to comply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br. at 38-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   If the City truly were punishing CSS for refusing to adopt its preferred view of Catholic teaching, no doubt that would be an impermissible establishment of religion. But that is not what happened here. Human Services still works with CSS as a congregate care provider and a Community Umbrella Agency. It still works with Bethany Christian as a foster care agency, even though Bethany also maintains its religious opposition to same-sex marriage. This supports the view that CSS is not being excluded due to its religious beliefs. Indeed, the City has maintained its other relationships with CSS and has merely insisted that, if CSS wants to continue providing foster care, it must abide by the City's non-discrimination policy in doing so. There is simply no evidence that this is a veiled attempt to coerce or impose certain religious beliefs on CSS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The District Court thus did not abuse its discretion in finding that CSS has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its Establishment Clause claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Freedom of Speech\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In addition to its claims under the First Amendment's Religion Clauses, CSS also claims that the City has violated its freedom-of-speech rights in two different ways: by compelling it to speak in ways it finds disagreeable and by retaliating against it for engaging in protected speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    i. Compelled Speech\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   For over 70 years it has been axiomatic that the Free Speech Clause also protects the right not to speak.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W.

CSS claims it has been compelled to speak because Pennsylvania law imposes a requirement that, after evaluating prospective foster parents, an agency must \"give written notice to foster families of its decision to approve, disapprove or provisionally approve the foster family.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203700.69\">\n    55 Pa.

But the rule that no funds could be used by any organization \"\n   <em>\n    that does not have a policy\n   </em>\n   explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 7631(f) (emphasis added), unconstitutionally compelled speech.

It contends that the speech in question is beyond the scope of its contract with the City because the requirement of performing evaluations comes from state law rather than from the contract itself, and because the compensation formula in the contract is not tied to the number of evaluations performed. We disagree. The speech here only occurs because CSS has chosen to partner with the government to help provide what is essentially a public service. The exact allocation of responsibility between the Commonwealth and the City, or the funding structure in the contract, does not change that. Neither\n   <em>\n    Rust\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    AOSI\n   </em>\n   , nor any other relevant precedent, focused on the precise funding structure of the government contracts at issue. Instead, the cases focus on whether the condition pertains to the program receiving government money, as the City's non-discrimination requirements do here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The City would violate\n   <em>\n    AOSI\n   </em>\n   if it refused to contract with CSS unless it officially proclaimed its support for same-sex marriage. But to the contrary, the City is willing to work with organizations that do not approve of gay marriage, as its continued relationship with Bethany Christian, its continued relationship with CSS in its other capacities, and its willingness to resume working with CSS as a foster care agency attest. It simply insists that CSS abide by public rules of nondiscrimination in the performance of its public function under any foster-care contract. Therefore CSS's compelled speech claim does not at this time have a reasonable likelihood of success, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in so holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Speech Retaliation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   To prevail on a speech retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show that it engaged in constitutionally protected activity, that the government responded with retaliation, and that the protected activity caused the retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eichenlaub v.

This rule is a straightforward application of the First Amendment's basic command that the government may\n   not punish those who utter protected speech. Where the plaintiff is a government employee, additional considerations come into play, and the plaintiff's speech is only protected if it occurred in his or her capacity as a citizen rather than as a public employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcetti v.

The speech retaliation doctrine is implicated where the government has taken some action against an individual ostensibly unrelated to that individual's protected speech yet motivated by a desire to retaliate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Eichenlaub\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319318\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/274/#p282\">\n    385 F.3d at 282-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (approving retaliation claim alleging that the Township denied building permit applications to punish a landowner's speech at a public meeting). Here, on the contrary, the City has directly regulated the very conduct CSS claims is constitutionally protected: its refusal to evaluate or work with same-sex couples. Thus the City has \"retaliated\" against CSS only in the same way enforcement of any government regulation \"retaliates\" against those who violate it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Insofar as CSS claims it was subject to retaliation for its statements to the\n   <em>\n    Inquirer\n   </em>\n   and to Human Services confirming that it engages in the discriminatory conduct to which the City objects, this too cannot support a valid retaliation claim. We do not read the City's actions as punishing CSS for those statements rather than for the discriminatory conduct itself. Once again, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that CSS has failed to establish a reasonable likelihood of success on its speech retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Pennsylvania Religious Freedom Protection Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   CSS's final claim is under the Pennsylvania Religious Freedom Protection Act (RFPA), 71 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2401\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . Similar in some ways to the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., the RFPA generally provides that \"an agency shall not substantially burden a person's free exercise of religion, including any burden which results from a rule of general applicability.\" It may do so, however, if it proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the burden both is \"(1) [i]n furtherance of a compelling interest of the agency\" and is \"(2) [t]he least restrictive means of furthering the compelling interest.\" 71 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2404. \"Substantially burden\" is defined as an action that does any of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   (1) Significantly constrains or inhibits conduct or expression mandated by a person's sincerely held religious beliefs[;]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   (2) Significantly curtails a person's ability to express adherence to the person's religious faith[;]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (3) Denies a person a reasonable opportunity to engage in activities which are fundamental to the person's religion[;]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (4) Compels conduct or expression which violates a specific tenet of a person's religious faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 2403. CSS argues that all four forms of substantial burden exist here. Its argument as to each prong ultimately rests on this: CSS's foster care work is part of its\n   religious ministry, its religious convictions prevent it from \"endorsing\" same-sex marriage, and under the City's policies it may not engage in its foster care ministry while abiding by its convictions. Thus, CSS must choose either endorsing a viewpoint that violates the tenets of its faith or ceasing its religious ministry of providing foster care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Pennsylvania courts applying the RFPA scrutinize claims of religious burden to see whether the burdened activity is truly \"fundamental to the person's religion.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Parente\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210105\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/956/1065/#p1074\">\n    956 A.2d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1074 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2008) (\"Parente never testified that his activities ... constitute 'activities which are fundamental to his religion' .... Rather, at best, Parente's testimony merely establishes that he engaged in these activities based upon his religious beliefs or that they flowed from a religious mission.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ridley Park United Methodist Church v.

Commw. Ct. 2007), for instance, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court held that a church was not entitled to a RFPA exemption from a local zoning code in order to operate a daycare center on its property. While the daycare center \"aided in carrying out the Church's religious mission,\" it was not a \"fundamental religious activity of a church.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 960. By analogy, \"ministering to the sick can flow from a religious mission, but it is not a fundamental religious activity of a church because a hospital may be built to satisfy that mission.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Thus it appears that Pennsylvania courts consider an activity \"fundamental to a person's religion\" if it is an inherently religious activity as opposed to something that could be done either by a religious person or group or by a secular one. The parallel here is direct: caring for vulnerable children can flow from a religious mission, but it is not an intrinsically religious activity under Pennsylvania law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   It thus seems unlikely that the Pennsylvania courts would recognize a substantial burden on CSS's exercise of religion in this case. We have noted before, however, that this facet of RFPA jurisprudence \"appears to create some tension between state and federal law,\" as the \"Supreme Court has cautioned against making religious interpretations in the First Amendment context.\"\n   <em>\n    Combs v.

First, it asserts that evaluating potential foster parents is not a public accommodation. Second, it calls the harm the City seeks to prevent speculative, citing\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334708,12450503\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/786/\">\n    564 U.S. 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799-800,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334708,12450503\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/786/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334708,12450503\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/786/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), for the principle that \"ambiguous proof\" of speculative harms will not suffice to provide a compelling interest. Finally, it argues that the City cannot have a compelling interest in preventing it from discriminating because doing so will not increase the number of foster agencies willing to work with same-sex couples: either the City allows CSS to continue discriminating, in which case there are 29 agencies willing to work with those applicants, or it ceases operation altogether, in which case there will still be 29 agencies willing to work with those applicants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   These arguments miss the mark entirely. The government's interest lies not in maximizing the number of establishments that do not discriminate against a protected class, but in minimizing-to zero-the number of establishments that do. And that interest is by no means limited to public accommodations as defined by the Fair Practices Ordinance. Thus, even if we were to assume that evaluating potential foster parents is not a public accommodation, the City would still have a compelling interest in adding a nondiscrimination provision to future contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Nor is the harm the City seeks to prevent speculative.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   held that a law restricting violent video games, on the theory that they would make children become more violent, could not be sustained, in part due to the lack of sound empirical support for this theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334708,12450503\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/786/\">\n    564 U.S. at 800-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334708,12450503\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/786/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This has no application here, where the mere existence of CSS's discriminatory policy is enough to offend the City's compelling interest in anti-discrimination. CSS notes that no same-sex couples have ever-so far as the record reflects-approached it seeking to become foster parents. This is not surprising given the Philadelphia Archdiocese's well-known opposition to gay marriage. But this is beside the point. The harm is not merely that \"gay foster parents will be discouraged from fostering.\" Appellant's Br. at 63. It is the discrimination itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   So even if CSS could show a substantial burden on its religious exercise as defined by the RFPA, the City's actions appear to survive strict scrutiny. Thus the District\n   Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that CSS has not established a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of its RFPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Other Preliminary Injunction Considerations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   We conclude, as the District Court did, that at the preliminary injunction stage and on the record before us, CSS is not reasonably likely to succeed on the merits of any of its claims. This alone defeats the request for a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276310\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/173/#p176\">\n    858 F.3d at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In any event, we also agree with the District Court that CSS has not met the other factors considered for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   To prevail, CSS must show not only a reasonable likelihood of success but also that it is more likely than not to suffer irreparable harm without an injunction. It identified several alleged irreparable harms before the District Court, but on appeal it wisely focuses on the prospect that, without a contract from the City, it will go out of business. Arguably even this would be compensable through money damages.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Lehigh Valley Cmty. Mental Health Ctrs., Inc. v. Pa.

Pa. 2015) (finding that the threat of going out of business did not qualify as an irreparable injury). In any case, CSS has not met its burden of demonstrating that it is more likely than not to suffer this injury. Its congregate care and Community Umbrella Agency functions are unaffected, it has other foster care contracts with neighboring counties, and even as to its foster care services in Philadelphia CSS cites only to Amato's self-professed \"guess\" that it would have to cease those operations within months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Even if CSS could establish both of the gatekeeping factors-likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm-neither the balance of the equities nor the public interest would favor issuing an injunction here. The District Court set out at length the City's interests in requiring CSS to abide by its nondiscrimination policy,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fulton v. City of Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526229\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/320/661/\">\n    320 F.Supp.3d at 703-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we agree that the City's interests weigh substantially in its favor-particularly in ensuring that government services are open to all Philadelphians. Placing vulnerable children with foster families is without question a vital public service, no doubt why there are 29 other foster care agencies, including Bethany Christian, that provide this service. Deterring discrimination in that effort is a paramount public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The City stands on firm ground in requiring its contractors to abide by its non-discrimination policies when administering public services. Under\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the First Amendment does not prohibit government regulation of religiously motivated conduct so long as that regulation is not a veiled attempt to suppress disfavored religious beliefs. And while CSS may assert that the City's actions were not driven by a sincere commitment to equality but rather by antireligious and anti-Catholic bias (and is of course able to introduce additional evidence as this case proceeds), the current record does not show religious persecution or bias. Instead it shows so far the City's good faith in its effort to enforce its laws against discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Hence we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for preliminary injunctive relief and affirm its thorough and well-reasoned decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    That being said, District Judge Tucker commented that she \"would prefer that the [p]arties seek ... some compromise to their current dispute without court intervention.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 667.

The City took issue with this policy, arguing that it violated both CSS's contract with the City and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the federal Constitution.

The City, meanwhile, disclaims the policy's existence, and says that it was solely enforcing its longstanding rules against discrimination. But as noted above, because the existing contract between CSS and the City has expired, we need not address whether any \"must-certify\" policy was a sufficiently neutral, general rule to support the City's actions.

Pena\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564297\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/200/\">\n     515 U.S. 200\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564297\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/200/\">\n     115 S.Ct. 2097\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564297\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/200/\">\n     132 L.Ed.2d 158\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1995). But the injunctions in those cases merely forbade government entities from enforcing their express affirmative action policies going forward.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    . at 210,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564297\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/200/\">\n     115 S.Ct. 2097\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . We have some doubt, therefore, that CSS could be entitled to the relief it seeks. We do not rest our decision on that ground, however, as it involves novel and complex questions of remedies law, and instead address the merits of CSS's claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    Unlike\n    <em>\n     Lukumi\n    </em>\n    , where the impermissible hostility toward Santeria was apparent during the adoption of the animal sacrifice ordinance, in\n    <em>\n     Masterpiece\n    </em>\n    it came out in the conduct of the officials charged with executing the law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    An\n    <em>\n     eruv\n    </em>\n    is a ceremonially created space outside of the home wherein Orthodox Jews may engage in the otherwise proscribed activities of pushing and carrying objects on the Sabbath.
