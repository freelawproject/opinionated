The district court granted summary judgement to Violent Hues, ruling\n   that this unauthorized display constituted \"fair use\" under the Copyright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20107\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Brammer licenses his work as stock imagery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 19, 2011, Brammer shot the photograph \"Adams Morgan at Night\" (\"Photo\") from a rooftop in Washington, D.C. The color-saturated Photo depicts a busy street during the evening in the Adams Morgan neighborhood, with the vehicle traffic rendered as red and white light trails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appendix A. After processing the Photo, Brammer published a digital copy on his own website. Brammer also uploaded the Photo to the image-sharing website Flickr, including the phrase \"\u00a9 All rights reserved\" beneath it. Appendix A. In the past, Brammer has sold physical prints of the Photo - for $ 200 to $ 300 - and licensed it for online use twice - once for $ 1,250, and once for $ 750.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2016, Fernando Mico, the owner of the Violent Hues film production company, posted the Photo on novafilmfest.com, a website belonging to the company. That website promoted the Northern Virginia International Film and Music Festival, a revenue-generating event. The website contained a page titled \"Plan Your Visit,\" which highlighted various tourism attractions around the Washington metropolitan area. Mico posted a cropped version of Brammer's Photo above the caption \"Adams Morgan, DC,\" without any attribution or other commentary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appendix B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mico believes that he found the Photo \"through a Google Images search, which led [him] to the website Flickr.\" Mico maintains that he did not see any \"indication on the Photo itself or the Flickr website that the Photo was copyrighted,\" and so believed it to be publicly available. After downloading the Photo, Mico cropped out the Photo's negative space \"for stylistic reasons\" before putting it on novafilmfest.com.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Brammer discovered this unauthorized use, his counsel sent a letter to Violent Hues requesting compensation for the use. In response, Violent Hues removed the Photo from its website, but did not compensate Brammer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Brammer then initiated this copyright infringement action against Violent Hues, seeking damages and attorney's fees. In response, Violent Hues asserted an affirmative \"fair use\" defense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20107\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion. Brammer now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The sole issue before us is whether Violent Hues made fair use of Brammer's Photo. The fair use defense presents a mixed question of law and fact, requiring us to \"review the district court's legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.\"\n   <em>\n    Bouchat v.

By way of illustration, courts have typically found contextual\n   changes sufficiently transformative in two recurring situations: technological uses and documentary uses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the first category, copyrighted works provide raw material for new technological functions. These functions are indifferent to the expressive aspects of the copied works. For example, we have held transformative the total reproduction of student essays for a plagiarism detection service because the database served an \"entirely different function\" that was unrelated to the expressive content of those essays.\n   <em>\n    A.V. ex rel.

These representations often have scholarly, biographical, or journalistic value, and are frequently accompanied by commentary on the copyrighted work itself.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bill Graham Archives v.

For Mico did not explain why this belief was reasonable given that all contemporary photographs are presumptively under copyright,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20302\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and given his own acknowledgment that he downloaded the Photo from Flickr, which stated \"\u00a9 All rights reserved\" in the Photo caption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We thus conclude that Violent Hues' claim of good faith does nothing to aid its fair use defense.

He alleges that he set up at a \"private, rooftop location\" and \"experimented with numerous shutter speed and aperture combinations.\" The resulting Photo is a stylized image, with vivid colors and a bird's-eye view. Notably, the vehicle traffic appears as streaks of light. The Photo's subject may be a real-world location, but that location does not, in reality, appear as shown.

A \"common sense\" presumption of cognizable market harm exists when a commercial use is not transformative but instead \"amounts to mere duplication of the entirety of an original.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"234489\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/569/#p575\">\n    510 U.S. at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"234489\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/569/#p575\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   That presumption applies here. Violent Hues made commercial use of the Photo and duplicated the heart of the work by copying the Photo's most expressive features. Brammer thus need not demonstrate that the licensing market for his Photo would be depressed should Violent Hues' behavior become widespread. Even so, Brammer introduced evidence showing that he has, on two occasions, licensed this specific Photo for online use. In one instance, a real estate company paid Brammer a $ 1,250 fee to use the Photo as a stock image to represent Adams Morgan on its website - a similar use to that of Violent Hues. If the real estate company had acted as Violent Hues did, Brammer would not have received that fee. Indeed, if Violent Hues' behavior became common and acceptable, the licensing market for Brammer's work specifically, and professional photography more broadly, might well be dampened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Violent Hues asks that we affirm the district court's conclusion that Brammer did not show market harm because he made two sales of the Photo after Violent Hues' use began. That cannot be correct. If the mere fact of subsequent sales served to defeat a claim of market harm, then\n   commercially successful works could hardly ever satisfy this factor. Like the others, the fourth factor weighs against fair use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   After examining the four factors, we conclude that none weighs in favor of Violent Hues. Considering these factors together, it is clear that the copying here fails the \"ultimate test\" of fair use: Violent Hues' online display of Brammer's Photo does not serve the interest of copyright law.\n   <em>\n    Cariou\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869659\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/694/#p705\">\n    714 F.3d at 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \"[C]opyright law embodies a recognition that creative intellectual activity is vital to the well-being of society,\" and fair use exists to \"stimulate creativity and authorship\" of derivative but new works.

Violent Hues' \"informational\" use of the Photo as a stock image does not further this intellectual objective because Violent Hues said nothing new through this use. Instead, allowance of Violent Hues' defense would frustrate copyright's central goal. If the ordinary commercial use of stock photography constituted fair use, professional photographers would have little financial incentive to produce their work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   We reach our conclusion with the recognition that the Internet has made copying as easy as a few clicks of a button and that much of this copying serves copyright's objectives. Many social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are specifically designed for the participatory \"sharing\" - or copying - of content. We express no opinion as to whether such sharing constitutes fair use. We note, however, that Violent Hues' use is not of this kind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Violent Hues did not comment on the Photo, promote the Photo, \"remix\" the Photo, or otherwise engage with the Photo in a way that might stimulate new insights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H. Brian Holland,\n   <em>\n    Social Semiotics in the Fair Use Analysis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20Harv.%20J.L.%20%26%20Tech.%20335\">\n    24 Harv.

What Violent Hues did was publish a tourism guide for a commercial event and include the Photo to make the end product more visually interesting. Such a use would not constitute fair use when done in print, and it does not constitute fair use on the Internet. Violent Hues' affirmative defense thus fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    APPENDICES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Appendix A\n   Appendix B\n   --------\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Stock images are \"photographs that are fungible in terms of their use in contexts such as magazines, websites, or brochures\" and are typically licensed for illustrative or aesthetic purposes.
