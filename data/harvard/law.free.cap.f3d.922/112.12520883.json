In this case, we must determine what happens when those laws conflict with the off-reservation commercial activities of Indian tribes. In so doing, we probe the boundaries of tribal sovereign immunity and hold that, notwithstanding tribal sovereign immunity, federal courts may entertain suits against tribal officers in their official capacities seeking prospective, injunctive relief prohibiting off-reservation conduct that violates state and substantive federal law. We also consider the specific lending agreements between these Plaintiffs and these Defendants and hold that the agreements' arbitration clauses are unenforceable and unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Payday loans are ostensibly short-term cash advances for people who face unexpected obligations or emergencies. The loans are typically for small sums that are to be repaid quickly-in anywhere from several weeks to a year. \"Typically, online lenders charge fees and interest that, when annualized, result in interest rates far in excess of legal limits or typical borrowing rates, often exceeding 300%, 500%, or even 1,000%.\" Vermont Attorney General's Office,\n   <em>\n    Illegal Lending: Facts and Figures\n   </em>\n   , at 1 (Apr. 2014). Many states endeavored to curb such lending practices through usury laws that set caps on interest rates. For example, Vermont laws prescribe a maximum interest rate of 24% per annum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 9, \u00a7 41a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This suit involves payday loans made by Plain Green, LLC, an online lending operation, which holds itself out as a ''tribal lending entity wholly owned by the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation, Montana.\" J. App. 150. The borrowers are Plaintiffs-Appellees Jessica Gingras and Angela Given, who are Vermont residents. In July 2011, Gingras\n   borrowed $1,050 at an interest rate of 198.17% per annum. She repaid that loan and borrowed an additional $2,900 a year later, this time with an interest rate of 371.82%. She has not repaid the second loan. Also in July 2011, Given borrowed $1,250 at a rate of 198.45%. Given paid off that loan in July 2012 and, within a few days of repayment, took out another loan for $2,000 at a rate of 159.46%. She also borrowed $250 in May 2013 at a rate of 376.13%, which she repaid quickly, and in July 2013 borrowed $3,000 at a rate of 59.83%. Given has not repaid the most recent loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To receive their loans, Gingras and Given were required to sign loan agreements. Those loan agreements provide for arbitration in the event of a dispute between the borrower and Plain Green. One such provision is a delegation clause whereby the parties agree that \"any Dispute ... will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with Chippewa Cree tribal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   114-15. The agreement defines a \"Dispute\" as \"any controversy or claim between\" the borrower and the lender, \"based on a tribal, federal or state constitution, statute, ordinance, regulation, or common law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   115. \"Dispute\" includes \"any issue concerning the validity, enforceability, or scope\" of the loan agreement itself or the arbitration provision specifically.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A separate provision of the agreement vests authority to decide the validity of a class action lawsuit waiver and class-wide arbitration waivers in Chippewa Cree tribal court, not in an arbitrator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   265.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The loan agreements also provide that Chippewa Cree tribal law governs the loan agreement and any dispute arising under it. An arbitrator, whom the borrower may select from the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") or JAMS, \"shall apply Tribal Law\" and any arbitral award must \"be supported by substantial evidence and must be consistent with [the loan agreement] and Tribal Law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Chippewa Cree tribal courts are empowered to set aside the arbitrator's award if it does not comply with tribal law.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The agreements' command to apply tribal law also includes provisions stating \"[n]either this Agreement nor the Lender is subject to the laws of any state of the United States,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   263, and the agreements are \"subject solely to the exclusive laws and jurisdiction of the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation\" such that \"no other state or federal law or regulation shall apply,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   258. To the extent that AAA or JAMS policies and procedures conflict with tribal law, tribal law prevails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The loan agreements allow borrowers to opt out of arbitration, but only if they exercise that option within sixty days of receiving the loan. If a borrower opts out, the agreements provide that their only recourse is to sue under tribal law in tribal courts. Neither Gingras nor Given opted out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Gingras and Given allege that the loan agreements violate Vermont and federal law. The loans originated from Plain Green, LLC. Plain Green's Chief Executive Officer is Defendant Joel Rosette; two members of Plain Green's Board of Directors, Ted Whitford and Tim McInerney, are also defendants. Gingras and Given sued all three, whom we refer to as the Tribal Defendants, in their official capacities for prospective declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The suit also names as defendants Think Finance, Inc. and its former President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board, Kenneth Rees. Plain Green employs Think Finance and its subsidiaries,\n   Defendants TC Decision Sciences, LLC, Tailwind Marketing, LLC, and TC Loan Service, LLC, to service Plain Green loans. Defendants Sequoia Capital Operations, LLC and Technology Crossover Ventures provide funding for the lending operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Think Finance and the Tribe agreed on various terms for the loans, including charging annual interest rates between 60% and 360% and establishing a maximum loan amount of $2,500. They allege that this arrangement was created to \"circumvent\" the \"stringent laws [that] have been enacted to prescribe how loans can be made and to prevent lenders from preying on indigent people,\" and to \"take advantage of legal doctrines, such as tribal immunity, to avoid liability for their actions\" in violating various federal and state lending laws.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Gingras and Given brought this class action in the District of Vermont, seeking, among other relief, an order barring Defendants from continuing their current lending practices. Relevant to this appeal, the Tribal Defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that they are entitled to tribal sovereign immunity. The district court disagreed and denied their motion. It concluded that tribal sovereign immunity does not bar suit against the Tribal Defendants in their official capacities for prospective, injunctive relief under a theory analogous to\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    209 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    28 S.Ct. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    52 L.Ed. 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1908). Specifically, the district court read the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/782/\">\n    572 U.S. 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007,7343111\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2024/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/782/\">\n    188 L.Ed.2d 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), to condone that form of action to vindicate violations of state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gingras v. Rosette\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-cv-101,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202932163\">\n    2016 WL 2932163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-7 (D. Vt. May 18, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   All Defendants also moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the loan agreements. The district court denied those motions. It concluded that the arbitration agreements are unconscionable and unenforceable because they insulate Defendants from claims that they have violated state and federal laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *13-18. In particular, it held that because the agreements apply tribal law exclusively and restrict all arbitral awards review solely by a tribal court, the neutral arbitral forum is illusory. All Defendants timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We first ensure that we have appellate jurisdiction of this interlocutory appeal. The district court denied two types of motions relevant to this appeal: motions to compel arbitration and motions to dismiss. Appellate jurisdiction over the motions to compel arbitration is easy enough-we exercise appellate jurisdiction under the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As for the portion of the Tribal Defendants' motion to dismiss based on the denial of tribal sovereign immunity, we have jurisdiction over that appeal, too. Interlocutory review under the collateral order doctrine is available when an order \"conclusively determine[s] the disputed question, resolve[s] an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and [is] effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181447\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/463/#p468\">\n    437 U.S. 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 468,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181447\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/463/#p468\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181447\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/463/#p468\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). As is the case here, denials of tribal sovereign immunity at the motion to dismiss stage conclusively determine the immunity question, and that question is one completely separate from the merits of the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Vaughn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3331195,7346236\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/1085/\">\n    509 F.3d 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1090 (9th Cir. 2007). Like Eleventh Amendment immunity,\n   foreign sovereign immunity, and qualified immunity, tribal sovereign immunity is immunity from suit, not merely immunity from liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v.

But this case does not. There is a minimal intrusion on sovereignty if federal courts are available as forums for enforcing violations of a state's law against tribal officials because tribes cannot empower their officials to violate state law the way a state can interpret\n   its own laws to permit a state official's challenged conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mescalero Apache\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10182\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/145/#p148\">\n    411 U.S. at 148-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10182\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/145/#p148\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Put differently, concerns of sovereignty oblige the federal courts not to instruct a state official how to conform her conduct to her own state law and not to instruct a tribal official how to conform his conduct to his own tribal law. There are no concomitant sovereignty concerns, however, that prevent the federal courts from instructing a tribal official how to conform that official's conduct to either state or federal law. The\n   <em>\n    Bay Mills\n   </em>\n   Court's recognition that tribal officials may be sued for violations of state law thus stands in harmony with\n   <em>\n    Pennhurst\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The majority in\n   <em>\n    Bay Mills\n   </em>\n   acknowledged that its holding was anything but novel.

Absent this mechanism for a state to enforce its laws against out-of-state tribal officials, the state and its citizens would seemingly be without recourse. Tribes and their officials would be free, in conducting affairs outside of reserved lands, to violate state laws with impunity. Given the unique geographic and political position of Indian tribes, allowing such conduct by tribes is especially fraught. The Constitution vests original jurisdiction in the Supreme Court for states to sue other states (a relinquishment of sovereignty originating from the Constitutional Convention, in which, regrettably, Indian tribes were not allowed to participate),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, but it provides no parallel avenue for disputes between states and tribes. An\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   -type suit protects a state's important interest in enforcing its own laws and the federal government's strong interest in providing a neutral forum for the peaceful resolution of disputes between domestic sovereigns, and it fairly holds Indian tribes acting off-reservation to their obligation to comply with generally applicable state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Apart from arguing that the\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   -like theory is unavailable for violations of state law, the Tribal Defendants also take issue with the application of\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   for alleged violations of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   We hold that Plaintiffs' RICO claims may proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As the Tribal Defendants acknowledge,\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   suits are available for alleged violations of federal law. We have said, however, that the federal law under which a plaintiff seeks the injunction must provide the plaintiff with a private right of action, and the law must apply substantively to the tribe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1950048,7348398\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/268/76/\">\n    268 F.3d at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Tribal Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' RICO claim fails on both counts. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   First, as the Tribal Defendants concede, binding Circuit precedent compels us to hold that RICO authorizes private rights of action for injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chevron Corp. v.

The Tribal Defendants argue that government entities like the Tribe, and \"arms of the Tribe\" like Plain Green, are not subject to RICO liability because they are incapable of forming the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   necessary to commit a predicate act. They argue that specific intent to defraud is an element of the predicate acts of mail and wire fraud, and thus the payday lending entity cannot be subject to RICO liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Some district courts (and at least one treatise) endorse a rule that government entities, and their officers sued in their\n   official capacities, cannot ordinarily be sued under RICO.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Frooks v.

We agree with the Third Circuit that courts exempting municipalities from RICO liability on the ground that they are incapable of forming a RICO\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   have failed to furnish a defensible explanation for their conclusion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Genty v.

For example, while the Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Lancaster Community Hospital v.

These include provisions governing class actions, such as this, and the actual scope of the arbitrator's authority, given the broad authority of tribal courts to set aside the arbitrator's award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In any event, \"[i]f a party challenges the validity under [ 9 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2 of the precise agreement to arbitrate at issue, the federal court must consider the challenge before ordering compliance with that agreement under \u00a7 4.\"\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    561 U.S. at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644316,12455276\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/2772/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Part of this scheme involves crafting arbitration agreements like the ones here, in which borrowers are forced to disclaim the application of federal and state law in favor of tribal law (that\n   may or may not be exceedingly favorable to the tribal lending entity). Like the Fourth and Seventh Circuits, we are not sold. We hold that the agreements here are both unenforceable and unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hayes v.

Similar to the agreement in\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' agreements here require the application of tribal law only and disclaim the application of state and federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.

And the Supreme Court has made clear that arbitration agreements that waive a party's right to pursue federal statutory remedies are prohibited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Exp.

By applying tribal law only, arbitration for the Plain Green borrowers appears wholly to foreclose them from vindicating rights granted by federal and state law. We agree with the Fourth Circuit that \"[t]he just and efficient system of arbitration intended by Congress when it passed the FAA may not play host to this sort of farce.\"\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081072\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/666/\">\n    811 F.3d at 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendants' argument that tribal law perhaps incorporates, or can be supplemented with, some federal law or Montana law does not save the agreements. It is altogether unclear what that incorporation or supplementation would look like. Tribal law is generally unavailable outside of the reservation, and Plaintiffs plausibly allege that any tribal law that would be applied has been carefully tailored to protect Plain Green's interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J. App. 73 (\"[The Tribe agreed to] adopt a finance code that is acceptable to all parties and provide for the licensing of an arm of the tribe to engage in consumer lending.\"). Tribal law provides no guarantee that federal and state statutory rights could be pursued, much less vindicated, in this arbitral forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Second, we conclude that the arbitration agreements are substantively unconscionable under Vermont law because the arbitral forum for which they provide is illusory. While the agreements provide for arbitration to be conducted by an AAA or JAMS arbitrator at a location convenient for the borrower, the mechanism of tribal court review hollows out those protections. Rather than the sharply limited federal court review of the arbitrators' decisions as constrained by the FAA, the review by tribal courts under these agreements\n   hands those courts unfettered discretion to overturn an arbitrator's award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   116 (any arbitral award \"may be set aside by the tribal court upon judicial review\"). Ultimately, the tribal court is directed to interpret its own law-alleged to be completely one-sided in favor of the tribe-which effectively insulates the tribe from any adverse award and leaves prospective litigants without a fair chance of prevailing in arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184189\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/765/\">\n    764 F.3d at 778-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying Illinois law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Adding to the unconscionability of arbitrating under these terms are the allegations of corruption in tribal government.

Without expressing any view, we note this issue for the district court's consideration at some appropriate point. As Plaintiffs' demands include injunctive relief that undoubtedly falls within the protected scope of\n    <em>\n     Ex parte Young\n    </em>\n    , the question whether an injunction barring recovery of the principal of a loan is outside the scope allowed by\n    <em>\n     Ex parte Young\n    </em>\n    might be deferred to a later stage in the proceedings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
