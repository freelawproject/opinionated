The tort claims arose from conduct committed by the nonmember on tribal lands during the scope of her employment. The question presented is whether the tribal court has jurisdiction to adjudicate tribal claims against its nonmember employee, where the tribe's personnel policies and procedures manual regulated the nonmember's conduct at issue and provided that the\n   tribal council would address violations by the nonmember during the course of her employment, and the tribal court and tribal judicial code were established and enacted after the nonmember left her employment with the tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We previously held that a tribe's inherent sovereign power to exclude nonmembers from tribal land is an independent source of regulatory power over nonmember conduct on tribal land.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Water Wheel Camp Recreational Area, Inc. v.

Today we also observe that a tribe's regulatory power over nonmembers on tribal land does not solely derive from an Indian tribe's exclusionary power, but also derives separately from its inherent sovereign power to protect self-government and control internal relations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/\">\n    450 U.S. at 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that Indian tribes retain their inherent sovereign power to protect tribal self-government and to control internal relations);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merrion v.

We also hold, in the alternative, that the tribe has regulatory authority over the nonmember employee's conduct under both\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   exceptions. Given the existence of regulatory authority, the sovereign interests at stake, and the congressional interest in promoting tribal self-government, we conclude that the tribal court has jurisdiction over the tribe's claims in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The facts as presented and analyzed here are based on the allegations included in the original complaint filed in tribal court, and not upon the conclusions of a fact finder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Cedarville Rancheria Tribe\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Cedarville Rancheria of Northern Paiute Indians (\"the Tribe\") is a federally recognized Indian tribe that has approximately twelve voting members and operates a 17-acre Rancheria in Cedarville, California (\"the Rancheria\"). The Rancheria is held in trust for the Tribe by the United States government. During the latter part of events at issue in this case, the Tribe's administrative offices were relocated from the Rancheria to land held in fee\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   by the Tribe in Alturas, California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Tribe's governing body is the Community Council, which is composed of all qualified voters of the Rancheria who are 18 years of age or older. Every three years, the Community Council elects three of its members to serve on the Executive\n   Committee-the Tribal Chairperson, Vice Chairperson, and Secretary. The Executive Committee enforces the Community Council's ordinances and other enactments and represents the Tribe in negotiations with tribal, federal, state, and local governments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Knighton's Employment with the Tribe\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Duanna Knighton (\"Knighton\") was employed by the Tribe from July 1996 until she resigned in March 2013. Knighton is not a member of the Tribe and had never resided on or owned land within the Rancheria. At the time of her resignation, Knighton's position was that of Tribal Administrator. As Tribal Administrator, she oversaw the day-to-day management of the Rancheria, its personnel, and many aspects of its finances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During Knighton's employment, the Tribe regulated its employees pursuant to the Cedarville Rancheria Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual (\"the Personnel Manual\"). The Personnel Manual regulated employee conduct including, but not limited to: misfeasance and malfeasance in the performance of duty, incompetency in the performance of job duties, theft, carelessness or negligence with the monies or property of the Rancheria, inducement of an employee to act in violation of Rancheria regulations, and violation of personnel rules. Disciplinary actions for an employee's breach of rules and standards of conduct in the course of employment specified in the Personnel Manual included a verbal warning, written reprimand, suspension without pay, demotion, and involuntary termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Personnel Manual provided that where the Tribal Administrator was the subject of disciplinary action, the Community Council directly oversaw the disciplinary process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Knighton's Employment with RISE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   From 2009 until at least 2016, in addition to her position as Tribal Administrator, Knighton was also serving as an employee or officer of Resources for Student Education (\"RISE\"), a California nonprofit, that provides education services and programs to Indian children. RISE is not a tribally created or licensed business entity, and it receives the majority of its funding from state and federal grants and private donations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Tribe's Purchase of RISE Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In mid-2009, Knighton, acting in her capacity as Tribal Administrator, negotiated the Tribe's purchase from RISE of a building in Alturas, California, where the Tribe's administrative offices are now located. During this time, Knighton was also an employee or agent of RISE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Knighton initially recommended that the Tribe purchase the building for $ 350,000, allegedly representing that such a price was below market value even though she had not received a professional appraisal of the property. The Tribe later discovered that the $ 350,000 purchase price recommended by Knighton was $ 200,000 above market value. Knighton also represented to the Tribe that it could pay off its building loan within five years after the purchase and that RISE would pay rent to the Tribe for its occupancy until the note on the building was paid off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Tribe asserts that at no time during the purchase negotiations did Knighton disclose she had a conflict of interest representing both RISE and the Tribe in the sale, that RISE was close to insolvency, or that she had an agreement with RISE to split the proceeds of the building sale. The parties settled on a purchase price of $ 300,000. Within twelve months of the\n   sale, RISE moved its business operations out of the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Knighton's Resignation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Before Knighton resigned in March 2013 as Tribal Administrator, she allegedly cashed out $ 29,925 in vacation and sick pay in violation of the Tribe's policies and procedures. The Tribe issued a check in the amount of $ 29,925, payable to RISE on Knighton's behalf. The Tribal Vice Chairman approved Knighton's request to cash out based on her representation that her request had been approved by the Tribal Chairperson, when in fact, the Tribal Chairperson had denied Knighton's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   When Knighton resigned in March 2013, she took with her all files, including files belonging to the Tribe, room furnishings, and a computer, representing to the Tribe that the property removed belonged to RISE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In late 2013, the Tribe wrote a letter to RISE demanding the return of the $ 29,925 and any and all tribal property, including the computer. Both RISE and Knighton refused through their counsel to return the funds or any of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Creation of Constitution, Tribal Judicial Code, and Tribal Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In February 2011, while Knighton was still employed by the Tribe, the Tribe's voting membership adopted the Constitution and Bylaws of the Cedarville Rancheria, which was approved by the Regional Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Article II of the Tribe's Constitution provides that the \"jurisdiction of [the Tribe] shall extend to the land now within the confines of the [ ] Rancheria and to such other lands as may thereafter be added thereto.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In December 2013, nine months after Knighton's resignation, the Tribe enacted the Cedarville Rancheria Judicial Code (\"the Tribal Judicial Code\") and established the Cedarville Rancheria Tribal Court, which consists of a tribal court (\"the Tribal Court\") and a tribal court of appeals (\"the Tribal Court of Appeals\"). All judges must be lawyers experienced in the practice of tribal and federal Indian law and licensed to practice in the highest court of any state. Judges cannot be the Tribal Administrator, Assistant Clerks, or members of the Executive Committee. The Tribal Judicial Code provides that the Tribal Court and Tribal Court of Appeals have jurisdiction over all civil causes of action that arise within the boundaries of the Rancheria. Pursuant to the Tribal Judicial Code, the Tribal Court has the power to issue orders and judgments and to award limited money damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    G. The Tribe's Audit Findings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In early 2014, after Knighton resigned, the Tribe conducted a forensic accounting of the Tribe's financial position. The Tribe alleges that the forensic accounting came about after the former Tribal Chairperson shot and killed four tribal members at an Executive Committee meeting on February 20, 2014. The slain Tribal Chairman was a vocal critic of Knighton's performance. He was among those killed by his sister. During this accounting, the Tribe reviewed its annual audit reports dating back to 2005 and found that the reports detailed several material weakness findings by the auditor. The auditor's findings noted major deficiencies in the accounting of the Tribe's finances, which Knighton oversaw, and noted that the Tribe had not adopted a policy regarding the investment of tribal funds. The Tribe also discovered that in 2008, an annual audit of the Tribe's finances showed that $ 3.07 million of the Tribe's money had been invested by Knighton in high-risk investments, which had declined in value by more than $ 1.2 million by the end of 2008. The Tribe also\n   discovered that tribal funds belonging to the Tribe's children had been co-mingled with funds invested on behalf of adults, resulting in improper taxation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Tribe asserts that the annual audit reports, and the material weakness findings and investment losses detailed therein, had not been provided by Knighton to the Tribe and were only discovered by the Tribe after Knighton's resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Tribe filed a complaint in the Tribal Court against Knighton, RISE, and Oppenheimer Funds, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint included claims for fraud and deceit, recovery of unauthorized and excessive pension payments, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment, common count-account stated, and common count-money had and received. In support of its claims, the Tribe alleged that Knighton improperly manipulated the Tribe's policies and procedures to provide her salary and fringe benefits, including a pension in excess of what would normally be paid to a Tribal Administrator for a like-sized tribe. The Tribe also alleged that Knighton invested its money in high-risk investments without the appropriate authority, and attempted to enter financial agreements without appropriate authorization or waivers of tribal sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Knighton responded by filing a motion to dismiss, claiming, in relevant part, that the Tribal Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under\n   <em>\n    Montana v. United States\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Tribal Court denied Knighton's motion to dismiss, finding that it had jurisdiction over the Tribe's claims against Knighton under both\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   exceptions because Knighton entered into a consensual relationship with the Tribe, by virtue of her employment with the Tribe, and because Knighton's conduct threatened or had a direct effect on the political integrity, economic security, and health and welfare of the Tribe. The Tribal Court's decision was affirmed by the Tribal Court of Appeals, but the case was remanded to the Tribal Court to determine whether RISE was an indispensable party to the suit, following a finding that the issue had not been raised in the Tribal Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On remand, pursuant to a stipulation between the parties, the Tribal Court stayed the case to allow Knighton to contest in federal district court the Tribal Court's jurisdiction over the Tribe's asserted claims. As a result of the stay, there is no Tribal Court exhaustion issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Knighton filed a lawsuit in federal district court seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that the Tribal Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Tribe's claims against Knighton under both\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   exceptions, and a permanent injunction against further proceedings in the Tribal Court. The defendants moved to dismiss Knighton's complaint on the basis that the Tribal Court's jurisdiction over the Tribe's claims was proper under both\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The district court ruled that the Tribal Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the Tribe's claims, and granted defendants' motion to dismiss. The district court declined to apply\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   in its jurisdictional analysis based on its finding that Knighton's alleged conduct occurred either on tribal land within the Rancheria's borders or was closely related to tribal land. The district court stated that under\n   <em>\n    Water Wheel\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   framework did not apply to jurisdictional issues involving nonmember conduct on tribal land. The district\n   court concluded that the Tribe had authority to regulate Knighton's conduct because \"Knighton's employment activities directly affected the Tribe's inherent powers to protect the welfare of its members and preserve the integrity of its government\" and because \"her conduct threatened the Tribe's very economic survival,\" and held that the Tribal Court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the Tribe's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Knighton appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Among the tribe's many claims are allegations that Knighton invested the Tribe's money without appropriate authority, concealed investment documents and audit reports from the Tribe, and attempted to enter financial agreements without the appropriate authorization or waiver of tribal sovereign immunity. The Tribe also alleges that Knighton made unreasonably risky investments that led to investment losses in excess of $ 1.2 million, excess transaction fees, and state and federal tax exposure, and that she breached her fiduciary duty and deceived the Tribe, causing it to pay $ 300,000, $ 150,000 above market value, for the RISE building purchase. Finally, the Tribe alleges that when she resigned her employment with the Tribe, Knighton took all files, including files belonging to the Tribe, room furnishings, and a computer, representing to the Tribe that the property removed belonged to RISE. We conclude that this conduct threatened the Tribe's very subsistence and that the Tribe therefore retains the inherent power under the second\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   exception to regulate this conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Adjudicatory Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Knighton also contends that the Tribe is seeking to exercise greater adjudicative\n   authority over her than it was capable of at the time of her employment. She argues that the adjudicatory authority of the Tribe is limited to the disciplinary procedures provided for in the Personnel Manual. At the time of her employment, the disciplinary actions detailed in the Personnel Manual for an employee's breach of rules and standards of conduct in the course of employment included a verbal warning, written reprimand, suspension without pay, demotion, and involuntary termination. The Personnel Manual provided that when the Tribal Administrator was the subject of disciplinary action, the Community Council directly oversaw the disciplinary and grievance procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   We hold that the Tribe has the power to regulate Knighton's conduct incident to its sovereign powers to exclude nonmembers from tribal land, and also, in the alternative, under both\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   exceptions. \"[W]here tribes possess authority to regulate the activities of nonmembers, '[c]ivil jurisdiction over [disputes arising out of] such activities presumptively lies in the tribal courts.' \"\n   <em>\n    Strate v.

As discussed above, the Personnel Manual regulated the conduct that forms the basis of the Tribe's claims against Knighton and conferred jurisdiction over her conduct as Tribal Administrator on the Community Council.
