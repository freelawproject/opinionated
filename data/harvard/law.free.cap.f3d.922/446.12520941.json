The Inventory Rule implements the retrospective and prospective reporting requirements that Congress required. Companies that manufactured and processed chemicals during the ten years prior to June 22, 2016 must submit a \"Notice of Activity Form A.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 37,523, 37,525.

These Forms also allow a manufacturer or processor of a chemical that was originally on the confidential portion of the Inventory to seek to continue that confidential status going forward.

Allowing any chemical manufacturer or processor to seek continued protection against public disclosure for its chemical substance fits comfortably within the statutory text. Section 2607's sole limitation on the class of manufacturers and processors that may wish to maintain an existing confidentiality claim is that they manufacture or process \"a chemical substance on the confidential portion of the [Inventory].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202607\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)(B)(ii). \"[\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    ny\n   </em>\n   \" of those manufacturers or processors may apply.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

To \"maintain\" commonly means \"to keep in an existing state.\" MERRIAM-WEBSTER DICTIONARY 431 (def. 1) (7th ed. 2016). The word imposes no limit on\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   may do that maintaining. A recent homebuyer, for example, might maintain the existing landscaping. New team players certainly hope to maintain the winning streak of last year's team. So too here, the statutory language naturally permits a manufacturer or processor to maintain a confidentiality status first obtained by another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Environmental Defense agrees that an original claimant's successor-in-interest can \"maintain an existing claim.\" But nothing in the statutory text requires drawing an impermeable line there. The EPA reasonably concluded that the claimant's corporate genealogy is beside the point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Environmental Defense reasons that all claimants who were not original claimants or their successors-in-interest should be required to file a new claim of confidentiality under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202613\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Control Act provides that for active substances, if \"no request [i]s received to\n   <em>\n    maintain an existing claim\n   </em>\n   for protection against disclosure,\" the EPA \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   \" move that chemical substance \"from the confidential portion of the list * * * to the nonconfidential portion of that list.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202607\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)(B)(iv) (emphasis added). And the statute requires that those requests to maintain confidentiality had to be filed \"not later than 180 days after the date on which the final rule is published in the Federal Register,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202607\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2607(b)(4)(A)(i) -that is, by February 7, 2018. That approach leaves insufficient time for new applications for confidentiality to be filed and acted upon before the previously confidential chemical identity is publicly disclosed. And once that disclosure occurs, the cat is out of the bag. There will be no confidentiality for a new claimant to obtain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 2607(b)(8) (\"No person may assert a new claim * * * for protection from disclosure of a specific chemical identity of any active or inactive substance * * * that is not on the confidential portion of the [Inventory].\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   S.

Environmental Defense Br. 40-41. But that ignores the myriad circumstances in which it would have made no sense for a company to submit its own confidentiality claim. For instance, there would be no need for more than one manufacturer in a co-manufacturing arrangement to submit a confidentiality claim for the same chemical substance. Likewise, an importer notified by a supplier that a chemical already was on the confidential portion of the list would have had no reason to submit a redundant claim. The EPA sensibly determined that companies like those \"legitimately benefit from the confidential status of a specific chemical identity,\" and therefore should have the opportunity to seek confidentiality going forward. 82 Fed. Reg. at 37,527.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   For all of those reasons, the EPA acted well within its discretion in concluding that, as part of the Inventory update, any manufacturer or processor of a chemical substance can file a claim to maintain the chemical substance's confidentiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Inventory Rule provides that information claimed to be confidential \"will be treated and disclosed in accordance with 40 C.F.R. part 2, subpart B,\" which regulates the EPA's treatment of confidential business information. 82 Fed.

The Inventory Rule's provisions simply complement and elaborate upon some of the statutory requirements without displacing the others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Environmental Defense seems to want the statutory requirements duplicated in the rule for duplication's sake. That is not necessary. \"[A] regulation can never 'trump the plain meaning of a statute.' \"\n   <em>\n    Texas v.

Should the EPA's future implementation of these provisions of the Inventory Rule fall short of statutory mandates, a challenge can be raised then. But there is nothing facially troubling about the failure to copy every relevant statutory obligation into the regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Environmental Defense's fourth objection to the Inventory Rule is that it fails to implement the statutory scheme for assigning a unique public identifier for each chemical identity it decides to keep confidential. Environmental Defense points to the Control Act's requirement that the EPA \"develop a system to assign a unique identifier to each specific chemical identity for which the Administrator approves a request for protection from disclosure,\" and then \"apply that identifier consistently to all information relevant to the applicable chemical substance[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202613\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(4)(A)(i)-(ii). The Control Act also directs the EPA to \"annually publish and update a list of chemical substances, referred to by their unique identifiers, for which claims to protect the specific chemical identity from disclosure have been approved, including the expiration date for each such claim[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 2613(g)(4)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   There is no question that the Inventory Rule does not implement those requirements.
