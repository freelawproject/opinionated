They seek money damages to redress the ICE agents' alleged violations of their rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, alleging that the ICE agents (1) stopped and detained them without a reasonable, articulable suspicion of unlawful activity; (2) invaded their homes without a warrant, consent, or probable cause; and (3) seized them illegally.

While the district court assumed that the plaintiffs' action presents a \" 'modest extension' in a 'new context' for the application of a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy,\" it denied the ICE agents' motion, concluding that a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy \"should be recognized in this case.\" It also denied the ICE agents qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Applying the Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence on\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   actions, we\n   reverse, concluding that a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy is not available in the circumstances of this case. Where there is no statute authorizing a claim for money damages, \"it is a significant step under separation-of-powers principles\" for a court to impose damages liability on federal officials.\n   <em>\n    Ziglar v.

In such cases, \"[t]he question is who should decide whether to provide for a damages remedy, Congress or the courts?\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1857 (cleaned up). \"The answer most often will be Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, in the course of repeatedly declining to provide a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy in recent years, the Supreme Court has now made clear that \"extend[ing]\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   liability to any new context or new category of defendants\" is highly \"disfavored.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

We thus conclude that, because the plaintiffs seek to extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   liability to a context the Supreme Court has yet to recognize and there are \"special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress,\"\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1857\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up), the plaintiffs' action for damages should be dismissed. Therefore, we reverse the district court's order denying the ICE agents' motion to dismiss and remand with instructions to dismiss the plaintiffs' action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In their complaint, the plaintiffs challenge the legality of stops, detentions, and home invasions that they experienced on February 8 and February 17, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As alleged in the complaint, on February 8, ICE agents stopped one of the plaintiffs as he was leaving his home and asked if he knew a man in a photo that the agents showed him. When the plaintiff denied knowing the man, the agents demanded that the plaintiff take them into his home. The agents then collected all of the other persons in the home, asked them the same question, and received the same response. They then arrested six residents and took them to an ICE facility in Lorton, Virginia. After ten hours, the agents released the six on bond. Removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") were then initiated against those six, who are now plaintiffs in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 17, ICE agents blocked a car with four Latino men in it as they were pulling out of a parking space, demanding that they provide identification. The ICE agents then showed the detained men photos of two men, whom one of the detained men recognized. The agents then directed the detained men to go to their apartment, where the agents arrested and frisked two of them and took them to an ICE facility in Fairfax, Virginia. After they were released, removal proceedings under the INA were initiated against those two men, who are also now plaintiffs in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In their initial complaint for damages, the two plaintiffs arrested on February 17 alleged violations of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. They also asserted that the arrests on that date \"did not occur in a vacuum,\" citing a recent Executive Order which \"was represented by the Trump administration as an effort to 'take the shackles off' ICE agents in their enforcement activities.\" (Citation omitted). As the complaint alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ICE agents across the country have been encouraged to stop individuals without reasonable suspicion, pursuant to the Trump Administration's efforts to \"take the shackles off\" ICE agents to free them from \"what they went through in the last administration.\" In contrast to the Obama Administration's immigration enforcement policies and practices, which discouraged ICE agents from\n   stopping individuals absent reasonable suspicion that the individuals had violated federal law, ... [the] Executive Order and implementing guidance from [the Department of Homeland Security] have encouraged a broader set of enforcement policies that \"no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Citations omitted). The initial complaint also alleged that \"[u]nder the Obama Administration, ICE agents carried out immigration arrests at [the same apartment complex] multiple times a year, but generally arrested only those persons whom they had come to arrest ... [and] generally did not engage in collateral arrests of third persons.\" They alleged that under the Trump Administration, by contrast, \"ICE agents have dramatically increased the number and scope of enforcement actions\" at the apartment complex and that \"[t]hese enforcement actions have included numerous collateral arrests,\" including the arrests of the two plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Several months later, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which added the events that occurred on February 8, 2017, and the additional seven plaintiffs involved in those events, one of whom was a U.S. citizen. The amended complaint again alleged claims for the unreasonable searches and seizures of the plaintiffs, in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and equal protection claims under the Fifth Amendment. It also eliminated all references to the Trump Administration's immigration enforcement policy. In both complaints, the plaintiffs demanded compensatory and punitive damages, relying on\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The ICE agents filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action is not available in the context of this case. The agents also asserted qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court rejected both arguments and denied the motion. First, the court concluded that the plaintiffs stated \"cognizable\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims, as those claims were against persons properly considered federal law enforcement officers under circumstances that sufficiently approximated those within the recognized contours of that remedy.\" Applying the framework articulated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Ziglar v. Abbasi\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1857\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1857\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), the court first assessed whether the case arose in a \"new\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   context,\" noting that \"[t]he alleged conduct in this case ha[d] the recognizable substance of Fourth Amendment violations\" but that the agents \"[were] ICE agents, rather than traditional law enforcement officers, ... and were purporting to operate under a different 'statutory or other legal mandate' than the officials referenced in\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   .\" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1857\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1860 ). For those reasons, the court \"assumed that this case present[ed] a 'modest extension' in a 'new context' for the application of a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy\" and therefore went on to evaluate whether \"special factors\" counseled against extending\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   by inquiring \"whether '(1) Congress ha[d] not already provided an exclusive statutory remedy; (2) there [were] no special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of the affirmative action by Congress; and (3) there [was] no explicit Congressional declaration that money damages not be awarded.' \" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Hall v. Clinton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11167466\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/235/202/#p204\">\n    235 F.3d 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204 (4th Cir. 2000) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After noting that the ICE agents \"d[id] not contend that Congress ha[d] already provided an exclusive statutory remedy ... or that there [was] an 'explicit Congressional declaration that money damages not be awarded,' \" the district court concluded that the issue \"reduce[d] to whether any 'special factors' counsel[ed] against extending an implied right of action within the context of this case.\" The court then\n   reasoned that the plaintiffs \"are not challenging an entity's policy\" but are rather \"claiming straightforward violations of their Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights based on [the ICE agents'] conduct.\" And while ICE agents, rather than traditional federal law enforcement officers, were involved, the court concluded that the agents \"nevertheless fall within the broad category of federal law enforcement officers, whose conduct raises the same issues and concerns as in\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\" As for the ICE agents' argument that \"Congress's intent to preclude a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   damages remedy [could] be found in its failure to provide for an explicit remedy in the [INA] while otherwise 'aggressively' legislating in the immigration area,\" the court reasoned that while that argument would have force if Congress had provided a lesser remedy for this sort of violation, \"Congress has provided\n   <em>\n    no remedy whatsoever\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added). The court concluded that \"Congress's silence in this context does not reliably reflect any Congressional intent to preclude a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   damage remedy, particularly given the longstanding judicial recognition of a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy for the types of Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims asserted in this case.\" The court thus ultimately concluded that \"there [were] no special factors that would counsel against [allowing] a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy for Plaintiffs' claims\" and accordingly allowed the plaintiffs to pursue their\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims against the ICE agents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court also rejected the ICE agents' claim of qualified immunity. The ICE agents asserted that the complaint failed to allege \"with the required specificity\" the involvement of each ICE agent. The court disagreed, concluding that the plaintiffs \"alleged at this stage each [ICE agent's] involvement with a sufficient level of factual specificity to give 'fair notice' of the claims asserted against each individual and the conduct relied on for those claims,\" and that, as such, the ICE agents \"are not entitled to qualified immunity on the ground that the plaintiffs have failed to state with specificity each [ICE agent's] involvement.\" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

The plaintiffs respond that while this may be a difference, it is not a\n   <em>\n    meaningful\n   </em>\n   one, as required by\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, they contend that this case arises \"squarely\" in the\n   same \"search-and-seizure context 'in which [\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   ] arose' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1857\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1856 ) and that, like in\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , the instant action is against individual line-level officers for violations of the Fourth Amendment. In addition, the plaintiffs argue that their allegations concern actions taken prior to the commencement of any removal proceeding under the INA and therefore that the INA is not relevant to the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Agreeing with the ICE agents, we conclude that the plaintiffs' position fails to reckon with the Supreme Court's specific guidance regarding the new-context inquiry.

The ICE agents were not enforcing the criminal law, as in\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , but rather were enforcing the immigration law of the INA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . The plaintiffs attempt to trivialize this difference, arguing at a general level that because the ICE agents are \"federal law enforcement officers\" alleged to have \"committed unconstitutional searches and seizures,\" this case arises in the same context as\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   regardless of the statutory mandate under which the ICE agents were operating. Arguing at so general a level, however, not only ignores the language of\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   , it also fails to appreciate the substantively distinct aspects of immigration enforcement. Immigration enforcement is by its nature addressed toward noncitizens, which raises a host of considerations and concerns that are simply absent in the majority of traditional law enforcement contexts. Indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized as such and has distinguished between immigration enforcement and criminal law enforcement in the past.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    INS v.

And more generally, the INA takes an approach to enforcement that is distinct from the approach taken by criminal laws, favoring arrest and detention\n   <em>\n    for the purpose of removal\n   </em>\n   from the United States, while the criminal law imposes incarceration\n   <em>\n    for the distinct purposes stated in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Also, enforcement of the immigration laws implicates broad policy concerns distinct from the enforcement of criminal law. Indeed, the plaintiffs recognized as much in their initial complaint, pointing out the significance of the Trump Administration's immigration policy to their case and emphasizing the differences between the policies of the Obama Administration and the Trump Administration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   In contrast to the Obama Administration's immigration enforcement policies and practices, which discourage ICE agents from stopping individuals absent reasonable suspicion that the individuals had violated federal law, the January 25, 2017 Executive Order [of the Trump Administration] and implementing guidance from [the Department of Homeland Security] have encouraged a broader set of enforcement priorities that \"no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (Citing Department of Homeland Security memoranda from the two Administrations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In addition, as part of the new-context analysis, the\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   Court \"refused to extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   to any ...\n   <em>\n    new category\n   </em>\n   of defendants,\" and pointed out categories that had been found to be meaningfully distinct from the three\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cases, such as \"federal employer[s],\" \"military officers,\" \"Social Security officials,\" a \"federal agency,\" a \"private prison operator,\" \"officials from the Bureau of Land Management,\" and \"prison guards at a private prison.\"\n   <em>\n    Abbasi,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1857\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). So it is in this case that the plaintiffs seek to extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   liability to a new category of defendants - ICE agents, who are charged with the enforcement of the immigration laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Further, the plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment claims have no analogue in the Supreme Court's prior\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cases. In effect, the plaintiffs attempt to wed the Fifth Amendment equal protection claim of\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Passman\n   </em>\n   , which concerned a Congressman firing his female secretary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532130\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/228/\">\n    442 U.S. at 230-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532130\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/228/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , with the Fourth Amendment claim of\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .

Because the plaintiffs seek to extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   liability to a new context, we must now inquire as to whether there are any \"special factors counselling hesitation [in extending\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   liability] in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1857.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In determining whether \"special factors\" are present, we focus on whether Congress\n   <em>\n    might doubt\n   </em>\n   the need for an implied damages remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1857\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Arguing that \"special factors\" do exist in this case, the ICE agents point to the complex and comprehensive nature of the INA, as well as the \"sheer size\" of the immigration system. They emphasize that Congress omitted a private damages remedy for constitutional violations arising from immigration enforcement and investigations while pervasively regulating other aspects of immigration policy and argue that this suggests that Congress intended to exclude such a remedy. The Judiciary's recognition of such a remedy absent statutory authorization would thus, according to the ICE agents, raise grave separation-of-powers concerns. In addition, the ICE agents point to immigration's relation to foreign policy and diplomacy and contend that the plaintiffs' action, in purpose and effect, seeks to alter immigration enforcement policy, which is a role for the Executive, not the Judiciary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The plaintiffs, by contrast, argue that they are only challenging \"run-of-the-mill, unconstitutional law enforcement activity by individual law enforcement agents\" and that \"this case is not about the U.S. 'immigration system' \" as such. The plaintiffs also emphasize that, while the INA does provide \"various procedural mechanisms to individuals who have been placed in removal proceedings,\" the INA \"does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   provide a remedial scheme for violations committed by immigration officials outside of removal proceedings.\" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Diaz-Bernal v.

As the ICE agents argue, because immigration enforcement is, at bottom, about ensuring that only those foreign nationals who are legally authorized to be in the United States remain present here, such enforcement has \"the natural tendency to affect diplomacy, foreign policy, and the security of the nation, which ... counsel hesitation in extending\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Mirmehdi v.
