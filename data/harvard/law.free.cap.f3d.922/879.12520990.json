Pertinent here, we held that the district court properly awarded Oracle approximately $12.8 million in non-taxable costs pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20505\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Oracle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266268\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/948/\">\n    879 F.3d at 965-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
