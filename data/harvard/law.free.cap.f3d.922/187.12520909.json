Whereas the district court determined, consistent with the other District of Maryland rulings, that no such tolling occurred, we find ourselves compelled by\n   <em>\n    Kholi\n   </em>\n   to conclude that the limitations period was tolled during the pendency of the Maryland Rule 4-345 motion. Consequently, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As explained in its Opinion of October 11, 2017, the district court received Mitchell's\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   petition on July 17, 2013. The court calculated that AEDPA's one-year limitations period for the filing of the \u00a7 2254 petition began to run nearly four years earlier, on August 21, 2009, the date on which Mitchell's state criminal judgment became final.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A) (specifying, in relevant part, that the one-year limitations period runs from \"the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Despite the nearly four-year lapse between the finalization of Mitchell's state criminal judgment and the filing of his \u00a7 2254 petition, the district court recognized that the \u00a7 2254 petition was timely filed if the limitations period was tolled during the pendency - for more than three years - of Mitchell's Maryland Rule 4-345 motion to reduce sentence. Mitchell filed his Maryland Rule 4-345 motion on September 2, 2009, soon after his state criminal judgment became final, and the motion was resolved on October 1, 2012, when it was denied by the state trial court (the Circuit Court for Harford County). To have tolled the \u00a7 2254 petition's limitations period for those three-plus years, the Maryland Rule 4-345 motion must constitute an \"application for State postconviction or other collateral review\" within the meaning of AEDPA's tolling provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2) (providing in full that \"[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its Opinion, the district court observed that Mitchell presented a substantial argument, relying on the Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Kholi\n   </em>\n   decision, that the Maryland Rule 4-345 motion sought \"collateral review\" and thus tolled the \u00a7 2254 petition's limitations period. The respondent Maryland officials countered, however, with the previous local rulings - rendered by six District of Maryland judges - rejecting similar\n   <em>\n    Kholi\n   </em>\n   -based contentions. Adhering to \"the unbroken chain of decisions from this district\" and respecting \"the need for uniformity in this area,\" the court ultimately ruled that \"a motion under Md. Rule 4-345 does not toll the running of the statute of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion 10. But the court also emphasized that there was \"no question ... that the procedural ruling is open to significant debate\" and \"only appellate courts can definitively resolve the issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    at 10, 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Kholi\n   </em>\n   , in 2011, the Supreme Court assessed whether a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law triggers AEDPA's tolling provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n    562 U.S. 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n    179 L.Ed.2d 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). The law at issue was Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, which by its subsection (a) authorizes a court to \"reduce any sentence,\" as well as to \"correct an illegal sentence\" and to \"correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 548 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted) (quoting R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35(a)). For a sentence reduction, Rhode Island Rule 35 requires the filing of a motion within 120 days after one of the following events: the court's imposition of the sentence at issue; the receipt by the court of the mandate of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island upon affirmance of the judgment or dismissal of the appeal; or receipt by the court of the mandate or order of the Supreme Court of the United States upon affirmance of the judgment, dismissal of the appeal, or denial of a writ of certiorari. With respect to any Rule 35 motion, the court is obliged to \"act on the motion within a reasonable time, provided that any delay by the court in ruling on the motion shall not prejudice the movant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting R.I.

Consequently, the\n   <em>\n    Kholi\n   </em>\n   decision focused on interpreting and applying that phrase. Writing for the unanimous Court, Justice Alito rejected Rhode Island's contention \"that 'collateral review' includes only 'legal' challenges to a conviction or sentence and thus excludes motions seeking a discretionary sentence reduction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, the Court agreed with prisoner Kholi's position \"that 'collateral review' is review other than review of a judgment in the direct appeal process and thus includes motions to reduce sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Upon careful examination of both \"collateral\" and \"review,\" the\n   <em>\n    Kholi\n   </em>\n   Court summarized that \" 'collateral review' of a judgment or claim means a judicial reexamination of a judgment or claim in a proceeding outside of the direct review process.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n    562 U.S. at 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying that definition to a Rhode Island Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence, the Court easily determined that the \"proceeding is 'collateral,' \" because \"such a motion is not part of the direct review process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n    at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further ruling that the Rule 35 motion \"undoubtedly calls for 'review' of the sentence,\" the Court explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The decision to reduce a sentence, while largely within the discretion of the trial justice, involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to determine whether a more lenient sentence is proper. When ruling on such a motion, a trial justice is guided by several factors, including (1) the severity of the crime, (2) the defendant's personal, educational, and employment background, (3) the potential for rehabilitation, (4) the element of societal deterrence, and (5) the appropriateness of the punishment. On appeal from a trial justice's decision on a motion to reduce sentence, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island evaluates the trial justice's justifications in light of the relevant sentencing factors to determine whether a sentence is without justification and grossly disparate from other sentences. This process surely qualifies as \"review\" of a sentence within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n    at 555-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted).

Of particular importance here, Rhode Island had asserted that the purpose of AEDPA's \"tolling provision is to allow a state prisoner to exhaust state remedies and that this\n   purpose is not served when a prisoner's state application merely seeks sentencing leniency, a matter that cannot be raised in a federal habeas petition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n    at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Roundly rejecting that interpretation, the Court instead construed the tolling provision to incentivize litigants to pursue \"all 'collateral review' motions\" in state court - including those \"that do not challenge the lawfulness of a judgment\" - thereby potentially \"narrow[ing] or even obviat[ing]\" the need for federal habeas review while \"further[ing] principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991689,12457267\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/545/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

Maryland\n   </em>\n   . At the time prisoner Tasker filed his motion to reduce sentence, Rule 4-345 authorized a court to correct an illegal sentence in subsection (a) and to reduce a sentence in subsection (b). Rule 4-345 also did not impose the five-year window or any time limit for a court to grant a sentence reduction. Upon examining the controlling\n   <em>\n    Kholi\n   </em>\n   precedent and outlining the parties' competing contentions regarding the import of that decision, the\n   <em>\n    Tasker\n   </em>\n   court ruled that Tasker's Rule 4-345 motion to reduce sentence did not toll AEDPA's limitations period. Without passing upon the merits of all of Maryland's arguments, the\n   <em>\n    Tasker\n   </em>\n   court premised its ruling on the following points:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 \"The Supreme Court repeatedly stated in\n   <em>\n    Kholi\n   </em>\n   that it was addressing the procedure under Rhode Island Rule 35\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Unlike Rhode Island Rule 35 - which, all by its subsection (a), authorizes a court to correct an illegal sentence, to correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner, and to reduce a sentence on a plea for leniency - Maryland Rule 4-345 has\n   \"specifically delineated and separate routes for challenges\" to the legality of sentences, in subsection (a), and for requests for leniency, then in subsection (b) and now in subsection (e);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 \"Rhode Island's proposed taxonomy dividing Rule 35 motions into those that 'challenge a sentence on legal grounds and those that merely ask for leniency,' which was rejected [by the\n   <em>\n    Kholi\n   </em>\n   Court] as 'problematic' and burdensome, does not pose such complications under Maryland's procedural framework\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 Because Tasker's Maryland 4-345 motion to reduce sentence asked \"purely for leniency,\" it could \"neither address nor exhaust a cognizable federal claim on habeas review\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 Tasker's Rule 4-345 motion was \"not subject to [state appellate] review\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 Absent any time limit in Rule 4-345 for a court to grant a motion to reduce sentence, such a motion could toll AEDPA's limitations period \"indefinitely.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tasker v.

Although the\n   <em>\n    Tasker\n   </em>\n   court nevertheless expressed concern that Maryland Rule 4-345 contained no time limit for the granting of a sentence reduction and could toll AEDPA's limitations period indefinitely,\n   Rule 4-345 now imposes a five-year window, perhaps with some limited exception under the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland's\n   <em>\n    Schlick\n   </em>\n   decision for a motion belatedly filed as a result of counsel's ineffective assistance. In these circumstances, if there ever was a legitimate concern about Rule 4-345 's omission of a time limit for granting a sentence reduction, that concern has been allayed by Rule 4-345 's addition of the generally-applicable five-year window, which is materially indistinguishable from Rhode Island Rule 35's \"reasonable time\" provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Having addressed each of the\n   <em>\n    Tasker\n   </em>\n   court's premises for concluding that, unlike a Rhode Island Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence, a Maryland Rule 4-345 motion for a sentence reduction does not trigger AEDPA's tolling provision, we turn to an additional argument made by the respondent Maryland officials in this appeal. That argument is based on a misinterpretation of\n   <em>\n    Kholi\n   </em>\n   's footnote 3 and goes as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Critical to the Supreme Court's determination that a Rhode Island proceeding for sentence reduction under Rule 35 constitutes \"collateral review\" under [ 28 U.S.C. \u00a7] 2244(d)(2) was the Court's recognition that \"defendants in Rhode Island cannot raise any challenge to their sentences on direct appeal; instead they must bring a Rule 35 motion.\" ...
