In any event, the court\u2019s charge was proper. The evidence, including the defendant\u2019s confession, indicated that the defendant and codefendants, acting in concert, armed themselves and entered the victim\u2019s store to rob him. When one codefendant fatally shot the storeowner, the attempted robbery escalated to murder. Accordingly, the defendant was properly convicted of murder in the second degree <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [3]; <em>People v Diaz, </em>177 AD2d 500, 502).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contention is unpreserved for appellate review and, in any event, without merit. Mangano, P. J., Sullivan, Copertino and Altman, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
