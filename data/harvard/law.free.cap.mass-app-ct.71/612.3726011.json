The man demanded money from the cashier and, when a second employee entered the store a few minutes later, stabbed the latter. The defendant was convicted of armed assault with intent to rob (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18[\u00bf&gt;]), and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (G. L. c. 256, \u00a7 15A[Z&gt;]). Before us are his direct appeal from the judgments and his appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial. The two appeals were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The defendant claims that the judge erred in not declaring a mistrial on a second return of a deadlocked jury, see G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 34, and erred by discharging the lone hold-out juror, who had brought to the jury room legal definitions of the terms \u201creasonable doubt\u201d and \u201cmoral certainty.\u201d The defendant also argues, laying stress on the fact that in this case there were no positive identifications by the witnesses, that he was entitled to a new trial because his counsel was ineffective by failing, among other things, to introduce exculpatory evidence as to the mustache of the assailant, to move to suppress the partial identifications as being unnecessarily suggestive, and to request an honest but mistaken identification instruction. We affirm the convictions and the denial of the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>In addition to the facts previously recounted, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth included the following. The man entering the Cumberland Farms store on November 20, 2004, was of small build, about five feet, one inch to five feet, four inches tall, and had dark hair, a tan, a little mustache, and an accent described as \u201cSpanish\u201d or \u201csomething like that.\u201d He wore a multicolored flannel plaid shirt, with a dark shirt underneath pulled up to cover the lower part of his face. After he entered the store, he demanded money and swung a knife at the cashier, Brian Provencher. He also attempted unsuccessfully to remove the cash register from the counter. During the scuffle, another Cumberland Farms employee, Robert Ryan, returned to the store and pulled the man by the neck, but retreated after he was stabbed superficially several times. The man fled. There were two customers in the store at the time of the attempted robbery, and a surveillance camera recorded the incident on videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Provencher called the police as soon as the man left. Pittsfield police officers received a report that a man in a plaid shirt had attempted to rob the Cumberland Farms store and had fled in the direction of Melville Street. Although the defendant was the only person seen by a police officer walking in that direction, he was not immediately taken into custody because he was wearing baggy grey sweatpants and a short-sleeved black T-shirt \u2014 not the clothing described in the report. His shoes were untied. Soon thereafter, however, police stopped him at a nearby street comer.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Within fifteen minutes of the incident, the two store employees and one of the store\u2019s customers were brought (individually) to the corner where the defendant was standing next to police officers. It was still raining. Each of the witnesses observed the defendant from the back seat of a police cruiser across the street from the defendant. While none of the three could identify the defendant \u2014 none had seen his full face at the store \u2014 each testified that the height, hair color, and skin tone<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> matched that of the would-be robber.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The clothing and the knife that had been discarded by the would-be robber were soon found nearby, and all three of the witnesses identified the clothing as that worn by the intruder. The two store employees stated that the knife was like the one wielded by the robber. Each of the witnesses identified the man seen on the street comer as the defendant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The surveillance videotape that recorded the incident was shown to the jury. Although the videotape did not show the would-be robber\u2019s face, it pictured his shoes. The shoes the defendant was wearing at the time of his arrest were an exhibit at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">2. <em>Jury deliberations and discharge of deliberating juror. </em>The case was submitted to the jury at 10:46 a.m. on January 25, 2006.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At 2:45 p.m., the jury sent the judge a note stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">\u201cSir, we are making no progress. We are completely divided. What do we do now?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>The judge sent the note back, asking the jury to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">\u201cgive the evidence due and thorough consideration and continue to attempt to reach a unanimous verdict on both indictments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">At 4:15 p.m., the jury sent another note to the judge explaining that they had \u201ccontinued to thoughtfully deliberate. We have evaluated all reliable evidence and yet have not reached a unanimous verdict. We are currently deadlocked at 11 to one.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After conferring with counsel, the judge told counsel he would recess for the evening and give the <em>Tuey-Rodriquez </em>charge in the morning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Before sending the jury home, he called them into the court room and instructed them to have no contact with any of the persons involved in the case, not to take any private views of the place about which they had heard testimony, to avoid and ignore any media coverage of the case, and not to discuss the case with anyone, including jurors, during this or any other recess. The judge did not specifically tell the jurors not to do any legal research during the overnight recess. He had, however, begun his charge by saying that the jury \u201cmust accept the entire body of law that I am now about to give to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The next morning, the judge gave the jury the <em>Tuey-Rodriquez </em>charge. After the jury resumed deliberations, they sent the following note to the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\u201cWe have two potential problems. First a juror looked up in 3 law dictionaries the definition of \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 &amp; \u2018moral certainty\u2019 &amp; brought it into the room. Whether as a result or not she is in complete disagreement with the other eleven jurors. Nothing has changed since yesterday. She says she will not change her mind. What now?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Defense counsel immediately moved for a mistrial, stating that the jury had been \u201chopelessly compromised.\u201d The judge, however, pointed out that the jury were saying two things: not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>only that they were deadlocked,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but also that extraneous information had been brought into the deliberations. Counsel reluctantly conceded that the juror could be questioned as to what she had done. When questioned, the juror explained that as she was the widow of a lawyer, she had access to law books,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> she \u201cdid not realize [she] was violating\u201d his instructions, and she had \u201cdifficulty recalling [his] instruction and the definition of reasonable doubt.\u201d She further stated that \u201c[b]ecause [she] was struggling with [her] decision, [she] needed to \u2014 refresh [her] memory of what reasonable doubt is . . . .\u201d After this explanation, the juror was sent out of the court room, but not to the jury room. When the judge consulted with counsel, defense counsel indicated that it would prejudice his client to have another juror brought in with eleven jurors who already had made up their minds.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The juror was brought back into the court room. The judge told her that some of the law she brought in was \u201cabsolutely wrong.\u201d The judge\u2019s additional inquiry, set forth in the margin, ensued.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>After the discussion, the judge asked the juror to leave the court room and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\u201cWell, I\u2019m concerned. She says she cannot guarantee that she would be able to decide the case based upon the law as I give it to her. I don\u2019t think I have a choice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The judge told counsel that he intended to ask the jurors indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>vidually whether they could disregard what they were told by the errant juror and could decide the case on the law. If all answered \u201cyes,\u201d he would excuse the juror, replace her with an alternate, and then reinstruct the jury on reasonable doubt. The judge then spoke to each juror, asking each, among other things, the following question or in words of similar import:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">\u201cWould you be able, do you think, to disregard what this juror told you about the law and decide the case based upon what I tell you the law is?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Each juror answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Although the Commonwealth agreed with the judge\u2019s proposed procedure, defense counsel \u201cfor the record\u201d objected to \u201cboth the jury questioning process as well as the denial of a mistrial.\u201d He stated that the questioning was not thorough, and that the judge should have asked \u201c[wjhether there has been an impact on their deliberations and the impact on their judgment . . . Not their substance, but whether this had any effect.\u201d The judge replied that \u201cif they can disregard [the material,] . . . that answers the question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The errant juror was excused, an alternate was chosen, and the judge reinstructed the new jury. The content of those instructions will be discussed in a later portion of this opinion. The record does not show how long the reconstituted jury deliberated as it does not show the lunch break; the docket shows they started their deliberations at 12:42 p.m. on the third day of trial and were discharged at 2:24 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">The standards for discharging a deliberating juror are set forth in G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 26B, and G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 39 (reproduced in relevant part in the margin).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See Mass.R.Crim.P. 20(d)(3), 378 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Mass. 891 (1979). Although differing in language, the standards under the two statutes have been considered interchangeable or synonymous, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cousin, </em>449 Mass. 809, 821 n.19 (2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 2053 (2008); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 660, 673 (2005), and have been construed to permit dismissal \u201conly [for] reasons personal to a juror, having nothing whatever to do with the issues of the case or with the juror\u2019s relationship with his fellow jurors.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. 838, 844-845 (1984). \u201cAllowing discharge only for personal reasons ensures that such action will not \u2018affect the substance or the course of the deliberations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swafford, </em>441 Mass. 329, 336 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, supra </em>at 845 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">\u201cThe discharge of a deliberating juror is a sensitive undertaking and is fraught with potential for error. It is to be done only in special circumstances, and with special precautions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. at 843. Even greater care should be taken when the jury is at an impasse with a lone dissenting juror. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 675-676, and other cases which specifically note that there is no indication in the record that the jury were at an impasse: <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leftwich, </em>430 Mass. 865, 874 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>432 Mass. 353, 369 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garrey, </em>436 Mass. 422, 431 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swafford, </em>441 Mass. at 337; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>442 Mass. 779, 789 (2004). The reason for special concern in impasse situations with hold-out jurors is that a lone juror, feeling the enormous pressure of being the only dissenting juror, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>529 F.2d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 1975), may seek to evade his responsibilities. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, supra </em>at 843. Moreover, if an alternate is chosen, that juror, too, will feel a substantial coercive effect when joining a jury of eleven that had, as in this case, formed their opinions and agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>upon the guilt (or innocence) of the accused. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lamb, supra; United States </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971, 996 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Meinster </em>v. <em>United States, </em>457 U.S. 1136 (1982), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>United States </em>v. <em>Huntress, </em>956 F.2d 1309, 1316 (5th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 905 (1993); <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>214 Ill. 2d 106, 125 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">We consider that the judge acted within his discretion in dismissing the juror in this case and acted in accordance with the procedures required by our cases. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, supra </em>at 846; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kamara, </em>422 Mass. 614, 616-620 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tennison, </em>440 Mass. 553, 557-560 (2003). See also Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 31.76 (3d ed. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">There is nothing in the record to suggest that the reason for the dismissal was the juror\u2019s hold-out status. To the contrary, as the judge noted, there were here two problems, the extraneous matter the juror brought to the jury room, as well as the holdout situation, and it was the former that triggered the juror\u2019s dismissal. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ginyard, </em>444 F.3d 648, 652 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (hold-out juror dismissed for employment reasons; no causal link between hold-out status and dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">In questioning the juror, the trial judge observed her demeanor and concluded that she might not be able to put aside what she had read and follow his instructions as to the law. Consistent with the teaching of our cases, we will not disturb a judge\u2019s determination of a juror\u2019s ability or inability to perform the functions of a juror where supported by facts in the record. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>442 Mass. at 789 (distraught juror). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 120, 129 (2001) (juror said \u201cthat she [could] not go on any longer, that it [went] against her beliefs\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leftwich, </em>430 Mass. at 873; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>432 Mass. at 369; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zimmerman, </em>441 Mass. 146, 150 (2004) (judge did not abuse his discretion in dismissing juror); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swafford, </em>441 Mass. at 336; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peppicelli, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 87, 93-94 (2007). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kamara, </em>422 Mass. at 620; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tennison, </em>440 Mass. at 558, 560; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCaster, </em>46 Mass. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Ct. 752, 758 n.12 (1999). Moreover, a judge need not accept a juror\u2019s view of whether she can perform her duties. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>401 Mass. 390, 406 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The judge questioned the remaining jurors as to their ability to disregard the extraneous material and to follow the law as he gave it to them. Because of the importance of not conveying any improper, silent message that he endorsed or approved their view, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. at 846; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zimmerman, supra </em>at 151-152; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 14-15 (1989), he instructed the new jury, as required by our cases, that the reasons for replacing the juror were \u201centirely personal to the excused juror and have nothing to do with her views of the case or her relationship with other jurors and you must not speculate or consider for any purpose the reasons why that juror has been excused.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, supra. </em>In strong language, as set forth in the margin, he told them they must begin their deliberations anew,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and he again instructed them on the terms \u201creasonable doubt\u201d and \u201cmoral certainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>A review of the record shows that the judge was aware of the delicate situation before him and took care to follow the procedures required by our cases. In sum, there was no error in dismissing the juror and appointing an alternate.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">There was also no error in not declaring a mistrial because the original jury had twice claimed they were at an impasse. The jury as reconstituted were a new jury, and contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 34, see note 6, <em>supra, </em>no longer applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">3. <em>Denial of motion for a new trial. </em>The defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was based on several claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">a. The defendant argues that trial counsel should have brought to the jury\u2019s attention a prior statement by Provencher to a police officer. The grand jury minutes and a police report indicate that when Provencher viewed the defendant on the street comer, he told a police officer that the would-be robber had a \u201cbusher [sz'c]\u201d mustache than the person he viewed from the police car. At the suggestion of the judge, the Commonwealth obtained an affidavit of trial counsel. That affidavit, however, contained no explanation for counsel\u2019s failure to present to the jury Provencher\u2019s statement. In the absence of an explanation, the judge inferred that counsel had no tactical or strategic reason for not cross-examining Provencher on this point. The judge, however, then concluded that the defendant had not, as required by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974), shown that he had been deprived of a substantial ground of defense. In so concluding, the judge carefully set forth the evidence at trial, noting particularly that the distinctive style of shoes (dark with light-colored soles and light-colored stitching) depicted on the surveillance videotape was exactly the same style of the shoes that the defendant was wearing at the time he was stopped. Moreover, at that time the shoes were untied, supporting the inference that the defendant had unlaced his shoes to remove his pants and, being in a hurry to distance himself from the store, did not take the time to lace them up. The judge also listed instances where defense counsel was successful in point<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>ing out gaps in the prosecution\u2019s case and noted that counsel \u201cstrove mightily\u201d to show such weaknesses. Based on what he viewed as strong circumstantial evidence, the judge did not consider that the result would have been different if counsel had cross-examined Provencher about his statement to the police. We agree. There was here no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 624 n.4 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>441 Mass. 390, 400 n.8 (2004). \u201cWhere the motion judge was also the trial judge, [he] could rely on [his] familiarity with the facts of the case, as [he] did here, and [his] conclusion is entitled to \u2018special deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>449 Mass. 12, 22 (2007), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>429 Mass. 763, 771 (1999). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>449 Mass. 343, 353 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">b. The defendant\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective in not objecting to the identifications at the street comer is without merit. \u201c[S]howups of suspects to eyewitnesses of crimes have been regularly held permissible when conducted by police promptly after the criminal event.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>447 Mass. 274, 280 (2006), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, 319 </em>Mass. 472, 479 (1980). That the witnesses who saw the would-be robber did not recognize his face does not preclude their identifying other features such as his build, the color of his hair, or his complexion.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">c. The claim that counsel was ineffective in failing to seek discovery of \u201cadvisements\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> given to the witnesses concerning identification at showups and in failing to discover that only Provencher, and not the other two witnesses, received them is also without merit. This argument that had the \u201cadvisements\u201d been given to counsel, the testimony of these witnesses would have been different, is pure speculation and would likely have been seen by the jury to have no weight. This is especially tme as none of the witnesses positively identified the person on the comer as the would-be robber. There was here no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">d. In view of defense counsel\u2019s focus on the defense of misidentification throughout the trial, the failure to seek an \u201chonest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>but mistaken identification\u201d instruction did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willard, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 650, 659-660 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">e. We have examined the defendant\u2019s other claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and conclude that whether viewed singly or cumulatively, the defendant has not met his burden of showing ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-11\">The two employees also mentioned that the defendant\u2019s build matched that of the would-be robber.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b646-12\">Provencher also saw that the man he viewed on the comer had a mustache.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b646-13\">At 11:10 a.m. the jury sent the judge a note requesting the surveillance videotape, the defendant\u2019s booking tape, and \u201cmagnification of shoes.\u201d (One copy of the videotape contained a magnification of the shoes.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b647-10\">The judge did not read into the record the last phrase \u201cat 11 to one.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b647-11\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuey, </em>8 Cush. 1, 2-3 (1851); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>364 Mass. 87, 101-102 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The judge indicated that if only a deadlock were involved, the jurors would have to be asked if they all agreed to continue their deliberations. Otherwise he agreed with defense counsel that a mistrial would be required by G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 34. That statute provides: \u201cIf a jury, after due and thorough deliberation, return to court without having agreed on a verdict, the court may state anew the evidence or any part thereof, explain to them anew the law applicable to the case and send them out for further deliberation; but if they return a second time without having agreed on a verdict, they shall not be sent out again without their own consent, unless they ask from the court some further explanation of the law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The judge read aloud the definitions the juror had brought into the jury room. The definition of moral certainty included, \u201cA juror is said to be morally certain of a fact when he would act in reliance upon its truth in matters of great importance to himself.\u201d Two of the definitions of \u201creasonable doubt\u201d included a \u201cdoubt that would cause prudent people to hesitate before acting in matters of importance to themselves,\u201d or words of similar import. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, </em>391 Mass. 123, 130-131 (1984), such definitions were held to be incorrect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"> Judge: \u201cNow I have told you that what you have brought into the jury room is incorrect, not the law of the Commonwealth, I\u2019m going to ask you if you would be able to disregard what you have brought with you today and decide the case based on the law that I gave you yesterday?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Juror: \u201cI would certainly make every effort to do that, Your Honor. I had actually wanted to have clarification yesterday and \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Judge: \u201cWell, you could have sent me a note asking me to clarify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Juror: \u201cI wanted to do that, but I was overruled, Your Honor. I\u2019m truly sorry. I really was doing it in an honest effort to clarify for myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Judge: \u201cI don\u2019t doubt your sincerity and your good faith. I don\u2019t doubt that for a minute, so don\u2019t be upset. I\u2019m not going to get mad at you. Don\u2019t worry about that. I\u2019m simply trying to do the job that I have to do. So the question I have again is if you remain on this jury, would you be able to disregard what you brought here this morning and decide the case based upon the law as I have given it to you, and I will give it to you again if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Juror: \u201cI believe I would be able to do so. I believe I would be able to do so if you could particularly clarify on what points the definitions are incorrect according to the law of the Commonwealth. Is there something specific that I would need to know?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Judge: \u201cNo. I cannot go through this and point out sentence by sentence what is incorrect about it. I\u2019m telling you that it is not correct. Parts of it may be essentially correct, but parts of it are not. So you have to decide the case based upon the law as the judge gives it to you, and I\u2019m going to repeat the definition of reasonable doubt. So my question is can you decide the case based upon the law as I gave it to you, or do you think you\u2019re going to be affected by what you\u2019ve done on your own here?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">Juror: \u201cI don\u2019t know how to answer that with perfect honesty, Your Honor. I really don\u2019t I would like to think that I can completely put that out of my mind, but some of those things are some things I had known before, of course, having lived with a lawyer and consorted with lawyers anyway. So these are points that have been part of my thoughts about it, and I thought they reflected what you had instructed us. But clearly if you re-defined it for me, I might be able to see where that differs and try my best to disregard anything that does not conform with that. But I don\u2019t know that I can honestly answer that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">Judge: \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re saying to me that you cannot assure me that you can decide the case based upon the law as I give it to you; is that correct?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">Juror: \u201cAll I can assure you is that I would make every effort to do so, but I don\u2019t know that I can answer for other things that might be in my head. I would make every sincere effort to do so, but I cannot say that I could guarantee that. I don\u2019t know how . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\">General Laws c. 234A, \u00a7 39, as amended by St. 1984, c. 189, \u00a7 158, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">\u201cThe court shall have the discretionary authority to dismiss a juror at any time in the best interests of justice.

And this right will be assured in this case only if the jury begins its deliberations again from the beginning. I, therefore, instruct you to set aside and to disregard all of your past deliberations and to begin deliberations anew. This means that each of you remaining jurors must put aside and disregard the earlier deliberations just as if they had not taken place.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b653-7\">We note that in a number of cases in which the applicable rules of criminal procedure did not permit withdrawal of a juror, the withdrawal was held not to be prejudicial when the judge, prior to instructing the jury to begin their deliberations anew, engaged in the practice of asking the remaining jurors <em>individually </em>whether they could disregard their previous deliberations and begin their deliberations from the beginning. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>664 F.2d at 996; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guevara, </em>823 F.2d 446, 448 (11th Cir. 1987).
