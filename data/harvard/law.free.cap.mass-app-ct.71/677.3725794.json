Fink and David A. Fink (David), appeal from a decision of the Appellate Tax Board (board) affirming the refusal by the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) to abate the taxpayers\u2019 nonresident income tax assessments for tax years 2000-2003. The taxpayers are New Hampshire residents. David is employed by the Springfield Terminal Railway Company (Springfield Railway), a Vermont corporation that operates rail lines and related facilities throughout New England, including Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">The taxpayers claim that, for the subject tax years, income earned in Massachusetts by David while working for Springfield <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Railway is exempt from Massachusetts nonresident income tax under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11502(a) (1995), which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">\u201cNo part of the compensation [a] <em>paid by a rail carrier . . . </em>to an employee who performs [b] <em>regularly assigned duties </em>. . <em>. on a railroad [c] in more than one State </em>shall be subject to the income tax laws of any State or subdivision of that State, other than the State or subdivision thereof of the employee\u2019s residence\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The sole question at issue in this appeal is whether the particular element for tax exemption under \u00a7 11502(a), which requires that David be engaged in \u201cregularly assigned duties ... on a railroad,\u201d was met.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The board found that David did not satisfy this element because the board construed the statutory term \u201cregularly assigned duties . . . on a railroad\u201d to be limited to a railroad employee performing \u201cphysical labor\u201d on the \u201cphysical facilities and equipment used in [railroad] transportation operations.\u201d Thus, under the board\u2019s statutory interpretation, in order to qualify for the \u00a7 11502(a) tax exemption, a railroad employee would have to work in the manner of a track line fixer, maintenance person, conductor, or engineer, and be engaged in the physical repair and maintenance of the railroad, including the moving stock of trains, tracks, and other transportation equipment necessary to run the railroad. David held the position of executive vice-president. Notwithstanding the fact that in addition to in-house executive duties, David also had outside responsibility for assignments relating to the Springfield Railway trains, tracks, bridges, yards, and general equipment \u2014 which assignments placed him out on the railroad \u2014 the board determined that, because a collective bargaining agreement prohibited executives from performing physical labor on the rail system, David did not qualify for the \u00a7 11502(a) tax exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">We conclude that the board\u2019s interpretation of what constitutes \u201cregularly assigned duties . . . on a railroad\u201d \u2014 with its super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>imposed requirement of physical labor on physical things \u2014 is overly restrictive and contrary to the purposes of \u00a7 11502(a). Section 11502(a) was enacted by Congress to avoid wages paid to a railroad employee working in several States being subject to taxation by duplicative or multiple States. Furthermore, we conclude that the board\u2019s restrictive interpretation is directly at odds with congressional intent, as reflected in the legislative history underlying \u00a7 11502(a), including a 1990 amendment by which Congress broadened the scope of \u00a7 11502(a), and the railroad employees covered by this law. The board\u2019s restrictive interpretation is contrary to congressional intent. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">1. <em>Procedural and factual history. </em>We summarize the factual background in the administrative record. G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. As previously noted, during the relevant tax years, David was an executive vice-president of Springfield Railway. Parts of his regular assignments involved administrative work, managerial functions, and government relations, which David performed from the Massachusetts office, where he was present three days per week. However, other parts of David\u2019s regularly assigned duties were extra-office and involved him being out and about on the railroad, including work relating to direct oversight of the condition of the railroad trains, tracks, and general railroad equipment. Such regular work assignments and duties, which placed David outside on the railroad, included (a) inspection and oversight of the condition of the trains, tracks, and equipment, and the work being done thereon; (b) oversight of, and responsibility for, a project involving rehabilitation of Springfield Railway\u2019s main freight tracks from New Hampshire to Maine for use in connection with Amtrak passenger trains; (c) responsibility for coordinating Springfield Railway\u2019s efforts to return to normal service in the event of a train derailment, in which circumstance David would be dispatched to the derailment site to provide information directly to Springfield Railway\u2019s president; and (d) assignments on the \u201cinspection trains,\u201d which ran six times annually to test railroad conditions. Certain of these assignments placed David outside the office and on the railroad \u201ctwo to three times a week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">2. <em>The board interpretation. </em>In its analysis determining that 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11502(a) does not apply to a railroad executive such as David, who is prohibited by collective bargaining from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>performing physical labor, the board cites 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102 (1995), which sets forth separate definitions for \u201crail carrier\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u201crailroad.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the board\u2019s analysis is less than clear, the board seems to reason that, because the definition of a railroad includes physical railroad equipment (such as spurs, tracks, terminals, bridges, and other intermodal equipment), the word \u201crailroad\u201d appearing in \u00a7 11502(a) must perforce be deemed to encompass only physical railroad equipment. From this, the board reasons that a railroad employee must be engaged in physical labor on such physical railroad equipment, in order to qualify for the \u00a7 11502(a) tax exemption. According to the board\u2019s reasoning,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">\u201c[David] did not engage in the actual physical work of railroad operations, which occurred on the railroad tracks, trains and transportation facilities themselves. . . . The term \u2018railroad\u2019 embraces the physical facilities and equipment used in transportation operations by a \u2018rail carrier.\u2019 It does not apply broadly to any aspect of a rail carrier\u2019s business, as [the taxpayers] suggest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">This is ipse dixit logic, and we reject it. Simply because the term \u201crail carrier\u201d is defined in reference to the primary operational mode of \u201cproviding common carrier railroad transportation for compensation,\u201d while the term \u201crailroad\u201d is defined in a manner that makes clear that a rail carrier includes the hard physical equipment and facilities used for transportation \u201cin connection with a railroad,\u201d those definitions do not translate into a restriction on the class of railroad employees who fall within the \u00a7 11502(a) exemption. Put another way, neither of those definitions \u2014 which by the way seem congruent in that one addresses railroad transportation for compensation and the other addresses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>the kind of equipment and facilities necessary for that railroad transportation \u2014 in any way speaks to a reduction in the class of State tax protected railroad employees so as to reach only those employees who perform physical work on physical equipment on the railroad. Nor do the definitions provide a basis for divesting a railroad employee, even at the executive level, of the \u00a7 11502(a) tax exemption against multiple State taxation, so long as the executive performs regularly assigned duties on the railroad. Accord In re McCann, DTA No. 816567 (N.Y. Div. Tax App. Nov. 12, 1999) (\u201c[T]he intent of the statute is to protect employees of railroads who, in <em>any </em>capacity of their employment, could have income taxes imposed by more than one state as a result of the nature of their employment\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Department of Rev., </em>14 Or. Tax 195 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Indeed, the legislative history, to which we now turn, establishes that \u00a7 11502(a) was intended by Congress to protect railroad employees working in multiple States. A 1990 amendment effected a major change, expanding the scope of this tax exemption for railroad employees working across State boundaries. Prior to the 1990 amendment, the predecessor version of the current 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11502(a) (codified earlier as 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11504[a]),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> granted a multi-State tax exemption only to railroad employees working on rolling stock, and \u201cperforming] regularly assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>duties on a locomotive, car, or other track-borne vehicle,\u201d or \u201cengaged principally in maintaining roadways, signals, communications, and structures or in operating motortrucks from railroad terminals.\u201d This pre-1990 version of the statute echoes the board\u2019s restrictive construction of \u00a7 11502(a), which imposes as a prerequisite that the tax exemption be tied exclusively to physical labor on railroad equipment. However, in the 1990 amendment, Congress struck this limiting, labor-specific language and substituted the more all-encompassing language now appearing in \u00a7 11502(a), and which is applicable in this case. See \u00a7 7(a) of the Amtrak Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 1990 (Act), Pub. L. No. 101-322.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Contrary to the board\u2019s interpretation, this legislative history evinces no congressional intent to protect only employees who perform physical work. To the contrary, it reflects a purposeful departure by Congress from precisely the narrow scope of the exemption that existed under the prior version of the statute. Entries in the legislative history convey the intent to expand the class of railroad employees protected from multi-State taxation. The Senate Report states that \u201c[t]he Committee [on Commerce, Science and Transportation] believes rail and motor carrier employees who perform duties in more than one State should not be subject to taxation in States or subdivisions in which they do not reside.\u201d S. Rep. No. 101-44, at 3 (1989). The Congressional Record is in accord. \u201cUnder current law . . . employees in the [railroad and trucking industries] are taxed in States where they work, thus providing for multistate taxation. This is a regressive tax law which simply does not make sense. It is poor public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>policy.\u201d 136 Cong. Rec. S6098-03 (1990). \u201cThe bill prevents double taxation of transportation employees who work in more than one State.\u201d 136 Cong. Rec. H4122-02 (1990). The conference report on the 1990 amendment describes the amendment as \u201c[p]rovid[ing] that no rail employee shall be subject to income tax laws of any State . . . other than that of the employee\u2019s residence.\u201d H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 101-471, at 10 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">We note that after this 1990 Federal amendment broadened the scope of the tax exemption in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11502(a), the Massachusetts tax commissioner issued Technical Information Release (TIR) 93-6 (April 20, 1992), 2 Official MassTax Guide PWS-96 to -98 (2008), which supports the taxpayers\u2019 position in this appeal, and is contrary to the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 11502(a). The stated purpose of TIR 93-6 \u201cis to explain the Massachusetts income tax and withholding rules for employees of certain interstate motor and rail carriers,\u201d in response to Congress\u2019s passage of the Act and the amendment of the provision now codified in \u00a7 11502(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">TIR 93-6 states that, in light of this 1990 amendment to the State income tax exemption for railroad employees working in multiple States, \u201cMassachusetts may impose its income tax only on interstate motor and rail carrier employees who are Massachusetts residents or who are Massachusetts nonresidents who perform all of their regularly assigned duties in Massachusetts.\u201d The additional requirements read into \u00a7 11502(a) by the board in this case, that a railroad employee must engage in physical labor on the railroad equipment, do not appear in TER 93-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">From all that appears in the record, TIR 93-6 is still in effect. Indeed, to this day, TIR 93-6 is published as an existing agency issued document setting forth the official position of the Department of Revenue (department). See <em>infra. </em>This TIR supports the taxpayers\u2019 position and is contrary to the board\u2019s interpretation of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11502(a). Notwithstanding the present effect of TIR 93-6, the commissioner claims that TIR 93-6 should not be considered in deciding this appeal. First, the commissioner argues that a TIR is not binding. But, regardless of whether TER 93-6 is legally binding on the commissioner, \u201cit nevertheless reflects the weakness of the contrary position asserted by the commissioner in the face of the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Lowney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 718, 724 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Second, the commissioner argues that the department \u201cclarified]\u201d TER 93-6 \u201cin a further guidance that it formally published on its public website.\u201d See Department of Revenue, Guide to Personal Income Tax: Special Provisions for Certain Taxpayers: Employees of Interstate Motor and Rail Carriers (Internet posting), found at the Web site set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Internet posting is apparently only available on the department\u2019s Web site, and consists of three short paragraphs (only one of which specifically refers to railroad employees),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and instructions on filing tax returns. As a preliminary matter, we do not see how the Internet posting provides \u201cclarification\u201d or \u201cfurther guidance\u201d regarding the essential substance of TIR 93-6. To the contrary, the Internet posting, rather than revoking or modifying TER 93-6, instead cites the TIR as a corresponding reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Beyond that, even if the Internet posting was supposed to clarify, modify, or revoke TIR 93-6, it legally does not do so because the posting fails to comply with the regulatory requirements for TIR revocation or modification (including modification by clarification). The standards governing a TIR, its legal effect, and any modification or revocation thereof are set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>in 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 62C.3.1(7) (1993), and provide as follows: \u201cA T.I.R. states the official position of the Department. The Department will use a T.I.R. as precedent in the disposition of cases unless and until it is revoked or modified under 830 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 62C.3.1.(7)(e)2 or otherwise. A taxpayer may rely upon a T.I.R. unless and until it is revoked or modified.\u201d 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 62C.3.1(7)(d). We reject any claim by the board that the Internet posting modified TIR 93-6, given the noncompliance with the procedures for revoking or modifying a TIR set forth in 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 62C.3.1.(7)(e)(2), which provides as follows: \u201cThe Commissioner may revoke or modify a T.I.R. by issuing a revocation or modification in the same manner as a T.I.R. is issued.<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> A revocation or modification shall identify the T.I.R. and any other public written statements affected, and the extent of the revocation or modification.\u201d The Internet posting meets none of these criteria for revocation or modification of TIR 93-6. Thus, TIR 93-6, which supports the taxpayers\u2019 position, and upon which \u201c[a] taxpayer may rely,\u201d 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 62C.3.1(7)(d), was of legal force and effect as the \u201cofficial position\u201d of the department at the time of the proceedings involving the taxpayers in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Given the foregoing, this court cannot, as matter of law, accept the board\u2019s interpretation of the tax exemption at issue in this case. There is not present in, nor can there be engrafted upon, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11502(a), the physical equipment/physical labor requirements that the board imposed. We do not read 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11502(a) to mean that a railroad executive, with regularly assigned duties on the railroad, is excluded from the tax exemption simply because he did not engage in physical labor on physical equipment, such as running the trains or laboring to lay and solder the tracks. Nor does \u00a7 11502(a) require that the executive work a specific number of hours on specific days, as long as there are regularly assigned duties that must be performed on the railroad. On this point, in denying the \u00a7 11502(a) tax exemption, the board also cited the circumstance that David cannot be deemed to perform \u201cregularly assigned duties\u201d because there was flexibility in the timing of, and discretion in the man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>ner in which David performed, his regularly assigned duties, including regularly assigned duties delegated to him by Springfield Railway\u2019s president. We reject the board\u2019s position that \u00a7 11502(a) requires that regularly assigned duties be performed in a regimented time frame, as if a time card must be punched in accord with specific hours of work on the railroad on specific days. Rather, the controlling inquiry is whether the employee has regularly assigned duties that must be performed to accomplish the assigned duties and resultant responsibilities for work on the railroad. That an employee may have some discretion with regard to his schedule in performing his work on the railroad does not per se exclude him from the ambit of \u00a7 11502(a), as long as he had regularly assigned duties on the railroad, which the record reflects David had.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>While a court will generally tend to give deference to an administrative agency in the realm of its expertise and experience, see <em>Moot </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>448 Mass. 340, 346 (2007), \u201c[a]n incorrect interpretation of a statute by an administrative agency is not entitled to deference.\u201d <em>Kszepka\u2019s Case, </em>408 Mass. 843, 847 (1990). Because there was error of law in the denial of the tax exemption under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11502(a), we reverse the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">\n<em>Decision of Appellate Tax Board reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b710-9\">The board does not dispute that elements [a] and [c], under \u00a7 11502(a), are met, i.e\u201e that the wages paid by Springfield Railway qualify as wages from a \u201crail carrier,\u201d and that David performed duties for Springfield Railway \u201cin more than one State.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b712-7\">In 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(5), \u201crail carrier\u201d is defined as an entity \u201cproviding common carrier railroad transportation for compensation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\">In 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(6), \u201crailroad\u201d is defined to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">\u201c(A) a bridge, car float, ferry, and intermodal equipment used by or in connection with a railroad;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">\u201c(B) the road used by a rail carrier and owned by it or operated under an agreement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-11\">\u201c(C) a switch, spur, track, terminal, terminal facility, and a freight depot, yard, and ground, used or necessary for transportation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The prior version of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11502(a), which previously was codified as 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11504(a), effectuated the multi-State tax exemption through placing limitations on State tax withholdings from the wages of a railroad employee working in multiple States, and provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">\u201c(a)(1) In this subsection, an employee is deemed to have earned more than 50 percent of pay in a State or subdivision of a State if the employee</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">\u201c(A) performs regularly assigned duties on a locomotive, car, or other track-borne vehicle in at least 2 States ... or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\">\u201c(B) is engaged principally in maintaining roadways, signals, communications, and structures or in operating motortrucks from railroad terminals in at least 2 States and the percent of the time worked by the employee in one State or subdivision of that State is more than 50 percent of the total time worked by the employee while employed during the calendar year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-10\">\u201c(2) A rail, express or sleeping car carrier providing transportation . . . shall withhold from the pay of an employee referred to in paragraph (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>of this subsection only income tax required to be withheld by the laws of a State</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">\u201c(A) in which the employee earns more than 50 percent of the pay received by the employee from the carrier; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">\u201c(B) that is the residence of the employee . . . if the employee did not earn in one State or subdivision more than 50 percent of the pay received by the employee from the carrier during the preceding calendar year.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11504(a) (1988 &amp; Supp. 1989).
