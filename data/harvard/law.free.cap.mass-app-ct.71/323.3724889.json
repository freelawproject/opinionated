L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A, and of doing so in a \u201cschool zone,\u201d see G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He appeals only from the school zone conviction. He argues that (1) his motion for a required finding of not guilty should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>have been allowed because there was insufficient evidence that the preschool near which the drugs were distributed was accredited; and (2) the judge\u2019s instruction regarding distribution in a school zone was erroneous. The provision of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, regarding accreditation has not been construed with respect to the contention advanced by the defendant. However, we are not persuaded by his interpretation of that provision, and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">1. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>There was testimony that the drug sale in question took place within 1,000 feet of the Keith School, a public prekindergarten and kindergarten in Brockton that serves approximately 300 students between the ages of four and six. A representative of the Brockton school department testified in response to a question whether the Keith School was accredited: \u201cI believe it is. I\u2019m not positive though.\u201d There was no other evidence regarding the school\u2019s accreditation or lack thereof. The defendant asserts that such testimony is insufficient to warrant a finding that the school was an accredited preschool for the purposes of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">We agree that the challenged testimony could not support a finding that the school was accredited. We do not see how the witness\u2019s statement, couched in terms of a belief about which he was not positive, can be viewed as anything more than speculation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), quoting from <em>Commonwealth v. Cooper, </em>264 Mass. 368, 373 (1928) (evidence must be \u201cof sufficient force to bring minds of ordinary intelligence and sagacity to . . . persuasion . . . beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). This, however, does not end the analysis, for we do not construe the relevant statute as requiring such proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Prior to 1998, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, as inserted by St. 1989, c. 227, \u00a7 2, provided in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person who violates the provisions of [certain drug statutes] while in or on, or within one thousand feet of the real property comprising a public or private elementary, vocational, or secondary school . . . shall be punished\u201d by imposition of not less than a prescribed minimum sentence. By the time of the present case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>statute had been amended to expand the category of protected institutions by adding references to accredited preschools and accredited headstart facilities, so that the zone of protection is now defined as \u201cin or on, or within one thousand feet of the real property comprising <em>a public or private accredited preschool, accredited headstart facility, elementary, vocational, or secondary </em>school.\u201d See St. 1998, c. 194, \u00a7 146, effective July 1, 1998 (emphasis supplied). It is the defendant\u2019s position that, for the statute to operate with respect to any preschool, there must be evidence that that preschool is accredited. We do not read the statute as creating so broad a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The pre-1998 version of \u00a7 32J described the zone of protection with respect to school property only in terms of public or private elementary, vocational, or secondary schools. Such schools were not otherwise defined, and \u201caccreditation,\u201d or lack thereof, was not an issue. Accreditation became a factor only in 1998 when preschools and headstart facilities were added to elementary, vocational, and secondary schools as protected institutions. It was also at that point that the Legislature adopted the term \u201caccredited\u201d as a modifier applicable, in our view, to those newly added facilities that were <em>private </em>in nature. This appears not only from the placement of the term \u201caccredited\u201d in the amended statute, but also from a recognition that <em>public </em>facilities had been included within the zone of protection without the requirement of separate accreditation from the time of the statute\u2019s adoption in 1989. See St. 1989, c. 227, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The 1998 amendment was intended to expand the reach of the statute, not restrict it. There being no dispute that the Keith School was, at the time of the offense, both public and a preschool, an additional showing that it was accredited was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">2. <em>Instructions. </em>The judge instructed on the school zone charge that the Commonwealth must prove \u201cthat the offense was committed within one thousand feet of the grounds of a <em>public, public </em>school\u201d (emphasis supplied). She subsequently reiterated the point by stating that the Commonwealth must prove \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the offense was committed within one thousand feet of a <em>public elementary </em>school\u201d (emphasis supplied). The defendant argues that the instructions were erroneous because they omitted the requirement that there be proof that the school was accredited, and because there was no evidence that the Keith School was in fact an elementary school. There having been no objection at trial to the instructions, the defendant concedes that he is entitled to a reversal only if an error brought about a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">For the reasons stated in part 1, <em>supra, </em>accreditation of a public preschool is not a requirement, and consequently the judge correctly omitted it as an element that the Commonwealth had to prove. The defendant points out correctly that the judge misspoke in referring to the Keith School as an elementary school when the evidence showed that it was a preschool. Acknowledging that the term \u201celementary school\u201d may not encompass a \u201cpreschool,\u201d the judge\u2019s slip could not have created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The statute applies equally to public preschools and public elementary schools; the evidence warranted a finding that the Keith School is a public preschool; and the jury got the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-15\">Prior to trial, the Commonwealth dismissed a charge of conspiracy to violate a drug law, see G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Even this presupposes that there was an adequate foundation that demonstrated that the witness had knowledge regarding the subject matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\">We assume that this reflects the Legislature\u2019s conclusion that, if a facility is part of a public school system, it is to be placed within the zone of protection regardless of the quality of the institution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
