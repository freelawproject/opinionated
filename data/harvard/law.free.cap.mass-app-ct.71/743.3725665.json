The defendant asserts that the motion judge erred in rejecting a claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a pretrial <em>Bishop-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number><em>Fuller </em>motion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to obtain mental health counseling records of K,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the child victim. He further contends that newly discovered evidence concerning K\u2019s nondisclosure of alleged abuse by another man while the investigation and prosecution of the defendant was ongoing requires a new trial because that evidence would have substantiated the defendant\u2019s theory that K was fabricating her testimony. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\"><em>Background. </em>The procedural history of this case is as follows. On June 4, 1999, a Superior Court jury convicted the defendant of two charges of indecent assault and battery of a child under the age of fourteen. The jury found the defendant not guilty of rape by force of a child. On July 8,1999, the trial judge sentenced the defendant to from nine to ten years on one conviction and from eight to ten years, consecutive, on the other. On direct appeal, in a memorandum and order pursuant to rule 1:28, we affirmed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 1112 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">On April 21, 2006, the defendant filed a motion for new trial. A Superior Court judge who was not the trial judge<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> denied the motion in the margin \u201cfor the reasons set forth in the Commonwealth\u2019s opposition.\u201d The present appeal resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The jury heard the following evidence at trial. From June, 1997, through November, 1997, the defendant was K\u2019s mother\u2019s boyfriend and lived in K\u2019s home. During this period, the defendant sexually assaulted K as well as her friend A,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> both of whom were eleven years old. K and A did not report the incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">In June, 1998, more than eight months after the defendant had moved out, K\u2019s mother inquired of K whether the defendant had sexually abused her. K revealed certain aspects of the incidents to her mother, but withheld some information. Later that day, K and her mother met with a school counsellor, with whom K said she had a good relationship. At the meeting, K reported the abuse. K testified that immediately after one of the incidents that she had not reported, she had seen her older sister <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>and cousin outside of K\u2019s residence, but had not disclosed the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">On cross-examination, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel elicited from K that she liked and was close to her school counsellor, and that the counsellor was available to discuss K\u2019s problems. Before proceeding further with the questioning, trial counsel requested and obtained a sidebar conference. Counsel explained that she sought to establish that K was in psychological counsel-ling at the time of the defendant\u2019s alleged assaults and that K also had not made a complaint about the abuse to her counsellor. The trial judge, concerned about the possibility that counsel intended to use this fact to suggest that K was a \u201cdisturbed child,\u201d denied counsel the opportunity to inquire of K whether she was in mental health counselling. Both the judge and the prosecutor also noted that counsel had not filed a <em>Bishop </em>motion to obtain any information about the counselling. The judge, however, did permit trial counsel to inquire why K had never told anybody about the abuse.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following the conference, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel continued to cross-examine K. In response to counsel\u2019s questions, K testified that she had not told her older sister about any of the defendant\u2019s behavior and that she had not revealed certain details concerning the defendant \u201cputting his fingers inside of\u201d her to either her school counsellor or the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In the new trial motion, the defendant included a copy of the docket of a District Court criminal proceeding (which occurred after the defendant\u2019s trial) wherein another man was charged with six counts of statutory rape and six counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen (District Court matter). K was the alleged victim. Also accompanying the motion was a transcript excerpt of a probable cause hearing from the District Court matter, wherein K testified that although the abuse alleged in the District Court matter was occurring at the same time the defendant was being prosecuted, she did not report the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>details to any authority. K, however, did testify that she had told a friend. In conjunction with this transcript, the defendant\u2019s new counsel filed an affidavit stating that she \u201cwas informed . . . that the file in the district attorney\u2019s office reflected that the [District Court matter] had been dismissed on March 01, 2005.\u201d New defense counsel was unable to determine whether the matter had been transferred to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Ineffective assistance. </em>The defendant contends that had trial counsel obtained K\u2019s mental health counselling records pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169 (1993), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216 (1996), those records would not have revealed any complaints about the defendant\u2019s purported abuse. He claims that without them, trial counsel was unable to cross-examine K effectively on her failure to make a contemporaneous complaint to a responsible adult, and hence to argue persuasively to the jury that K\u2019s abuse claim was a fabrication.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">In a new trial motion asserting ineffective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to obtain mental health records pursuant to the then-applicable protocol,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the defendant initially must demonstrate that trial counsel could have presented a threshold factual basis for filing a motion to obtain the records. If the defendant makes this threshold showing then he must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>demonstrate, in graduating stages, (1) that the records would have been deemed discoverable under the then-existing standard; (2) that the resulting discovery process would have produced relevant and admissible documents; and (3) that the relevant and admissible documents, after review, disclosed exculpatory information material to the defendant\u2019s case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>431 Mass. 609, 614-616 (2000), <em>S.C., </em>438 Mass. 325 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bourgeois, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 433, 436-439 (2007). See also <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>449 Mass. 1029, 1030 (2007) (suggesting similar means of postconviction relief available under new protocol set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>448 Mass. 122 [2006]). Assuming arguendo that K\u2019s mental health records in this case were discoverable under the then-existing protocol, because the alleged ineffectiveness presently concerns only K\u2019s credibility, which the defendant\u2019s trial counsel already had impeached, the mental health records, even if potentially relevant and admissible, would have been cumulative, not exculpatory.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">As we stated in our memorandum and order pursuant to rule 1:28, 53 Mass. App. Ct. 1112, on direct appeal of this matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">\u201cEven if we were to assume that the judge erred in not permitting the inquiry, the defendant was not prejudiced. In his cross-examination, the defendant was able to establish that K never spoke about the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of her with her sister, with whom she was close; her school counsellor, whom she liked; or any other adult whom she saw regularly and with whom she was close. The allegation that K did not tell her mental health counsel[l]or was simply cumulative of this testimony and its impact was, thus, negligible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Although our reasoning in that decision arose in a slightly different context \u2014 addressing whether the trial judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request to inquire of K regarding what she told the mental health counsellor violated the defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination \u2014 its force is equally applicable here. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>defendant offers no compelling arguments for departing from this logic and thus cannot demonstrate that trial counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness deprived him of a substantial ground of defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">2. <em>Newly discovered evidence. </em>\u201cA defendant seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence must establish both that the evidence is newly discovered<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> and that it casts real doubt on the justice of the conviction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>450 Mass. 729, 733 (2008), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 305 (1986). The proffered evidence must be \u201cmaterial and credible.\u201d <em>Raymond, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Grace, supra. </em>\u201cMoreover, the [motion] judge must find there is a substantial risk that the jury would have reached a different conclusion had the evidence been admitted at trial\u201d or that the \u201cnew evidence would probably have been a real factor in the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d <em>Raymond, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Grace, supra </em>at 306. As in this case where the motion judge was not the trial judge, we \u201cregard ourselves in as good a position as the motion judge to assess the trial record.\u201d <em>Raymond, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Grace, supra </em>at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Here, the defendant\u2019s newly discovered evidence consisted of a transcript from the District Court matter wherein K testified that during the proceedings against the defendant, she had not reported sexual assaults, then ongoing, perpetrated by another individual. In the motion for new trial, the defendant asserted that this evidence, if presented to the jury, would have further impeached K\u2019s credibility by showing that she had failed to report sexual assaults by a different individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">However, as we discussed <em>supra, </em>trial counsel, during cross-examination, had ample opportunity to question K\u2019s credibility and did so effectively. Further evidence on the matter of K\u2019s failure to report the incidents merely would have been cumulative and thus unlikely to have been a significant factor in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>jury\u2019s deliberations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sena, </em>441 Mass. 822, 831 (2004), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lo, </em>428 Mass. 45, 53 (1998) (\u201cIt is well established that \u2018[njewly discovered evidence that tends merely to impeach the credibility of a witness will not ordinarily be the basis of a new trial\u2019 \u201d). Any value of K\u2019s testimony was for impeachment purposes, and even then, its admissibility would have been subject to the trial judge\u2019s sound discretion. We cannot reasonably or with fair assurance conclude that the evidence would have had a real impact on the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">For the first time on appeal, the defendant also argues that the dismissal of the District Court matter equates to proof that K was in fact fabricating allegations of sexual abuse against the defendant. In essence, the defendant implicitly is asserting that K is a serial fabricator who manufactured allegations of sexual abuse. This allegation, if substantiated, carries a distinctly different tenor from the cumulative, nondisclosure impeachment theory discussed <em>supra. </em>However, because the defendant did not raise this argument in the new trial motion now before us, the record on this issue is not sufficiently developed to permit adequate appellate consideration at the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">\n<em>Order denying defendant\u2019s motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-9\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b776-10\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b776-11\">The trial judge since had retired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b776-12\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The judge would have permitted counsel, if she was aware of the mental health counsellor\u2019s name, to inquire if K knew the named person as well as whether K had told this person of the abuse.
