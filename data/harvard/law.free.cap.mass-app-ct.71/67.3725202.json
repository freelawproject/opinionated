As the wife had serious facial injuries, Cuddy\u2019s first concern was for her \u201chealth and well being.\u201d He immediately called an ambulance. Thereafter, Cuddy separated the wife from the defendant so that she was about fifty feet away from him, with her back turned toward him. The wife appeared nervous and confused. When he asked her what happened, she stated that she \u201cfell down the stairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>The defendant was charged with assault and battery and, after a jury trial, was convicted of that offense. His wife, with whom he was living at the time of trial, did not appear as a witness. On appeal he claims that the admission of his wife\u2019s statement, introduced through Officer Cuddy, violated the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as set forth in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also claims there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction and that his motions for a required finding of not guilty should have been granted. We affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">1. <em>Additional evidence. </em>Officer Cuddy was the first witness at trial. After he testified that he had responded to a 911 call, the audio tape of that call was played to the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When he resumed his testimony, Cuddy recounted the evidence described at the beginning of this opinion. He stated that once the ambulance had arrived, and while the wife was being treated, he turned to question the defendant. As soon as Cuddy asked about the incident, the defendant became very angry. Cuddy smelled a strong odor of alcohol and noticed the defendant was unsteady on his feet. Cuddy had not detected any odor of alcohol on the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">When asked what had happened, the defendant explained that he had come home from work at about 4:00 p.m., and \u201cfound his wife in that condition.\u201d When questioned why it had taken him until 11:00 p.m. to call the police, the defendant gave a different explanation. He stated that he had come home at 4:00 p.m., found a condom in the room he shared with his wife, became very angry and left to get some drinks. When he came back hours later, he \u201cfound his wife in that condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Cuddy noticed a fresh cut on the knuckles of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>right hand and blood splatters on his shirt and forehead. That the cut was on the right hand was significant to Cuddy because the victim\u2019s injuries were to the left side of her face. Asked how he got the cut and the blood on his shirt and face, the defendant answered that \u201che had no idea.\u201d Cuddy arrested the defendant, and as he placed him in the back of his cruiser, the defendant turned toward his wife \u201cand yelled out, \u2018what did you tell him?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">While other officers took charge of the defendant, Cuddy went into the rooming house and up the stairs to the couple\u2019s room. There was no blood on the stairs, but there was blood in the room and in a bathroom shared with other occupants of the rooming house. In Cuddy\u2019s opinion, the wife\u2019s injuries were not consistent with falling down the stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The only additional witness, other than the defendant, was the wife\u2019s daughter. She testified that after the incident, her mother did not go home with the defendant, but came to stay with her and the wife\u2019s parents. The wife\u2019s injuries were so severe that she was bedridden, could not eat, and had to be fed a liquid diet. After about two weeks the wife received a telephone call from the defendant, immediately left, and \u201cran out the house without shoes on in a cab.\u201d Both Cuddy and the daughter had taken photographs of the injured wife, which were introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Taking the stand, the defendant stated that his wife was an alcoholic. When she was sober, they had a loving relationship, but infidelity had been a problem. When he came home on the day of the incident, he found his wife face down on the bed unconscious, fully clothed and completely inebriated, a bottle of liquor by her side. She had no injuries, but was heaving to get air. After seeing a condom wrapper in the bathroom, he left with the bottle, went to a park and drank. He subsequently went to a bar, hoping she would be there. When he returned to the apartment, he found her in need of medical attention, telephoned 911, and carried her down the stairs. Upon arriving home after being released on bail, he found a note on the bed, \u201clike a love letter.\u201d He called his wife after about two weeks; she said she wanted to return home, and she came back.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">2. <em>Admission of wife\u2019s statement. </em>Although the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>objected to the introduction in evidence of the wife\u2019s statement that she fell down the stairs on hearsay grounds,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the statement was admitted. The judge instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">\u201cThat particular statement is not offered for the truth; what the officer just testified to that he was told that she fell down the stairs. It\u2019s offered to explain and put in context what the officer\u2019s investigation was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The <em>Crawford </em>decision \u201creestablished the principle that testimonial out-of-court statements are inadmissible under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, regardless of local rules of evidence, unless the declarant is available at trial or the declarant formally is unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>445 Mass. 1, 3 (2005), cert. denied, 548 U.S. 926 (2006). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>450 Mass. 215, 223-224 (2007). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>450 Mass. 422, 426 (2008). In interpreting <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court held that statements elicited through \u201cquestioning by law enforcement agents . . . other than to secure a volatile scene or to establish the need for or provide medical care\u201d are \u201cper se testimonial and therefore implicate the confrontation clause.\u201d <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 9. In the present case, although there was originally a medical emergency, by the time the defendant\u2019s wife answered the question, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d the ambulance had been called and the urgency had subsided. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galicia, </em>447 Mass. 737, 745 (2006). Thus, the wife\u2019s answer to Cuddy\u2019s question cannot be viewed as nontestimonial on the basis set forth in <em>Gonsalves, supra, Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, supra </em>at 226, and <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 822 (2006) (statements nontestimonial if \u201cprimary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">There is, however, also a significant footnote in <em>Crawford </em>that the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Gonsalves, supra, </em>and also in the more recent cases of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, supra, </em>had no occasion to discuss, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the court in neither case was concerned with statements introduced for purposes other than their truth. In <em>Crawford, </em>after pointing out that the confrontation clause does not bar admission of a statement if the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it, the United States Supreme Court noted parenthetically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">\u201cThe Clause also does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted. See <em>Tennessee </em>v. <em>Street, </em>471 U.S. 409, 414 (1985).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-6\"><em>Crawford, supra </em>at 59-60 n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We do not believe that the Supreme Judicial Court would, on this record, hold that the confrontation clause bars the wife\u2019s statement. We note that all of the Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals (except the District of Columbia Circuit, which has not dealt with the question) and the majority of State courts have indicated, usually on the basis of the <em>Crawford </em>footnote, that statements, even if testimonial, when not offered for their truth do not implicate the confrontation clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>The trial judge in this case viewed the wife\u2019s statement as setting the context for the police investigation. Even if introduced for a different purpose, the wife\u2019s statement was not being offered to prove the truth of anything asserted therein.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As pointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>out <em>in Anderson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>417 U.S. 211, 219-220 (1974), false statements generally do not fall within the rationale of the hearsay rule. Although the <em>Anderson </em>case preceded <em>Crawford, </em>the same rationale applies after <em>Crawford. </em>See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Trala, </em>386 F.3d 536, 544-545 (3d Cir. 2004), vacated on other grounds, 546 U.S. 1086 (2006), a case also involving false statements where the court held the statements, although not relevant, were not barred by the confrontation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In sum, we consider the <em>Crawford </em>footnote applicable and conclude that the confrontation clause does not bar the wife\u2019s statement, which was introduced \u201cfor purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 59-60 n.9. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>448 Mass. 180, 188 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">4. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The judge was correct in denying the defendant\u2019s motions for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and after the close of all the evidence. The jury were warranted, based on the circumstantial evidence, in convicting the defendant of assault and battery. The defendant gave Officer Cuddy two different and inconsistent stories as to what he found when he came home at 4:00 p.m. on the day of the incident. The second explanation was given only after he was asked why he waited until 11:00 p.m. to telephone 911. He was unable to explain the cut on his knuckles or give a cause for the blood splatters on his face and clothing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When questioned by the police, he was angry. When he was being placed in the police cruiser, he yelled to the vic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>tim, \u201c[Wjhat did you tell him?\u201d These circumstances, as well as the blood in the room and bathroom, were sufficient to warrant the jury finding under the standard of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), that the defendant caused the severe injuries to his wife and to convict him of assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right. . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him. . . .\u2019\u2019In cases involving the hearsay rule and its exceptions, the Supreme Judicial Court has \u201cheld that the protection provided by art. 12 [of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights] is coextensive with the guarantees of the Sixth Amendment . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeOliveira, </em>447 Mass. 56, 57 n.l (2006). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>450 Mass. 215, 223 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The record on appeal does not include a transcript of the tape; instead, there is a notation that the tape is not audible enough to be transcribed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Unfortunately, the conference at side bar could not be transcribed.

Peele\u2019s confession was introduced to show there were differences between the two confessions and that the defendant\u2019s contained details of the crime not in Peele\u2019s, which, the prosecutor argued, the defendant knew because he participated in the murder. <em>Id. </em>at 412. The Supreme Court held: \u201cThe nonhearsay aspect of Peele\u2019s confession \u2014 not to prove what happened at the murder scene but to prove what happened when [defendant] confessed \u2014 raises no Confrontation Clause concerns.\" <em>Id. </em>at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">In a similar case, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brum, </em>438 Mass. 103, 116-117 (2002), albeit prior to <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court held, citing <em>Tennessee </em>v. <em>Street, supra, </em>that two statements offered not for their truth but to show that the defendant and his brother John had given identically false accounts of the same precise details were nonhearsay and did not violate the confrontation clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b103-10\">See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>419 F.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1189 (2006); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Matera, </em>489 F.3d 115, 122 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 128 S.
