Evans, stemming from a 1998 automobile accident involving the plaintiff, Joao M. Raposo (Raposo).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At issue is the propriety of the denial, on waiver grounds, of Evans\u2019s second motion to dismiss for insufficiency of service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">Evans argues on appeal that (1) the Superior Court judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>erred by denying the motion to dismiss because the defense of insufficiency of service of process had not been waived; and (2) service was insufficient under Mass.R.Civ.P. 4, as amended, 402 Mass. 1401 (1988). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\"><em>Background. </em>This case arises out of a motor vehicle accident that occurred on May 23, 1998. The complaint was filed on April 12, 2001, against Danny M. Evans, Kristin M. (Caliri) Te\u00f1e, and Charles R. Caliri.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A deputy sheriff served Evans by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint on May 8, 2001, at what was purported to be Evans\u2019s last and usual place of abode. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 4(d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The deputy sheriff also mailed Evans a copy of the summons and complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Evans, whose insurer was insolvent, was initially defaulted for failing to respond to the complaint. His defense was subsequently assumed by the Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund (Fund),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which, on his behalf, filed, on August 22, 2001, a motion to vacate default and file late answer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That motion was allowed. In the answer filed on August 22, 2001, Evans\u2019s attorney asserted a host of boilerplate defenses,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> including insuf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>ficiency of service of process under Mass.R.Civ.P 12(b)(5), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), but did not press that issue through a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The matter was stayed from January, 2002, until September, 2003, upon the joint motion of the parties, while the Raposos, by mandate of G. L. c. 175D, exhausted all other insurance benefits before pursuing an action against the Fund. In February of 2004, the Raposos\u2019 new counsel, after being informed by Evans\u2019s counsel that there might be a problem with service,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> attempted to re-serve Evans through the registry of motor vehicles (registry).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On September 13, 2004, Evans\u2019s attorney, again averring that he could not locate Evans, filed his first motion to dismiss \u201cfor failure to effectuate service within the time prescribed by the Statute of Limitations,\u201d and for failure to serve Evans within ninety days after the filing of the complaint under Mass.R.Civ.P 4(j). The Raposos successfully argued that Evans\u2019s attorney had not \u201cprovided any evidence to rebut the sheriff\u2019s Affidavit and Return of Service that [Evans] was properly served.\u201d The motion was denied on November 9, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The case proceeded, and the parties agreed to a discovery schedule. On March 2, 2005, a trial date was set. The Raposos filed an affidavit of written notice of intent to offer medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>bills as evidence on November 16, 2005. On November 30, 2005, the Raposos moved for default judgment due to Evans\u2019s failure to appear at depositions or to respond to discovery; Evans opposed the motion. On January 12, 2006, the Raposos filed a motion to compel Evans\u2019s presence at deposition and a motion to compel further discovery, which Evans also opposed. On January 23, 2006, the parties filed a joint pretrial memorandum. On February 1, 2006, the Raposos filed a \u201creapplication for default for failure to\u201d comply with discovery requests pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.R 33(a)(4), as appearing in 436 Mass. 1401 (2002). The motion for default judgment and the motion to compel were denied, \u201cin light of re-application for Final Judgment against Defendant Evans pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.R 33(a)(4).\u201d On February 24, 2006, Evans was defaulted for \u201cfailure ... to respond to discovery.\u201d On February 27, 2006, a default judgment under Mass.R.Civ.P. 33(a) was entered \u201con liability only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">On March 6, 2006, nearly eighteen months after the filing of his first motion to dismiss, Evans\u2019s attorney filed a second motion to dismiss for insufficiency of service,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> on the same grounds as the first motion to dismiss, but this time adding that the initial service on Evans had been made upon a commercial establishment (a restaurant), which, if true, could not have been Evans\u2019s last and usual abode.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> After a hearing, the judge denied the motion on August 1, 2006, concluding that Evans had waived and abandoned the defense of insufficiency of process, notwithstanding having pleaded it in his answer, by his failure to meaningfully pursue it for more than five years, until after the final pretrial conference and after his participation in discovery and motion practice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Thereafter, damages were assessed against Evans.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> After entry of final judgment on November 28, 2006, Evans appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The issue is whether a defendant who challenges service of process in his answer has the obligation to move to dismiss on those grounds within a reasonable time, prior to substantially participating in discovery and litigating the merits of the case, and whether the defense is waived for failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">While no .Massachusetts cases have addressed this issue, \u201c[w]e are . . . guided by judicial interpretation of the parallel Federal rule, absent compelling reasons to the contrary or significant differences in content.\u201d <em>Shuman </em>v. <em>The Stanley Works, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 951, 952-953 (1991). See <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>399 Mass. 585, 589 (1987). Rule 12(h)(1) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 757 (1974), which uses the same wording as its Federal counterpart, provides that the defense of \u201cinsufficiency of service of process ... is waived . . . if it is neither made by motion . . . nor included in a responsive pleading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">While rule 12(h)(1) does not explicitly impose an obligation to file a timely motion to dismiss for lack of proper service (despite preserving the defense in an answer), generally the few Federal courts that have addressed the issue have imposed such an obligation. These courts have held that a defendant\u2019s failure to move to dismiss for improper service within a reasonable time and prior to participating in discovery and litigating the merits of the case constitutes a waiver of the defense.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Datskow </em>v. <em>Teledyne, Inc., </em>899 F.2d 1298, 1303 (2d Cir.), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>denied, 498 U.S. 854 (1990) (defendant waived proper service by participating in \u201cscheduling discovery and motion practice\u201d); <em>Continental Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>10 F.3d 1293, 1297 (7th Cir. 1993) (despite pleading defense of insufficiency of service, by participating in discovery and motion practice, defense was waived); <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Northern Dutchess Hosp., </em>106 F.R.D. 477, 481 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (defense of insufficiency of service of process must be raised \u201cin a reasonably timely manner or it is waived\u201d). See also <em>Marcial Ucin, S.A. </em>v. <em>S.S. Galicia, </em>723 F.2d 994, 996 (1st Cir. 1983), quoting from <em>Neirbo Co. </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Corp., </em>308 U.S. 165, 168 (1939) (waiver of defense of lack of personal jurisdiction may occur \u201cby failure [to] assert [it] seasonably\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">In <em>Burton, </em>106 F.R.D. at 481, while the defense of improper service was pleaded, a motion to dismiss was not filed until more than three and one-half years after the commencement of the action. During those years, the parties attended conferences and participated in discovery and motion practice. <em>Id. </em>at 480. The court held that the defendant \u201cshould have moved at the earliest possible opportunity to dismiss the complaint,\u201d reasoning that \u201ca prompt motion to dismiss would have saved all parties and the court the expense of years of discovery, pre-trial conferences and motions relating to discovery and to the merits of the complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Similarly, in <em>Continental Bank, </em>10 F.3d at 1297, \u201cthe defendants fully participated in litigation of the merits for over two-and-a-half years without actively contesting personal jurisdiction.\u201d During that time the defendants \u201cparticipated in lengthy discovery, filed various motions and opposed a number of motions filed by the [plaintiff].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court held that the defendants waived the defense because \u201cthey did not comply with the spirit of the rule, which is \u2018to expedite and simplify proceedings ....\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Yeldell </em>v. <em>Tutt, </em>913 F.2d 533, 539 (8th Cir. 1990). In <em>Datskow, </em>899 F.2d at 1303, the defendant only participated in the administration of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>for a few months. During that time, the \u201c[defendant attended the conference with the magistrate and participated in scheduling discovery and motion practice.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Despite the short time period, the court applied similar reasoning, holding that the defense was waived because the issue could have easily been cured if the defendant had promptly complained. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Conversely, other Federal courts have chosen not to apply this obligation. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Kuwahara Co., Ltd., 717 </em>F. Supp. 525, 527 (W.D. Mich. 1989) (\u201c[t]he conduct on the merits that prompted the waiver of jurisdictional defense holdings in the New York cases was far more extensive and prejudicial than that of [the defendant] in this case\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ziegler Bolt &amp; Parts Co., </em>19 Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 507, 520 (1995) (\u201c[t]his Court rejects the adoption of court-imposed obligations unauthorized by the rules that may effectively force defendants to waive their legitimate affirmative defenses . . . which have been properly asserted in their answers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">We find persuasive the reasoning that requires action within a reasonable time. A defendant who challenges service of process in his answer must move to dismiss within a reasonable time, prior to substantially participating in discovery and litigating the merits of the case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This will save the parties and the courts substantial time, expense, and effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Here, Evans waived the defense. Although Evans averred in his answer that service was insufficient, he failed to file a motion to dismiss until more than three years after filing his answer. Even then, he filed a bare bones motion, without evidentiary support, which was denied. Nearly eighteen months later, almost one and one-half months after filing the joint pretrial memorandum, a second motion was brought, this time with compelling evidence of service being made, not to an abode, but to a restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">This second motion, however, came almost five years after the answer was filed, and after Evans agreed to a discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>schedule and participated in motion practice as well as the final pretrial conference. As the judge in his memorandum of decision on the second motion to dismiss stated, \u201c[although Evans noted that there was insufficient service of process several times during the evolution of this case, Evans failed to channel his efforts and pursue this defense in any meaningful way for a period of several years.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">As the court in <em>Burton, </em>106 F.R.D. at 481, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">\u201cDefendants have literally complied with Rule 12(h)(1) by asserting the defense .... These responsive pleadings, however, do not preserve the defense in perpetuity. Defendants are required at some point to raise the issue by motion for the court\u2019s determination. After preserving the jurisdictional defense in their answers, defendants should have sought discovery immediately to ascertain whether service was proper. If they discovered that service was not proper, defendants should have moved at the earliest possible opportunity to dismiss the complaint. This would have allowed plaintiff to re-serve the summons and complaint before the expiration of the statute of limitations. . . . Even if plaintiff could not have re-served the summons and complaint within the limitations period, a prompt motion to dismiss would have saved all parties and the court the expense of years of discovery, pre-trial conferences and motions relating to discovery and to the merits of the complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-16\">The complaint alleged that, while driving on Route 93 South in Braintree, \u201cEvans failed to maintain control of his vehicle so as to cause it to collide into the rear of the vehicle operated by [Raposo].\u201d The pleadings indicate that Evans\u2019s car struck Raposo\u2019s car, which was stopped in the breakdown lane. Evans was allegedly cut off by a car driven by Kristin M. Caliri. As a result, Raposo suffered a broken jaw, four fractured ribs, and the loss of a tooth. He was out of work from May 23, 1998, to July 6, 1998, and claimed lost wages of $5,500, and $42,548.08 in medical bills.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Charles Caliri was the owner of the car driven by Kristin Caliri when the accident occurred. Kristin and Charles were uninsured, and the claims against them were not pursued. Raposo recovered $20,000 in uninsured benefits from his own insurance company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Rule 4(d) provides that successful service occurs \u201c[u]pan an individual by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to him personally; or by leaving copies thereof at his last and usual place of abode; or by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to an agent authorized by appointment or by statute to receive service of process, provided that any further notice required by such statute be given.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\">\u201cThe Fund is a statutorily mandated, nonprofit, unincorporated association of all insurers writing certain kinds of direct insurance in the Commonwealth. . . . [General Laws c.] 175D prescribes a procedure for the formation and maintenance of the Fund in order that it will be available to settle certain unpaid claims which arise out of and are within the coverage of an insurance policy issued by an insolvent insurer.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>373 Mass. 798, 799 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Evans\u2019s attorney has never met his client. Neither party has raised, and we do not address, the issue regarding the obligations of the Fund to defend an unavailable insured, or the propriety of an attorney filing an answer, motion, or appeal on behalf of a client he has not met. Lastly, we were not provided with a copy of Evans\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b412-11\">The defendant filed nine boilerplate defenses: (1) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, Mass.R.Civ.P 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>(1974); (2) insufficient process, Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(4), 365 Mass. 755 (1974); (3) insufficient service of process, Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(5), 365 Mass. 755 (1974); (4) the negligence of Raposo exceeded that of Evans, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85; (5) the damages assessed against Evans should be reduced by the percentage of Raposo\u2019s negligence, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85; (6) the injuries to the Raposos were not causally related to any negligence of Evans; (7) the injuries to the Raposos did not exceed the threshold required by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6D; (8) Evans is entitled to an offset of personal injury protection benefits paid to Raposo under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M; and (9) the Raposos must first avail themselves of all other collateral sources of insurance, G. L. c. 175D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b413-14\">Defense counsel sent a letter to the Raposos\u2019 counsel on October 14, 2003, stating that he did not know where Evans was and expressing his belief that Evans had not been properly served. The defense argued the same in May, 2004, in an opposition to the Raposos\u2019 motion to compel Evans\u2019s attendance at deposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b413-15\">A deputy sheriff certified that service was made on the registry on February 12, 2004. The return indicated that process was served on the registry and forwarded by mail to the last address for Evans appearing in the registrar\u2019s records, in accordance with G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 3C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The motion was served on February 22, 2006, and docketed on March 6, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Evans attached to his second motion to dismiss an affidavit from Michael Duni, the owner of the property at 237 Hamilton Street, Saugus, where Evans was purportedly served. In that affidavit, Duni states that the property is, and was in May of 2001, a commercial business known as \u201cMike\u2019s Roast Beef\u201d or \u201cMike\u2019s Place,\u201d and that \u201c[tjhere is no Apartment #2 at that address.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Evans served his second motion to dismiss on February 22, 2006. The court entered a judgment of liability on February 27, 2006, and denied the second motion to dismiss on August 1, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b414-11\">It is unclear from the record to what extent, or if at all, Evans initiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>discovery or complied with the Raposos\u2019 discovery requests. The record indicates that the Raposos filed interrogatories and that depositions of Evans were scheduled, but that Evans never appeared for depositions or filed responses to interrogatory requests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Damages were assessed in the amount of $87,000 ($120,000 less an offset of $33,000 for uninsured motorist benefits, personal injury protection benefits, and medical payments).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b415-10\">These cases discuss Fed.R.Civ.R 12(h)(1) and involve motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction due to insufficiency of service of process. See <em>Datskow </em>v. <em>Teledyne, Inc., </em>899 F.2d 1298 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 854 (1990); <em>Continental Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>10 F.3d 1293 (7th Cir. 1993); <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Northern Dutchess Hosp., </em>106 F.R.D. 477 (S.D.N.Y. 1985). The defendants in those cases essentially argued that as they were not properly served, the court did not have personal jurisdiction. The issue litigated was whether the defendants waived their right to challenge proper service \u2014 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>by extension, personal jurisdiction \u2014 through their conduct and participation in the litigation. Insufficiency of process and lack of personal jurisdiction are defenses that can be waived under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(1) and Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(1) if not timely raised by motion or responsive pleading.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b417-9\">What is a reasonable amount of time is determined by the facts of the case and is left to the discretion of the court. Compare <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Kuwahara Co., Ltd., </em>717 F. Supp. at 528 (\u201c[I]t would be unduly harsh to penalize [the defendant] by finding it waived its jurisdictional objection by engaging in a moderate amount of pretrial activity for a relatively short period of time after properly raising that objection\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The grounds relied on in Evans\u2019s two motions to dismiss were nearly identical, except that the second motion added the crucial averment that the address at which Evans was initially served was a business and could not have been an abode. We do not address the effect of the failure to include that averment in the first motion when the judge considered the second motion. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(g) and 12(h)(1)(A), 365 Mass. 757 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
