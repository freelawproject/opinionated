L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a); unlawful possession of ammunition without an identification (F.I.D.) card, in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6); and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A(6)3 He now appeals from those convictions, as well as from the denial of his pro se motion for a new trial. He raises a variety of claims, principally involving photographic identification evidence and severance. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\"><em>Background. </em>On January 13, 2004, near a Springfield car wash and gasoline station, from different vantage points, three eyewitnesses \u2014 Stuart MacGregor, James DeGray, and Fernando Basile \u2014 observed a gun fight break out between a shooter from a green Honda Accord automobile, later identified as Israel Cardona, and a single shooter from a silver Acura vehicle. It was not disputed that when arriving at the scene, the defendant had been seated in the front passenger seat of the silver Acura, and that his brother, Vito Resto, a codefendant as trial began, had been driving.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At trial, the primary issue was the identity of the shooter from the silver Acura who engaged in the firelight with Cardona. By the time of trial, Cardona, who refused to testify, had already pleaded guilty. As trial began, the jury were thus presented with the question whether the defendant (and his brother Resto) had assaulted Cardona with a firearm, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A(6), and whether, being armed with a firearm, they had assaulted Cardona with intent to murder him, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18(6). At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the judge entered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>required finding of not guilty for Resto, leaving the defendant to proceed alone. The defendant testified, and was the lone defense witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Photographic evidence issues. </em>The defendant argues that the admission of photographic evidence at trial, together with accompanying police testimony, constituted mug shot evidence impermissibly informing the jury that he had a prior criminal history and propensity for criminality. He contends that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object when the evidence was introduced created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice and amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. He further contends that counsel was ineffective for not accepting the judge\u2019s offer to provide immediately a curative jury instruction after the police testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must demonstrate that there has been (i) \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u201d and (ii) that this incompetence \u201chas likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rubeck, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 396, 398 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 757, 760 (2002), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). We note at the outset that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is usually \u201cbest left for resolution in the first instance by the trial judge on a motion for new trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adamides, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 344 (1994), quoting from <em>Gibney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>375 Mass. 146, 148 (1978). \u201c[O]ur case law strongly disfavors raising ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zinser, </em>446 Mass. 807, 809 n.2 (2006), because this issue \u201cis most appropriately left to the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 548, 553 (2006). However, because here the trial record alone permits us to address the second prong of <em>Saferian, </em>and thus to dispose of the defendant\u2019s claim, we resolve the issue on direct appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adamides, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">In this case, the Springfield police department compiled a photographic array of possible suspects to show to the three eyewitnesses. The array included frontal individual photographs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>of eight men, each standing in front a cinder block wall. The top of each page of the array was labeled \u201cSpringfield Police Department Photo Array Images Associated with Case Number 04-228-AR.\u201d Officer Reid testified that he obtained the defendant\u2019s picture from a section of the police database containing photographs of people with past arrests. He stated that \u201cin the computer system of the police department, they have a section of whoever was arrested[.] [A] photograph is taken of them and through this Records Management System, there is a particular field to recreate photo arrays.\u201d On the night of the shooting, from the array (which did not include a photograph of Resto), eyewitnesses DeGray and MacGregor identified the defendant as the shooter. The array was entered into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">In responding to the contention that the photographs constituted inadmissible mug shot evidence, which should have drawn an objection from counsel, the Commonwealth claims, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamont L., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 748, 752 (2002), <em>S.C., </em>438 Mass. 842 (2003), that \u201cnone of the photographs included in the array had any markings identifying them as mugshots.\u201d This claim fails to recognize that the array evidence cannot be viewed in isolation, but must be assessed in the context of the accompanying testimony. It is true that the photographs here did not contain the common attributes of mug shots, such as \u201cheight scales in the background or chest plates that bear a name or number,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 449, 452 (1990), see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass. 589, 594 (2005), and would, by themselves, likely be deemed sufficiently sanitized. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 451-453. However, the accompanying police testimony, explaining that the photographs were compiled from a database of those with a prior arrest history, unduly raised the taint of prior criminal activity. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Payton, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 595 (1993) (\u201cno testimony . . . that the photograph was taken in connection with any other criminal event\u201d). In sum, the jurisprudence governing the admission of mug shots is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">\u201cIt is <em>\u00e1 </em>matter of fairly common knowledge that the central photographic files maintained by police do not . . . contain the likenesses of any save those who have had some contact with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>criminal law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>357 Mass. 45, 48-49, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 837 (1970). Accordingly, the courts have recognized that there is a \u201crisk that any use in evidence of photographs . . . ordinarily used in police identification files will suggest to the jury that the defendant may have a prior criminal record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gerald, </em>356 Mass. 386, 388 (1969). To minimize this risk of prejudice, the Supreme Judicial Court has concluded that \u201c[mjugshots may be admitted in evidence where \u2018[1] the prosecution shows some need for their introduction, [2] they are offered in a form that does not imply a prior criminal record, and [3] the manner of their introduction does not call attention to their source.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>447 Mass. 274, 286 (2006), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McAfee, </em>430 Mass. 483, 493 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The police testimony here arguably violated the second and third <em>Martin </em>prongs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As has been noted, that testimony about the array, referencing the criminal arrest database, strongly suggested that the defendant possessed a criminal record, and also showed the origins of the photographs. Moreover, Officer Reid testified that he showed this array to the eyewitnesses on the very same night that the firefight occurred. Another police officer testified that the eyewitnesses were shown the array rather than the defendant himself due to the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s injuries at that time. The jury were therefore fully aware that the detective compiled the array at a time when the defendant was hospitalized and could not possibly have been available to be photographed in front of a cinder block wall. This strongly suggested that the police already possessed a photograph of the defendant prior to the January 13, 2004, shooting. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gee, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 154, 158 (1994) (placards appearing in photographs impermissibly suggested that police were in possession of defendant\u2019s picture due to criminal activity prior to offense at issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Whether or not the prosecution intentionally elicited this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>introduction of the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts, this testimony was inappropriate. \u201cEvidence of prior bad acts may not be admitted to prove bad character or criminal propensity . . <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kent K., 421 </em>Mass. 754, 756 (1998), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>425 Mass. 361, 370 (1997). While the evidence of prior bad acts may have been introduced unintentionally, the circumstances in which the evidence was admitted tended to demonstrate criminal propensity, which is prohibited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kent K., supra </em>at 756.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The detective\u2019s testimony did not draw an objection from counsel. The judge, however, offered to give a curative instruction immediately.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Trial counsel twice declined, stating that he preferred to have the instruction given with the general instructions. Accordingly, at the end of the trial, in his instructions to the jury, the judge attempted to cure any problems with the array and the accompanying police testimony. He told the jury, tracking language cited approvingly in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blaney, </em>387 Mass. 628, 636 n.7, 639 (1982): <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>The Commonwealth contends that this instruction was sufficient, noting that \u201c[j]uries are presumed to follow the instructions given them.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Petersen, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 49, 54 (2006), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>425 Mass. 830, 840 (1997). Had there been no reference by the detective to the defendant\u2019s prior criminal history, this limiting instruction might ordinarily be sufficient to safeguard against any potential prejudice. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blaney, </em>387 Mass. at 639. Here, however, the police officer testified that the array was compiled from those individuals who had prior arrests. As such, we think that under the circumstances, a stronger instruction was required directing the jury to ignore the testimony insofar as it indicated that the defendant had a prior arrest record. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kent K., </em>427 Mass. at 756-757 (police testimony that photographs shown to victim\u2019s mother were taken from persons who had prior arrests was improper propensity evidence; judge\u2019s curative instruction, given immediately after objectionable testimony, adequately Instructed jury to ignore that testimony).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gee, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 160 (instruction insufficient to overcome prejudice from combined effect of unsanitized mug shots and police testimony concerning photographs). That being said, no such stronger instruction was sought here, and we must determine whether counsel\u2019s failure to propose an appropriate instruction \u201cdeprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d We determine that it did not.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>\u201c[Y]ou must not draw any inference against the defendant simply because the police had his picture. Police departments collect pictures of many people from many sources for many different reasons, and you must not speculate what the reason may have been in this case. I instruct you in the strongest possible terms that the mere fact that the police may have had the defendant\u2019s picture does not mean that he committed this or any other crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Unlike in some cases, here there was very strong evidence (independent of the photographic evidence) not only placing the defendant at the scene of the crime, but also substantiating his role as shooter. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 396 (1995) (where evidence was not overwhelming and was based solely on witness\u2019s identification of defendant, admission of mug shots listing unrelated criminal activity created substantial risk of miscarriage of justice). While there was some divergence in the testimony of the eyewitnesses who viewed the incident from different vantage points, in basic respect that eyewitness testimony showed that there was a shooting involving two shooters, one who got out of a silver Acura, and the other who got out of a green Honda Accord. Both of the shooters were injured, and there was no evidence that any of the other people present at the scene were wounded. Immediately after the shooting, the green Honda Accord was driven to Mercy Hospital, where all of the eyewitness identified Cardona as being one of the shooters. The other vehicle, the silver Acura, was driven to Baystate Medical Center (Baystate). Officer Moran, who drove to Baystate in response to a report of a shooting, saw the wounded defendant at the entrance, in the passenger .seat of the Acura, and the defendant\u2019s brother, Resto, who was not injured, in the driver\u2019s seat. At Baystate, the crime scene eyewitnesses identified the silver Acura, and none of them identified Resto as the shooter. While the eyewitnesses did not view the defendant at the hospital because he had been seriously injured and was being treated, the jury could have considered that the defendant was the only remaining injured person present at the crime scene \u2014 where there were only two shooters and they were the only individuals injured.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>their assessment of the evidence, the jury could have inferred that the defendant was, indeed, the other shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Quite apart from the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, we also note that the police officer\u2019s reference to how the mug shot array was compiled was fleeting, did not identify what sort of prior offense may have been implicated by the prior arrest (or its seriousness), see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kent K., </em>427 Mass. at 757, and was not mentioned in closing argument. Indeed, there was no reference to \u201cmug shot\u201d in the closing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass. at 594. In sum, because the defendant has not demonstrated, as required by the second prong of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. at 96, that counsel\u2019s performance \u201clikely deprived [him] of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence,\u201d the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is unavailing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rubeck, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">2. <em>Mistaken identification instruction. </em>The defendant challenges the adequacy of the jury instruction on honest mistaken identification. \u201cFairness to a defendant compels the trial judge to give an instruction on the possibility of an honest but mistaken identification when the facts permit it and when the defendant requests it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pressley, </em>390 Mass. 617, 620 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alleyne, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 28, 31 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Here, the defendant specifically requested an honest mistake instruction, and the judge so instructed the jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">After hearing this instruction, defense counsel requested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>the judge specifically instruct the jury as follows: \u201cEven if you find that the witness is sincere and honest in his belief that the defendant committed the offense, you must still return a verdict of not guilty unless you\u2019re convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the identification is accurate.\u201d The judge, concluding that he had already given this instruction using different language, noted the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">We review for prejudicial error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass. at 591.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Since this case hinged on the identification of the defendant, a good faith mistaken identification instruction was warranted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pressley, </em>390 Mass. at 620. The judge\u2019s instruction adequately and at length covered the very issue the defendant requested the court to address. The judge specifically noted the possibility of \u201chonest mistake,\u201d noted that the witnesses might have been \u201cconfused,\u201d and informed the jury that they could not convict the defendant unless they believed \u201cthe accuracy of the identification\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cThe judge is not required to grant a particular instruction so long as the charge, as a whole, adequately covers the issue.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass. at 597, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>411 Mass. 719, 739 (1992), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>396 Mass. 306, 316 (1985). While the judge did not use the exact wording requested by defense counsel, his instructions completely addressed the issue. As the judge gave a sufficient <em>Pressley </em>honest mistake instruction, there was no error, let alone prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">3. <em>Failure to sever the codefendant\u2019s trial. </em>The defendant argues that the trial judge erred in denying the motions for severance presented by both codefendants before trial began. This claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>\u201cA motion to sever is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collado, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 464, 468 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>426 Mass. 675 (1998), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>387 Mass. 644, 658 (1982). Failure to sever a codefendant\u2019s trial constitutes an abuse of discretion when the codefendants\u2019 defenses are so antagonistic that \u201c[t]he only realistic escape for either defendant [is] to blame the other.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, supra </em>at 659. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bienvenu, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 632, 637 (2005). See also Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 20.31 (3d ed. 2007). However, if a defendant simply stands a better chance of acquittal if tried alone, severance is not required. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Twing, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 75, 79 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">\u201cThe denial of a requested severance does not require reversal unless the request is made at a time when the necessity for severance has been firmly established. A premature request for severance, not renewed when the necessity to sever has been established, is not sufficient.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, supra </em>at 659-660. Here, at the pretrial stage, a motion judge and then the trial judge ruled appropriately that the question of severance was premature,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and suggested that it be revisited if either or both defendants decided to testify.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In opening statements, the Commonwealth stated that the evidence would show that the defendant had stepped out of a silver Acura and shot Cardona, and that the defendant\u2019s brother, Resto, had driven the Acura and had also taken the defendant to the hospital after he was shot. In their respective openings, counsel for Resto and the defendant did not offer mutually antagonistic theories supportive of severance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">In any event, the severance issue became moot when the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>judge granted Resto\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty, at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. In essence, the defendant\u2019s request for a separate trial was realized, particularly where, as here, there was no prejudicial spillover arising from Resto\u2019s status as a codefendant. Indeed, the defendant took the stand and testified that his brother was the shooter.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Since it was no longer a joint trial, the question whether any resulting prejudice \u2014 if there was any \u2014 was \u201cso compelling that it prevent[ed] [the] defendant from obtaining a fair trial\u201d was eliminated. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 940, 944 (1998), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 960 (1983). Although the defendant testified that it was Resto, and not he, who had fired the weapon, the jury were not presented with a case of \u201cantagonistic\u201d or mutually exclusive defenses. The jury had only to decide the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amazeen, </em>375 Mass. 73, 81 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardone, </em>406 Mass. 123, 129-130 (1989). The jury rejected the defendant\u2019s testimony, and the evidence supports the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">4. <em>Other issues, </em>a. <em>Denial of defendant\u2019s pro se motion for new trial. </em>On September 12, 2005, the defendant filed a pro se <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>motion for new trial pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979), arguing that he had had ineffective assistance of counsel because of poor communication, that Cardona should not have been allowed to invoke his right to remain silent when giving testimony out of the hearing of the jury, and that the Commonwealth withheld exculpatory evidence (the nature of which is not clear). The motion was not supported by affidavit or other corroborating documents. On September 14, 2005, the motion judge (who was also the trial judge) denied the motion without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">We review the decision of the judge for abuse of discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>443 Mass. 213, 224-225 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 125 (1990) (\u201cA motion for a new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the judge . . . and the judge\u2019s disposition of the motion will not be reversed unless it is manifestly unjust . . . or unless the trial was infected with prejudicial constitutional error\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Despres, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 645, 649-650 (2007), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>446 Mass. 435, 441 (2006) (\u201cWe review the denial of a motion for a new trial \u2018only to determine whether there has been a significant error of law or other abuse of discretion\u2019 \u201d). In this case, as the motion judge and the trial judge were one and the same, we extend special deference. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>360 Mass. 531, 543 (1971). The motion judge may rely on his knowledge of the trial events when ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>384 Mass. 262, 269 (1981). As the defendant did not provide sufficient credible information to support his pro se claims for a new trial, the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">b. <em>Carrying a firearm and ammunition. </em>Regarding his convictions of unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), and unlawful possession of ammunition in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(/z), the defendant argues that the instruction that the Commonwealth need not prove that the defendant did not have a license to carry a firearm and ammunition or an F.I.D. card shifted the burden of proof, thereby violating his due process rights. This claim has no merit. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>372 Mass. 403, 406 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farley, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 854, 861-862 (2005).
