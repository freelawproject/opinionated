Aponte, was convicted of receiving a stolen motor vehicle. G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28(a). The defendant appeals, arguing (1) that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove that the Honda Elite 44 (the vehicle) was a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28(a); (2) that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to warrant a finding that the defendant knew that the motor vehicle had been stolen; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>(3) that the trial judge improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant to prove that the vehicle was not a motor vehicle under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\"><em>Background. </em>The trial judge, sitting as fact finder, could have found the following facts. On June 10, 2005, Pablo Terr\u00f3n reported that his vehicle had been stolen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After his vehicle had been stolen, Terr\u00f3n observed someone other than the defendant riding it outside his neighborhood.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 14, 2005, Holyoke police Officer Henry J. Wielgosz, Jr., responded to a report of a stolen vehicle. Officer Wielgosz met Terr\u00f3n and accompanied him to Biting Circle where Terr\u00f3n reported his vehicle had been located. Upon arrival, Officer Wielgosz and Terr\u00f3n observed the defendant seated on a Honda Elite 44, wearing a helmet.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Officer Wielgosz approached the defendant, asked the defendant to come with him, and placed the defendant in his cruiser. Officer Wielgosz then continued to investigate the ownership of the Honda Elite 44. Terr\u00f3n produced a bill of sale for the vehicle. The identification numbers on the bill of sale matched those on the recovered vehicle. At the time that it was recovered, part of the vehicle had been painted yellow and part had been painted with grey primer. The ignition key was missing, and in its place were two bare wires.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Terr\u00f3n testified that he had been fixing the vehicle when it was stolen, and that it had \u201clots of things wrong with it.\u201d According to Terr\u00f3n, before the vehicle was stolen, part of it had been painted red, and part had been painted with grey primer. Terr\u00f3n further testified that the vehicle was \u201c[ljike a small motorcycle,\u201d that it had a forty-nine cubic centimeter motor, and that it \u201cd[id]n\u2019t go any faster than thirty-five miles an hour.\u201d The vehicle was given to Terr\u00f3n; he estimated its value at $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Definition of \u201cmotor </em>vehicle.\u201d The defendant argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove that the vehicle was a motor vehicle and that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>judge erred in not allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty after the Commonwealth rested. In examining this question, we recite a familiar standard: we must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting from <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979). \u201c[I]t is not enough ... to find that there was some record evidence, however slight, to support each essential element of the offense; [the judge] must find that there was enough evidence that could have satisfied a rational trier of fact of each such element beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ixitimore, supra </em>at 677-678. \u201c[T]he evidence and the inferences permitted to be drawn therefrom must be \u2018of sufficient force to bring minds of ordinary intelligence and sagacity to the persuasion of [guilt] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>264 Mass. 368, 373 (1928). \u201cInferences drawn from circumstantial evidence \u2018need not be inescapable or necessary, so long as they are reasonable, possible and not unwarranted because too remote.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cullen, </em>395 Mass. 225, 230 (1985), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 255, 257 (1980). A case may stand entirely upon circumstantial evidence, \u201cas long as \u2018no essential element of the crime . . . rest[s] on surmise, conjecture, or guesswork.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>395 Mass. 20, 25 (1985), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walter, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The crime of possession of a stolen motor vehicle under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28(a), requires proof that (1) the motor vehicle is stolen; (2) the defendant possessed the motor vehicle; and (3) the defendant knew that the motor vehicle was stolen. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 215, 217 (2003). As a threshold matter, however, the vehicle in question must be a motor vehicle. General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1984, c. 77, \u00a7 2, in defining motor vehicles, states that \u201c[t]he definition of \u2018Motor vehicles\u2019 shall not include motorized bicycles.\u201d The same section defines a \u201c[mjotorized bicycle\u201d as follows: \u201ca pedal bicycle which has a helper motor, or a non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>pedal bicycle which has a motor, with a cylinder capacity not exceeding fifty cubic centimeters, an automatic transmission, and which is capable of a maximum speed of no more than thirty miles per hour.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1991, c. 138, \u00a7 388. The statute further defines a \u201c[m]otorcycle\u201d as \u201cany motor vehicle having a seat or saddle for the use of the rider and designed to travel on not more than three wheels in contact with the ground.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1984, c. 115, \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The defendant argues that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to establish that the vehicle was a motor vehicle rather than a motorized bicycle. The defendant argues that because the evidence at trial did not warrant a finding that the motor had a cylinder capacity exceeding fifty cubic centimeters or that the vehicle had an automatic transmission, there was insufficient evidence to find that the vehicle was a motor vehicle. This conclusion assumes that the judge\u2019s findings that the vehicle had a motor and was capable of traveling over thirty miles per hour are not, by themselves, sufficient to warrant a conclusion that the vehicle is a motor vehicle. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The statutory definition of a \u201cmotorized bicycle\u201d contains the provision \u201cand which is capable of a maximum speed of no more than thirty miles per hour.\u201d It is axiomatic that the word \u201cand\u201d is not synonymous with the word \u201cor\u201d; the word \u201cor\u201d is disjunctive, while the word \u201cand\u201d is conjunctive. \u201cThe word \u2018or\u2019 is given a disjunctive meaning unless the context and the main purpose of all the words demand otherwise.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davie, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 27 (1998), quoting from <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>350 Mass. 340, 343 (1966). It follows that if the evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that the vehicle has a maximum speed greater than thirty miles per hour, the vehicle is not considered a motorized bicycle, but rather a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>The descriptive testimony given at trial was sufficient to place the vehicle within the category of a motor vehicle. Terr\u00f3n testified that the vehicle was a \u201csmall motorcycle [that] doesn\u2019t go any faster than thirty-five miles an hour.\u201d The trial judge noted that \u201c[t]he only testimony about its capability for speed was thirty-five miles an hour . . . so I\u2019m going to determine that it was a motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">After examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence that could have satisfied a rational trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt that the vehicle was a motor vehicle. The trial judge credited Terr\u00f3n\u2019s testimony that the vehicle had a maximum speed of thirty-five miles per hour, and that maximum speed exceeded the allowable maximum speed for a motorized bicycle. This evidence supported the judge\u2019s determination that the vehicle was a motor vehicle, not a motorized bicycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">2. <em>Sufficiency of evidence of knowledge. </em>The defense argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to warrant a finding that the defendant knew that the vehicle had been stolen, one of the elements of possession of a stolen motor vehicle under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. at 217. Because the defendant challenges the trial judge\u2019s decision to deny the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty after the Commonwealth rested on the basis of lack of proof of knowledge, we again apply the familiar <em>Latimore </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Although there was no direct evidence that the defendant knew the vehicle was stolen, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, to warrant an inference that the defendant knew that the vehicle was stolen. There is no need to prove actual knowledge; it may be inferred from the circumstances. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dellamano, </em>393 Mass. 132, 136 (1984). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young-worth, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 30, 35 (2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 1064 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Here, there was circumstantial evidence that could have satisfied a rational trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that the vehicle was stolen. If the defendant\u2019s possession of property occurs \u201cin a context fraught with suspi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>cion,\u201d a fact finder may draw an inference that the defendant knew he was holding stolen goods. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 595, 602 (1988). The altered condition of the vehicle, particularly the fact that the vehicle had been partly repainted and the ignition switch was missing, thus requiring the operator to \u201chot wire\u201d the vehicle to start it, provided sufficient circumstantial evidence that could have satisfied a rational trier of fact, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant knew that the vehicle was stolen. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woody, </em>429 Mass. 95, 99-100 (1999) (insufficient evidence to demonstrate knowledge where defendant had keys to car, ignition was still intact, there was no evidence that rental company\u2019s tag was still on key ring, and there was no evidence that rental company\u2019s bar code was on vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The defendant argues that because the trial judge made no explicit finding that the defendant knew the vehicle was stolen, he could not be found guilty of possession of a stolen motor vehicle. While it is true that the trial judge made no explicit finding that the defendant knew that the vehicle was stolen, this does not undermine the sufficiency of the evidence. We presume that a trial judge has properly instructed herself as to the elements of the crime, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 308 (1992), and as discussed, there was ample circumstantial evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant to have had knowledge that the vehicle was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">3. <em>Burden of proof. </em>The defendant argues that the trial judge improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant to prove that the vehicle was not a motor vehicle under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28(a). In making this argument, the defendant claims that the trial judge made her ruling not on the basis of the evidence presented by the Commonwealth, but on the basis of evidence not presented, resulting in an improper shift of the burden of proof onto the defendant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">After the defense moved for a finding of not guilty, the judge took a few moments to think out loud as she decided whether or not to allow the motion. The judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-8\">\u201cGetting to the issue of motorized bicycle, I\u2019m also look<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>ing at Chapter 90, Section 1 . . . . One of the exceptions is motorized bicycle, and to get it out of motor vehicles and get it into that exception it has to be a pedal bicycle, no evidence of that, or a non-pedal bicycle which has a motor with a cylinder capacity not exceeding 50 cubic centimeters, we\u2019ve got that; an automatic transmission, I don\u2019t know what kind of transmission it had. I don\u2019t know whether it was automatic or other, and which is capable of a maximum speed of no more than thirty miles an hour. There was no limit to the maximum speed of thirty miles an hour that was testified to. The only testimony about its capability for speed was thirty-five miles an hour. So because I don\u2019t have any evidence about the transmission I can\u2019t determine that it comes out of the motor vehicle\u2019s definition and goes into the motorized bicycle definition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">These comments are not indicative of an impermissible shifting of the burden of proof. The trial judge was merely thinking aloud as she went through the elements that the vehicle had to meet in order to be an exception from the definition of motor vehicle. There was ample evidence to lead a rational finder of fact to conclude that the vehicle was a motor vehicle; furthermore, there is no indication that the trial judge was unaware that the burden of proof was on the Commonwealth to prove that the vehicle was in fact a motor vehicle, and we presume that the trial judge properly instructed herself on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The trial judge did not base her finding that the vehicle was a motor vehicle on a lack of evidence regarding the transmission and maximum speed of the vehicle, as the defense suggests; rather, the judge\u2019s finding is based on Terr\u00f3n\u2019s testimony that the vehicle \u201cdoesn\u2019t go any faster than thirty-five miles an hour\u201d and a reasonable inference therefrom that the maximum speed was greater than thirty miles per hour. The judge\u2019s failure to make a finding with respect to the type of transmission on the Honda Elite is irrelevant in light of her finding that the maximum speed of the Honda Elite was greater than thirty miles per hour. This inference is reasonable and does not rest on surmise, conjecture, or guesswork. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>395 Mass. at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-9\">The vehicle, a Honda Elite 44, was described at trial as a \u201cscooter,\u201d \u201csmall motorcycle,\u201d \u201cmotorized bicycle,\u201d \u201cbike,\u201d and \u201cmotorbike.\u201d The main issue on appeal concerns whether this vehicle fits into the definition of a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d or, instead, a \u201cmotorized bicycle.\u201d Consequently, we recognize that the arbitrary names used by the witnesses have no impact on the legal definitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b791-10\">Terron was not able to identify the person he witnessed riding the vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b793-7\">On the basis of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 506, 509 &amp; n.3 (2002), the argument could be made that the definitions in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1, have no application to G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28(a). As neither party has urged this position and as the trial judge employed the definition of \u201cmotorized bicycle\u201d contained in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1, we apply the definition for \u201cmotorized bicycle\u201d set forth in that section as an exception to the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
