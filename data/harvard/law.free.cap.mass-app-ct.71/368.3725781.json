The matter went to a jury, which found, on special questions, that (1) Tencer sexually harassed Trinh; (2) such harassment proximately caused damages of $20,000 for emotional injury and $20,000 in lost income or back pay; (3) Tencer was individually liable for a punitive award of $65,000; (4) Gentle was separately liable for Tencer\u2019s sexual harassment because it knew of Tencer\u2019s harassment and failed to take adequate remedial measures; (5) Trinh\u2019s damages proximately related to Gentle\u2019s separate tort were $20,000 in lost income and $20,000 in emotional injury; (6) Gentle was separately liable for a $1 million punitive award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury also determined that (1) neither Tencer nor Gentle retaliated against Trinh for presenting her complaint; (2) Tencer did not intentionally inflict emotional distress on Trinh; and (3) Tencer did not interfere with an advantageous business or employee relationship between Trinh and Gentle.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Tencer and Gentle filed motions pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 50(b), as amended, 428 Mass. 402 (1998), for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (judgment n.o.v.) or, in the alternative, for a new trial or a remittitur. The trial judge allowed the motions for judgment n.o.v. in part, concluding that (1) there was no evidence that Trinh suffered lost income proximately caused by either Tencer or Gentle; (2) no evidence supported a finding of separate liability against Gentle; and (3) no evidence supported a punitive award against Gentle, which award was in any case grossly excessive.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge denied the motion for judgment n.o.v. on the sexual harassment award and on the separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>punitive damage award against Tencer. In accord with those rulings, the judge entered a judgment that awarded Trinh (1) $20,000 in compensatory damages jointly and severally against both Tencer and Gentle; (2) $65,000 in punitive damages against Tencer only; and (3) $30,592 as Trinh\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees against both Tencer and Gentle. The defendants appeal, and Trinh cross-appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\"><em>Factual background. </em>We summarize the facts the jury could have found as follows. Gentle owns a number of dentists\u2019 offices in the greater Boston area. In October of 1997, Trinh was hired by Gentle and was assigned to work in its Brookline office as a \u201ccare coordinator,\u201d as part of what Gentle designated as a \u201cpilot program.\u201d The care coordinator\u2019s role was to explain treatments recommended by the dentists to the patients, to determine how patients would pay, and to schedule the treatments. When Trinh began her employment, Gentle presented Trinh with a copy of Gentle\u2019s written sexual harassment policy and had her sign it. The policy indicated that complaints about sexual harassment should be directed to Barry Bomfriend, Gentle\u2019s chief operating officer, or Donna Simonds, its director of human resources. Trinh testified that she was not given time to adequately review the policy prior to signing it, nor was she given a copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">After her training, Trinh began work in the Brookline office at the beginning of December. Tencer had previously expressed skepticism with the idea of care coordinators, but agreed to participate in the pilot program.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">During the few months in which Trinh worked at the Brookline office, Tencer engaged in behavior that made her feel uncomfortable. Trinh testified that Tencer, on several occasions, made inappropriate sexual remarks to her. Tencer had, at one point, walked in on a conversation at the front desk where Trinh revealed to other coworkers that she was considering breast augmentation surgery. Tencer later brought up the surgery with her individually and asked her if he could see what her breasts looked like before the surgery. He commented on her clothes and body at work, and at one point walked into the lunchroom, looked at the plaintiff, and said, \u201cI like to eat that too,\u201d refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>ring to Trinh. He also whistled at Trinh in the workplace, looked at her in a way that made her feel uncomfortable, and when he passed her in the hallways during work, he would brush against her. Finally, at one point Tencer leaned over Trinh while she worked at the front counter, and she testified that she could feel his penis against her back.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Over the course of her employment in the Brookline office, Trinh mentioned her discomfort to three people: a care coordinator in Gentle\u2019s Natick office, who had gone through training with the plaintiff; the Gentle employee who trained and supervised the care coordinator program; and a dentist at another Gentle location (a part owner who did not act as an officer of the company) whom she dated over the span of approximately two months while she worked in the Brookline office.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Near the end of February, 1998, Trinh was notified that she was to be transferred to Gentle\u2019s Cambridge office. On her second-to-last day in the Brookline office, Thursday, February 26, Trinh notified Kathy Circeo, the Brookline office administrator, of her complaints. The next day, Circeo called Simonds about the complaint. Simonds then conferred with Bomfriend and decided to investigate the allegations, although Trinh had not contacted either of them directly to relate the substance of her complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The following Monday, March 2, Simonds contacted Trinh, who was at her first day of work in the Cambridge office, and made an appointment to speak to her on Wednesday, March 4. On March 3, Simonds and Bomfriend went to the Brookline office and interviewed five employees there, including Tencer and Circeo. When interviewed, Tencer denied the harassing behavior and said that Trinh had dressed inappropriately for the office, although she had never been told during her employment at Gentle that her dress was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">When conducting the interviews, Simonds took handwritten notes and typed them afterwards. There were differences between the handwritten notes and the typed copies made afterwards; the typed versions lacked some details and contained other additional details not included in the handwritten notes. Each set of typed interview notes contained a signature line for the interviewee to attest that the notes were a truthful representation of the interview, but most of them were unsigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>On March 3, Trinh sent a letter to Bomfriend, saying that she was too \u201cstressed out\u201d to meet with Bomfriend and Simonds the next day. Bomfriend and Simonds then made an appointment to speak with Trinh at some point in the next week. In the meantime, Bomfriend and Simonds interviewed several employees at different Gentle offices, including, on March 5, the care coordinator in Natick to whom Trinh had detailed her complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Trinh testified that her conversation with her colleague in Natick convinced her that the investigation was biased against her. From that conversation, she got the impression that the investigation was focusing on her behavior at the office, rather than Tencer\u2019s, and therefore that the investigation was aimed at trying to discredit her rather than to resolve her complaints fairly. On March 9, she wrote another letter to Bomfriend, stating that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for her to continue working at Gentle because \u201ceveryone in the company knows about your investigation and you have accused me of lying about the sexual harassment and of being immoral and illegal. The entire environment has become hostile towards me.\u201d She then went on to state that she was terminating her employment with Gentle as of March 14, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Simonds and Bomfriend went to the Cambridge office to speak with Trinh in person, but she ended the interview after a short period of time because, as she testified, she had to see a patient. At the end of the week, Trinh left her job at Gentle. Thus, Simonds and Bomfriend\u2019s investigation concluded with none of their interview subjects having corroborated Trinh\u2019s complaints and with Trinh herself having refused to participate in the internal investigation because of her belief that the investigation was biased against her. As they had found no information confirming Trinh\u2019s complaints against Tencer during their interviews, and Trinh had declined the opportunities given to her to participate in the investigation, Simonds and Bomfriend concluded their investigation, and Tencer was not disciplined.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>In reviewing a trial judge\u2019s decision on a motion for judgment n.o.v., \u201c[w]e do not defer to the judge\u2019s view of the evidence but examine the case anew, following the same standard the judge is obliged to apply.\u201d <em>MacCormack </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>423 Mass. 652, 659 (1996). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>That standard has been often articulated and provides that \u201cthe question before us is the same: that is, \u2018whether \u201canywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d \u2019 <em>Raunela </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>361 Mass. 341, 343 (1972), quoting from <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Railway Exp. Agency, Inc., </em>315 Mass. 301, 302 (1943).\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Senechal, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 68, 76 (2006). <em>Salvi </em>v. <em>Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Dept., </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 596, 603 (2006). See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bell Atl., </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 702, 711 (2005). We consider the claims against each of the defendants in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">2. <em>Claims against Tencer. </em>a. <em>Compensatory damages. </em>On appeal Tencer argues that the trial judge should have granted his motion for judgment n.o.v. or a new trial on the award for compensatory damages because Trinh failed to introduce sufficient evidence to sustain a sexual harassment claim against Tencer individually and, in addition, failed to meet the heightened burden for assessing punitive damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Trinh\u2019s case was based on the theory that Tencer\u2019s harassment created a hostile work environment. The relevant portion of the statute defines sexual harassment as \u201cverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when . . . such . . . conduct ha[s] the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\u2019s work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, humiliating or sexually offensive work environment.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1(18), as amended by St. 1987, c. 473, \u00a7 2. In order to prevail on this theory, Trinh had to show that the \u2018.\u2018conduct alleged was sufficiently severe and pervasive to interfere with a reasonable person\u2019s work performance.\u201d <em>Muzzy </em>v. <em>Cahillane Motors, Inc., </em>434 Mass. 409, 411 (2001). Conduct of a sexual nature may be considered sexual harassment under the statute, even absent sexual advances or requests for sexual favors. See <em>Melnychenko </em>v. <em>84 Lumber Co., </em>424 Mass. 285, 290 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">There was sufficient evidence at trial to support the jury\u2019s verdict that Tencer sexually harassed Trinh. She testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Tencer asked to see her breasts after the conversation concerning her breast augmentation surgery. Trinh testified that Tencer made other sexually suggestive comments, and that he rubbed against her in a way in which she could feel his penis against her. Tencer\u2019s statements and actions were objectively offensive, and Trinh testified to her discomfort about the comments and physical contact. Tencer\u2019s remarks and actions were sufficiently severe and pervasive to support the finding of harassment and the emotional distress damages that ensued therefrom.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We find nothing in the record that compels us to disturb the trial judge\u2019s decision to allow the jury\u2019s verdict to stand in this regard. It was also appropriate to hold the employer vicariously liable for its manager\u2019s sexual harassment and for the compensatory damages owed because of this harassment. See <em>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. 156, 166-167 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">b. <em>Damages for lost income.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The plaintiff complains that the judge should not have granted the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment n.o.v. on the award of damages to her for lost income. The judge did not err in his ruling. Trinh was not fired from Gentle, but rather resigned. In these circumstances, she was required to show that she was constructively discharged from Gentle in order to recover lost income. A plaintiff establishes a constructive discharge by showing that \u201cbased on an <em>objective </em>assessment of the conditions under which the employee has asserted [s]he was expected to work, it could be found they were so difficult as to be intolerable.\u201d <em>GTE Prod. Corp. </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>421 Mass. 22, 34 (1995). See <em>Salvi </em>v. <em>Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Dept., </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. at 606-607. In this case, Trinh was transferred out of the Brookline office, where the complained of harassment took place, and away from the one manager who had harassed her. She had worked in the Cambridge office for less than two weeks when she submitted her letter of resignation. Her pay had not been reduced, and her responsibilities at Cambridge were sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>stantially the same as they had been in Brookline.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There was no evidence that her managers in Cambridge took any adverse action toward her.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Trinh\u2019s testimony and her resignation letter do not establish a work environment in Cambridge so hostile that it would support a finding of constructive discharge. While participation in the company\u2019s investigation of her sexual harassment complaint could be expected to be difficult, it would not constitute intolerable working conditions. Moreover, Trinh did not participate in the process after making the complaint.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial judge properly ruled that Trinh had not presented sufficient evidence to establish a constructive discharge, and therefore she was not entitled to damages for lost income.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">c. <em>Punitive damages. </em>To assess punitive damages under G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 9, the plaintiff must show that the complained-of behavior is \u201cnot merely intentional and offensive.\u201d <em>Beaupre </em>v. <em>Cliff Smith &amp; Assocs., </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 480, 498 (2000). Rather, the conduct must be \u201coutrageous, because of the defendant\u2019s evil motive or his reckless indifference to the rights of others.\u201d <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), All </em>Mass. 1, 17a (1998), quoting from Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 908(2) (1979). The conduct must warrant \u201ccondemnation and deterrence.\u201d <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>424 Mass. 758, 767 (1997). We conclude that Tencer\u2019s conduct could have been found outrageous given his sexual harassment of a junior employee, including asking to see her breasts and rubbing up against her so that she could feel his penis, and his position of responsibility as the dentist in charge of the local office.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The punitive damages assessed against Tencer also were not excessive. We use a three-part test to analyze the reasonableness of a punitive damages award, scrutinizing \u201c \u2018the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s conduct,\u2019 the ratio of the punitive damage award to the \u2018actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff,\u2019 [and] a comparison of the \u2018punitive damages award and the civil or criminal penalties that could be imposed for comparable misconduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Mass. 813, 826-827 (1997), quoting from <em>BMW of N. Am. </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. 559, 575, 580, 583 (1996). Tencer\u2019s conduct described above could have been found reprehensible. The ratio of less than four-to-one was within standards deemed appropriate. See <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. 408, 425 (2003) (\u201cSingle digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process\u201d); <em>Ciccarelli </em>v. <em>School Dept. of Lowell, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 787, 798 (2007) (five-to-one ratio affirmed). And the amount, under $100,000, has been found acceptable in similar contexts. See, e.g., <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>424 Mass. at 768; <em>Beaupre </em>v. <em>Cliff Smith &amp; Assocs., supra </em>at 497-498.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">3. <em>Claims against Gentle, </em>a. <em>Compensatory damages. </em>An employer may be found directly liable for discrimination under G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4, if it is notified of sexual harassment in its workplace and fails to take adequate remedial action. <em>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. at 167. On appeal, Trinh argues that the jury verdict assessing direct liability, both compensatory and punitive, against Gentle was adequately supported, and therefore the judge\u2019s grant of Gentle\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. and, in the alternative, a new trial should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The trial judge, in his ruling on Gentle\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v., accurately delineated the factual basis for his decision to vacate the jury\u2019s finding of direct liability against Gentle. Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>drawing all reasonable inferences in Trinh\u2019s favor, the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to warrant a finding that Gentle inadequately or inappropriately investigated the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Trinh did not complain to the officials identified in the sexual harassment policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Once Donna Simonds, the director of human resources and one of the officials responsible for investigating sexual harassment, became aware of the complaints, she followed up immediately along with Barry Bomfriend, the chief operating officer of the company, and the other official responsible for sexual harassment investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Simonds and Bomfriend also responded appropriately, including questioning Trinh\u2019s behavior. At least some inquiry into the plaintiff\u2019s workplace behavior was relevant to the investigation, as determining whether the conduct at issue was unwelcome is a key component of a claim under the sexual harassment statute. See <em>Ramsdell </em>v. <em>Western Mass. Bus Lines, Inc., </em>415 Mass. 673, 676-678 (1993). Tencer denied the allegations, and others had told the investigators that Trinh was a willing participant in the office\u2019s sexual banter. The notes from the interviews indicate that Bomfriend and Simonds asked their interview subjects relevant questions about the behavior of all involved regarding the plaintiff\u2019s allegations. Trinh was kept informed of the investigation and given several opportunities to participate, which she declined. Tencer was not involved in the investigation, except for being questioned, and other staff members were questioned individually, thereby allowing them to speak more freely. Contrast <em>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. at 167-168 (\u201c[The plaintiff] was never informed about the staff meeting, while [the alleged harasser] was present throughout. The staff were never questioned individually. [The plaintiff] was never provided an opportunity to confront [the alleged harasser], nor was she interviewed after [the alleged harasser] and the staff had been approached\u201d). While Tencer was not disciplined, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>without Trinh\u2019s testimony the appropriate employer response is a difficult personnel matter on a contested complaint. Unlike the jury, the personnel director never heard Trinh\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Trinh\u2019s arguments based on disparities between handwritten notes and typed versions of interviews do not establish that the investigation was a whitewash, particularly where her contentions were not corroborated by other witnesses, and she failed to participate in the process and left the employer\u2019s employment, thereby short-circuiting the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Trinh\u2019s reliance on the filing of an unrelated sexual harassment complaint against Bomfriend in 1994 does not provide evidence that the investigation was biased, nor was there any evidence that Trinh was aware of the complaint, which might have given her reason not to participate in the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">As we conclude that Trinh did not present sufficient evidence to establish direct liability against Gentle for sexual harassment for purposes of compensatory liability, we also conclude that the trial judge was correct in mling that the jury lacked a factual predicate for assessing punitive damages against Gentle directly.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The complaint also set forth a cause of action against Tencer for tortious interference with advantageous contractual relations and against Gentle for breach of contract. The judge allowed Gentle\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the breach of contract claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">The judge also ruled that if the judgment n.o.v. were ultimately reversed, Tencer and Gentle would be entitled to a new trial on the same issues. As we affirm the judgment, we need not address the request for alternate relief in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>form of a new trial or a remittitur.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\">General Laws c. 151B allows employees to be held individually liable for sexual harassment. See, e.g., <em>Beaupre </em>v. <em>Cliff Smith &amp; Assocs., </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 480, 490-491 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Trinh testified to loss of sleep and weight due to the harassment.

Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. at 167, there was no attempt to hold the company vicariously liable for the punitive damages award against Tencer. \u201cThe common law has long recognized that agency principles limit vicarious liability on punitive awards.\u201d <em>Kolstad </em>v. <em>American Dental Assn., </em>527 U.S. 526, 541 (1999). In the analogous Title VII context, the United States Supreme Court held: \u201cRecognizing Title VII as an effort to promote prevention as well as remediation, and observing the very principles underlying the Restatement [of Agency\u2019s] strict limits on vicarious liability for punitive damages, we agree that, in the punitive damages context, an employer may not be vicariously liable for the discriminatory employment decisions of managerial agents where these decisions are contrary to the employer\u2019s good faith efforts to comply with Title VII.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545 (quotation omitted). In the instant case, the plaintiff sought to hold the defendant employer directly, and not vicariously, liable for punitive damages for its response to Tencer\u2019s harassment.
