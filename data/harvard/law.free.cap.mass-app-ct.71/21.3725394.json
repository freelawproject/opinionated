We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>After a jury-waived trial, the judge found the following: Hingham had previously insured the Mercurios under the policy. As part of the periodic renewal process, Hingham wrote to West Boylston Insurance Agency (Boylston) and requested that Boylston send it a completed personal umbrella application form for the Mercurios. Boylston is the Mercurios\u2019 insurance agency and also has an agency agreement with Hingham. As requested, Boylston filled out a personal umbrella application and mailed it to David Mercurio for review and signing.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">On the application in a section headed, in boldface capitalized print, \u201cOPERATOR INFORMATION,\u201d Hingham requested, in smaller capitalized nonboldface letters, that the applicants list \u201cALL MEMBERS OF HOUSEHOLD AND ALL OPERATORS OF VEHICLES/WATERCRAFT AS REQUIRED BY COMPANY.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Boylston filled out the operator information section, it listed only David and Melanie Mercurio. When the Mercurios received the application, David added their nineteen year old daughter Talia\u2019s name in this section, but he did not add their seventeen year old son Daniel\u2019s name. It is undisputed that Daniel lived at the Mercurios\u2019 home, owned his own truck that was not listed on his parents\u2019 automobile policy, and that he had a separate automobile policy to cover his truck. Talia, who also lived at home, did not have her own vehicle and was listed on her parents\u2019 automobile policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">David signed and returned the application to Boylston, and Boylston in turn forwarded it to Hingham. The Mercurios paid the premium and Hingham renewed the policy. If David had listed Daniel as an operator on the application, the annual premium would have increased by twenty-five dollars (an eighteen percent increase).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">During the policy period, Daniel was involved in a two-car accident in New Hampshire while driving a friend\u2019s car. Two passengers in Daniel\u2019s car were injured and the driver of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>other car, Lillian Prud\u2019homme, was killed. Several months later, after Prud\u2019homme\u2019s attorney requested information related to all policies insuring the Mercurio household, Hingham learned of the accident. Hingham then notified the Mercurios that it was rescinding the policy and refunding the premium the Mercurios had paid for that policy year. As grounds, Hingham stated that the Mercurios made a material misrepresentation in their application by failing to list Daniel as a household member in response to the operator information question.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Hingham then commenced the present action, seeking a declaration that its rescission of the policy was permitted by law and that the policy was therefore void. It later added a count seeking, in the alternative, reformation of the policy to exclude Daniel from coverage. Lillian Prud\u2019homme\u2019s umbrella insurer, Cambridge Mutual Fire Insurance Company (Cambridge), intervened on the grounds that rescission of Hingham\u2019s policy was likely to adversely affect Cambridge\u2019s obligation to the Prud\u2019homme estate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">We refer to additional facts as they become relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Rescission. </em>We agree that Hingham was not entitled to rescind the policy, albeit on somewhat different grounds than employed by the judge. An insurer may only rescind or cancel an insurance policy based upon a misrepresentation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">\u201cNo oral or written misrepresentation or warranty made in the negotiation of a policy of insurance by the insured or in his behalf shall be deemed material or defeat or avoid the policy or prevent its attaching unless such misrepresentation or warranty is made with actual intent to deceive, or unless the matter misrepresented or made a warranty increased the risk of loss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 186. Any misrepresentation that results in the insurer\u2019s charging a lower premium than it otherwise would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>have charged is \u201cmaterial.\u201d <em>Barnstable County Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gale, </em>425 Mass. 126, 128-129 (1997) (finding insured\u2019s failure to disclose his second car material even where it did not technically increase risk of loss as cars were never on the road at the same time). A material misrepresentation in an application for an insurance policy will give the insurer the right to rescind it. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In order to determine whether an answer is a misrepresentation, we must identify the information sought by the question. \u201cWhere . . . there is more than one rational interpretation of policy language, \u2018the insured is entitled to the benefit of the one that is more favorable to it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hakim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers\u2019 Insolvency Fund, </em>424 Mass. 275, 281 (1997), quoting from <em>Trustees of Tufts Univ. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>415 Mass. 844, 849 (1993). See <em>Interstate Gourmet Coffee Roasters, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seaco Ins. Co., </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 78, 83 (2003) (\u201cexclusions from insurance coverage and ambiguities in an insurance policy are to be strictly construed against an insurer\u201d). The rationale behind this rule is to encourage insurers, who typically draft the policy and are in the best position to avoid future misunderstandings, to be as clear and explicit as possible. See 2 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 22:14, at 22-33 (3d ed. 2005) (\u201cdoubtful language is to be interpreted most strongly against the party who used it in drafting the contract\u201d). This same rationale extends to insurance questionnaires and applications. See, e.g., <em>Vella </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of U.S., </em>887 F.2d 388, 392 (2d Cir. 1989) (applying rule of construing insurance policies against insurer \u201cto questions on insurance applications where the insurance company seeks to avoid liability by citing the answers thereto as misrepresentations\u201d). Where a question on an application lends itself to more than one reasonable interpretation, an honest answer to one of those reasonable interpretations cannot be labeled a misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Whether a particular contract provision is ambiguous is a question of law reviewable by an appellate court. See <em>Berkowitz </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 270 (2003). \u201cAn ambiguity exists in an insurance contract when the language contained therein is susceptible of more than one meaning. ... It must be shown that reasonably intelligent persons would differ as to which one of two or more meanings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>is the proper one.\u201d <em>Jefferson Ins. Co. of N.Y. </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 472, 474-475 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The operator information question on the Mercurios\u2019 application read as follows: \u201cList All Members Of Household And All Operators Of Vehicles/Watercraft As Required By Company.\u201d Below the question was a table with several rows, and columns for name, date of birth, date driver license issued, driver license number, and \u201cVEHICLE, CRAFT, % USE, ETC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The judge, in an interlocutory order, ruled that this question \u201cclearly call[ed] for the identification of Daniel who was living at home.\u201d This is one rational interpretation of the language at issue, but it is not the only one. While directing the applicant to list \u201call members of household,\u201d the query itself was titled \u201cOperator Information\u201d and sought specific information on each person\u2019s driver\u2019s license and percentage use of vehicles and watercraft. It is thus somewhat unclear whether the question actually sought the names of household members who were not \u201coperators of vehicles/watercraft.\u201d The question becomes far more confusing read in the context of the application as a whole. The immediately preceding questions, titled \u201cAUTOMOBILES\u201d and \u201cWATERCRAFT,\u201d direct the applicant to \u201c[ljist all [ajutos owned, leased or furnished for reg. use\u201d and to \u201c[ljist all watercraft owned, leased, chartered, or furnished for regular use.\u201d It was thus additionally unclear whether the applicant, who had presumably just answered the preceding questions, is thereafter being asked, when filling out \u201cOperator Information,\u201d for only those operators or for household members who operate the Usted vehicles and watercraft, or for household members who operate any vehicles or watercraft whatsoever.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the apphcation contained a prior section titled \u201cPRIMARY POLICY INFORMATION,\u201d which requested information on the primary automobile po\u00fccy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, another reason that the \u201cOperator Information\u201d question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>may have been ambiguous is that it is unclear whether the applicant should list only operators covered by the listed primary insurance, or whether it should list all operators. One logical reason why one may honestly conclude that the question sought only the former is that the umbrella policy provides secondary insurance, and requires a minimum amount of primary automobile insurance as a condition of coverage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, the last portion of the instruction, \u201cas required by company,\u201d is entirely circular and does not clarify matters, particularly where there was some testimony that Boylston told the Mercurios they need not list Daniel.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">A policyholder generally has no obligation to answer a question that has not been asked by the insurer. <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Quisset Properties, Inc., </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 147, 154-156 (2007).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> David\u2019s failure to list Daniel was an honest response to an objectively reasonable interpretation of the question as a direction to list only those members of the household who operated the vehicles or watercraft previously listed. It is undisputed that Daniel did not operate either of the two vehicles listed. And, as it is also undisputed that Daniel was not covered under the primary policy previously requested by the application, there was yet additional good faith interpretive basis for David to exclude him. We consider it significant that although Boylston had listed only David and Melanie in response to the question, David specifically added Talia, a household member who was both an operator of the listed vehicles and covered by the primary policy. In light of the above ambiguities, the Mercurios\u2019 response to the question was not a misrepresentation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">2. <em>Reformation. </em>Hingham also contends that the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>improperly refused to reform the policy to exclude Daniel from the definition of \u201cInsured.\u201d For several reasons, we concur in the result reached by the judge. The policy defines \u201cInsured\u201d as \u201cyou [the named insured] or any relative of yours.\u201d \u201cRelative\u201d is, in turn, defined as \u201ca person who lives in your household and is: A. related to you; or B. an unmarried, dependent person under the age of 21 in your care.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These definitions are boilerplate language in an instrument prepared by the company; there is no evidence of any negotiation over, or even reference to, these terms by the parties at the time of the renewal. Accordingly, the doctrine of mutual mistake, which applies only where \u201cthe language of a written instrument does not reflect the true intent of both parties,\u201d does not apply to these facts. <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co., </em>414 Mass. 747, 756 (1993). The party seeking reformation must prove the mistake by \u201cfull, clear, and decisive proof.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, Hingham offered no proof to satisfy its burden that either party, much less both, intended to alter the normal contractual terms. The trial judge\u2019s findings of fact, supported by the record, reflect this \u2014 the parties may have been \u201cmistaken\u201d as to collateral matters, namely the correct premium to be charged and the import of the \u201cOperator Information\u201d question, but they did not intend anything that was not reflected in the contractual documents taken as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Finally, we note that even had Hingham provided clear and convincing evidence of a mutual mistake, reformation need not necessarily be awarded. \u201cSince the remedy of reformation is equitable in nature, a court has the discretion to withhold it. . . on grounds that have traditionally justified courts of equity in withholding relief.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 155 cmt. d (1981). See <em>Nissan Autos, of Marlborough, Inc. </em>v. <em>Glick, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 302, 306 (2004) (if other conditions are met, \u201ccourt may choose to reform the agreement at its discretion\u201d). To the extent that the judge withheld reformation at least partly for equitable reasons, stating that \u201c[i]t would be inequitable to burden the Mercurios with the mistakes and poor training of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Hingham\u2019s agent at . . . Boylston,\u201d there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b54-9\">As discussed <em>infra, </em>this section was preceded by others for \u201cPRIMARY POLICY INFORMATION,\u201d \u201cAUTOMOBILES,\u201d and \u201cWATERCRAFT.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b55-10\">The estate of Lillian Prud\u2019homme and Roland Prud\u2019homme filed a wrongful death suit against Daniel in New Hampshire State court. Daniel\u2019s automobile insurers agreed to pay $525,000 and Cambridge agreed to pay $315,000 to the Prud\u2019homme estate. Pursuant to an intercompany agreement between Hing-ham and Cambridge, if Hingham is unsuccessful in this action it must reimburse Cambridge for that amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The information in the boxes following the \u201cAutomobiles\u201d and \u201cWatercraft\u201d sections was filled out by Boylston, and included only the Mercurios\u2019 two family automobiles. Daniel\u2019s car was not listed. David did not add Daniel\u2019s car, and Hingham did not allege that this omission was a material misrepresentation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Again, the information in this box was filled out by Boylston; it included the Mercurios\u2019 automobile insurance policy, but Daniel\u2019s car insurance policy was not listed.

Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Quisset Properties, Inc., </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 147 (2007), this court considered whether summary judgment was properly granted where the parties\u2019 submissions left disputed whether the insurer had made a request for certain information such that a failure to provide the information could be found to be a misrepresentation. Accordingly, that case was remanded for development of the evidence at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 157.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Because we affirm the trial court\u2019s declaration on the distinct grounds that the Mercurios gave an honest response to an ambiguous question, we need not address whether the declaration is also supported on the grounds advanced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the trial judge \u2014 namely, that rescission was improper because Hingham\u2019s agent, Boylston, had actual knowledge of Daniel\u2019s status as a member of the Mercurio household.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Hingham concedes that the policy, on its face, provides Daniel with coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
