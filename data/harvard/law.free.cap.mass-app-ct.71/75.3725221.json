L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34, 34A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>related section of the act, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1), as amended through St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 1, defines \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d in pertinent part as follows: \u201cIn case the injured employee is employed in the <em>concurrent service of more than one insured employer or self-insurer, his total earnings from the several insured employers and self-insurers shall be considered in determining his average weekly </em>wages\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In this case, Michael Sellers (employee) worked concurrently for an insured employer (i.e., an employer that carried workers\u2019 compensation insurance) and an uninsured employer (i.e., an employer that, in violation of G. L. c. 152, unlawfully failed to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The employee suffered a serious and wholly disabling injury while working for the uninsured employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Had the employee been engaged in concurrent work for, and earning wages from, one or more <em>insured employers or self-insurers, </em>then, under the above-quoted sections of the act, the employee would have received disability benefits calculated by combining his concurrent average weekly wages from the several .insured or self-insured employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The question presented in this appeal is whether, even though one of the employers was an uninsured entity, the applicable sections of the act may be construed so as to entitle the employee to the same calculated combined wages that would have resulted under \u00a7\u00a7 1(1) and 34 or 34A if the employee had been concurrently working for insured employers or self-insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Based on the plain definitions contained in the act, we are constrained to conclude that the employee in this case is not entitled to have his average weekly wages calculated by combining his concurrent wages earned from both the uninsured employer and the insured employer. Revisions of the applicable sections of G. L. c. 152 to correct what is obviously a disparity among injured employees requires legislative amendment. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>amendment cannot, however, be achieved by judicial rewriting of the statutory terms. This court cannot \u201cread into the statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there, whether the omission came from inadvertence or of set purpose.\u201d <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 803 (1999), quoting from <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">1. <em>Procedural and factual history. </em>We take the facts from the administrative record. In September, 2001, the employee was working for the John Havlin Tree Service (Havlin) when a tree limb weighing 300 to 400 pounds fell on his back and neck. The employee suffered injuries rendering him a quadriplegic. At the time of the accident, Havlin did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance. However, at the time of his injury, in addition to working for Havlin, the employee also worked for, and received wages from, Steve Miller Company (SMC). SMC carried workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The employee filed his application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits with the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA). Because the injury occurred while the employee was performing services for an uninsured employer, under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(2), the employee\u2019s benefits were to be paid by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust Fund (trust fund), which provides benefits where an injury to a worker occurs during employment for an uninsured company.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trust fund, in turn, may seek recovery from the uninsured employer for the compensation paid. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(8). (In addition, employers that fail to carry mandated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>worker\u2019s compensation insurance can be held liable for full tort damages to the injured plaintiff. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25C.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Following a conference held pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, an administrative judge awarded the employee temporary total incapacity benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34. The amount awarded did not reflect the employee\u2019s concurrent employment. Both sides appealed. Following a de nova hearing, the same administrative judge awarded the employee permanent total incapacity benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A, by combining his weekly wages from Havlin and SMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The trust fund then appealed to the DIA reviewing board (board). The board concluded that in keeping with the remedial purpose of the act, an \u201cinsured employer\u201d as used in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1), should be interpreted to mean \u201can employer legally required to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance.\u201d The board\u2019s analysis was that both employers were required to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation system, and that Havlin participated \u201cillegally, causing the [tjrust [fjund ... to pay the benefits that would have otherwise been the responsibility of Havlin\u2019s . . . insurer.\u201d In light of this, the board determined that the employee\u2019s benefits were to be calculated based on his combined wages from both Havlin and SMC, and it affirmed the decision of the administrative judge. This appeal by the trust fund followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">2. <em>Statutory analysis. </em>The trust fund argues on appeal that the plain language of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1), cannot support the interpretation applied by the administrative judge and the board. The employee maintains that the term \u201cconcurrent service\u201d in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1), captures and encompasses wages from all employers that are legally required under G. L. c. 152 to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance \u2014 even if a specific employer fails to carry insurance as required by law. According to the employee\u2019s theory, such a defaulting employer should still be considered as subject to, and still operating within the legal universe of, the G. L. c. 152 workers\u2019 compensation system. Thus, the employee submits, all wages are to be combined in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The employee\u2019s proposed construction falls before the black letter terms in G. L. c. 152. First, the definition in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1), speaks directly of, and is limited to, earnings from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u201cinsured employers and self-insurers.\u201d Second, in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(6), as amended through St. 1986, c. 662, \u00a7 5, an insured employer is defined as \u201can employer who has provided by insurance for the payment to his employees by an insurer of the compensation provided for by this chapter, or is a self-insurer.\u201d Likewise, in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7), a self-insurer is included within the statutory definition of an employer providing worker\u2019s compensation insurance under c. 152.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The core and plain point in these definitions is that workers\u2019 compensation insurance exists as provided by the insured employer or self-insurer. \u201cWhen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, it must be given its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>431 Mass. 772, 775 (2000). An uninsured employer does not fall within either of these plainly defined terms, and the legislatively defined terms cannot be expanded to include a different class, i.e., an uninsured employer. \u201c[A] statutory expression of one thing [here the express reference to \u2018insured employer or self-insurer\u2019 in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1)] is an implied exclusion of other things omitted [here the omission of any reference to uninsured employers] from the statute.\u201d <em>Police Commr. of Boston </em>v. <em>Cecil, </em>431 Mass. 410, 413 (2000), quoting from <em>Harborview Residents\u2019 Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Quincy Hous. Authy., </em>368 Mass. 425, 432 (1975), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">A third flaw is that, in order to accept the employee\u2019s interpretation of the statute, we would, in effect, have to amend \u00a7 1(1) to read that, in addition to a worker\u2019s concurrent wages being combined for insured employers and self-insurers, an additional wage component subject to such combining \u201cimplicit\u201d in \u00a7 1(1) would be wages earned by the worker from <em>employers that should have, but did not have, workers \u2019 compensation insurance. </em>\u201cWhere \u2018the Legislature has carefully employed specific language in one paragraph of a statute ... the language should not be implied where it is not present.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 66, 69 (2000), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>from <em>First Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Judge Baker Guidance Center, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 144, 153 (1982).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A court \u201cwill not add words to a statute that the Legislature did not put there, either by inadvertent omission or by design.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>440 Mass. 436, 443 (2003), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>437 Mass. 286, 294 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We understand that the end result to the permanently and catastrophically injured employee in this case is untoward, and is particularly troublesome in light of the \u201chumanitarian measure[s]\u201d inherent in the act. <em>Neff v. Commissioner of the Dept. of Industrial Accs., </em>421 Mass. 70, 73 (1995), quoting from <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349 (1914). A court cannot, however, rewrite the material provisions of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1), by judicial fiat. \u201cIt is the function of the court to construe a statute as written and an event or contingency for which no provision is made does not justify judicial legislation.\u201d <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>369 Mass. 542, 547 (1976). It remains for legislative consideration and prerogative to amend the governing provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation act to yield a different calculus for average weekly wages to include concurrent wages earned by an injured employee from a uninsured employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The decision of the board is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the DIA for recalculation of the employee\u2019s benefits in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-14\">Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, as amended through St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 59, an employee with an injury resulting in temporary, total incapacity is to be paid \u201csixty percent of his or her average weekly wage before the injury, . . . unless the average weekly wage of the employee is less than the minimum weekly compensation rate, in which case said weekly compensation shall be equal to his average weekly wage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-15\">Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A, as amended through St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 60, where the injury proves to be both \u201cpermanent and total,\u201d the employee is entitled to \u201ca weekly compensation equal to two-thirds of his average weekly wage before the injury, but not more than the maximum weekly compensation rate nor less than the minimum weekly compensation rate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The controlling differential is not that the employee suffered the injury while working for the uninsured, as opposed to the insured, employer. This is so because even had the employee been injured while working for his insured employer, the question of the calculation of average weekly wages would still pose the same issue, viz., whether the employee\u2019s concurrent wages would include wages from both the insured and uninsured employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 65(2), as amended through St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 85, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">\u201cThere is hereby established a trust fund in the state treasury, known as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust Fund, the proceeds of which shall be used to pay or reimburse the following compensation: ...(e) payment of benefits resulting from approved claims against employers . . . who are uninsured in violation of this chapter . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 65(8), as amended through St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 88, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">\u201cIf the trust fund pays compensation to a claimant pursuant to clause (e) of subsection (2), it may seek recovery from the uninsured employer for an amount equal to the amount paid on behalf of the claimant under this chapter, plus any necessary and reasonable attorney fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b111-6\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 1(7), as amended through St. 1986, c. 662, \u00a7 5, defines and includes a self-insurer with the class of insuring entities: \u201c \u2018Insurer\u2019, any insurance company, reciprocal, or interinsurance exchange, authorized so to do, which has contracted with an employer to pay the compensation provided for by this chapter.

L. c. 152 by adding \u00a7 65, establishing the trust fund as a mechanism to provide compensation to injured workers employed by uninsured employers, see St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 55, the Legislature did not contemporaneously amend \u00a7 1(1) to add references to uninsured employers to the calculation of \u201caverage weekly wages.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
