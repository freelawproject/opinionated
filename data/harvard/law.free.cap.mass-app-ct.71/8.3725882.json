L. c. 152, \u00a7 35B,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when an employee suffers a recurrence of an earlier injury after returning to work, the employee is entitled to be paid compensation at the average weekly wage rate in effect at the time of the subsequent injury. Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> compensation benefits are subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>to an annual cost of living adjustment in accordance with changes in the average weekly wage. At issue in the present appeal is the date used to calculate the \u00a7 34B adjustment in cases involving recurrence of an earlier injury. The reviewing board (reviewing board) of the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) concluded that the \u00a7 34B adjustment should be calculated using the date of the employee\u2019s original injury, rather than the date of the subsequent injury. The Commonwealth<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> contends that the appropriate date instead should be the date of the subsequent injury, which establishes the rate of the benefits subject to the \u00a7 34B adjustment. We agree with the Commonwealth, and reverse the decision of the reviewing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Background.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The employee, John M. Camara, was employed by the Commonwealth as a laborer for the highway department when, on October 23, 1987, he injured his lower back. He was paid temporary and total incapacity benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, at the rate of $258.37 per week, based on an average weekly wage of $387.56, from October 23, 1987, through January 15, 1992, when he returned to work. After almost four months, the employee again left work because of lower back pain, and was paid \u00a7 34 temporary and total incapacity benefits at the rate of $325.91 per week, based on an average weekly wage of $488.87, from May 8, 1992, through November 1, 1992, when he returned to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The employee continued to work until February 4, 1994, when his back pain became too great. From February 4, 1994, through March 13, 1999, the employee was paid partial incapacity benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, in the amount of $239.25 per week, based on an average weekly wage of $488.87 and an earning capacity of $130 per week.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On March 13, 1999, the Commonwealth terminated payment of benefits, on the ground that the employee had received benefits for the maximum period of five years authorized under \u00a7 35. The employee filed a claim with the DIA for permanent and total incapacity benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A, which resulted (on January 11, 2000) in an order of payment awarding the employee \u00a7 34A benefits at the rate of $325.91 per week, based on an average weekly wage of $488.87, beginning on March 13, 1999, and continuing. The employee\u2019s benefits were adjusted pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B, in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001, based on a date of injury of October 23, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">On or about April 10, 2002, the Commonwealth unilaterally determined that the \u00a7 34B adjustment should instead be based on the February 4, 1994, date of the employee\u2019s subsequent injury, rather than the October 23, 1987, date of the employee\u2019s original injury. The Commonwealth recalculated the adjusted benefit rate and advised the employee that it would thereafter pay \u00a7 34A benefits at the recalculated rate, less a weekly deduction to recoup the overpayment attributable to the previous use of the 1987 injury date for purposes of calculating the \u00a7 34B adjustment. In response, the employee filed a claim with the DIA for reinstatement of the \u00a7 34B adjustment based on the 1987 injury date and penalties pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(5). An administrative judge concluded that the employee was entitled to \u00a7 34B adjustment of his benefits based on the 1987 date of injury and, on the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal, the reviewing board affirmed (albeit on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>different grounds).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commonwealth\u2019s appeal to this court followed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>At issue is the interplay between G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34B and 35B. Under the unambiguous terms of \u00a7 35B, the compensation rate applicable to an employee\u2019s claim for benefits based on a subsequent injury is determined as of the date of the subsequent injury. See <em>Taylor\u2019s Case, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 499-500 (1998). See also <em>Don Francisco\u2019s Case, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 463 (1982) (\u201cUnder \u00a7 35B, . . . the employee\u2019s right to compensation . . . originate] in the change in the employee\u2019s condition subsequent to his return to work\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Section 34B provides for an annual adjustment of benefits, on a review date of October 1 of each year, based on the change in the average weekly wage from the date of injury to the review date. The evident purpose of the cost of living adjustment under \u00a7 34B is to protect an individual\u2019s economic position \u201cby acting as a buffer against the erosion of inflation.\u201d <em>Sliski\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. 126, 135 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">In concluding that the employee\u2019s \u00a7 34B cost of living adjustment should be based on the October 23, 1987, date of his original injury, instead of the February 4,1994, date of his subsequent injury, the reviewing board compared the rate adjusting provisions of \u00a7 35B, applicable upon the occurrence of a subsequent injury, to those of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 51 A,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which apply when no compensation has been paid on a claim before the date of the final decision on that claim. Noting its conclusion in a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>case that the cost of living adjustment under \u00a7 34B should be based on the date of injury, notwithstanding an adjustment of benefits under \u00a7 51A based on a later date of the claim\u2019s final decision, the reviewing board stated that its analysis of \u00a7 51A is equally applicable to the rate shifting effect of \u00a7 35B, and accordingly concluded that the establishment of benefits for a subsequent injury under \u00a7 35B, based on the date of the subsequent injury, would not affect the date of injury used for purposes of the cost of living adjustment under \u00a7 34B.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The employee also offers an alternative path to the same conclusion, rooted in the language of the statute. Section 34B provides that the cost of living adjustment prescribed thereby is to be determined by reference to the date of injury. Since \u00a7 35B involves a recurrence of a preexisting injury, rather than a new injury, the employee suggests that the \u201cdate of injury\u201d for purposes of the \u00a7 34B cost of living adjustment must be based on the date of the original injury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In our view, the reviewing board\u2019s and the employee\u2019s interpretations violate both the letter and the spirit of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u201c[A] statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>perfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 255 (1994), quoting from <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975). \u201c[T]he statutory language itself is the principal source of insight into the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Schejfler\u2019s Case, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). \u201cThe language of the statute is not to be enlarged or limited by construction unless its object and plain meaning require it.\u201d <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993). \u201cThe interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with primary responsibility for administering it is entitled to substantial deference.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, \u201c[a]n incorrect interpretation of a statute by an administrative agency is not entitled to deference.\u201d <em>Kszepka\u2019s Case, </em>408 Mass. 843, 847 (1990). See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">We have previously held, in accordance with the express terms of \u00a7 35B, that an employee who suffers an aggravation of an earlier injury two months or more after returning to work is entitled to compensation at the rate applicable on the date of his subsequent injury. See <em>Don Francisco\u2019s Case, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 460-461. In so holding, we construed the term \u201cinjury\u201d to include \u201cthe aggravation of a preexisting condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In accordance with that holding, the employee\u2019s benefits in the present case were determined on the basis of the average weekly wage rate as of the date of his subsequent injury. Under the terms of \u00a7 35B, then, the date of injury used for purposes of determining the compensation rate applicable to a subsequent injury is the date of the subsequent injury, rather than the original injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Under \u00a7 34B, the cost of living adjustment is determined by the change in the average weekly wage between the date of the injury and the applicable annual review date. As we have observed, the purpose of the adjustment is to maintain the purchasing power of the benefits, once established, against the erosive effects of inflation. That purpose is met by the application of the \u00a7 34B formula to the date on which benefits are established \u2014 in other words, to the date of the subsequent injury in cases to which \u00a7 35B applies. It would be anomalous to apply \u00a7 34B\u2019s cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>living adjustment to benefits using a date other than the date on which the benefits are determined, if the purpose of the cost of living adjustment is to preserve, rather than to augment, the purchasing power of the benefits initially established.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Our conclusion, that for purposes of the \u00a7 34B cost of living adjustment to \u00a7 35B benefits the \u201cdate of injury\u201d should be the date of the employee\u2019s subsequent injury, is also consistent with the treatment of adjustments to benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35C,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in cases where there is a lengthy delay between the date of the injury and the date on which the employee becomes eligible for benefits. Under \u00a7 35C, the applicable date for purposes of the \u00a7 34B cost of living adjustment is the date on which the benefits are determined, rather than the date of the injury. The essential point is that in order to maintain the purchasing power of benefits once awarded, the cost of living adjustment under \u00a7 34B should be applied to such benefits as of the date on which they are established.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">For the reasons we have stated, the decision of the reviewing board was based on an error of law and is reversed. A new order shall issue stating that the employee\u2019s benefits shall be adjusted under \u00a7 34B based on the change in the average weekly wage between February 4, 1994, and each applicable review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>date.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The case is remanded to the reviewing board for consideration of any right the Commonwealth may have to recoupment of any excess payments made based on use of the October 23, 1987, date for previous \u00a7 34B adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-13\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 35B, inserted by St. 1970, c. 667, \u00a7 1, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-14\">\u201cAn employee who has been receiving compensation under this chapter and who has returned to work for a period of not less than two months shall, if he is subsequently injured and receives compensation, be paid such compensation at the rate in effect at the time of the subsequent injury whether or not such subsequent injury is determined to be a recurrence of the former injury; provided, that if compensation for the old injury was paid in a lump sum, he shall not receive compensation unless the subsequent claim is determined to be a new injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b40-15\">As pertinent here, G.

Similarly, the parties entered into a stipulation in November, 2000, during a hearing before the DIA, which stated that the date of injury was October 23, 1987. The administrative judge held that the Commonwealth was bound by the \u00a7 19 agreement and the stipulation as to the \u201cdate of injury\u201d to be used for purposes of the \u00a7 34B adjustment. As observed in our introduction, the reviewing board affirmed on the ground that, under the terms of \u00a7 34B, the annual cost of living adjustment is based on the date of the original injury, rather than the date of the subsequent injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b43-14\">Although the reviewing board reversed so much of the administrative judge\u2019s order denying the employee a G.

In its brief, the Commonwealth states that if it prevails on appeal, then no penalty is due to the employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b43-15\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 51A, inserted by St. 1969, c. 833, \u00a7 1, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u201cIn any claim in which no compensation has been paid prior to the final decision on such claim, said final decision shall take into consideration the compensation provided by statute on the date of the decision, rather than the date of the injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The question of the interplay between \u00a7\u00a7 51A and 34B is not before us, and we express no view concerning the reviewing board\u2019s prior determination of that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b44-10\">As a third alternative basis to support use of the October 23, 1987, date of injury for purposes of the \u00a7 34B adjustment, the employee proposes the rationale employed by the administrative judge. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>However, neither the \u00a7 19 agreement nor the hearing stipulation concerned the subject matter of the \u00a7 34B adjustment. In both cases, the agreement and the stipulation reflected the reality that the employee had suffered an injury on October 23, 1987, merely as background information. Moreover, on neither occasion was the basis for compensation determined based on the average weekly wage in effect on October 23, 1987. We do not view the parties\u2019 \u00a7 19 agreement or stipulation as binding or preclusive in establishing the October 23, 1987, date for purposes of subsequent \u00a7 34B adjustments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b46-7\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 35C, inserted by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 45, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">\u201cWhen there is a difference of five years or more between the date of injury and the initial date on which the injured worker or his survivor first became eligible for benefits . . . , the applicable benefits shall be those in effect on the first date of eligibility for benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">\u201cFor purposes of adjustments to compensation under sections thirty-four B and thirty-five F for employees subject to this section, the first date of eligibility for benefits rather than the date of injury shall be used for purposes of computing such supplemental benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b46-10\">Contrary to the suggestion of the employee and the reviewing board, we do not consider the explicit treatment of the \u00a7 34B adjustment in \u00a7 35C to reflect a conscious choice by the Legislature to base the \u00a7 34B adjustment on the date of the original injury in cases of a subsequent injury under \u00a7 35B. Though \u00a7 35B omits a similar explicit treatment, for the reasons we have described, we consider the language of \u00a7 35B to express with sufficient clarity that the date of injury used both for purposes of establishing benefits and for subsequent cost of living adjustment to be the date of the subsequent injury, rather than the date of the original injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Because we agree with the position taken by the Commonwealth, we likewise reverse so much of the reviewing board\u2019s decision as awarded G.
