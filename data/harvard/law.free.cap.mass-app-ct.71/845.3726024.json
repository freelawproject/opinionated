Haines (claimant) was entitled to continued dependent\u2019s compensation as the surviving spouse of the deceased employee, because she was \u201cin fact not fully self-supporting\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31, as appearing in St. 1982, c. 663, \u00a7 1. The Commonwealth (self-insurer) appeals, arguing that the claimant\u2019s annual pension made her \u201cin fact\u201d fully self-supporting. We affirm the reviewing board\u2019s decision in this case of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\"><em>Background. </em>William P. Haines (employee) was employed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>Middlesex County as a security guard. In 1991, he suffered a heart attack in the course of his employment and left his job, never to return. He received weekly payments under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a734 and 34A, until his death in 1999. Upon his death, his wife, the claimant, received survivor\u2019s benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31, for 250 weeks. The Commonwealth then moved to terminate her payments, claiming that because she received her own annual retirement pension<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she was therefore \u201cin fact . . . fully self-supporting\u201d under \u00a7 31. An administrative judge agreed, but on appeal, the reviewing board reversed and ordered the continued payment of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The sole issue before us is whether the claimant\u2019s pension should be included in calculating whether she is in fact fully self-supporting under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31. The parties have stipulated that the claimant is fully self-supporting if her pension is considered, and not fully self-supporting if it is not considered. We review questions of statutory construction de nova and will overturn an agency decision inconsistent with governing law. <em>McDonough\u2019s Case, </em>448 Mass. 79, 81 (2006). However, where the agency is \u201ccharged with primary responsibility for administering [the statute],\u201d we grant its interpretation substantial deference and will not disturb it where the interpretation is reasonable. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 834, 838 (2007), quoting from <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">The fourth paragraph of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31, provides that, after payment of two hundred fifty (250) weeks of compensation benefits, \u201ca dependent unremarried widow . . . shall continue to receive further payments but only during such periods as . . . she is in fact not fully self-supporting.\u201d In turn, \u201c[section 38 [of G. L. c. 152] categorizes the types of benefits or monies that shall be excluded from the \u2018self-supporting\u2019 analysis under \u00a7 31.\u201d <em>Wilson\u2019s Case, 67 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 1, 6 (2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 38 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>\u201cExcept as expressly provided elsewhere in this chapter, no savings or insurance of the injured employee independent of this chapter shall be considered in determining compensation payable thereunder, nor shall benefits derived from any other source than the insurer be considered in such determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 38,. as amended by St. 1986, c. 662, \u00a7 33. The parties agree that the phrase \u201cbenefits derived from any other source\u201d in \u00a7 38 applies to the employee\u2019s pension and it must be excluded. See <em>Wilson\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 7, quoting from <em>Mizrahi\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 733, 737 (1947) (referring to \u00a7 38 benefits as including entitlements from, among other sources, \u201cpension plans governmental or otherwise\u201d). They disagree whether the phrase applies to the claimant\u2019s own pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">We affirm the reviewing board\u2019s determination that the claimant\u2019s pension is \u201cthe product of a benefit scheme to which the employee (or claimant) contributed\u201d <em>(Wilson\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 7), and thus may not be considered in the fully self-supporting analysis of \u00a7 31. The comprehensive discussion in <em>Wilson\u2019s Case </em>(see note 2, <em>supra) </em>also reinforces the conclusion in <em>Mizrahi\u2019s Case </em>that \u00a7 38 should be broadly construed in the relevant \u201cfield [i.e., the realm of sick benefits, <em>pensions, </em>and other benefits from membership associations]\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Wilson\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 7, quoting from <em>Mizrahi\u2019s Case, supra. </em>Section 38 makes no distinction between the employee\u2019s benefits and other benefits; if the benefit is not derived from the insurer, it is excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Under these circumstances we do not interpret \u00a7 38 as excluding only benefits of the \u201cinjured employee\u201d \u2014 that phrase is defined by the statute to include the employee\u2019s dependents where, as here, the employee is deceased. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(4), seventh par.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that \u201ca different meaning is plainly required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>by the context.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While a broader contextual argument, such as that made by the Commonwealth in connection with the claimant\u2019s over-all level of income, is not irrational, it is neither \u201cplainly required by the context [n]or specifically prescribed.\u201d Although the claimant is \u201cself-supporting\u201d in the colloquial sense of the phrase, that result could also be reached where sources of income undeniably excluded from consideration under the statute (such as, in this case, a deceased employee\u2019s pension) are sufficient to provide for her support.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is equally rational, under this statutory scheme, to assert that the claimant\u2019s pension should have no different effect on the employee\u2019s benefits after his death than it would if the claimant had retired during the employee\u2019s lifetime, a perspective directly reinforced by the referential language of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(4), seventh par.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that in \u00a7 31 the phrase \u201cin fact\u201d means that any and all income of the claimant should be considered proves too much, as it would have us consider even the employee\u2019s benefits received by the claimant, which we may not do. See <em>Wilson\u2019s Case, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 6-7. Moreover, the \u201cin fact\u201d language emphasizes the absence of any causal element in the showing that must be made under \u00a7 31, in distinction to the showing of \u201cincapacity for work\u201d that an injured employee must make under other sections of the statute. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34, 34A, &amp; 35. See also Kistin, Dependency Benefits Under the Massachusetts Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 5 B.C. Indus. &amp; Com. L. Rev. 527, 563 (1964). Use of the phrase \u201cin fact not fully self-supporting\u201d in \u00a7 31 indicates that the claimant must show only that the sources of income which may be considered under the statute are inadequate, rather than incapacity for work now or in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Finally, even if this is not the only permissible reading of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>arguably somewhat ambiguous provision, the reviewing board\u2019s reasonable interpretation is entitled to our deference. See <em>McCarty\u2019s Case, </em>445 Mass. 361, 367 (2005), citing <em>Richards\u2019s Case, 62 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 701, 706 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">\n<em>Decision of reviewing board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-7\">The claimant is retired from her position as the assistant town manager for the town of Billerica, and receives an annual superannuation retirement pension from the Middlesex retirement system.
