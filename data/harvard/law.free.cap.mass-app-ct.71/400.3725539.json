In his suit, Staveley claimed that the city\u2019s action violated his rights under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 74, as well as his right to due process of law. A judge of the Superior Court allowed Staveley\u2019s motion for summary judgment on liability and a second judge awarded him damages in the amount of $68,200. The city appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the city\u2019s cross motion, were argued on a statement of agreed facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The essential facts are these. In April, 1997, Staveley and the city entered into an agreement settling Staveley\u2019s then pending claim before the Civil Service Commission (commission). That claim alleged that the city had improperly bypassed Staveley, then a Lowell police lieutenant, for promotion to captain in favor of a person below him on the promotion list. As part of the settlement, Staveley was promoted to captain but agreed to \u201cforgo the opportunity to apply for promotion to the rank of Deputy Superintendent in the Lowell Police Department for the next available promotion after the execution of this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">When Staveley and the city executed the agreement, one deputy superintendent position was available, but there was no outstanding civil service list for that position. In August, 1997, however, the city council enacted an ordinance creating a second deputy superintendent position effective as of July 1, 1997. Lowell police Captains Dennis Cormier and Kenneth Lavallee were provisionally appointed to fill the new and pre-existing positions pending permanent appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>About the time it created the new deputy superintendent position, the city, acting under a \u201cDelegation Agreement\u201d with the Massachusetts Human Resources Department (HRD), began an \u201cassessment center\u201d process to fill both positions permanently.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the delegation agreement, city manager Brian Martin became the \u201cDelegation Administrator\u201d and assumed responsibility \u201cfor all matters relative to [the] delegation agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In June, 1998, Staveley submitted an application and paid a fee for the assessment center evaluation, then scheduled for September, 1998. In July, Martin, citing the 1997 settlement agreement, rejected Staveley\u2019s application and returned his fee. Staveley resubmitted his application, but Martin again rejected it for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The assessment center evaluation took place as scheduled, without Staveley\u2019s participation. Lavallee and Cormier were listed first and second on the resulting civil service list and were appointed permanently. Staveley did not file an administrative claim, but instead commenced this action in June, 2000, some twenty months after the September, 1998, evaluation, claiming that, by refusing to allow his participation in the assessment center process, the city had violated his right to due process of law and had violated the provisions of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 74, a statute carrying criminal penalties for those who interfere with an applicant\u2019s pursuit of certain rights under the civil service laws.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">In allowing Staveley\u2019s motion for summary judgment on li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>ability, the first judge ruled that the settlement agreement did not bar Staveley from applying for the second deputy superintendent position the city created in August, 1997. Rejecting the city\u2019s claim that Staveley had failed to exhaust administrative remedies, the judge stated, in effect, that no administrative remedy existed. He concluded by ruling that the city had violated G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 74, and Staveley\u2019s right to due process of law by barring him from the assessment center process, and that his claim was not barred by loches. Having found liability, the judge scheduled the question of the appropriate remedy for resolution at a later proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">At the subsequent proceeding before a second judge, the city, among other things, presented testimony from the Lowell police superintendent, who said that he had bypassed Staveley for appointment to captain and would likely have bypassed him again had he emerged at the top of a deputy superintendent list.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge concluded that because Staveley was \u201cnot allowed to be considered for the position of Deputy Superintendente] \u201d and because it was \u201chighly unlikely that [he would] <em>ever </em>be put on equal footing with other candidates for the position of Deputy Superintendente] \u201d the appropriate remedy was damages measured by the difference in the salaries of a captain and a deputy superintendent. Accordingly, he awarded Staveley $68,200.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">On appeal, the city first argues that Staveley is barred from recovering because he failed to exhaust available administrative remedies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Secondarily, the city urges that, even if Staveley is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>entitled to recover something, he is not entitled to an award based on the salary differential the second judge utilized. On both counts, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Our conclusion that Staveley was required to exhaust administrative remedies is informed by the familiar principle that \u201c[wjhere the Legislature has provided an administrative process for the resolution of disputes in the first instance, the courts must respect that choice.\u201d <em>Puorro </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 61, 64 (2003). Here, by enacting G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 <em>2(b),</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Legislature created an administrative process that was available to Staveley, his claims to the contrary notwithstanding, and that was important for smooth operation of the civil service laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Viewed together, several components of the civil service laws reveal both the availability and the importance of the process \u00a7 <em>2(b) </em>created. By virtue of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 5, the personnel administrator has general responsibility for administration of the civil service laws. Included among the administrator\u2019s responsibilities are the tasks of creating and administering the process that produces civil service eligibility lists.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 5. Acting in accordance with G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 <em>5(1), </em>however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>administrator may delegate those functions to State agencies, cities, and towns.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The delegation agreement in this case, which neither party challenges, embodies the administrator\u2019s delegation of authority to the city pursuant to \u00a7 <em>5(1). </em>Under the agreement, Martin, the city manager, became the delegation administrator, responsible, as noted earlier, \u201cfor all matters relative to [the] delegation agreement.\u201d More specifically, Martin, as delegation administrator, was responsible for \u201cacceptance and processing of examination applications[ and] verification of examination eligibility.\u201d He was also responsible for a broad range of duties normally performed by the administrator, including establishing and maintaining eligibility lists, certifications from those lists, ensuring public access to all public records, providing a mechanism for ensuring that candidates have an opportunity to review their standing on eligible lists, and other like duties. By virtue of the delegation agreement, then, Martin acted as the personnel administrator with respect to the delegated functions the agreement contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Neither the personnel administrator nor the delegation administrator has final and unlimited decision-making authority. Instead, those who are aggrieved by the administrator\u2019s actions and decisions have a right of appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 <em>2(b), </em>which broadly empowers the commission \u201c[t]o hear and decide appeals by a person aggrieved by any decision, action, or failure to act by the administrator.\u201d See note 8, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">To be sure, \u00a7 <em>2(b) </em>does not explicitly mention appeals from a \u201cdelegation administrator,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and Staveley therefore urges that appeals from decisions of a delegation administrator, as op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>posed to those of the personnel administrator, are impermissible. We do not agree, for acceptance of Staveley\u2019s argument would be fundamentally inconsistent with the central role the Legislature intended the commission to have in overseeing operation of the civil service laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Our decisions and those of the Supreme Judicial Court have noted that the commission brings to disputes arising out of the civil service laws a substantial body of expertise, see <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Minority Law Enforcement Officers </em>v. <em>Abban, </em>434 Mass. 256, 262-263 (2001), on which the smooth and sound administration of those laws is dependent. The commission\u2019s expertise relates not only to the way in which various statutes affect the substantive rights of civil service applicants and employees but also the appropriate remedy for cases in which individual rights have been violated. In the remedial category, the commission\u2019s powers are broad and its expertise particularly helpful. See generally <em>Mulhern </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 920, 921 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Acceptance of Staveley\u2019s argument that \u00a7 <em>2(b) </em>does not permit appeals to the commission from decisions of a delegation administrator would mean that the personnel administrator, by exercising the powers of delegation contained in \u00a7 <em>5(1), </em>could remove from the commission\u2019s oversight and expertise significant decisions made in many areas covered by the civil service laws. Indeed, the broad responsibilities the administrator delegated to Martin in this case show how large an area of his statutory responsibility he could remove from the commission\u2019s oversight were we to accept Staveley\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Statutes, of course, are to be construed in a manner designed to carry out the Legislature\u2019s manifest intent. See, e.g., <em>Anderson St. Assocs. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>442 Mass. 812, 816 (2004); <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 862, 867-868 (2001). We think that the Legislature would not have placed the elaborate civil service system embodied in G. L. c. 31 under the commission\u2019s supervisory authority while at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>same time giving the administrator, whose decisions are appeal-able to the commission, the power to remove broad areas of the system from the commission\u2019s supervision. Instead, we think that the administrator\u2019s powers of delegation must be viewed in the context of the Legislature\u2019s decision to charge the commission with responsibility for smooth and consistent operation of a system that affects so centrally the manner in which the vast majority of the Commonwealth\u2019s police and fire personnel are hired and promoted. When the appellate provisions of \u00a7 <em>2(b) </em>are viewed in that context, we think that the \u201cadministrator\u201d from whose decisions an appeal to the commission is available includes a \u201cdelegation administrator\u201d like Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Staveley next argues, and the first judge agreed, that even if the commission had jurisdiction to resolve appeals from decisions of the delegation administrator, there was nothing for the commission to review in this case because Martin\u2019s decision was based on his interpretation, aided by that of the Lowell city solicitor, of the settlement agreement, not on some provision of the civil service laws. In the judge\u2019s view, appeals to the commission were limited to appeals from actions of the administrator described in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 22,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and none of Staveley\u2019s claims challenged those actions.-See also G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 23, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">But the commission\u2019s power under \u00a7 <em>2(b) </em>ranges far beyond the contours of \u00a7\u00a7 22-24 to encompass \u201cappeals by a person aggrieved by <em>any </em>decision, action, or failure to act by the administrator\u201d (emphasis added). \u201cPersons aggrieved\u201d are defined by \u00a7 <em>2(b) </em>as those who claim that the administrator acted in violation of G. L. c. 31 and \u201cthe rules or basic merit principles promulgated thereunder.\u201d The \u201c[bjasic merit principles,\u201d inserted by St. 1981, c. 767, \u00a7 10, are defined in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1, to include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">\u201c(a) recruiting, selecting and advancing of employees on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>the basis of their relative ability, knowledge and skills including open consideration of qualified applicants for initial appointment; ...(e) assuring fair treatment of all applicants and employees in all aspects of personnel administration . . . with proper regard for . . . basic rights outlined in this chapter and constitutional rights as citizens, and; (/) assuring that all employees ... are protected from arbitrary and capricious actions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">So defined, the commission\u2019s oversight responsibility is broad, and Staveley\u2019s claims fell within its generous scope. The delegation agreement empowered Martin to make decisions regarding \u201cexamination eligibility,\u201d and his decision to bar Staveley from participating in the assessment process was a decision about Staveley\u2019s ineligibility for that process, an ineligibility Martin found in the terms of the settlement agreement. An appeal would have allowed the commission to decide whether Martin was correct or whether his decision stretched the agreement beyond its proper boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Insofar as Staveley\u2019s claims under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 74,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> are concerned, his rights surely were capable of vindication through an appeal to the commission. See generally, e.g., <em>Cotter </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>73 F. Supp. 2d 62, 67 (D. Mass. 1999). If, on appeal, the commission concluded that Martin was wrong, it possessed the remedial power to provide Staveley with an opportunity to compete for the deputy super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>intendent position before it was too late to do so. See <em>Bielawski </em>v. <em>Personnel Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admn., </em>422 Mass. 459, 465 (1996); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 446, 451 (2000); <em>Mulhern </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. at 921. Ultimately, the commission\u2019s resolution of those and any other pertinent issues was subject to review in the Superior Court and in any necessary appellate proceedings thereafter. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44. Under all of those circumstances, there simply were no permissible grounds for Staveley\u2019s election to bypass the commission before commencing this action. See generally <em>Puorro </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. at 63-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Although what we have said thus far is sufficient to dispose of the case, a brief look at damages, the second of the city\u2019s appellate issues, is appropriate. As mentioned earlier, the second judge, after a hearing on the appropriate remedy, awarded damages to Staveley based on the difference between his salary as a Lowell police captain and the salary he would have received had he been promoted to deputy superintendent. Even if constitutional rights are violated, however, compensatory damages are available only for the injury actually suffered. See <em>Santana </em>v. <em>Registrars of Voters of Worcester, </em>398 Mass. 862, 869 (1986). Damages based on a wage differential, therefore, necessarily assume that Staveley would have been promoted to deputy superintendent if he had participated in the assessment process.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">To apply for a civil service position, however, is not to obtain it. \u201cThe civil service system does not guarantee an applicant a promotion \u2018at a certain date or upon a specific event.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>447 Mass. 233, 252-253 (2006), quoting from <em>Bielawski </em>v. <em>Personnel Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admn., </em>422 Mass. at 466. While Staveley claims that he was \u201centitled to be promoted, and undoubtedly hoped that [he] would be, there was simply no guarantee that [he] would be successful in that endeavor.\u201d <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., supra </em>at 253. In this case, there were two available deputy superintendent positions and at least three applicants. With no evidence indicating that Staveley was more likely than either of the other two to obtain one of the positions \u2014 indeed, on a record suggesting that he was the least likely of the three to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>either position \u2014 there was no basis for awarding him damages based on a salary differential.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The judgment is vacated. A new judgment shall enter dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The case, however, was not presented as a \u201ccase stated.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Ware </em>v. Hardwick, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 325, 326 (2006). Ordinarily, in reviewing allowance of a summary judgment motion, we look at the record in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was granted. <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Cannon, 69 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 414, 416 (2007). As we see it, though, the dis-positive question in this case deals with primary jurisdiction. See note 7, <em>infra. </em>That question is purely one of law which we are free to decide for ourselves. See generally <em>Choate </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Mashpee, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 376, 387 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\">An assessment center process involves creation of a mechanism for examining, through a series of exercises, each applicant\u2019s professional competence in a variety of areas applicable to the position he or she is seeking, here that of deputy superintendent. Under the agreement, the assessment center was to be created and administered by an outside consultant, which turned out to be the International Association of Chiefs of Police, hired by the city with HRD\u2019s approval. The assessment center process produces the scores used to \u201cestablish a civil service list from which the Appointing Authority must hire in the same way that hiring is done from a \u2018traditional\u2019 Civil Service list.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b434-9\">The delegation agreement applied only to the selection process for the positions of \u201cDeputy Police Chief, Police Captain, and Police Lieutenant.\u201d We infer from the record that the agreement\u2019s reference to \u201c[d]eputy [p]olice [c]hief\u201d was intended to cover selection of Lowell\u2019s \u201cdeputy superintendent.\u201d No party has argued otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b434-10\">In pertinent part, that section provides, \u201cNo person . . . shall wilfully or corruptly defeat, deceive or obstruct any person with respect to his right, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>pursuant to the civil service law and rules, of examination, . . . certification, appointment, promotion or reinstatement . . . .\u201d G.

In any event, the city does not claim that the judge\u2019s damage calculation, as opposed to his decision to award any damages at all, was erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Technically, the issue is one of primary jurisdiction, not exhaustion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">\u201cThe doctrine of \u2018primary jurisdiction\u2019 describes a situation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>which a plaintiff, \u2018in the absence of pending administrative proceedings, invokes the original jurisdiction of a court to decide the merits of a controversy.\u2019 <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admin., 377 </em>Mass. 217, 220 (1979).

L. c. 149, \u00a7 148).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">We also have some doubt that the statute applies to the city. In pertinent part, \u00a7 74 says that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall wilfully or corruptly defeat, deceive or obstruct . . . .\u201d See note 4, <em>supra. </em>When used in a statute, \u201cthe word \u2018person\u2019 ordinarily does not describe the State or its subdivisions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 164, 166 (1994). See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-third (\u201c \u2018Person\u2019 or \u2018whoever\u2019 shall include corporations, societies, associations and partnerships\u201d). As the city notes, \u201cWhen the Legislature intends that provisions in a statute apply to municipalities or governmental entities, it will generally manifest that intent expressly in language to that effect.\u201d <em>Howcroft </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 573, 593 (2001), quoting from Randall &amp; Franklin, Municipal Law &amp; Practice \u00a7 6 (4th ed. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
