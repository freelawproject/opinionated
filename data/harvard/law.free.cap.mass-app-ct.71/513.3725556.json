See G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 15. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\"><em>Background. </em>In September, 2004, the defendant accepted the plaintiff\u2019s offer to purchase property located at 22 Summer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Street in Weston for a total purchase price of $769,000. The parties entered into a purchase and sale agreement (P &amp; S) on October 8, 2004, which was amended on October 15, 2004, and was subject to the issuance of a building permit for an affordable housing project. The P &amp; S required closing within thirty days of the issuance of a building permit and within nine months of the P &amp; S execution date, i.e., July 8, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The notice provision, section 21 of the P &amp; S, set forth explicit requirements regarding the appropriate methods for notices provided by the parties, stating in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201cAll written notices required or permitted to be made under this Agreement shall be delivered in hand, sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, sent by United States Postal Service overnight Express Mail or other overnight delivery service, or by facsimile with a copy sent by first class mail, addressed to the BUYER or SELLER or their authorized representative at the address set forth in this paragraph. Such notice shall be deemed to have been given upon delivery or, if sent by certified mail on the date of delivery set forth in the receipt or in the absence of a receipt three business days after deposited or, if sent by overnight mail or delivery, the next business day after deposit with the overnight mail or delivery service, whether or not a signature is required. Acceptance of any notice, whether by delivery or mail, shall be sufficient if accepted or signed by a person having express or implied authority to receive same. Notice shall also be deemed adequate if given in any other form permitted by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">When the plaintiff was unable to close by July 8, 2005, the parties executed a document entitled \u201cAgreement of the Parties\u201d (extension), which incorporated and revived the P &amp; S, and set the time for performance as October 15, 2005, unless the plaintiff provided written notice to the defendant on or before October 5, 2005, to extend the closing date to December 15, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">On October 24, 2005, the defendant notified the plaintiff that his failure to close or to extend the closing by October 5, 2005, constituted a material breach of the parties\u2019 P &amp; S and extension agreements and that the agreements consequently were void and no longer in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>In November, 2005, the plaintiff filed a verified complaint and an amended verified complaint seeking declaratory relief, specific performance, and damages for breach of contract, all arising from the failure of the parties to consummate the P &amp; S. In his amended verified complaint, the plaintiff stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">\u201cOn or about September 23, 2005 [the plaintiff] . . . hand delivered notice of his decision to extend the closing date to December 15, 2005 to the offices of [defendant\u2019s counsel].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The complaint contained no other specifics regarding how delivery was effectuated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">On November 4, 2005, the plaintiff filed a motion for approval of a memorandum of lis pendens, which the defendant opposed. After a judge of the Superior Court allowed the motion, the defendant filed an answer and counterclaim. In her answer, the defendant denied that the plaintiff had hand-delivered a notice to extend the closing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">On December 27, 2005, the defendant notified the plaintiff of his obligation to preserve all electronic evidence regarding the creation and authenticity of the notice. In March, 2006, the defendant filed a motion to compel the production of documents. The court allowed the defendant\u2019s motion, which was unopposed. In the ensuing discovery, the plaintiff revealed, for the first time, that when he delivered the notice \u201c[n]o one was in the office so [he] left [it] on what looked like the receptionist\u2019s cubicle on top of a pad that seemed to be used for recording telephone messages.\u201d The plaintiff also claimed that the electronic evidence, by which the defendant had sought to authenticate the notice letter, was damaged and unrecoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">In June, 2006, the defendant filed a special motion to dismiss and a motion for dissolution of the memorandum of lis pendens. See G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 15(c). The motions were heard by a second judge of the Superior Court who, on July 31, 2006, issued a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>memorandum of decision and an order allowing the special motion to dismiss and dissolving the memorandum of lis pendens. In his memorandum of decision, the judge found that the plaintiff failed to give proper notice of his intent to extend the closing date. The judge also found that the plaintiff omitted material facts from his amended verified complaint, namely, that the plaintiff did not deliver the notice to a person and that no one with authority accepted or signed for the notice. From the subsequent order allowing the defendant\u2019s special motion to dismiss and dissolving the memorandum of lis pendens, the plaintiff brought the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><em>Contract interpretation. </em>The judge below determined that the plaintiff did not comply with the contractual notice provision prescribing delivery \u201cin hand\u201d because the plaintiff did not put the notice in the hand of a person with express or implied authority to accept delivery. The plaintiff contends that the judge\u2019s interpretation of the notice provision was erroneous because the term \u201cin hand\u201d merely required delivery by hand to defense counsel\u2019s address.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with the judge\u2019s interpretation of \u201cin hand\u201d and his conclusion that the plaintiff did not comply with the requirement of \u201cin hand\u201d delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u201cThe interpretation of a written contract is a question of law.\u201d <em>Brillante </em>v. <em>R.W. Granger &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 542, 548 (2002). When the words of a contract are not ambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>pus, the contract language must be construed in its usual and ordinary sense. <em>116 Commonwealth Condominium Trust </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>433 Mass. 373, 376 (2001). \u201cWe read the [contract] as written. We are not free to revise it or change the order of the words.\u201d <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., </em>391 Mass. 143, 147 (1984). In addition, \u201c[a]ll parts of an agreement are to be construed together as constituting a single and consistent arrangement.\u201d <em>Crimmins &amp; Peirce Co. </em>v. <em>Kidder Peabody Acceptance Corp., </em>282 Mass. 367, 375 (1933). We \u201cmust \u2018give effect to the parties\u2019 intentions and construe the language to give it reasonable meaning wherever possible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brillante, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Baybank Middlesex </em>v. <em>1200 Beacon Properties, Inc., </em>760 F. Supp. 957, 963 (D. Mass. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The parties have not cited any authority on the meaning of \u201cin hand,\u201d and although that term appears in our statutes, court rules, and decisions, we have been unable to locate any Massachusetts cases that explicitly define that term. There is legal authority, however, that uses the term \u201cin hand\u201d to characterize delivery to a person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Harding </em>v. <em>Studley, </em>290 Mass. 310, 313, 315 (1935) (characterizing handing of item to individual as a \u201cdelivery in hand\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 281, 282-283 (1983) (characterizing statutory phrase, \u201cdelivered to the offender,\u201d as \u201cin-hand delivery\u201d); <em>Lombardi </em>v. <em>Lombardi, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 407, 413, 415 (2007) (characterizing statutory phrase, \u201cthe individual is personally served with a notice,\u201d as \u201cin-hand service\u201d). This authority indicates that delivery \u201cin hand,\u201d as used in its ordinary and usual sense, means that the item to be delivered is placed in the hand of the intended receiver \u2014 not that the item is carried in the deliverer\u2019s hand, as suggested by the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation. The plaintiff\u2019s interpretation would more accurately describe \u201cby hand\u201d delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>We believe that our view of the meaning of \u201cin hand\u201d delivery also finds support in both the context in which the term appears and the purpose of the contract\u2019s notice provisions. In addition to delivery \u201cin hand,\u201d the notice provision lists three other methods that the parties could use to effectuate delivery of notice. Each of these methods (certified mail, overnight delivery, and facsimile service) provide a paper or electronic trail, thereby enabling delivery to be verified without reliance on an uncorroborated assertion by the plaintiff. See <em>Cinder Prod. Corp. </em>v. <em>Schena Constr. Co., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 927, 929 (1986) (registered mail and certified mail facilitate proof of delivery of notice); <em>Computune, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tocio, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 489, 493 (1998), quoting from <em>Gerson Realty Inc. </em>v. <em>Casaly, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 875, 875 (1974) (\u201c \u2018The function of a requirement that notice be transmitted by registered mail is to provide a means of resolving disputes as to the fact of delivery of the notice.\u2019 Delivery by Federal Express . . . serves the same function and provides the same proof of delivery as certified or registered mail\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Thus, three of the four alternative methods by which notice may be effected create a means of verification that does not depend solely on the notice giver. While \u201cin hand\u201d delivery does not by itself generate the same kind of written or electronic verification (absent a requirement of a signed receipt), it at least envisions a living recipient who can testify that a particular document was in fact received. This is not the case with \u201cby hand\u201d delivery which, as here, can result in a notice reaching a place but not a person. That method accomplishes nothing with respect to verification of receipt that is not accomplished by ordinary mail. Giving these contractual provisions a construction that will effectuate what appears to have been the parties\u2019 intent, see <em>Bray </em>v. <em>Hickman, </em>263 Mass. 409, 412 (1928), we conclude that the parties sought the extra assurance of delivery that was possible by means of actual contact with a living recipient.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The plaintiff, in essence, asks this court to revise the explicit language of the notice provision from \u201cin hand\u201d to \u201cby hand.\u201d We decline. We conclude that the term \u201cin hand\u201d requires that the plaintiff place the notice in another person\u2019s hand, as this construction is supported by the language of the contract as written and adheres to the usual and ordinary meaning of \u201cin hand,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>and such a construction, consistent with the other delivery methods, provides a means of verifying delivery that does not depend solely on the plaintiff\u2019s veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In light of our construction of the notice provision, and given that the plaintiff makes no claim that he placed the notice in another individual\u2019s hand, we also conclude that the plaintiff did not comply with the notice provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\"><em>Dismissal of action and dissolution of lis pendens. A </em>memorandum of lis pendens is a notice on the record title of real estate that reflects the pendency of any action that \u201caffects the title to real property or the use and occupation thereof.\u201d <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 700 (2004). General Laws c. 184, \u00a7 15, provides \u201ca mechanism for expedited removal of an unjustified lis pendens, including dismissal of frivolous claims supporting an approved lis pendens.\u201d <em>Galipault </em>v. <em>Wash Rock Invs., LLC, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 73, 81 (2005), quoting from <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, supra </em>at 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Section 15(c), inserted by St. 2002, c. 496, \u00a7 2, provides that a special motion to dismiss \u201cshall be granted if the court finds that the action or claim is frivolous because (1) it is devoid of any reasonable factual support; or (2) it is devoid of any arguable basis in law; or (3) the action or claim is subject to dismissal based on a valid legal defense such as the statute of frauds.\u201d The statute requires that the judge consider the verified pleadings and affidavits in ruling on the motion and, if the motion is granted, award costs and attorney\u2019s fees to the aggrieved party. See <em>Galipault, supra </em>at 81-82. The applicable standard of review for the dismissal of the plaintiffs action, dissolution of the lis pendens, and awarding of fees and costs is whether the trial court judge \u201ccommitted an error of law or abused his discretion in applying the standards of G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 15(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">General Laws c. 184, \u00a7 15(6), provides that the proceeding underlying a request for a memorandum of lis pendens must be commenced by a complaint including a certification from the movant that \u201cno material facts have been omitted therefrom.\u201d <em>Galipault, supra </em>at 82, quoting from G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 15(6), inserted by St. 2002, c. 496, \u00a7 2. A party\u2019s failure to include all material facts may result in the dismissal of that party\u2019s claims where the omitted facts establish that those claims are devoid of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>reasonable factual support or arguable basis in law. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at 82-83. A \u201cmaterial fact\u201d is one that is \u201csignificant or essential to the issue or matter at hand.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 629 (8th ed. 2004). See <em>Dagan </em>v. <em>Jewish Community Hous. for the </em>Elderly, 45 Mass. App. Ct. 511, 513-514 (1998) (in summary judgment context, material fact is one essential to element in plaintiff\u2019s case).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Here, the entire case turned on whether notice was properly delivered pursuant to the contractual provision. As discussed above, the notice provision required that the plaintiff place the notice in the hand of a person. However, the only details provided in the plaintiff\u2019s amended verified complaint regarding the method by which he delivered the notice were misleading. The plaintiff had simply stated that he \u201chand delivered notice of his decision to extend the closing date ... to the offices of [defendant\u2019s counsel].\u201d Moreover, the plaintiff did not disclose until four months after he filed his amended verified complaint \u2014 after the judge issued an order compelling the plaintiff to respond to the defendant\u2019s discovery \u2014 that \u201c[n]o one was in the office so [he] left [the notice] on what looked like the receptionist\u2019s cubicle on top of a pad that seemed to be used for recording telephone messages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Comparing the plaintiff\u2019s allegations in his complaint to the requirements in the notice provision, it is clear that the plaintiff omitted a material fact, namely, that he did not place the notice in a person\u2019s hand. This detail went to the crux of the case, and when it was finally disclosed, the factual and legal deficiencies in the plaintiff\u2019s claims were immediately exposed. Accordingly, the judge properly concluded that the underlying claims were frivolous because they lacked factual or legal support. The judge therefore did not err by allowing the defendant\u2019s special motion to dismiss or by dissolving the memorandum of lis pendens.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>As we see no error of law or abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s application of the standards of G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 15(c), we affirm the order dissolving the memorandum of lis pendens, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action, and awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the defendant. We also allow the defendant\u2019s requests for attorney\u2019s fees and single costs with respect to this appeal. The defendant may file a petition within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>fourteen days of the date of the rescript of this opinion, together with supporting materials, and the plaintiff shall have fourteen days thereafter to respond. See <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>441 Mass. 9, 10-11 (2004). The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings with respect to the defendant\u2019s counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-10\">The plaintiff also alleged in his complaint that he had provided the defendant with verbal notice that he needed to extend the closing. On appeal, the plaintiff claims only that he provided notice \u201cin hand,\u201d and he does not argue that verbal notice was sufficient or that he provided notice in any other way permitted by the notice provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The plaintiff also argues that the judge erred when he construed the third sentence of the notice provision (\u201cAcceptance of any notice . . . shall be sufficient if accepted or signed by a person having express or implied authority to receive same\u201d) to apply to \u201cin hand\u201d deliveries. Although we determine, <em>infra, </em>that the plaintiff did not comply with the \u201cin hand\u201d delivery requirement of the P &amp; S and therefore need not address this issue, we are not persuaded by the plaintiff\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The plaintiff argues, in essence, that the statement, \u201cnotice shall be deemed to have been given upon delivery,\u201d which is located in the second sentence of the notice provision, indicates that the parties did not intend that receipt or awareness of receipt be required. Thus, according to the plaintiff, it would make \u201cno sense\u201d to interpret the notice provision as requiring acceptance or signed acceptance by a person with authority. We reject the plaintiff\u2019s argument for two reasons. First, as contract terms establishing the time of delivery and the methods of acceptance are distinguishable, we see no need to interpret the phrases in the manner pressed by the plaintiff. Second, the plaintiff\u2019s construction violates the principle that \u201cno part of the contract is to be disregarded.\u201d <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Transit Authy., </em>323 Mass. 562, 569 (1949).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b549-6\">There also is legal authority that identifies \u201cin hand\u201d delivery and leaving the item at an address as alternative delivery methods, thereby indicating that \u201cin hand\u201d delivery is not the same as leaving the item at a designated address. See, e.g., G. L. c. 224, \u00a7 14 (\u201cIf the debtor is a natural person, service shall be made by delivery in hand or by leaving a copy at the debtor\u2019s last and usual place of abode\u201d); <em>Christian Book Distribs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 905, 905-906 (2001) (leaving process at defendant\u2019s residence was adequate to perfect personal jurisdiction; delivery \u201cin hand\u201d was not required).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
