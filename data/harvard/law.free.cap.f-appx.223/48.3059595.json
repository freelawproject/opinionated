Santamaria, </em>No. 04 cr 1038 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 20, 2005). The District Court sentenced defendant to a term of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a term of three years\u2019 supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-19\">On appeal, defendant argues that the District Court erred in finding that sentencing disparities created by the Department of Justice\u2019s \u201cfast-track\u201d programs<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>for illegal reentry offenders are not \u201cunwarranted\u201d disparities within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Defendant\u2019s argument is squarely foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 158, 164 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that fast-track programs do not create \u201cunwarranted\u201d sentencing disparities within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6)).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-11\">. The Probation Office\u2019s Presentence Report concluded that defendant\u2019s applicable Guidelines range was 24-30 months. At sentencing, the District Court also imposed a mandatory $100 special assessment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b76-12\">. \"Fast-track\u201d programs operate as a set of policies followed by U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices in certain districts, whereby the Government recommends reduced sentences for violators of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 \"in return for the defendants\u2019 waiver of various rights, including: indictment by a grand jury, trial by jury, presentation of a pre-sentence report, and appellate review of the sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 158, 160 (2d Cir.2006). The programs may be implemented only in select districts that \"confront[] an exceptionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>large number of a specific class of offenses within the district, and failure to handle such cases on an expedited or \"fast-track\" basis would significantly strain prosecutorial and judicial resources available in the district,\u201d or where \"the district confronts some other exceptional local circumstance with respect to a specific class of cases.\u201d Memorandum from Attorney General John Ashcroft Setting Forth Justice Department\u2019s \u201cFast-Track\u201d Policies (Sept. 22, 2003), 16 Fed. Sent. Rep. 134, 2003 WL 23475483, at *2 (2003). Congress has explicitly approved such programs. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650, 675 (2003) (codified in various sections of 18, 28, and 42 U.S.C.). Further, United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K3.1, \u201cEarly Disposition Programs (Policy Statement),\u201d addresses the programs, providing that, \u201c[ujpon motion of the Government, the court may depart downward not more than 4 levels pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the Attorney General of the United States and the United States Attorney for the district in which the court resides.\u201d U.S. Sent'g Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K3.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
