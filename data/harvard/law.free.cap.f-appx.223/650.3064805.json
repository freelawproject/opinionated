R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b679-11\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">Jianzhong Wang, a native and citizen of China, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir.2006), we grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">Wang claims he was persecuted after he provided Falun Gong members a place to meet at a hotel. Contrary to the agency\u2019s findings, Wang\u2019s consistent testimony and documentary evidence reflect that: after he was released from police custody, he remained employed by the hotel until he fled China; he was unofficially demoted from his position as a room service manager; and he did not receive a bonus. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1112 (9th Cir.2002) (the omission of a detail included in an applicant\u2019s oral testimony does not make a supporting document inconsistent or incompatible, and thus will not support an adverse credibility finding). Further, Wang\u2019s testimony that he safely returned to China for eight days when his mother became ill, hiding in a hotel and then staying with an aunt approximately 1000 kilometers from home, is not implausible. <em>See Quan v. Gonzales, </em>428 F.3d 883, 887-88 (9th Cir.2005) (speculation regarding police capabilities based, in part, on country\u2019s geographical size). Consequently, substantial evidence does not support the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b679-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
