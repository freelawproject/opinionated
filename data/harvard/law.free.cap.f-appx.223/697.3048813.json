R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">Reyna Noemi Alarcon, a native and citizen of Guatemala, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order affirming, without opinion, an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying Alarcon\u2019s application for asylum. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1487 (9th Cir.1997), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">Because we review the merits of the IJ\u2019s decision, we need not review the BIA\u2019s decision to streamline Alarcon\u2019s case. <em>See Garcia-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 1066, 1078-79 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">Alarcon testified that she was threatened by unknown men who entered her house in 1992, and that several relatives were killed after she arrived in the United States. Contrary to Alarcon\u2019s contentions, neither her testimony nor any other evidence in the record compels the conclusion that she was, or has a reasonable fear of being, targeted on account of a political opinion imputed to her. <em>See Sangha, </em>103 F.3d at 1490-91; <em>Arriaga-Barrientos v. INS, </em>937 F.2d 411, 414 (9th Cir.1991) (although acts of violence against a petitioner\u2019s family members may establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, the violence must \u201ccreate a pattern of persecution closely tied to the petitioner\u201d). Consequently, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Alarcon is not eligible for asylum. <em>See id. </em>at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-18\">In light of this holding, we need not reach Alarcon\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b726-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
