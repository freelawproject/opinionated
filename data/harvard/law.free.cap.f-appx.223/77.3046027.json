Wandersee also requests appointment of counsel. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 <em>de novo, see McEachin v. McGuinnis, </em>357 F.3d 197, 200 (2d Cir.2004), we find that, for the reasons stated by the district court, Wandersee\u2019s complaint not only is incomprehensible but also fails to articulate a single cognizable federal claim. His complaint is therefore frivolous. <em>See Nance v. Kelly, </em>912 F.2d 605, 606 (2d Cir.1990) (noting that an action is frivolous where it asserts \u201cfactual contentions [that] are clearly baseless\u201d or \u201cclaims [that are] based on an indisputably meritless legal theory\u201d) (internal quotations marks omitted). Further, the record does not suggest any possibility that Wandersee would be able to amend his complaint to state an actionable claim. <em>See, e.g., Gomez v. USAA Federal Sav. Bank, </em>171 F.3d 794, 796 (2d Cir.1999) (\u201c[A] <em>pro se </em>plaintiff ... should be afforded the ... opportunity ... to amend his complaint prior to its dismissal for failure to state a claim, unless the court can rule out any possibility, however unlikely it might be, that an amended complaint would succeed in stating a claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">Wandersee\u2019s request for appointment of counsel is denied as meritless. <em>See Cooper v. A. Sargenti Co., </em>877 F.2d 170, 172-74 (2d Cir.1989) (finding that the Court \u201cshould first determine whether the indigent\u2019s position [is] likely to be of substance\u201d before appointing counsel) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court, and DENY Wandersee\u2019s request for appointment of counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
