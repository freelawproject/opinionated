Wright appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint against the Defendants. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Wright v. Donegal Ins. Cos., </em>No. 1:06-cv-00827-WDQ (D. Md. June 7, 2006). Wright also appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion. Although the district court incorrectly construed this motion as one filed under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b), we have reviewed the motion and the documents submitted with the motion and find that the Rule 59(e) motion was properly denied. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
