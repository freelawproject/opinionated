We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s order and we uphold the Commissioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>decision if it is supported by substantial evidence and applies the correct legal standard. <em>Mayes v. Massanari, </em>276 F.3d 453, 458-59 (9th Cir.2001). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Hill offers no argument to this court concerning the administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) factual findings or the legal basis for his decision. For the reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s June 22, 2006 report, adopted in full by the district court in its order entered September 14, 2006, we agree that the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Hill\u2019s contention that the district court did not consider additional evidence she submitted to it is not supported by the record. Moreover, Hill offers no basis for concluding that any such evidence would be \u201cmaterial\u201d to the ALJ\u2019s determination of disability, or that \u201cthere is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in [the] prior proceeding.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>see also Mayes, </em>276 F.3d at 461-62 (explaining materiality requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Hill\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b708-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
