POOLER, Circuit Judges, RICHARD MILLS,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> District Judge.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b94-10\"> The Honorable Richard Mills, United States District Judge for the Central District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b94-16\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b94-17\">Defendant-appellant Quinton Carmon (\u201cCarmon\u201d) appeals the sentence imposed by the district court following a plea of guilty and the defendant\u2019s flight before sentencing. Carmon argues that his flight is not a sufficient basis for declaring him to have breached the plea agreement and relieving the government of its obligations under the agreement with respect to departure motions and recommendations with regard to the sentence to be imposed. Although the government had moved for a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, the government was allowed by the district court, after Carmon absconded, to withdraw that motion and to urge that the calculation of Carmon\u2019s sentence include an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S. S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, and that he be denied a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S. S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u201c[B]y absconding, [Cannon] forfeited any rights he arguably may have had based on his cooperation agreement with the government.\u201d <em>United States v. El-Gheur, </em>201 F.3d 90, 94 (2d Cir.2000); <em>see id. </em>at 92 (cooperation agreement provided, inter alia, that the defendant \u201c \u2018must not commit any further crimes whatsoever.\u2019 \u201d). Additionally, \u201ccertain conduct, such as intentionally failing to appear as required at judicial proceedings, is so inherently obstructive of the administration of justice that it is sufficient that the defendant willfully engaged in the underlying conduct, regardless of any additional purpose.\u201d <em>United States v. Reed, </em>88 F.3d 174, 178 (2d Cir.1996). Accordingly, \u201c[i]t is well-established that by willfully faffing to appear for sentencing, a defendant fails to accept responsibility for the offense, regardless of whether there was a plea agreement stipulating credit for the adjustment.\u201d <em>United States v. Loeb, </em>45 F.3d 719, 722 (2d Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Finally, this court has previously rejected the argument that \u201cthe exchange for drugs of firearms ... [is] not sufficiently related\u201d to the possession of that firearm, for the purposes of the applicability of the adjustment of the guideline levels contemplated by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). <em>United States v. Shepardson, </em>196 F.3d 306, 314 (2d Cir.1999). As in <em>Shepardson, </em>since the firearm\u2019s presence is not merely coincidental to the crime of purchasing drugs, the requirement of connection was met. <em>Id. </em>at 315. Accordingly, there was no error in the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines in the calculation of the advisory guideline range applicable in Carmon\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"Av1\">We have considered the defendant-appellant\u2019s arguments, and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
