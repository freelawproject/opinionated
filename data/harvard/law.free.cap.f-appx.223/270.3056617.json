Haskins appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) on the ground Haskins failed to establish he exhausted his administrative remedies as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997(e)(a) (2000) (\u201cPLRA\u201d). After the district court dismissed Haskins\u2019 complaint, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007), and held that \u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA\u201d and \u201cinmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 921. Although the district court erred under <em>Jones </em>in dismissing Haskins\u2019 complaint for his failure to establish exhaustion, we affirm the district court\u2019s order on the modified grounds that Haskins failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and that his complaint is frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (2000). We also modify the district court\u2019s order to reflect that the dismissal is with prejudice. We deny Haskins\u2019 motions for release from confinement, to add an additional party, and for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
