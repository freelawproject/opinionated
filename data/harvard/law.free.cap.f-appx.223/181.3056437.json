Appellants Goldberger, Seligsohn &amp; Shinrod, P.A., a New Jersey law firm and Allen S. Goldberger, Esq., a New Jersey attorney, appeal the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Appellee Gulf Insurance Company. The Appellants had sought a declaratory judgment in the District Court that Gulf Insurance Company owes them coverage under a professional liability policy for a legal malpractice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"A-L\">After thorough study of the briefs filed by the parties, as well as the record and transcripts of hearings conducted in the District Court, we will affirm essentially for the reasons stated by the District Court. The facts and procedural history of this case are well known to the parties and the court, and it is not necessary that we restate them here. The reasons why . . . \u201e \u201e , \u201e we write an opinion of the court are three- . <em>Jv . </em>,, , . . <em>n </em>, , fold: to instruct the District Court, to educate and inform the attorneys and parties&gt; and to exPlain our decision. We use a n\u00b0t~precedential opinion in cases such as this&gt; in which a Precedential opinion is rendered unnecessary because the opinion has no institutional or precedential value. <em>gee </em>United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Internal Operating Proeedure (I.O.P.) 5.3. Under the usual circumstances when we affirm by not-precedential opinion and judgment, we briefly set forth the reasons supporting the court\u2019s decision. In this case, however, we have concluded that neither a full memorandum explanation nor a precedential opinion is necessary. Judge Linares\u2019 ruling is an excellent statement of his reasoning and fully supports his order. No further refutation of the appellant\u2019s al- , \u201e legations of error is necessary,</p>\n<p id=\"AhH\">Hence, we believe it wholly unnecessary to further opine, or offer additional explanations and reasons to those given by the District Court, why we will affirm. It is sufficient to say that, essentially for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>reasons given by the District Court in its opinion dated the 29th day of December, 2005, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A2-\">^ h\u00aereby 0b,DERfD JUDGED that the Judgment of the District Court entered on December 29, 2005 be, and the same is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
