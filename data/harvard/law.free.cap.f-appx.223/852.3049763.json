Bonadonna appeals the summary judgment in favor of Columbia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>Deering Hospital (\u201cColumbia-Deering\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bonadonna alleges that Columbia-Deering is liable to him, as a third party beneficiary to a contract entered into between the United States Bureau of Prisons and Columbia-Deering, because the treatment he received from Dr. Kim, a doctor allegedly affiliated with Columbia-Deering, fell below the appropriate standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Having previously dismissed allegations against Dr. Kim on the basis that he was not a party to the contract at issue, the district court also granted Columbia-Deering\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis that the court lacked federal jurisdiction over the complaint, and, alternatively, because Columbia-Deering, having no relationship with Dr. Kim, could not be held liable for his conduct. Moreover, even if there was a relationship, Bonadonna provided no evidence that Dr. Kim\u2019s services were substandard.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Having reviewed the record, we cannot conclude that the district court erred in finding that Columbia-Deering did not have a relationship with Dr. Kim that would subject Columbia-Deering to liability for Dr. Kim\u2019s treatment of Bonadonna.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-9\">.
