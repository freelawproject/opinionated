Carter, </em>270 F.3d 731, 734-35 (8th Cir.2001) (proof that firearm was manufactured in one state and recovered in another satisfies interstate commerce element; evidence was sufficient where firearms expert testified that firearm was manufactured in state other than state in which defendant possessed it). Walker\u2019s related jurisdictional argument is also without merit. See <em>United States v. Rankin, </em>64 F.3d 338, 339 (8th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (denying motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; \u00a7 922(g)(1) \u201cclearly is tied to interstate commerce\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">We further conclude that the district court did not err in sentencing Walker in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (imposing mandatory minimum sentence for armed career criminals). The existence of sentence-enhancing prior convictions need not be found by a jury. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (any fact other than prior conviction which is necessary to support sentence exceeding maximum authorized by facts established by guilty plea or jury verdict must be admitted by defendant or proved to jury beyond reasonable doubt); <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 244-46, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (recidivism, as basis for increasing sentence, need not be charged in indictment and may be subsequently decided by court at sentencing); <em>United States v. Strong, </em>415 F.3d 902, 907 (8th Cir.2005) (construing <em>Booker </em>as reaffirming holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1121, 163 L.Ed.2d 927 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">Finally, we decline to consider Walker\u2019s ineffective-assistance arguments on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Cook, </em>356 F.3d 913, 919-20 (8th Cir.2004) (ineffective-assistance claims are generally better left for postconviction proceedings; such claims are proper on direct appeal only where record has been fully developed, to avoid plain miscarriage of justice, or where counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness is readily apparent).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-10\">. The Honorable Dean Whipple, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
