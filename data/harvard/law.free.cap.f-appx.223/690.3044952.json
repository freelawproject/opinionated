Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Iturribarria v.

INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that \u201cthe decision of the BIA whether to invoke its sua sponte authority is committed to its unfettered discretion\u201d) (italics and internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b718-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
