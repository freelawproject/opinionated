Chineag is currently serving a life sentence for conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and concurrent 240-month sentences for conspiracy to commit robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a), and conspiracy to carry a gun during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), (o).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-22\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion before the district court, Chineag alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on only one issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ard\">Whether the district court properly denied appellant\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to object or move for a mistrial when the non-redacted recording of the June 7, 2001 meeting was not submitted to the jury?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-23\">On appeal, Chineag does not argue that his counsel was ineffective, but instead (1) contends that this Court failed to properly evaluate his motion for COA, and (2) raises additional issues outside the scope of the COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-24\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996) (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), governs this appeal because Chineag filed his petition after AEDPA\u2019s effective date. Under AEDPA, appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-25\">Even liberally construing Chineag\u2019s brief, he fails to address the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel as specified in the COA. Indeed, he renounces the issue, declaring that he did not request a COA on it. Therefore, Chineag has abandoned his ineffective assistance claim. <em>See Jones v. Campbell, </em>436 F.3d 1285, 1303 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 619, 166 L.Ed.2d 428 (2006) (concluding that when an appellant fails to argue a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>certified issue in his appellate brief, that issue is abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Further, we reject Chineag\u2019s argument that this Court erred in evaluating Chineag\u2019s motion for a COA. There is no evidence that this Court failed to evaluate properly Chineag\u2019s motion for a COA. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (explaining that in deciding whether to grant a COA, the appellate court should \u201clook to the District Court\u2019s application of AEDPA to petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims and ask whether that resolution was debatable amongst jurists of reason. This threshold inquiry does not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims. In fact, the statute forbids it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Chineag\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-17\">. For this reason, we decline to address Chineag\u2019s other claims (a chain-of-custody issue and a challenge under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)). These claims lie outside the scope of the COA. <em>See Harrell v. Butterworth, </em>251 F.3d 926, 928 n. 1 (11th Cir.2001) (declining to address issues not included in the COA).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
