We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 </em>F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The Rusevs concede that their motions were untimely as they were not filed within ninety days of the BIA\u2019s August 13, 2003 order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding the Rusevs are not entitled to equitable tolling of the ninety-day time limit because they failed to demonstrate they acted with due diligence after learning their prior counsel did not file a brief before the BIA. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 898 (9th Cir.2003) (stating that the court recognizes equitable tolling of deadlines on motions to reopen when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">We do not consider the Rusevs\u2019 allegation that they did not know until July, 2004 that no brief was submitted to the BIA in support of their appeal as they failed to raise this allegation before the BIA. <em>See Vargas v. U.S. Dept. of Immigration and Naturalization, </em>831 F.2d 906, 907-08 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">The Rusevs\u2019 second motion to reopen also exceeded the numerical limitations for motions to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b663-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
