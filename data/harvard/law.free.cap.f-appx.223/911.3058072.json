On appeal of his first 188-month sentence, we remanded his case to the district court to \u201cresentence him, treating the sentencing guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory,\u201d in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Kitzelman (Kitzelman I), </em>140 Fed.Appx. 931, 932 (11th Cir. 2005) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">Complying with those instructions, the district court on remand again sentenced Kitzelman to 188 months. And as it had done in the original sentence hearing, the district court based its sentence in part on its finding that Kitzelman\u2019s prior felony convictions included one \u201cviolent felony\u201d and two \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d within the meaning of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e)(1). Under the ACCA, any person having \u201cthree previous convictions ... for a violent felony or ... serious drug offense\u201d who violates \u00a7 922(g) is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">Here, on appeal of this second 188-month sentence, Kitzelman simply repeats a contention he made in his previous appeal with respect to his first 188-month sentence. For a second time, Kitzelman complains that the district court violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment when it (and not a jury) found that his prior felony convictions counted under the ACCA as predicate convictions for the fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence. This time, he cites not only <em>Booker </em>and its forbears, but also the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), which was decided during the pendency of his first appeal and which \u201climit[ed] the scope of judicial factfinding on the disputed ... character of a prior [conviction]\u201d for purposes of increasing a defendant\u2019s potential sentence under statutes like the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 25, 125 S.Ct. at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-13\">Under the decisions of the Supreme Court and of this Court, we doubt that Kitzelman can succeed on the merits of this contention. <em>See United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that <em>\u201cShepard </em>does not bar judges from finding whether prior convictions qualify for ACCA purposes; it [merely] restricts the sources or evidence that a judge (instead of a jury) can consider in making that finding\u201d). A more fundamental problem for Kitzelman is that we can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>not even consider the merits issue, because he made a substantially identical argument on his first trip to this Court, and we rejected it as \u201cwithout merit.\u201d <em>See Kitzelman I, </em>140 Fed.Appx. at 931. Under our \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine, both the district court and this Court are bound by that legal conclusion. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>690 F.2d 869, 872 (11th Cir. 1982) (\u201cUnder the law of the case doctrine, both the district court and the court of appeals generally are bound by findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the court of appeals in a prior appeal of the same case.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">There are exceptions to the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine. They account for new evidence produced at a subsequent trial, allow for changes in controlling authority on a particular issue after the initial appellate disposition of the case, or seek to prevent \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d if the prior appellate decision was \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>See id. </em>But none of the exceptions apply here. Kitzelman does not squarely address any of them, instead stating that he is making the argument \u201cin the event that the Supreme Court does in fact reconsider its decision\u201d in cases such as <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (where the Supreme Court held that the factual issue of whether a defendant has previously been convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for sentence enhancement purposes is not to be treated as an element of the offense for constitutional purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
