We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-19\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because it was not filed within ninety days of the BIA\u2019s December 29, 1999 order. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Singh was not under a final order of exclusion as of March 22, 1999; therefore, the grace period allowing aliens to reopen proceedings for the sole purpose of seeking relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) did not apply to him. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(b)(2) (stating that motions to reopen for CAT relief were not governed by the time limitations of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) for those aliens subject to a final order as of March 22, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-20\">Furthermore, the regulations Singh cites did not require the BIA to inform him about any apparent eligibility for CAT relief. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.11(a)(2) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.17 (1994); <em>see also Valderrama-Fonseca v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 853, 857 (9th Cir.1997) (holding that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.17 imposes requirements on immigration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>judges but imposes \u201cno independent requirement on the BIA to identify the types of relief for which an alien might be eligible and to remand to the Immigration Judge in the event that it finds any.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b742-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
