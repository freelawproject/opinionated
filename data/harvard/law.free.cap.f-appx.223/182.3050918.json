In his complaint, Purveegiin expressed dissatisfaction with how pending appeals were being handled. He took issue with an instruction that he communicate in writing with this Court in lieu of expressing his concerns in abusive telephone calls. Also, as the District Court accurately and diplomatically summarized, Purveegiin alleged that his counsel in another case had seduced, or been seduced ^ Q0Urt personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"A4T\">_ . _ The Distnct Court denied Purveegims request to proceed <em>m forma paupens </em>and dismissed Purveegiin\u2019s complaint as legally frivolous. Purveegiin appeals and re&lt;luests appointment of counsel. Also, in a \u201cmotion to strike,\u201d he moves to quash the appearance of Appellees\u2019 counsel, arguing, among other things, that Appellees\u2019 counsel unlawfully colluded with Purveegiin\u2019s former counsel and seduced, or was seduced by&gt; a district court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"Azb\">As the District Court acknowledged, \u201e .. , . \u2019 Purveegiin was entitled to proceed <em>m for- </em>. , , , , , , <em>ma paupens. </em>as he was absolutely without TT _ .. , , . , assets.
