Conelly, </em>451 F.3d 942, 944 (8th Cir.2006). We hold that no error-much less plain error-occurred because the district court had authority to find that Crump had the prior convictions at issue. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (any fact other than prior conviction which is necessary to support sentence exceeding maximum authorized by facts established by guilty plea or jury verdict must be admitted by defendant or proved to jury beyond reasonable doubt); <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 244-46, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (recidivism, as basis for increasing sentence, need not be charged in indictment and may be subsequently decided by court at sentencing); <em>United States v. Strong, </em>415 F.3d 902, 907 (8th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Cir.2005) (construing <em>Booker </em>as reaffirming holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1121, 163 L.Ed.2d 927 (2006); <em>see also United States v. Pirani, </em>406 F.3d 543, 550 (8th Cir.) (en banc) (under plain-error standard, there must be (1) error, which is (2) plain and (3) affects substantial rights, and (4) error must seriously affect fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 266, 163 L.Ed.2d 239 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">We also hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering Crump\u2019s federal sentence to run consecutively to his undischarged state sentence where the court imposed the consecutive sentence upon consideration of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) (sentence may be imposed to run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve reasonable punishment for instant offense); <em>United States v. Shafer, </em>438 F.3d 1225, 1227 (8th Cir.2006) (imposition of consecutive sentence is reviewed under reasonableness standard, which is akin to abuse-of-discretion standard); <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>451 F.3d 939, 941-42 (8th Cir. 2006) (describing court\u2019s discretion under \u00a7 5G1.3(c) as \u201cwide\u201d; court did not abuse its discretion in applying \u00a7 3553 factors and imposing consecutive sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-15\">.
