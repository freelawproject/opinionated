Thompson, a Washington state prisoner, appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that his constitutional rights were violated when he was referred to civil commitment proceedings under the Washington Community Protection Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), and his personal information was released <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>to the public. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim under the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), <em>Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir. 1998) (order), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Thompson failed to state a federal claim against defendants Werner and Paulsen because they were acting in their capacity as Thompson\u2019s attorneys at the time they allegedly violated his constitutional rights. <em>See Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981) (\u201ca public defender does not act under color of state law when performing a lawyer\u2019s traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">To the extent Thompson challenges the validity of his civil commitment proceedings under the Act, and the public release of his conviction and sex offender status, these claims are foreclosed by prior court decisions upholding various portions of the Act as constitutional. <em>See Seling v. Young, </em>531 U.S. 250, 263, 121 S.Ct. 727, 148 L.Ed.2d 734 (2001); <em>Russell v. Gregoire, </em>124 F.3d 1079, 1089-94 (9th Cir.1997) (registration and notification provisions of the Act do not violate the Ex Post Facto clause, the right to privacy, or due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">We deny Thompson\u2019s request for appointment of counsel because he has not shown exceptional circumstances. <em>See Terrell v. Brewer, </em>935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Thompson\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">Thompson\u2019s pending motion is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b710-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
