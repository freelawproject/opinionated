HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">Hoskie Walter, Sr., pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico to one count of abusive sexual contact in Indian Country. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153, 2244(a)(1). The district court sentenced him to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by three years\u2019 supervised release. His plea agreement contained a waiver of his right to appeal, and he appealed neither his conviction nor his sentence. Instead he filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which, as far as we can discern, sought to vacate his term of supervised release because it was not permitted by the statute of conviction, violated the constitutional protection against double jeopardy, and violated what he calls the \u201cSeverance Clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d Pet\u2019r Mem. of Law in Supp. of His \u00a7 2255 at 1, <em>Walter v. United States, </em>No. 06-404, (D.N.M. July 3, 2006). The Magistrate Judge\u2019s Proposed Findings and Recommended Disposition, which was adopted by the district court, recommended that the motion be denied because (1) Mr. Walter had not raised these issues on direct appeal, <em>see United States v. Warner, </em>23 F.3d 287, 291 (10th Cir.1994) (a defendant cannot raise issues in a \u00a7 2255 motion that he has failed to present on direct appeal), and (2) he could not escape the procedural bar because he had not demonstrated good cause for his procedural default and had not suffered actual prejudice since his contentions had no merit. The district court denied his request for a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion, and he now applies to this court for a COA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (requiring COA). We deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">A movant seeking a COA must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Such a demonstration \u201cincludes showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Mr. Walter has not met this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">The magistrate judge\u2019s analysis of the merits of Mr. Walter\u2019s contentions cannot reasonably be disputed. Addressing first Mr. Walter\u2019s contention that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>was no statutory authority for supervised release, we acknowledge that the statute under which he was convicted does not mention supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(1). Another statute, however, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(a), explicitly allows the court to \u201cinclude as a part of the sentence a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Robinson, </em>62 F.3d 1282, 1285 (10th Cir.1995). As to Mr. Walter\u2019s double-jeopardy argument, the supervised-release term was not a multiple punishment but a congressionally authorized part of his original sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(a). Finally, no one other than Mr. Walter appears to be familiar with a \u201cSeverance Clause\u201d in our Constitution. Some of his pleadings suggest that he may be referring to separation-of-powers doctrine; but we fail to see any threat to that doctrine in the imposition of a term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Because Mr. Walter\u2019s contentions clearly lack merit, we need not concern ourselves with whether they are procedurally barred. We DENY a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
