Potter appeals the district court\u2019s decision affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s denial of Potter\u2019s application for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) under Title XVI of the Social Security Act. Potter claims that she has mental impairments that render her disabled. The ALJ\u2019s decision adequately states why he found that Potter\u2019s condition did not meet or equal a listed impairment and that work exists in the national economy that accommodates Potter\u2019s residual functional capacity. Because the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that Potter is not disabled is supported by substantial evidence, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">Potter filed for SSI benefits on August 6, 2003. Potter claimed that she was unable to work because of her learning disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Potter received a hearing before an ALJ in 2005. The ALJ found that Potter\u2019s \u201clearning disability and borderline intellectual functioning\u201d were severe impairments. However, the ALJ concluded that Potter\u2019s impairments did not meet or medically equal a listed impairment that entitled Potter to an irrebuttable presumption of disability. The ALJ further concluded that, based on Potter\u2019s residual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>functional capacity, Potter could perform a substantial number of jobs requiring \u201clight exertion\u201d and was therefore not disabled. Potter\u2019s internal appeal was denied, and Potter then appealed to the district court. A magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that was adopted by the district court over Potter\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">At the time the ALJ issued his decision, Potter was twenty-seven years old. Potter claimed that she had been disabled since January 1, 1982. Potter and her mother, Shirley Ann Nelson, testified that they believed that Potter\u2019s mental impairments started when Potter experienced seizures as a small child. Although the medical evidence in the record does not address the cause of Potter\u2019s mental limitations, the record does establish that Potter has below-average mental ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Potter submitted extensive school records documenting her enrollment in special education classes as a result of her learning disability. The record also includes three separate intelligence tests performed on Potter. The first was performed when Potter was thirteen by Dr. Mark Schachter, a neuropsychologist. Dr. Schachter found that Potter had an IQ of 80, which placed her in the \u201cborderline to low range of intellectual functioning.\u201d Potter was again tested when she was sixteen years old. At that time, school psychologists assessed Potter\u2019s IQ as 81, which they termed \u201ca borderline range.\u201d This evaluation also concluded that Potter was of \u201cLow Average to Borderline [intellectual] ability.\u201d Potter\u2019s third, and most recent, IQ assessment was performed by Dr. Ollie C. Dennis for the Social Security Administration in connection with Potter\u2019s current application for benefits. Dr. Dennis assessed Potter\u2019s IQ as 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Dr. Dennis concluded that Potter \u201cfunctioned within the \u2018extremely low1 range of intelligence.\u201d Dr. Dennis also concluded that Potter was \u201cmoderately limited\u201d in her ability to function due to her intellectual limitations, and in particular that she would have \u201cmoderate difficulty understanding, retaining, and following written and oral instructions\u201d; that she would have \u201cmild difficulty\u201d sustaining attention to perform repetitive tasks; that she would be \u201cmild[ly] to moderately impaired in her ability to relate to co-workers and supervisors\u201d; and that \u201c[h]er ability to tolerate the stress and pressure of daily work activity was considered to be mildly to moderately limited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">Dr. Edward Stodola and Dr. Stephen Scher, state agency psychological consultants, both reviewed the record to assist the ALJ in evaluating Potter\u2019s application for benefits. Both reviewing consultants concluded that Potter\u2019s condition did not meet or equal the elements of the mental retardation listing. In evaluating Potter\u2019s functional limitations, both consultants concluded that Potter was mildly limited in her daily living activities and social functioning; that she was moderately limited in her ability to maintain concentration, persistence, or pace; and that she had no episodes of decompensation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">In her application for benefits, Potter indicated that she had no problems taking care of her personal hygiene; that she prepared her own meals and did the dishes; that she shopped for personal items; that she attended church, dated, went to the movies, and occasionally bowled; and that she was the sole care<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>giver for her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter. At Potter\u2019s hearing, she testified that she attended school through the twelfth grade, but that she only received an \u201cindividual education program\u201d (IEP), which \u201csimply states I was there,\u201d instead of a regular diploma. Potter also testified that she had trouble functioning independently because she needed \u201csomebody there reminding me of what has to be done.\u201d As examples of this she said that she sometimes forgot to feed and care for her daughter and that she would often forget that food was cooking and would let it burn. Potter also testified concerning her work history. She reported working at numerous unskilled jobs for brief periods of time. She testified that she had to leave or was fired for each job because she \u201cwasn\u2019t working fast enough, and [ ] would forget what [she] was doing\u201d or because she was otherwise unable to do the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">At the hearing, the ALJ next heard testimony from a vocational expert. The ALJ asked the expert the following hypothetical,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">[A]ssume a[n] 27 year old lady with a apparently 12th grade education who has a number of jobs that she\u2019s worked at part-time or for brief periods less than two-months. Any job that she\u2019s worked full-time that\u2019s been less than two months.... I want you to assume that she is moderately restricted in her ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods of time. She could do simple routine tasks. I want you to assume that she should be restricted to jobs that require few changes in the work setting. Based on those assumptions, would there be any jobs existing in the state of Kentucky and the United States that such a person could perform or not?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The vocational expert\u2019s response was, \u201cYes, sir. Just based on that, simple type of bench assembly or hand packing. Production labor positions like polishing and debriding and separating ... excess material for molded pieces.\u201d The expert estimated that, assuming a \u201clight\u201d exertional level, the hypothetical person could perform nearly one million jobs available in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">When the ALJ altered the hypothetical and asked the vocational expert to assume that the individual \u201chas a very poor ability to retain instructions, whether simple or detailed, and that she has poor ability to maintain pace on a sustained basis,\u201d the vocational expert then concluded that such conditions would not be consistent with \u201ccompetitive employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">The final witness at the hearing was Potter\u2019s mother, Shirley Ann Nelson. Nelson testified about Potter\u2019s early childhood illness. Nelson also testified that she continuously had to remind Potter to do things including to care for her daughter until the child was old enough to communicate her needs and that Potter wanted to work but could not because of her need for constant supervision. Nelson also elaborated on Potter\u2019s educational background and limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">The ALJ\u2019s opinion noted that Potter had filed two previous applications for SSI. The ALJ stated that he was bound by the findings of the previous ALJs in those applications, \u201cabsent evidence of improvement or deterioration in a claimant\u2019s condition.\u201d However, the ALJ noted that \u201c[t]he prior hearing decision was not available for review,\u201d and made no additional reference to the earlier decision in his opinion. After summarizing the evidence, the ALJ concluded that Potter\u2019s \u201clearning disability and borderline intellectual functioning\u201d impairments were severe, but that they did not meet or medically equal a listing. The ALJ did not find Potter\u2019s allegations credible as to the extent that she was precluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>from \u201cperforming exertional work-related activities,\u201d because those allegations were inconsistent with Potter\u2019s description of her daily activities. The ALJ also chose to rely on Potter\u2019s two earlier IQ scores rather than one more-recent, lower score. The ALJ also relied on the consultant evaluations, which indicated that Potter\u2019s mental limitations did not qualify as a listed disability. Finally, the ALJ relied on the testimony of the vocational expert in finding that, while Potter\u2019s \u201cability to work is compromised at all exertional levels,\u201d given her residual functioning capacity, Potter was \u201ccapable of making a successful adjustment to work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy.\u201d Accordingly, the ALJ found that Potter was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The ALJ\u2019s determination that Potter was not disabled was supported by substantial evidence. The hypothetical posed by the ALJ to the vocational expert included a description of Potter\u2019s limitations as supported by the evidence in the record and therefore provided substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Potter was able to perform a significant number of jobs available in the national economy. Similarly, the ALJ\u2019s decision that Potter\u2019s allegations regarding her limitations were not fully credible was supported by substantial evidence. Finally, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Potter\u2019s learning disability and borderline intellectual functioning, while severe, did not meet or equal the listing for mental retardation is supported by evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s conclusion in a social security case de novo. <em>Crum v. Sullivan, </em>921 F.2d 642, 644 (6th Cir.1990). However, the court reviews the underlying findings of the Commissioner to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Walters v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>127 F.3d 525, 528 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Potter\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that the ALJ erred when he found that Potter had a \u201chigh school education,\u201d and, as a result, that the assumption that Potter had a \u201c12th grade education,\u201d rendered the expert opinion relied on by the ALJ at step five of the disability evaluation process unreliable<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At step five of the sequential evaluation process, the ALJ must determine whether the claimant\u2019s impairments prevent her from \u201cmaking an adjustment to any other work.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(g). In so doing, the ALJ is to consider the claimant\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity ... together with [her] vocational factors ([ ] age, education, and work experience).\u201d <em>Id. </em>In assessing the availability of \u201cother work\u201d that the claimant can perform, the ALJ commonly relies on the testimony of a vocational expert who is asked a hypothetical question based on the limitations and abilities of the claimant. <em>See Webb v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>368 F.3d 629, 630 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">In this case, the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical asked the vocational expert to assume an individual \u201cwith a[n] apparently 12th grade education.\u201d Potter argues that because the record clearly shows that she did not obtain a regular high school diploma, and because her actual educational abilities are clearly lower than what is indicated by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>high school educational level, the vocational expert\u2019s conclusions in response to the hypothetical are invalid. The Commissioner concedes that Potter\u2019s educational abilities are not accurately represented as high school level because \u201cit is undisputed that [Potter\u2019s] language and math skill ranged from the third to fifth grade levels.\u201d However, the Commissioner correctly notes that Potter\u2019s argument fails because the reference to Potter\u2019s education was not material to the ultimate conclusion that she was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The basis of Potter\u2019s disability claim has little to do with her level of formal schooling. Rather, the material issue is the degree to which her current mental impairments prevent her from functioning in a work environment. Potter argues that her failure to succeed at past jobs proves that she cannot perform even simple light assembly positions such as \u201cbench assembly or hand picking.\u201d However, Potter\u2019s explanation of why she has been unable to function at jobs involving \u201csimple routine tasks,\u201d like those identified by the vocational expert in response to the hypothetical, have nothing to do with her level of formal educational. For example, as proof of her inability to do bench assembly work her brief points to her testimony that she was unable to work as a sandwich maker because she \u201cwasn\u2019t working fast enough.\u201d Similarly, her brief argues that Potter could not do hand picking jobs because at her previous job bagging apples \u201cshe could not keep pace or make the decisions to place \u2018good\u2019 apples in bags.\u201d In response to the vocational expert\u2019s suggestion that she could do polishing jobs, Potter\u2019s brief notes that she \u201cwas fired from cleaning a motel room [ ] because she could not make the bed properly and was slow.\u201d Potter does not offer any connection between her level of formal schooling and the evidence that she performs simple, unskilled tasks too slowly and exercises poor judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Furthermore, the full text of the vocational hypothetical itself makes it clear that the mistaken reference to an \u201capparently 12th grade education\u201d was not material. The rest of the hypothetical addressed Potter\u2019s non-education mental limitations, which are directly relevant to the kinds of \u201csimple\u201d tasks that the ALJ concluded Potter could perform. The hypothetical noted that she had worked only \u201cbrief periods less than two months\u201d and asked the expert to assume that \u201cshe is moderately restricted in her ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods of time .... [and] that she should be restricted to jobs that require [ ] few changes in the work setting.\u201d It is precisely these kinds of limitations on Potter\u2019s abilities that are material to determining whether she could in fact perform even \u201csimple\u201d jobs, regardless of what her level of formal education may have been. Because as a whole the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical sufficiently presented Potter\u2019s relevant mental limitations, the ALJ\u2019s reference to an apparent twelfth-grade education was harmless.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Colwell v. Cha</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><em>ter, </em>No. 95-6179, 1996 WL 557773, at * 3 (6th Cir. Sept.30, 1996) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Substantial evidence in the record supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Potter was capable of performing \u201csimple routine tasks\u201d and the ALJ\u2019s rejection of Potter\u2019s allegations to the contrary. The ALJ\u2019s assessment of Potter\u2019s residual functioning capacity is supported by the opinions of Drs. Stodola, Scher, and Dennis.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Dr. Stodola stated that Potter was \u201cmentally able to understand[,]remember[, and] carryout simple instructions; [] relate adequately in most settings; [and] tolerate the changes and pressures of a routine setting.\u201d Dr. Stodola and Dr. Scher concluded that Potter was \u201cmoderately limited\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in her ability to carry out detailed instructions, her ability to maintain concentration for extended periods of time, and her ability to respond appropriately to changes in the work setting. Both psychological consultants found that Potter was \u201cnot significantly limited\u201d in seventeen other areas of mental functioning. Dr. Dennis found that Potter was \u201cmoderately limited in her ability to function as a result of deficits in cognitive, adaptive, and academic skill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Potter argues that her testimony and the testimony of her mother concerning her functional limitations, as well as Potter\u2019s previous failed attempts at simple routine jobs, show that she does not have a sufficient residual functional capacity to work at any job. While there does appear to be substantial evidence to support Potter\u2019s contentions, the question on review is not whether substantial evidence, or even the weight of the evidence, supports Potter\u2019s position. Rather, this court is only asked to decide if the record includes substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s determination. <em>See Johnson v. Sec. of Health and Human Servs., </em>948 F.2d 989, 992 (6th Cir.1991). The evidence from Drs. Stodola, Scher, and Dennis clearly offer substantial support for the ALJ\u2019s determination in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">Similarly, because Potter\u2019s allegations concerning the scope of her limitations are contradicted by the medical and expert evidence discussed above, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">Finally, the ALJ\u2019s determination at step three of the sequential analysis, that Potter\u2019s mental impairments failed to meet or equal a listed impairment, is supported by substantial evidence. Potter argues that her learning disability and mental impairments satisfied paragraph D of the mental retardation listing, and that she was therefore entitled to a presumption of disability. The relevant listing provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFEi\">12.05 Mental retardation: Mental retardation refers to significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested during the developmental period; i.e., the evidence demonstrates or supports onset of the impairment before age 22.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">The required level of severity for this disorder is met when the requirements in A, B, C, or D are satisfied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-13\">D. A valid verbal, performance, or full scale IQ of 60 through 70, resulting in at least two of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-14\">1. Marked restriction of activities of daily living; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-15\">2. Marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>3. Marked difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">4. Repeated episodes of decompensation, each of extended duration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">To qualify for the listing under paragraph D, Potter must satisfy both the introductory requirements and at least two of the four criteria in the paragraph. Even assuming that Dr. Dennis\u2019s assessment of Potter\u2019s IQ as 69 satisfies the introductory criterion of a valid full scale IQ of 60 though 70, the ALJ identified substantial evidence in the record that supports the determination that Potter did not satisfy each of the criteria in subsection D. First, the ALJ found that Potter did not have \u201cMarked restriction of activities of daily living,\u201d but instead he found that Potter\u2019s daily activities were only \u201cmildly\u201d limited. As evidence of this finding, the ALJ noted that Potter \u201cattends to her personal hygiene, does household chores, laundry and watches television.\u201d Similarly, the ALJ found that Potter experienced only \u201cmild\u201d limitations in social functioning, as evidenced by her interaction with her daughter and boyfriend and her own statements that she attends church, goes bowling, and visits with a neighbor. The ALJ determined that Potter had only \u201cmoderate\u201d difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace based on Dr. Dennis\u2019s conclusion that Potter had mild difficulty sustaining attention. Finally, the ALJ noted, and Potter does not contest, that the record contains no evidence of episodes of decompensation. The ALJ\u2019s finding as to each of the paragraph D criteria is further supported by the reports of both psychological consultants who made the same criteria determinations based on their review of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Because substantial evidence in the record supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to deny benefits, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-17\">. Potter also claimed to suffer from occasional migraine headaches and back pain. Neither of these limitations are at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b488-6\">. \"Episodes of decompensation are exacerbations or temporary increases in symptoms or signs accompanied by a loss of adaptive functioning, as manifested by difficulties in performing activities of daily living, maintaining social relationships, or maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace.\" 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 12.00(C)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\">. In evaluating whether a claimant is disabled, the Commissioner is to consider, in a five-step sequence, whether the claimant: 1) worked during the alleged period of disability; 2) has a severe impairment; 3) has an impairment that meets or equals the requirements of an impairment listed in the regulations; 4) can return to past relevant work; and 5) if not, whether he or she can perform other work in the national economy. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a). All of Potter\u2019s arguments related to the ALJ\u2019s conclusions at either step three or step five.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b491-6\">. Although we do not find that the ALJ\u2019s error in describing Potter\u2019s education level as an \"apparently 12th grade education\u201d was so material as to necessitate reversal or remand, we prefer that ALJs exercise greater precision in the formulation of hypothetical questions. Because a vocational expert\u2019s response to a hypothetical question can constitute substantial evidence to support an ALJ\u2019s decision if the question \"accurately portrays [the claimant\u2019s] individual physical and mental impairments,\u201d <em>Varley </em>v. <em>Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>820 F.2d 777, 779 (6th Cir. 1987), the accuracy of such hypothetical questions is often a critical issue in these cases. A greater degree of care taken at the administrative level in crafting hypothetical questions not only increases the likelihood of correct determinations, it saves unnecessary disputes if the case is later appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\">.
