To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion and we review de novo due process claims. <em>Cano-Merida, v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002). We dismiss in part, deny in part and grant in part the petition for review in No. 04 \u2014 73548, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>deny the petition for review in No. 04-75407.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that Barron-Palomares failed to establish the requisite exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his United States citizen children, and is therefore ineligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Barron-Palomares\u2019s contention that the IJ violated due process by relying on evidence not in the record and by not allowing him to rebut such evidence is unavailing. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (recognizing that due process claims require showing that proceedings were \u201cso fundamentally unfair that [he] was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The IJ granted voluntary departure for a 60-day period and the BIA streamlined and changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held \u201cthat because the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d We therefore remand to the agency for further proceedings regarding voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Barron-Palomares\u2019s motion to reconsider because Barron-Palomares failed to identify any errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s previous order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part; GRANTED in part and REMANDED in No. 04-73548.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in No. 04-75407.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b603-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
