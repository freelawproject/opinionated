Upon consideration of the foregoing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b31-32\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the order of the district court denying Ralph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Wilson\u2019s motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 be affirmed. Wilson\u2019s argument that the district court denied his right to counsel of choice during trial is forfeit because Wilson did not raise that issue before the district court in support of his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Wilson\u2019s claims that the Government violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by belatedly releasing evidence useful for impeaching a Government witness, <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and knowingly eliciting false testimony at trial, <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 103-07, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), fail because he did not show prejudice. With respect to his <em>Brady </em>claim, the Government\u2019s disclosure of Mr. Eddings\u2019s pretrial statements on the eve of that witness\u2019s trial testimony is not \u201csufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome,\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). Likewise, even if the Government knowingly elicited false testimony from Mr. Ed-dings, the deprivation of due process would have been \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678-80, 105 S.Ct. 3375. As this court said in denying Wilson\u2019s direct appeal, the evidence against him was \u201cnonconflicting, nonambiguous, and overwhelming.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Wilson, </em>160 F.3d 732, 741 n. 8 (D.C. Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
