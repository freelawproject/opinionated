Bernal-Jimenez argues that the district court constructively amended the indictment by instructing the jury on the elements of drug distribution, even though he was not charged with that substantive offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-21\">A defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights are violated \u201cwhen the grand jury charges one crime and the jury convicts of another.\u201d <em>United States v. Solis, </em>841 F.2d 307, 308-09 (9th Cir.1988). In <em>Solis, </em>we reversed the defendants\u2019 convictions for distributing heroin because the district court instructed the jury on heroin possession, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>an offense not charged in the indictments. Bernal-Jimenez argues that his case is analogous to <em>Solis </em>because he was charged with conspiracy to distribute narcotics and aiding and abetting the possession of narcotics with intent to distribute, but the district court instructed the jury on the substantive offense of drug distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">This argument is unpersuasive. The district court instructed the jury on the elements of drug distribution so that the jury could determine whether Bernal-Jimenez conspired to distribute narcotics. Instructing a jury on the elements of the object of a conspiracy is not error. <em>See United States v. Kostoff, </em>585 F.2d 378, 379-80 (9th Cir.1978). Further, to avoid confusion, the district court clearly explained the purpose of the instruction setting forth the elements for distribution: \u201cThe object of the conspiracy charged in ... the Indictment is the distribution of [narcotics]. The elements of that offense are....\u201d In sum, the district court did not give the jury the option to convict BernalJimenez for distributing narcotics. Consequently, the district court did not constructively amend the indictment, and BernalJimenez\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b666-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Cir.
