Reyes argues that under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his sentence must be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing. He asserts that the district court sentenced him pursuant to mandatory Sentencing Guidelines and that the error was not harmless. Reyes asserts, in addition, that \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The district court\u2019s sentence pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme constitutes <em>Fanfan </em>error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). The sentencing transcript is silent regarding whether the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the Guidelines been advisory. Thus, the Government has not met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under mandatory Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Zamora-Vallejo, </em>470 F.3d 592, 595 (5th Cir.2006)(internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Reyes argues that \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional. Reyes\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Reyes properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent and raises it here only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM Reyes\u2019s conviction, VACATE his sentence, and REMAND the case for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
