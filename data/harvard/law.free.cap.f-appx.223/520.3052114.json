Newman\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the district court abused its discretion by not taking into account the level of Newman\u2019s cooperation and his rehabilitative efforts in prison when deciding how far to depart from the advisory Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Counsel\u2019s argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Coppedge, </em>135 F.3d 598, 599 (8th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (concluding a challenge to the extent of a sentence reduction upon the government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion was unreviewable because the appeal was not based on any criteria listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)); <em>United States v. Haskins, </em>479 F.3d 955, 957 (8th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (holding a court lacks jurisdiction to consider the reasonableness of a sentence following a Rule 35(b) reduction; and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), did not expand \u00a7 3742(a) to include appellate review of discretionary sentencing reductions). <em>Cf. United States v. Pepper, </em>412 F.3d 995, 998-99 (8th Cir.2005) (deciding only assistance facts, and not other factors, can be considered in a substantial assistance downward departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-30\">. The Honorable Joseph F.
