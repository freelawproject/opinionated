Weisel, revoking his prior grant of asylum. <em>In re Mamadou Ba, </em>No. A95 378 293 (B.I.A. Aug. 31, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 378 293 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 12, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts and affirms, then supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Bhanot v. Chertoff, </em>474 F.3d 71, 72 (2d Cir.2007). We review legal issues, and the application of law to fact, <em>de novo. See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">Based on the thorough opinion of the BIA the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral arguments in this case is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
