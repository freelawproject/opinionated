Rosas argues for the first time on appeal that his prior conviction in Texas for attempted sexual assault is not a crime of violence and that the district court therefore erroneously applied a 16-level sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Because he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>object in the district court to this enhancement, Rosas correctly concedes that our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 310 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In support of his argument, Rosas relies on <em>United States v. Luciano-Rodriguez, </em>442 F.3d 320, 322-23 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 747, 166 L.Ed.2d 578 (2006), where we held that the Texas offense of sexual assault was not a forcible sex offense because certain subsections of the Texas statute \u201ccriminaliz[ed] assented-to-but-not-consented-to conduct\u201d and the element of force was absent from those subsections. During the course of briefing, the Government has supplemented the appellate record with Rosas\u2019s state court charging papers and judgment, which show that he was charged with a sexual assault by the use of force. Rosas now concedes that his challenge is unavailing. In light of the Government\u2019s supplementation and Rosas\u2019s concession, Rosas has failed to demonstrate plain error. <em>See United States v. Calderon-Pena, </em>383 F.3d 254, 258 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc); \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii); <em>cf. Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Rosas also argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 37-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Rosas\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rosas properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
