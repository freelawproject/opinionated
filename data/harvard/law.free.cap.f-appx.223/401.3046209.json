Prior to imposing the sanctions, the district court had dismissed White\u2019s substantive claim, which alleged that the defendants violated the False Claims Act through various frauds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The' court entered a final judgment dismissing this claim in January 2006. White appealed from that judgment, and this court dismissed that appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-26\">The present appeal was timely filed in May 2006 as to the district court\u2019s sanctions order, which followed the defendants\u2019 compliance with Rule U\u2019s safe harbor provision and two previous warnings to White about the possibility of sanctions. \u201cWhite\u2019s brief to this court, however, does not address at all the propriety of the sanctions; instead, \u201cWhite puts forth various arguments related to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his substantive claim. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), arguments must be briefed to be preserved. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). White has thus waived any argument to the propriety of sanctions. As to White\u2019s arguments concerning the district court\u2019s dismissal of his substantive claim, White has already appealed from that judgment, and this court dismissed that appeal. In any event, White\u2019s May 2006 notice of appeal is untimely as to the final judgment filed over three months earlier. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), 4(a)(4)(A)(iii); <em>see also Moody Nat\u2019l Bank of Galveston v. GE Life &amp; Annuity Assurance Co., </em>383 F.3d 249, 252-53 (5th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">AFFIRMED.
