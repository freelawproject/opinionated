In the plea agreement, defendant and the United States agreed, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C), that \u201c[d]efendant\u2019s final adjusted sentencing guidelines offense level is twelve (12), and that [djefendant\u2019s criminal history category will be determined by the United States Probation Office and reflected in the original presentence report prepared in this case.\u201d Mot. to Enforce, Attach. 1 (Plea Agreement) at 3. Defendant agreed \u201cthat the sentence in this case shall be determined pursuant to the sentencing guidelines, using the offense level agreed upon in this plea agreement, and applying the criminal history category determined by the Court after review of the presentence report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defendant then \u201cknowingly waive[d] the right to appeal any sentence within the statutory range applicable to the statute(s) of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-19\">In sentencing defendant, the district court accepted the Plea Agreement\u2019s stipulated offense level of 12, as well as the criminal history category calculation set forth in the presentence report, which was a category of V. <em>See id. </em>Attach. 3 (Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g) at 10-11. These two factors yielded a guideline sentencing range of twenty-seven to thirty-three months. The district court sentenced defendant to a term of twenty-seven months\u2019 incarceration, followed by a two-year term of unsupervised release. As defendant acknowledged in the Plea Agreement, the maximum sentence the court could have imposed under the applicable statute was up to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment, a mandatory term of not more than three years\u2019 supervised release, a fine not to exceed $250,000, and a special penalty assessment of $100. <em>See </em>Plea Agreement at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-20\">Notwithstanding the appeal waiver in his Plea Agreement, defendant, proceeding pro se, filed a notice of appeal challenging his sentence. The government has moved to enforce the appeal waiver under <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315 (10th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>2004) (en banc) (per curiam). Under <em>Hahn, </em>we will enforce a criminal defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal so long as (1) \u201cthe disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights,\u201d (2) \u201cthe defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights,\u201d and (3) \u201cenforcing the waiver would [not] result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325. Defendant\u2019s counsel has filed a response to the motion to enforce stating his belief that there are no grounds upon which defendant\u2019s appeal can be sustained. This court provided defendant an opportunity to file a pro se response to the motion to enforce, which was due on April 5, 2007, but to date, he has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">We have carefully reviewed the Plea Agreement and the transcripts of the plea hearing and the sentencing hearing. We conclude, applying the <em>Hahn </em>factors, that defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Accordingly, we GRANT the government\u2019s motion to enforce the Plea Agreement and DISMISS the appeal. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b834-17\"> This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
