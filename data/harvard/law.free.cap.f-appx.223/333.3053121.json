The district court determined that the suit was frivolous and/or failed to state a claim and dismissed it. Xuan appeals the dismissal of his suit. He argues that his suit is timely, that his claims are valid, and that the district court erred by dismissing his suit prior to service upon the defendants and discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-22\">Xuan has failed to show that the defendants infringed his constitutional rights. <em>See Shinn v. College Station Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>96 F.3d 783, 786 (5th Cir.1996) (per curiam). Consequently, the district court did not err by dismissing his suit. <em>See Johnson v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>38 F.3d 198, 200 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir.1999). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and Xuan\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
