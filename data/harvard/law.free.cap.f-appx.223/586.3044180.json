Diaz contends that the district court erred in its standard of review because the California Court of Appeal never adjudicated his Sixth Amendment claim. He also argues that the judge\u2019s dismissal of a lone holdout juror violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a writ of habeas corpus de novo. <em>Clark v. Murphy, </em>331 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir. 2003). Because Diaz\u2019s petition was filed after April 24, 1996, the extent of review is governed by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214. Diaz argues that in his appeal to the California Court of Appeal, he raised two distinct claims, a Sixth Amendment claim as well as a separate California Penal Code \u00a7 1089 claim. According to Diaz, the Court of Appeal fully addressed the \u00a7 1089 claim, but failed to resolve the separate Sixth Amendment claim. Diaz maintains that the court\u2019s failure to address the Sixth Amendment claim renders inapplicable AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review. <em>See Pirtle v. Morgan, </em>313 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that de novo review is appropriate where \u201ca state court has not reached the merits of a properly raised issue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">The record belies Diaz\u2019s argument. In his appeal, Diaz cited the Sixth Amendment, federal law, and California state law in arguing that the trial court erred in dismissing Juror No. 5, without making any distinction between a \u00a7 1089 claim and a Sixth Amendment claim. While Diaz listed various standards for juror dismissal under both California and federal law, he did so in the context of a single argument that the trial court\u2019s action was erroneous. The California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision that the trial court\u2019s actions were not erroneous therefore constituted an implicit adjudication of Diaz\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim, despite the court\u2019s failure to mention the Sixth Amendment or Supreme Court precedent. <em>See Early v. Packer, </em>537 U.S. 3, 8, 123 S.Ct. 362, 154 L.Ed.2d 263 (2002); <em>Lambert v. Blodgett, </em>393 F.3d 943, 969 (9th Cir.2004). We conclude that the decision by the California Court of Appeal constituted a decision on the merits of Diaz\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim as required under AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">Diaz argues that the state court\u2019s removal of Juror No. 5 constituted a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury. The Sixth Amendment requires the preservation of the \u201cessential feature\u201d of the jury system. <em>See Williams v. Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 100, 90 S.Ct. 1893, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970). There is ample evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s determination that Juror No. 5 was emotionally unable to continue with deliberations. The trial judge spoke on two separate occasions with Juror No. 5 before stating that she had determined that Juror No. 5 appeared to be too upset to continue effectively with deliberations. A trial court\u2019s findings regarding juror fitness are entitled to special deference because trial courts are \u201cin a superior position to observe [jurors\u2019] physical appearance and demeanor and thereby to determine [their] ability to continue deliberating.\u201d <em>Perez v. Marshall, </em>119 F.3d 1422, 1427 (9th Cir. 1997). The trial court also spoke with three other jurors, all of whom agreed that Juror No. 5 was unwilling to deliberate fully with the other jurors. Diaz has not presented clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of correctness that we must accord the trial court\u2019s factual determination of juror fitness. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). Accordingly, we conclude that the state court\u2019s determination that Juror No. 5 was unable to continue with deliberations was not an unreasonable determination of the facts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Removal pursuant to \u00a7 1089 is constitutional because California\u2019s statute \u201cpreserv\u00e9is] the \u2018essential feature\u2019 of the jury required by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d <em>Miller v. Stagner, </em>757 F.2d 988, 995 (9th Cir.1985). In light of <em>Miller </em>and the lack of directly controlling Supreme Court precedent on this issue, the California Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that the trial court properly discharged Juror No. 5 was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Carey v. Musladin, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-, 127 S.Ct. 649, 654, 166 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b615-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
