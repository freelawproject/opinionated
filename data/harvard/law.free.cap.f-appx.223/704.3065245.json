The IJ denied Oyedele-Banda\u2019s applications because he found him not credible. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002), we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s findings that petitioner testified inconsistently regarding his parents\u2019 death and that petitioner was dishonest in attempting to gain entry to the United States. <em>See Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 889 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that false statements to gain admission to the United States are considered \u201cin light of all the circumstances of the case\u201d). We also accord deference to the IJ\u2019s finding that petitioner\u2019s account of his voyage to the United States was implausible as were other elements of his testimony. <em>See Jibril v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1129, 1135 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that an IJ is permitted to \u201cexercise common sense\u201d in evaluating the plausibility of a petitioner\u2019s testimony). Finally, we find support in the record for the IJ\u2019s finding that petitioner was evasive in answering questions at the hearing. The IJ properly concluded that these and other problems in petitioner\u2019s testimony cumulatively supported an adverse credibility finding on issues that go to the heart of petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>See Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir.2005). The IJ thus properly denied petitioner\u2019s asylum petition and his petition for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">We similarly hold that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding with regard to petitioner\u2019s claim under the Convention Against Torture was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ considered all of the relevant factors and his credibility finding defeats petitioner\u2019s claim that \u201che ... would be in danger of being subject to torture\u201d in Sierra Leone. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1284 (9th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). Petitioner\u2019s torture convention claim therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
