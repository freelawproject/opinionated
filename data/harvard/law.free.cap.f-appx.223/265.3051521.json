Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review this determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Zaidi v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 678, 680-81 (7th Cir. 2004) (collecting cases); <em>see also Vasile v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 766, 768 (7th Cir.2005) (holding that even in light of the REAL ID Act of 2005, these \u201cfactual determinations continue to fall outside the jurisdiction of the court of appeals entertaining a petition for review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-20\">While we lack jurisdiction to consider the Board\u2019s ruling on the asylum claim, we retain jurisdiction to consider the denial of withholding of removal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2006). \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. SteviC, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Balde challenges the immigration judge\u2019s determination that her testimony was not credible, and that she otherwise failed to meet her burden of proof for withholding of removal. Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). We accord broad, though not unlimited, deference to credibility findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>supported by substantial evidence. <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). We will uphold the final agency determination if it is not \u201cmanifestly contrary to law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on our review of the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s determination that Balde failed to present a credible claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We dismiss the petition for review as to Balde\u2019s asylum claim and deny the remainder of the petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-17\"> As Balde does not challenge the Board\u2019s denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture, any such claim has been abandoned on appeal. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
