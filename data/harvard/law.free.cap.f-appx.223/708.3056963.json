(\u201cZTE\u201d) appeals the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\u2019s memorandum opinion affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling that John Edward Amoroso, Jr.\u2019s debt was dischargeable. Because the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, we will not recount them here. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Decisions of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and bankruptcy court are reviewed <em>de novo. Endo Steel, Inc. v. Janas (In re JWJ Contracting Co., Inc.), </em>371 F.3d 1079, 1081 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Carrillo v. Su (In re Su), </em>290 F.3d 1140, 1142 (9th Cir.2002). Factual findings are reviewed for clear error. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8013. Whether a claim is dischargeable is a mixed question of law and fact reviewed <em>de novo. In re Su, </em>290 F.3d at 1142; <em>Murray v. Bammer (In re Bammer), </em>131 F.3d 788, 791-92 (9th Cir.1997) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The bankruptcy court did not err in rejecting ZTE\u2019s non-dischargeability argument. It was ZTE\u2019s burden to establish that Amoroso was personally hable for the debt of his company to ZTE. <em>Banks v. Gill Distrib. Ctrs., Inc. (In re Banks), </em>263 F.3d 862, 868 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Mills v. Sdrawde Titleholders, Inc. (In re Mills), </em>841 F.2d 902, 904 (9th Cir.1988). The evidence at trial did not establish that Amoroso used his company, Audio Wood Products, Inc. (\u201cAudio Wood\u201d), as an <em>alter ego. </em>Accordingly, Amoroso was not personally liable for Audio Wood\u2019s debts on an <em>alter ego </em>theory. <em>Hambleton Bros. Lumber Co. v. Balkin Enters., Inc., </em>397 F.3d 1217, 1227 (9th Cir.2005). ZTE\u2019s reliance on <em>Griffin v. Felton (In re Felton), </em>197 B.R. 881, 885 (N.D.Cal.1996), is unavailing because in that case plaintiffs sued the defendant individually to recover damages he caused, not for the non-dischargeability of his company\u2019s debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Nor did the bankruptcy court err in finding ZTE failed to demonstrate nondischargeability under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a). ZTE did not establish that Amoroso misrepresented Audio Wood\u2019s financial condition or its intention to pay ZTE for goods. <em>Diamond v. Kolcum (In re Diamond), </em>285 F.3d 822, 827 (9th Cir.2002). ZTE\u2019s contention that Amoroso maliciously injured ZTE by intentionally misappropriating its goods has no support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings were well supported by trial evidence, and its conclusions were not erroneous. The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\u2019s memorandum order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling was without error.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b737-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
