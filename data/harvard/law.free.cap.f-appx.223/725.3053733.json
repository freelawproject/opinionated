The California Court of Appeal affirmed Bishop\u2019s conviction on five counts of misappropriating public money, Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 424, and two counts of perjury, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 118. Because this case arises in habeas, relief could be granted only if the California courts\u2019 decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Applying this standard, the federal district court denied habeas relief. We affirm except with respect to one perjury count.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-18\">Bishop alleges that the state trial judge committed constitutional error by failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>instruct the jury, as requested by the defense, that reimbursement is a defense to misappropriation charges. Bishop maintains she was entitled to such an instruction because James Sepulveda, a lawyer from the District Attorney\u2019s Office, had informed her during the summer of 1993 that the law allowed personal use of county-funded resources as long as she reimbursed the County. At trial, Sepulveda, who prosecuted Bishop\u2019s case, told the jury that reimbursement is not a defense under California\u2019s misappropriation statute, and the judge denied Bishop\u2019s request to instruct the jury to the contrary. The California Court of Appeal agreed with Sepulveda\u2019s interpretation of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">\u201c[T]he Due Process Clause of the Constitution ... prohibits convictions based on misleading actions by government officials.\u201d <em>United States v. Batterjee, </em>361 F.3d 1210, 1216 (9th Cir.2004); <em>see also Cox v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 559, 85 S.Ct. 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965); <em>Raley v. Ohio, </em>360 U.S. 423, 79 S.Ct. 1257, 3 L.Ed.2d 1344 (1959). Bishop may therefore have been constitutionally entitled to a reimbursement defense even though California\u2019s misappropriation statute does not provide one.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">To obtain relief on a claim that a valid defense was not given in jury instructions, \u201c[a] habeas petitioner must show that the alleged instructional error \u2018had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clark v. Brown, </em>450 F.3d 898, 905 (9th Cir.) (quoting <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993)), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 555, 166 L.Ed.2d 423 (2006). In this context, a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d means a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the jury would have arrived at a different verdict had the instruction been given. <em>Id. </em>at 916. To decide this prejudice question, the court looks to (1) the weight of evidence that contradicts the defense; and (2) whether the defense could have completely absolved the defendant of the charge. <em>See Beardslee v. Woodford, </em>358 F.3d 560, 578 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">After carefully surveying the evidence, we conclude that Bishop does not meet this standard for any of the counts on which she was convicted. Bishop presented evidence that she followed Sepulveda\u2019s advice by reimbursing her use of the county\u2019s material resources. She offered no evidence, however, that she understood Sepulveda\u2019s advice to permit reimbursement for misappropriated staff time. Instead, she claimed that the staff never did her private tasks on county-paid time, but rather performed them on their personal time.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">For several of the counts, the state\u2019s evidence focused on Bishop\u2019s campaign-related misuse of county-paid staff time, not on use of material resources. The factual issue concerning these counts was whether certain employees had kept a database of campaign contributors, designed fundraising invitations, prepared campaign-related press clippings, and wrote fundraising letters while on the clock for the county. In finding Bishop guilty on these counts, the jury must have rejected Bishop\u2019s testimony that these chores were done during the employees\u2019 personal time. A reimbursement defense therefore would not have absolved the illegal conduct alleged in those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">Although the state\u2019s case on the count related to Bishop\u2019s law practice focused heavily on her use of the county\u2019s material resources, a reimbursement instruction could not have completely absolved the conduct alleged in that count for a different reason: Undisputed evidence established that Bishop used county equipment for legal work <em>before </em>she received the advice on reimbursement. Due process con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>cerns arise only when \u201ca government official commits an error and the defendant relies on it <em>and thereby violates the law </em>\u201d \u2014 not, as here, when the violation of the law predates the incorrect advice. <em>United States v. Burrows, </em>36 F.3d 875, 882 (9th Cir.1994) (emphasis added). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Bishop argues that her trial lawyers labored under a conflict of interest, violating her right to counsel. An unconstitutional conflict arises when a defendant\u2019s lawyer previously represented a witness in the case \u201cif the cases are substantially related or if the attorney reveals privileged communications of the former client or otherwise divides his loyalties.\u201d <em>United States v. Shwayder, </em>312 F.3d 1109, 1118 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Fitzpatrick v. McCormick, </em>869 F.2d 1247, 1252 (9th Cir.1989)) (internal quotation mark omitted). Bishop alleges that a conflict arose in her case because the trial judge forbid one of her two lawyers from participating in pre-trial discussions about one of the state\u2019s witnesses, who had been his client a decade earlier in an unrelated family law matter. The cases were not \u201csubstantially related\u201d and the lawyers did not \u201creveal[] privileged communications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Bishop argues, however, that the judge\u2019s order caused her lawyers to \u201cotherwise divide[ ] [their] loyalties\u201d between her and the former witness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">To show a constitutional violation, Bishop must demonstrate both that her lawyer had \u201can actual conflict\u201d and that this conflict \u201cadversely affected [her] lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>United States v. Wells, </em>394 F.3d 725, 733 (9th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980)) (internal quotation mark omitted). \u201c[T]o show adverse effect, a defendant need not demonstrate prejudice \u2014 that the outcome of his trial would have been different but for the conflict \u2014 but only that some plausible alternative defense strategy or tactic might have been pursued but was not and that the alternative defense was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney\u2019s other loyalties or interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Stantini, </em>85 F.3d 9, 16 (2d Cir.1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">The court order did not create an actual conflict as to both of Bishop\u2019s attorneys because its explicit terms only applied to one of the attorneys. Although a successive representation conflict that arises as a matter of ethical rules applies to all the members of that lawyer\u2019s firm, <em>United States v. Rodrigues, </em>347 F.3d 818, 824 (9th Cir.2003), the conflict Bishop here complains about arose only because of the order, so its breadth is set by that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Moreover, even if the actual conflict applied to both of Bishop\u2019s lawyers, there was no adverse effect as a result of the conflict. Bishop does not proffer any foregone defense strategies that were \u201cinherently in conflict with or not undertaken <em>due to the attorney\u2019s other loyalties or interests. \u201d Wells, </em>394 F.3d at 733 (emphasis added). The failure to use the custody dispute records cannot be attributed to the conflict the order created, because the records were public and the order left one lawyer free to search for them. Bishop also cannot claim an adverse effect based on her lawyers\u2019 failure to use knowledge attainable only through their past representation of the witness. <em>Shwayder, </em>312 F.3d at 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Bishop claims that her lawyers\u2019 decision not to disqualify the prosecutor was a quid pro quo for his failure to seek the lawyers\u2019 own disqualification, and was thus connected to the conflicted loyalty created by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>order. We agree with the California Court of Appeal that Sepulveda\u2019s service in the case is quite troubling, given his status as a percipient witness. The record, however, does not explain the failure of Bishop\u2019s lawyers to object during trial to Sepulveda\u2019s participation. The California Court of Appeal rejected the effort to link this failure and the lawyers\u2019 fear about their potentially disqualifying conflict as \u201coverly speculative,\u201d and noted that there is a plausible explanation for the failure to disqualify Sepulveda having nothing to do with the conflict \u2014 namely, that Bishop and her lawyers did not want him to appear as a witness. Because demonstrating that a conflict produced an actual effect is \u201ca substantial hurdle\u201d even though it does not require a showing of prejudice, <em>Lockhart v. Terhune, </em>250 F.3d 1223, 1231 (9th Cir. 2001) (quoting <em>Maiden v. Bunnell, </em>35 F.3d 477, 481 (9th Cir.1994)), the California Court of Appeal was not unreasonable in rejecting Bishop\u2019s claim of an unconstitutional conflict on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Finally, the trial court\u2019s order also did not unconstitutionally restrict Bishop\u2019s ability to confer with her lawyers, as it left her free at all times to speak with one of the lawyers about the witness. <em>See United States v. Miguel, </em>111 F.3d 666, 672-73 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Bishop also argues that the jury considered impermissible extrinsic evidence when one of the jurors discussed his experience as a Contra Costa County employee. A juror\u2019s personal experiences can enter jury deliberations to aid the interpretation of record evidence. <em>See United States v. Navarro-Garcia, </em>926 F.2d 818, 821-22 (9th Cir.1991). We doubt the alleged discussions went beyond that scope. In any case, we would have to find \u201cthe extrinsic evidence had a \u2018substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict\u2019 \u201d to grant relief on this claim. <em>Sassounian v. Roe, </em>230 F.3d 1097, 1108 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710). In the absence of any evidence specifying the precise nature of the statements about the general \u201cpractices and mentalities\u201d of county employees, we cannot conclude that those statements were capable of altering the jury\u2019s credibility evaluations of individual county employees. Bishop therefore has not established that the alleged extrinsic evidence had any \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d on the jury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Because the due process clause allows courts to \u201cconsider the content of the allegations [and] the seriousness of the alleged misconduct\u201d in deciding whether to hold an evidentiary hearing when a defendant alleges jury misconduct, <em>Tracey v. Palmateer, </em>341 F.3d 1037, 1044 (9th Cir.2003), the vague allegations in the juror affidavits did not require the state trial court to conduct a further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">We will grant habeas relief on the erroneous admission of evidence when its consideration \u201crendered the trial so fundamentally unfair as to violate due process.\u201d <em>Windham v. Merkle, </em>163 F.3d 1092, 1103 (9th Cir.1998). Although the California Court of Appeal held that the trial court erred in allowing witnesses to testify that Bishop \u201clied\u201d during her grand jury appearance because the testimony was unnecessary opinion testimony by a lay witness, see Cal. Evid. Code \u00a7 800(b), it did not unreasonably hold that the error was harmless. Federal courts \u201cmay not grant [a] habeas petition ... if the state court simply erred in concluding that the State\u2019s errors were harmless; rather, habeas relief is only appropriate if the [state court] applied harmless error review in an \u2018objectively unreasonable\u2019 manner.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number><em>Esparza, </em>540 U.S. 12, 18, 124 S.Ct. 7, 157 L.Ed.2d 263 (2003) (per curiam). Bishop has failed to locate any authority that suggests such an \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d error occurred in her trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Bishop alleges that constitutionally insufficient evidence supported the perjury verdict concerning whether she committed perjury by denying that she \u201cdirected] any of [her] staff to prepare, on county time, campaign material targeted at certain geographic areas within [her] district.\u201d We must determine whether the California Court of Appeal unreasonably decided that a rational juror could have found the required elements of perjury proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Juan H. v. Allen, </em>408 F.3d 1262, 1274-75 (9th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1142, 1145, 163 L.Ed.2d 1000 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The falsity element of California\u2019s perjury statute requires that a statement be \u201cliterally false.\u201d <em>Chein v. Shumsky, </em>373 F.3d 978, 985 (9th Cir.2004) (en banc) (citing <em>People v. Rosoto, </em>10 Cal.3d 939, 949, 112 Cal.Rptr. 641, 519 P.2d 1065 (1974); <em>Cabe v. Sup.Ct., </em>63 Cal.App.4th 732, 740, 74 Cal.Rptr.2d 331 (1998)). As the California Court of Appeal acknowledged, \u201cnone of the witnesses testified that [Bishop] expressly directed them to prepare their material for the [targeted] letter on county time.\u201d Instead, they testified that Bishop told them to complete the letter \u201cas soon as possible\u201d or \u201cby noon.\u201d The California Court of Appeal, however, concluded that \u201ctheir testimony supports an inference that she nevertheless communicated such a direction,\u201d because of the instruction\u2019s context and because the testimony \u201csuggests that [the employees] interpreted [Bishop] as having directed preparation of the material in a time period within normal county business hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">The conclusion that a reasonable juror could have found Bishop\u2019s statement to the grand jury false is not a reasonable assessment of the evidence. The addressees\u2019 decisions concerning how to respond to Bishop\u2019s instructions cannot render false Bishop\u2019s statement that they were not directed so to respond. Moreover, at least one employee did not so respond, but instead went home to complete the assigned task. Further, the inference that a task is to be done during \u201cnormal county business hours\u201d is not equivalent to an inference that it is to be done on paid time, or in county offices. Finally, even if Bishop knew it was likely that the employees would likely perform the task on county time, that circumstance would not establish that she \u201cdirect[ed]\u201d them to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Although Bishop was less than forthcoming in her grand jury testimony by not acknowledging that her staff actually did prepare the material on paid county time, she did not commit perjury by making literally true statements that \u201ccause[d] a misleading impression\u201d by \u201cfailing to volunteer more explicit information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rosoto, </em>10 Cal.3d at 949, 112 Cal. Rptr. 641, 519 P.2d 1065). Without evidence that <em>Bishop </em>told her employees to do campaign work on county time, the California Court of Appeal unreasonably determined that a rational juror could find Bishop\u2019s statement literally false. The inadmissible opinion testimony that Bishop \u201clied\u201d explains why the jury nonetheless returned a guilty verdict. <em>See id. </em>at 989 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED in part; REMANDED with instructions to grant a writ of habeas corpus with respect to count 10 of the conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b754-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
