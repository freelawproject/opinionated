Burns, United States District Judge for the Southern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b751-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-16\">Leon Wilson Brown challenges several special conditions of supervised release imposed as part of his sentence following his guilty plea to possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we affirm in part and vacate in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-17\">Because Brown did not object to the special release conditions in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>441 F.3d 767, 772 (9th Cir.2006). Under this standard, there must be (1) error; (2) that is plain; and (3) that affects Brown\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Maciel-Vasquez, </em>458 F.3d 994, 996 n. 3 (9th Cir. 2006). If these conditions are met, we may correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-18\">Brown argues the district court committed plain error when it imposed a supervised release condition that barred alcohol use. However, as the alcohol condition reasonably relates to Brown\u2019s drug conviction and history of alcohol-related incidents and drug use; protects the public from further crimes; and contributes to rehabilitation, no plain error occurred. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>159 F.3d 397, 401 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Brown also maintains the district court committed plain error by improperly delegating to the probation officer the authority to determine (1) the maximum number of drug and alcohol tests and (2) whether Brown should pay the cost of drug and psychiatric treatment. These claims are foreclosed by our decisions in <em>Maciel-Vasquez, </em>458 F.3d at 996, and <em>United States v. Dupas, </em>419 F.3d 916, 924 (9th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1484, 164 L.Ed.2d 261 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Finally, Brown argues the district court committed plain error by imposing an overbroad and vague supervised release condition requiring that Brown \u201cnot wear, display, use or possess any insignia, emblem, button, badge, cap, hat, scarf, bandana, jewelry, paraphernalia, or any article of clothing which may connote affiliation with, or membership in the Rollin 30\u2019s Piru Blood, Bloodstone Piru, or Bloods gang.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">A district court has broad discretion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 to set supervised release conditions, and may restrict fundamental or First Amendment rights if the conditions reasonably relate to the \u00a7 3553(a) statutory factors, including the nature of the crime, deterring criminal conduct, aiding the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation, or protecting the public. <em>United States v. Ross, </em>476 F.3d 719, 720-22 (9th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Weber, </em>451 F.3d 552, 557-58 (9th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Bee, </em>162 F.3d 1232, 1234-36 (9th Cir.1998). In particular, a district court may impose special conditions of supervised release like the ones in this case that are designed to prevent a defendant\u2019s reversion into a former crime-inducing lifestyle or bar affiliation with former associates. <em>United States v. Bolinger, </em>940 F.2d 478, 480 (9th Cir.1991) (citing <em>Malone v. United States, </em>502 F.2d 554, 556-57 (9th Cir.1974)). At the same time, due process prohibits setting a condition that is \u201cso vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\u201d <em>United States v. Hugs, </em>384 F.3d 762, 768 (9th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 933, 125 S.Ct. 1680, 161 L.Ed.2d 500 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">Here, the district court prohibited Brown from wearing clothing or displaying articles that \u201cmay connote affiliation with, or membership in\u201d certain street gangs. The problem with the restriction imposed by the district court is the phrase \u201cmay connote\u201d is vague and open to interpretation depending on who the observer is. For example, baseball caps, gloves and bandanas as well as clothing bearing college logos may be deemed gang attire by high schools around the country. Paul D. Murphy, <em>Restricting Gang Clothing in Public Schools; Does a Dress Code Violate a Student\u2019s Right of Free Expression?, </em>64 S.Cal.L.Rev. 1321, 1328 (July 1991). However, we think the restrictive condition covering what clothing Brown may not wear sweeps too broadly and indiscriminately. Specifically, the phrase \u201cmay connote\u201d fails to adequately define or provide notice of precisely what apparel Brown should refrain from wearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">Despite Brown\u2019s failure to object to the condition when it was announced, we hold it was plain error for the district court to impose such a vague condition implicating First Amendment freedoms. Accordingly, we vacate this portion of Brown\u2019s sentence and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b751-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

On remand, the district court remains free to impose a supervised release condition restricting Brown from wearing gang attire or displaying gang paraphernalia, provided the restriction is narrowly drawn and violations may be determined under a reasonably definite standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
