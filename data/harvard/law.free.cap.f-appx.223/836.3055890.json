Cooper filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action for damages and injunctive relief against the following individuals: Judge J. Gary Pate, Judge James Finley, Judge Andra Sparks, Judge Breudette Brown Green, Judge Sandra H. Storm, and Judge Elise Barclay, all of whom are either Jefferson County, Alabama Family Court judges or referees, or state appellate judges; Jack Wallace, an Assistant Attorney General for the State of Ala<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>bama; Page Walley, the Commissioner of the Alabama Department of Human Resources when the complaint was filed; Oliver Gilmore, the former Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts for the State of Alabama; Roderick \u2018Graham, a private attorney who represented Ena Patricia Walker in a child support case in which Cooper was the opposing party; and Charles Cleveland, the former Commissioner of the Alabama Department of Human Resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Cooper appeals the granting of summary judgment as to some appellees, and the granting of motions to dismiss as to other appellees. With respect to all appellees, either the appellees are immune, Cooper has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1983, or the <em>Younger </em>doctrine applies. <em>See Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). Thus, we affirm for the reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s well-reasoned report and recommendation of July 21, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
