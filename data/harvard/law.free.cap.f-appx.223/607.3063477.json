We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Botello v. Gammick, </em>413 F.3d 971, 975 (9th Cir.2005) (absolute immunity to public officials); <em>Nat\u2019l Audubon Soc\u2019y Inc. v. Davis, </em>307 F.3d 835, 846 (9th Cir.2002) (Eleventh Amendment immunity), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The district court properly dismissed Robinson\u2019s claims against the state court judges, because they are entitled to absolute immunity for judicial actions taken within their jurisdiction. <em>See Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>363 F.3d 916, 922-23 (9th Cir.2004). Likewise, the district court properly concluded the prosecutors were entitled to absolute immunity, because they were performing functions \u201cintimately associated with the judicial phase\u201d of Robinson\u2019s criminal trial. <em>See KRL v. Moore, </em>384 F.3d 1105, 1110-11 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The district court also properly concluded Robinson failed to adequately allege that the defendants conspired to violate his civil rights, <em>see Olsen, </em>363 F.3d at 929, or that Plumas County maintained a policy or custom of violating civil rights, <em>see Gillette v. Delmore, </em>979 F.2d 1342, 1346-47 (9th Cir.1992) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">The district court properly dismissed Robinson\u2019s claims against the State of California as barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Franceschi v. Schwartz, </em>57 F.3d 828, 831 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">Robinson\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
