The government seeks to enforce Hernandez-Penalosa\u2019s sentencing waiver of appeal. The record shows that the waiver was knowing and voluntary and, based on the plain language of the agreement, applies to the circumstances at hand. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we do not address Hernandez-Penalosa\u2019s sentencing challenge. <em>See id. </em>at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-24\">Hernandez-Penalosa argues that, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), his 57-month term of imprisonment exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense, which must be found by a jury. Hernandez-Penalosa\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), cert <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Hernandez-Penalosa properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, and that he raises it here solely to preserve it for further review. We GRANT the government\u2019s unopposed motion for summary affirmance of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The government moved for dismissal of the appeal as barred by Hernandez-Penalosa\u2019s waiver of appeal. As the challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b) is arguably not waived, the motion to dismiss is DENIED. As it is clear, however, that Hernandez-Penalosa\u2019s appeal of his sentence is barred by his waiver and that his sentence should be affirmed, the government\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary. For the foregoing reasons HernandezPenalosa\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
