WOOD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Mauro Pi\u00f1a-Gonzalez, a Mexican citizen, pleaded guilty to being in the United States without permission after his removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Pi\u00f1a-Gonzalez had been removed after he was convicted of the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl, whom he also impregnated. The district court calculated a guidelines imprisonment range of 46 to 57 months and sentenced Pi\u00f1a-Gonzalez to 57 months. The court explicitly rejected the requests of both the government and defense counsel that he receive a sentence at the bottom of the range; the court noted that Pi\u00f1a-Gonzalez was still serving probation for the statutory rape when he committed the immigration violation, and that his young victim was with him when he was arrested, despite a court order prohibiting him from contacting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">As part of a written plea agreement, Pi\u00f1a-Gonzalez waived the right to appeal his conviction and any sentence within the guidelines range. Despite this waiver, Pi\u00f1a-Gonzalez directed his appointed counsel to appeal his sentence, but counsel now seeks to withdraw because he cannot discern a nonfrivolous basis for the appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Pi\u00f1aGonzalez was invited to respond to counsel\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), but his only response was to request the appointment of new counsel. Our review of the record is thus limited to the potential issues identified in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">Counsel identifies two possible grounds on which Pi\u00f1a-Gonzalez could attack his sentence, but the appeal waiver makes both frivolous. An appeal waiver is enforceable if knowing and voluntary, <em>United States v. Lockwood, </em>416 F.3d 604, 608 (7th Cir.2005), so Pi\u00f1a-Gonzalez cannot proceed with this appeal unless he can overcome his waiver. And Pi\u00f1a-Gonzalez cannot contest the waiver without challenging his guilty plea, <em>see United States v. Cieslowski </em>410 F.3d 353, 361-62 (7th Cir. 2005); <em>United States v. Whitlow, </em>287 F.3d 638, 640 (7th Cir.2002), which Pi\u00f1a-Gonzalez has not indicated that he wishes to do. Thus, any argument relating to his sentence would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">Counsel also considers whether Pi\u00f1aGonzalez could argue that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Any such claim, however, is better suited to collateral attack, at which time a full record may be developed. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>394 F.3d 543, 557-58 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-15\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Pi\u00f1a-Gonzalez\u2019s filing, which we construe as a motion for the appointment of substitute counsel, is DENIED. This appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
