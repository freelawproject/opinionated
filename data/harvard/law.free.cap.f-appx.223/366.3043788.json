His execution is scheduled for today, March 20, 2007. The facts and procedural history are detailed in the opinion we filed earlier today, in which we denied Nealy\u2019s motion for authorization to file a successive federal habeas application in which he sought to raise claims that (1) his due process rights were violated because the State suppressed exculpatory evidence and knowingly relied on perjured evidence to convict him, and (2) that his conviction is unreliable under the Eighth Amendment. <em>In re Nealy, </em>No. 07-10311, \u2014 Fed.Appx.-, 2007 WL 866641 (5th Cir. March 20, 2007) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">On March 19, 2007, Nealy filed a Motion for Appointment of Counsel and Stay of Execution in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. He asked the district court to appoint counsel and stay his execution so that counsel can investigate evidence of possible mental retardation and prepare and file a motion in this court for authorization to file a successive habeas application asserting a claim under <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002), in which the Supreme Court held that mentally retarded persons cannot be executed. Today, the district court, <em>sua sponte, </em>transferred Nealy\u2019s motion for stay and appointment of counsel to this court in the interest of justice, because of the short time before Nealy\u2019s scheduled execution. Nealy has filed a notice of appeal of the district court\u2019s transfer order. That appeal is consolidated with the transferred motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-17\">This court has held that where an unrepresented petitioner can make a \u201ccolor-able showing\u201d of mental retardation, the petitioner is entitled to a stay of execution and appointment of counsel. <em>In re Hearn (Hearn I), </em>376 F.3d 447, 455 (5th Cir. 2004). The court subsequently clarified that such relief is available only to a petitioner who has already completed the state and federal habeas process and who may have a claim based on the previously unavailable, new rule of <em>Atkins, </em>that is not time-barred. <em>In re Hearn (Hearn II), </em>389 F.3d 122, 123 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-18\"><em>Hearn </em>does not apply to Nealy\u2019s situation. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas appointed attorney John Nation to represent Nealy on February 25, 2002. Nation continued to represent Nealy in June 2002, when <em>Atkins </em>was decided by the Supreme Court. Nation filed Nealy\u2019s first federal habeas petition in October 2002. While Nealy\u2019s federal habeas petition was pending, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Texas Court of Criminal Appeals issued its opinion in <em>Ex parte Soffar, </em>143 S.W.3d 804 (Tex.Crim.App.2004) (modifying the Texas \u201ctwo-forum\u201d abstention rule to allow consideration of a successive application for state habeas relief if the federal court with jurisdiction over a parallel federal habeas petition entered an order staying its proceedings to allow the federal petitioner to pursue unexhausted claims in state court). After <em>Sojfar, </em>Nealy could have sought a stay of his federal habeas proceedings and raised an <em>Atkins </em>claim in state court (unlike <em>Hearn, </em>whose federal proceedings and federal counsel\u2019s appointment ended before <em>Sojfar </em>was decided). Nation continued to represent Nealy following the district court\u2019s denial of his federal habeas petition on May 18, 2005, up until January 2007, when the Texas Defender Service was substituted as counsel for Nealy. Therefore, Nealy was not \u201cunrepresented\u201d and an <em>Atkins </em>claim was not \u201cunavailable\u201d to him, within the meaning of <em>Hearn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Nealy argues that his <em>Atkins </em>claim should nevertheless be considered as previously \u201cunavailable\u201d, because his federal habeas counsel at that time did not believe he could investigate or raise new claims that had not been raised previously in state court. This contention is without merit. As the State pointed out in its response in opposition to Nealy\u2019s pending motions, it submitted Nation\u2019s affidavit along with its response to Nealy\u2019s fourth state habeas application (filed on March 14, 2007, asserting an <em>Atkins </em>claim for the first time in state court). In that affidavit, Nation stated that he had represented Nealy continuously from 2002 until January 9, 2007, when Nealy\u2019s present counsel was substituted. He stated that he understands the law of <em>Atkins, </em>knows how to raise an <em>Atkins </em>claim when he has evidence suggesting that a defendant may be mentally retarded, and that he has never considered filing an <em>Atkins </em>claim for Nealy \u201cfor the simple reason that I have no evidence or indication, through personal observation or otherwise, that Charles Nealy might be mentally retarded.\u201d The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed Nealy\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>claim as an abuse of the writ. <em>Ex parte Nealy, </em>No. WR-50,-361-04 (Tex.Crim.App. March 15, 2007) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Finally, <em>Hearn </em>does not apply because any potential <em>Atkins </em>claim by Nealy would be time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) (petitioner has one year to file federal habeas application following date on which constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review). <em>Atkins </em>was decided on June 20, 2002. Thus, Nealy had until June 20, 2003 to assert a claim under <em>Atkins. </em>Furthermore, he would have been entitled to claim equitable tolling from June 20, 2003 until February 11, 2004, when <em>Sojfar </em>modified the Texas \u201ctwo forum\u201d rule to allow consideration of the merits of a subsequent state habeas application if the federal court stayed a pending federal habeas application in order to allow the petitioner to exhaust state court remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">For the foregoing reasons, Nealy\u2019s Motion for Appointment of Counsel and Stay of Execution is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
