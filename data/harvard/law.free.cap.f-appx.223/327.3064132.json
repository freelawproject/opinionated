He contends that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) based on a finding that he was a leader or supervisor in the conspiracy. We have reviewed the record and determine that the district court did not clearly err in imposing the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005); <em>United States v. Ronning, </em>47 F.3d 710, 711 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Quiroga also asserts that the district court erred in including 321 kilograms of marijuana found at a stash house in the base offense level. He contends that the Government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he engaged in a conspiracy involving those drugs. However, in light of Quiroga\u2019s guilty plea to a drug conspiracy, the Government was required to show at sentencing that the marijuana at the stash house was \u201cpart of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). We have reviewed the record and determine that the evidence in the presentence report is sufficient to warrant the finding of relevant conduct. <em>See United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 247 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. De Jesus-Batres, </em>410 F.3d 154, 164 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1020, 163 L.Ed.2d 865 (2006). The judgment of the district court is thus AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
