Williams (M.R.Williams), </em>435 F.3d 1350 (11th Cir. 2006), who was convicted of a similar offense and received only a 90-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-26\">We review the district court\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.... \u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-27\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we have established a two-part process for district courts to use in calculating sentences. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. First, the district court must consult and correct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>ly calculate the range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>Second, the district court must fashion a reasonable sentence by considering the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>Included among the \u00a7 3553(a) factors are (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (4) the need for deterrence; (5) the need to protect the public; (6) the Sentencing Guidelines range; and (7) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). However, the district court does not need to state on the record that it has considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">In addition, \u201cthe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams (A.E. Williams), </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. petition filed, </em>No. 06-7352 (Oct. 19, 2006). A reviewing court will not substitute its judgment in weighing the relevant factors. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we have rejected the notion that a sentence within the guidelines is <em>per se </em>reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 787. Even so, \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose, and when the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, [this court] ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Little\u2019s sentence was reasonable. Because Little does not challenge the district court\u2019s scoring of the Guidelines, the only issue is whether in this case the \u00a7 3553(a) factors make a sentence within the Guidelines range unreasonable. In imposing the sentence, the district court noted that it had considered the advisory guidelines, factors set forth in \u00a7 3553, the statements offered in mitigation, and the history and characteristics of this defendant. The court noted that some of Little\u2019s prior offenses were \u201ccommitted one right after the other.\u201d As a result, the court did not believe it was appropriate to depart from the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Little\u2019s reliance on our opinion in <em>Williams </em>is misplaced because in that case, we held that in similar circumstances it was reasonable to vary below the Guidelines range, whereas in this case, Little is asking us to hold that it is unreasonable not to vary from the Guidelines range in these circumstances. Because there are a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose, the fact that the sentence in <em>Williams </em>was found to be reasonable does not make a significantly different sentence in a similar case unreasonable. Little has not met the burden of showing that the sentence imposed was unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
