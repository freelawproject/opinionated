On August 17, 2005, the District Court granted appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment as to all federal claims and claims arising under the Pennsylvania Whistle-blower Law, 43 Pa. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1421-1428, while dismissing appellants\u2019 other state claims without prejudice. Appellants now challenge that order. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The Livingstons\u2019 claims concern an unfortunate June 7, 2000 incident in which Brandon Livingston was attacked by a McKees Rocks K-9 police dog (Dolpho) while the K-9 was ostensibly under the control of Officer Barger. After the episode, Lorraine Livingston, Brandon\u2019s mother, made comments on various media outlets criticizing the McKees Rocks police department for allowing the attack to occur. Thereafter, according to the Livingstons, the police began targeting them; more specifically: (1) the Livingstons received a notice warning them to cut their grass, even though their neighbors, whose grass was higher, did not; (2) the police department stopped their son, Chai, for running a stop sign and called him \u201cboy\u201d; and (3) the police generally harassed the family by driving through their neighborhood and watching them. Ultimately, the Livingstons brought state-law claims regarding Brandon\u2019s injuries and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims alleging First Amendment retaliation, racial profiling, and failure to train.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">Initially, we agree with the District Court that Dolpho, as a dog, and the police department, as an inseparable component of the Borough, <em>see Rhodes v. McDannel, </em>945 F.2d 117, 120 (6th Cir. 1991); <em>Pahle v. Colebrookdale Twp., </em>227 F.Supp.2d 361, 367 (E.D.Pa.2002), are improper parties to this lawsuit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We also conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Kazmarae Livingston\u2019s claims for failure to prosecute. Given that Kazmarae has not shown up for depositions, has failed to cooperate with discovery, has been unavailable for medical evaluations, and that her whereabouts are currently unknown, we are convinced that the District Court\u2019s decision is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>in accordance with <em>Poulis v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>747 F.2d 868, 868 (3d Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The Livingstons\u2019 constitutional claims fare no better. To establish a First Amendment retaliation claim, the Livingstons must show: \u201c(1) that [they] engaged in protected activity; (2) that the government responded with retaliation; and (3) that the protected activity was the cause of the retaliation.\u201d <em>Estate of Smith v. Marasco, </em>318 F.3d 497, 512 (3d Cir.2003). Even assuming the <em>first two </em>prongs are met, this claim cannot succeed because the Livingstons have failed to present any evidence showing that their protected speech (critical statements made to the media) was the cause of the police officers\u2019 conduct. The only evidence supporting causation is the fact that the adverse actions followed the speech; however, the temporal proximity between the two must be \u201cunusually suggestive\u201d before we will infer a causal link. <em>Id. </em>Here, the Livingstons have failed to provide a precise chronology of events; no reasonable jury could infer causation based solely on such a vague temporal connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The Livingstons next challenge the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to their racial profiling claim. In order to make out a profiling claim, the Livingstons must establish that the actions of the officers \u201c(1) had a discriminatory effect and (2) were motivated by a discriminatory purpose.\u201d <em>Bradley v. United States, </em>299 F.3d 197, 205 (3d Cir.2002). This claim suffers from two fatal shortcomings. First, the Livingstons lack standing to bring claims resting on the legal rights of third parties, <em>see Powers v. Ohio, </em>499 U.S. 400, 410, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991), and the bulk of then-racial profiling allegations concern third-party injuries. Second, to prove discriminatory effect, the Livingstons were required to present evidence that similarly situated members of an unprotected class were not subjected to the same adverse treatment, <em>Bradley, </em>299 F.3d at 206, which they have not even attempted to do. Thus, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to appellees on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Finally, the Livingstons challenge the judgment on their failure-to-train claim concerning Dolpho and Officer Barger. \u201cA plaintiff pressing a \u00a7 1983 claim must identify a failure to provide specific training that has a causal nexus with their injuries and must demonstrate that the absence of that specific training can reasonably be said to reflect a deliberate indifference to whether the alleged constitutional deprivations occurred.\u201d <em>Reitz v. County of Bucks, </em>125 F.3d 139, 145 (3d Cir.1997). The Livingstons have failed to identify the specific training that they believe should have been offered; indeed, the only evidence in the record is that Barger and Dolpho were extensively trained and that Dolpho passed certification tests each year. The fact that Dolpho attacked Brandon does not lead ineluctably to the conclusion that Barger and Dolpho were inadequately trained. <em>See City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 391, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989) (\u201c[Adequately trained officers occasionally make mistakes; the fact that they do says little about the training program or the legal basis for holding the city liable.\u201d). Thus, we agree with the District Court that the Livingstons failed to present evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the injuries to Brandon were caused by the Borough\u2019s failure to provide adequate training.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Given that we conclude that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment to appellees on all of the Living<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>stons\u2019 federal claims, we also rule that it was appropriate for the Court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Livingstons\u2019 state claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Wanda Jones-Dixon, an African-American woman who during the time relevant to this lawsuit was a Borough eouncilwoman, appeals the District Court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment to appellee Borough on her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims alleging racial harassment and First Amendment retaliation and her claim under the Pennsylvania Whistleblower Law. Jones-Dixon\u2019s claims are based on a variety of mistreatment she claims to have suffered at the hands of Borough employees, including her: receiving death threats as a result of her complaints about illegal Borough dumping procedures in 1996; being called racial epithets because she attempted to commission a study of racial profiling in 2000; being threatened for attempting to challenge the conduct of a police officer in 1994; and receiving threatening and hang-up phone calls and being warned to shut up by Borough Police Officer Conners in 2002 immediately after blasting the Borough for allowing Dolpho to attack Brandon Livingston.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The District Court was correct to conclude that the majority of Jones-Dixon\u2019s claims are time-barred under both \u00a7 1983 and the Pennsylvania Whistleblower Law. In Pennsylvania, \u00a7 1983 actions are subject to a two-year statute of limitations, <em>Sameric Corp. of Del., Inc. v. City of Philadelphia, </em>142 F.3d 582, 599 (3rd Cir. 1998); the Whistleblower Law has a statute of limitations of 180 days, 43 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 1424(a). Jones-Dixon filed this lawsuit on June 7, 2004, and accordingly, \u00a7 1983\u2019s statute of limitations bars any claims that accrued before June 7, 2002, and the Whistleblower Law\u2019s statute of limitations bars any claims that accrued before December 10, 2003. Almost all of the alleged retaliatory conduct occurred before June 7, 2002, let alone December 10, 2003. Thus, all of Jones-Dixon\u2019s Whistleblower Law claims are time-barred, and all of her \u00a7 1983 claims are time-barred except those alleging retaliation for her outspoken criticism of the Borough concerning the Dolpho affair.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">Even Jones-Dixon\u2019s timely retaliation claim cannot provide her with relief. She has sued only the Borough, and when a suit is based on \u00a7 1983, a municipality cannot be liable under a theory of <em>respondeat superior; </em>rather, \u201cthe municipality can only be liable when the alleged constitutional transgression implements or executes a policy, regulation or decision officially adopted by the governing body or informally adopted by custom.\u201d <em>Beck v. City of Pittsburgh, </em>89 F.3d 966, 971 (3d Cir.1996). Here, Jones-Dixon stated that she did not know who was making the threatening phone calls, and presented no evidence that Officer Conners\u2019 belligerent conduct was part of the Borough\u2019s operating procedure or ordered by a Borough decisionmaker. Thus, no reasonable juror could conclude that the mistreatment Jones-Dixon suffered was the result of a Borough policy, and we affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment against Jones-Dixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">Rene Surgest, an African-American woman who was a dispatcher at the Bor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>ough\u2019s police department, also appeals the District Court\u2019s disposition of her claims. She brought claims against the Borough under the Pennsylvania Whistleblower Law and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that she was racially harassed at work and that she was discharged from her position in retaliation for reporting unlawful activities of the Borough.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">As noted above, \u00a7 1983 claims have a two-year limitations period and Whistle-blower Law claims have a 180-day limitations period. Because Surgest filed her complaint on June 7, 2004, any \u00a7 1983 claims that accrued before June 7, 2002 and any Whistleblower Law claims that accrued before December 10, 2003 are time-barred. This includes Surgest\u2019s retaliation claim concerning the workers\u2019 television being confiscated, which occurred sometime before 2000, and her retaliation claim concerning a dispute about her sick leave, which occurred in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Surgest\u2019s other retaliation claim alleges that she was discharged from her job because she complained to the FBI about the police force\u2019s racial profiling, committing civil rights abuses, and maintaining a hostile work environment. The analysis under \u00a7 1983 and the Whistle-blower Law is similar. A public employee\u2019s claim of First Amendment retaliation is subject to a three-step test: (1) \u201cthe employee must show that the activity is in fact protected\u201d; (2) \u201cthe employee must show that the protected activity was a substantial factor in the alleged retaliatory action\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe employer may defeat the employee\u2019s claim by demonstrating that the same adverse action would have taken place in the absence of the protected conduct.\u201d <em>Hill v. City of Scranton, </em>411 F.3d 118, 125 (3d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks, citations omitted). As relevant to this case, the Whistleblower Law provides that \u201cIt shall be a defense to an action under this section if the defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the action by the employer occurred for separate and legitimate reasons, which are not merely pretextual.\u201d 43 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 1424(c). Here, the District Court correctly concluded that Surgest has failed to present sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to find in her favor under either statute. The Borough has presented evidence that it discharged not only Surgest, but all of its dispatchers because it joined the county-wide 911 emergency-response system. Surgest has failed to proffer any evidence challenging that explanation; indeed, she stated that the Borough was \u201cwell within [its] rights to eliminate that job.\u201d Thus, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against Surgest\u2019s only non-time-barred retaliation claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court entered on August 17, 2005, will be affirmed</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-10\">. We review a district court\u2019s order granting a motion for summary judgment under a plenary standard, applying the same test employed by the District Court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c). <em>Morton Int\u2019l, Inc. v. A.E. Staley Mfg. Co., </em>343 F.3d 669, 679 (3d Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate if \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In making this determination, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Further, we may affirm for any reason supported by the record. <em>Nicini v. Morra, </em>212 F.3d 798, 805 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-15\"><em>. </em>This also applies to claims brought by appellants Jones-Dixon and Surgest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b117-8\">. Jones-Dixon argues that none of these claims should be time-barred because they represent a continuing violation. However, we have explained that \"causes of action that can be brought individually expire with the applicable limitations period,\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor v. City of Newark, </em>440 F.3d 125, 128 (3d Cir. 2006), and each of the challenged incidents was individually actionable as a First Amendment retaliation claim when it occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\">. The filings are unclear as to whether Surgest, by claiming that the Borough has shown a pattern and practice of racial harassment, aimed to present a hostile-work-environment claim, or whether, consistent with all appellants\u2019 propensities, she was complaining about injuries to third parties that she has no standing to challenge. Regardless, the ambiguity is of no moment, because no reasonable jury could conclude that Surgest was subjected to a hostile work environment because of her race. In order to prove the existence of a hostile work environment, Surgest must show that she suffered \u201csevere or pervasive\u201d discrimination because of her race. <em>Jensen v. Potter, </em>435 F.3d 444, 449 (3d Cir.2006). The only evidence of racial animus Surgest presented is that officers directed racial epithets to prisoners (not to Surgest or other employees), and that she once stumbled upon a sound clip in an officer's computer from the movie <em>Blazing Saddles </em>that contained an epithet. These allegations are wholly insufficient to demonstrate a hostile work environment. <em>See Caver v. City of Trenton, </em>420 F.3d 243, 263 (3d Cir.2005). Even accepting that each incident of (non-time-barred) facially neutral mistreatment that Surgest complained of was also racially motivated, a reasonable jury could not have found those isolated incidents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>of harassment were severe or pervasive. <em>Cf. Cardenas v. Massey, </em>269 F.3d 251, 262 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
