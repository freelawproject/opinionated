Ct. N.Y. City May 4, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-17\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-18\">The IJ\u2019s conclusion that Ye failed to establish that he would more likely than not be tortured if removed to China on the basis of his illegal departure is supported by substantial evidence. We have acknowledged that \u201cChinese law does indeed allow for imposition of a sentence of imprisonment on a person who illegally de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>parts the country.\u201d <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 407 (2d. Cir.2005). However, \u201cpunishment as a result of ... illegal departure ... does not [standing alone] demonstrate a likelihood of persecution under the Act.\u201d <em>See Matter of Sibrun, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 354, 359 (BIA 1983). Ye has presented no facts or background material that would compel us to reach a different conclusion than that reached by the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">As Ye has not shown that illegal emigrants are more likely than not to be tortured in Chinese prisons, he has not demonstrated that he is entitled to CAT relief on this basis. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir.2005). This Court has made clear that the relevant inquiry is whether someone in the petitioner\u2019s \u201cparticular alleged circumstances\u201d is more likely than not to be tortured. <em>Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-44 (2d Cir.2003). Here, Ye provided no information regarding his own personal circumstances that would allow the IJ to find that he, in particular, was more likely than not to be imprisoned, much less tortured in prison. Based on this record, the IJ reasonably determined that Ye failed to meet his burden. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin, </em>432 F.3d at 159-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Because Ye did not raise any arguments regarding persecution on the basis of Falun Gong in his brief to this Court, we deem that claim abandoned. <em>Jian Wen Wang v. BCIS, </em>437 F.3d 276, 278 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
