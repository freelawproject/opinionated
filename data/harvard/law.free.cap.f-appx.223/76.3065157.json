Pogue, of the United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b104-18\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b104-19\">Defendant-appellant Kareem A. Ford appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (I. Leo Glasser, <em>Judge) </em>convicting him, after a plea of guilty, of one count of possession, with intent to defraud, of 15 or more unauthorized access devices, specifically, credit card numbers, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(3). <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>No. 04 Cr. 00146 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 15, 2005). The district court sentenced the defendant to a term of 36 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-20\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-21\">On appeal, the defendant does not contest the accuracy of the Guidelines calculation of his sentence. Rather, he argues that the district court erred in failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>mention the Section 3553(a) factors, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and that his sentence is unreasonable because the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 calculation overstated his criminal history and the value of the intended loss from his crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">We conclude that the district court was not <em>in </em>error inasmuch as it sufficiently considered the Section 3553(a) factors; it need not list them in a \u201crobotic incantation.\u201d <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In imposing the Guidelines sentence, the court also sufficiently considered, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1); (2) \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); and (3) \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6). The sentence reflected these considerations, and defendant points to nothing in the record that constitutes a basis for concluding the sentence to be unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cAs long as the judge is aware of both the statutory requirements and the sentencing range or ranges that are arguably applicable, and nothing in the record indicates misunderstanding about such materials or misperception about their relevance, we will accept that the requisite consideration has occurred.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
