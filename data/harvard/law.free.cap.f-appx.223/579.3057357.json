We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Garro</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number><em>villas v. INS, </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1013 (9th Cir.1998), and we grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The IJ\u2019s findings that Mersropyanan\u2019s testimony was inconsistent regarding whether it was the \u201cprosecutors\u201d or \u201ccustoms agents\u201d who came to her house in May 2001 and how the authorities entered her house on September 20, 2001, do not constitute substantial evidence to support an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 1164, 1172 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that the BIA must explain how discrepancies go to the heart of the claim). Further, Mersropyanan fully explained the discrepancy as to whether she made the video regarding what happened to her brother before or after speaking with the customs agent Sarkisian and, in any event, the testimony was not used to bolster her claim for asylum. <em>See id. </em>at 1171; <em>Garrovillas </em>156 F.3d at 1013. Because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings are not supported by substantial evidence, additional documentary corroboration is not required. <em>See Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 890 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We therefore remand this case to the agency for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b608-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
