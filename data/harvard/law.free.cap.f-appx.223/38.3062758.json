We have carefully considered the parties\u2019 submissions to this Court and the record on appeal. For substantially the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s careful and cogent decision, we conclude (1) that defendant-appellee\u2019s denial of disability benefits was free of legal error and was supported by substantial evidence, and (2) that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over plaintiff-appellant\u2019s claims that defendant-appellee erred in not reopening earlier applications for benefits. The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
