He argues that the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> erred in concluding that he was an armed career criminal, subject to a statutory minimum sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), and by enhancing his advisory guideline range based on his possession of a firearm in connection with another felony, USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (Nov. 2005). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-22\">Miller pled guilty to unlawful possession of the handgun as a previously-convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He was charged after police found a semiautomatic handgun in a stolen van that Miller was driving at the time of a traffic accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-23\">Prior to the instant offense, Miller had sustained three prior felony convictions for theft of a motor vehicle, two for attempted theft of a vehicle, and two for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. Under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u00a7 924(e)(1), a statutory minimum sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment applies if at least three of Miller\u2019s prior convictions are \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>406 F.3d 1074, 1076 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 292, 163 L.Ed.2d 256 (2005). Under our precedent, Miller\u2019s three convictions for auto theft qualify as violent felonies. <em>Id.; United States v. Barbour, </em>395 F.3d 826, 827 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 133, 163 L.Ed.2d 137 (2005); <em>United States v. Sun Bear, </em>307 F.3d 747, 753 (8th Cir. 2002). These decisions are not undermined by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004), which involved a materially different statutory provision, <em>see United States v. McCall, </em>439 F.3d 967, 971 (8th Cir.2006) (en banc); <em>Barbour, </em>395 F.3d at 828, and our precedent, of course, is binding on this panel. The district court thus properly classified Miller as an armed career criminal and correctly applied the mandatory minimum term of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Because Miller was sentenced to the statutory minimum term of imprisonment, a favorable ruling on the question whether he possessed a firearm in connection with another felony could not reduce his sentence, so we need not consider the issue. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-14\">. The Honorable Ann D. Montgomery, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
