Nelson denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Mariano Abzun-Ladino, </em>No. A 70 776 909 (B.I.A. March 31, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 70 776 909 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 23, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). \u201cWhen a factual challenge pertains to a credibility finding made by an IJ and adopted by the BIA, we afford particular deference in applying the substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 73 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Abzun-Ladino failed to meet his burden of establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The IJ reasonably found that Abzun-Ladino\u2019s claim of past persecution based on political opinion was undermined by his testimony\u2019s implausibility and lack of corroboration. In particular, Abzun-Ladino\u2019s uncorroborated testimony about his membership in the Revolutionary Party, which was not mentioned in either of his asylum applications, was insufficient to establish that he was persecuted for his membership in the party. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cIn order to establish persecution \u2018on account of political opinion under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1101(a)(42), an asylum applicant must show that the persecution arises from his or her own political opinion.... The applicant must also show, through direct or circumstantial evidence, that the persecutor\u2019s motive to persecute arises from the applicant\u2019s political belief.\u201d (citing <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992))). In addition, Abzun-Ladino\u2019s failure to obtain corroborating statements or testimony from siblings who live in the United States was properly considered by the IJ. <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 71 (\u201c[Wjhere the circumstances indicate that an applicant has, or with reasonable effort could gain, access to relevant corroborating evidence, his failure to produce such evidence in support of his claim is a factor that may be weighed in considering whether he has satisfied the burden of proof.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Abzun-Ladino failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, particularly in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>substantial changes in country conditions, <em>see Hoxhallari v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 179, 184-87 (2d Cir.2006). The IJ properly found that Abzun-Ladino\u2019s failure to offer any evidence that the guerrillas who allegedly threatened him in 1993 continued to operate in Guatemala, much less that anyone would be aware of Abzun-Ladino\u2019s alleged political opinion were he to return, weighed against Abzun-Ladino\u2019s claim to a well-founded fear of future persecution. The IJ also properly considered the continued residence of Abzun-Ladino\u2019s mother and other relatives, and his two return visits to Guatemala, as evidence that his alleged fear of future persecution was not well-founded. <em>See Matter of A-E-M-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1157 (BIA 1998) (finding that an applicant\u2019s fear of persecution was undermined when his family remained in the native country unharmed).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">With respect to Abzun-Ladino\u2019s request for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT, we lack jurisdiction to review any arguments regarding these claims because they were not exhausted at the administrative level. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Gill v. INS, </em>420 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.2005). Lastly, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the denial of Abzun-Ladino\u2019s request for voluntary departure. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">For the foregoing reasons, Abzun-Ladino\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
