Noraj drove Chan and Lou from Dallas to Odessa in return for a promised payment once the drugs were delivered. Noraj was familiar with ecstasy, having used the drug on four or five occasions, and he was present when Chan gave Lou ten ecstasy pills from a large bag of ecstasy pills during the drive to Odessa. Morever, Noraj used methamphetamine on the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The jury could have inferred from the evidence that Chan possessed ecstasy with the intent to distribute it. <em>See United States v. Gourley, </em>168 F.3d 165, 169 (5th Cir.1999). The jury could have inferred from the evidence that Noraj associated himself with Chan\u2019s drug-trafficking venture and that he participated in the venture and sought to make it succeed by driving Chan and Lou to Odessa in return for the promised payment. <em>See United States v. Pearson, </em>667 F.2d 12, 14 (5th Cir.1982). The evidence was sufficient to support Noraj\u2019s conviction. <em>See United States v. Ortega Reyna, </em>148 F.3d 540, 543 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
