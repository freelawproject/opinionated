O\u2019Reilly claims the District Court erred in dismissing the complaint O\u2019Reilly filed in which she claimed that Rutgers\u2019 insistence on her filing the required Health Care Provider form with a supervisor rather than with a medical professional violated both the FMLA and her right to privacy. The pertinent facts are not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">In its thorough and well reasoned Opinion dated January 19, 2006, the District Court explained why Rutgers was entitled to judgment as a matter of law based upon the undisputed facts. We can add little to that court\u2019s analysis and discussion. Accordingly, we will affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in the aforementioned Opinion of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
