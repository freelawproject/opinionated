Lamb, denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Ze Lin, </em>No. A97 743 641 (B.I.A. July 28, 2006) <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 743 641 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City March 29, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir. 2003). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">As an initial matter, Lin does not argue that he is entitled to CAT relief; rather, in his brief to this Court, he only argues that he is eligible for asylum and withholding of removal. Accordingly, we deem any challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">Here, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. The implausibility of Lin\u2019s lack of knowledge, the lack of corroboration, and other cumulative noted weaknesses in Lin\u2019s testimony provided ample support for the IJ\u2019s determination. Accordingly, because Lin has not presented a credible claim for relief, the agency did not err in denying his asylum and withholding of removal claims. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 78-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
