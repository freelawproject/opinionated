(\u201cBank One\u201d) and others seeking the rescission of their home mortgage on the ground that it violated the Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601, <em>et seq. </em>The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Bank One, and the Oscars appeal that ruling. However, because we find that there is no final order with respect to Homeloan Financial, Inc. (\u201cHome-loan Financial\u201d), another party in the case, we will dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">On February 8, 2002, the Oscars refinanced their home mortgage with WMC Mortgage Corporation. The loan was held by Bank One during the period relevant to this case. Alvin Oscar, who was a physician, subsequently suffered health problems that left him without a job. As a result, the Oscars defaulted on their loan, and Bank One instituted a mortgage foreclosure action in March 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-17\">In April 2004, the Oscars sent a letter to Bank One and others seeking to rescind their loan. In June of that year, Catherine Oscar filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Before that court, the Oscars initiated an adversary proceeding against Bank One, WMC Mortgage Corporation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Homeloan Financial, seeking the rescission of their loan under TILA and statutory damages for Bank One\u2019s failure to rescind. Among other things, they claimed that Bank One had violated TILA by (1) not properly disclosing the variable-rate feature of their loan, and (2) not accurately disclosing the finance charge they would incur in connection with the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-18\">In September 2005, the Oscars\u2019 bankruptcy case was dismissed, and the adversary proceeding was referred to the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. At the time, the Bankruptcy Court had issued a default judgment against Home-loan Financial, but had not yet determined the amount of damages. On February 17, 2006, the District Court entered summary judgment in favor of Bank One on all of the Oscars\u2019 claims. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-20\">Before we may consider the merits of this case, we must satisfy ourselves that we have jurisdiction. Although neither party raises any jurisdictional issue in this case, it is our obligation to raise it sua sponte. <em>Adapt of Philadelphia v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, </em>433 F.3d 353, 361 n. 10 (3d Cir.2006). We conclude that there is no final appealable order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>As we have explained, \u201c[a] judgment is final and appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 if it \u2018ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maritime Elec. Co., Inc. v. United Jersey Bank, </em>959 F.2d 1194, 1208 (3d Cir.1991) (quoting <em>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., </em>485 U.S. 271, 275, 108 S.Ct. 1133, 99 L.Ed.2d 296 (1988) (quoting <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945))). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) provides that \u201cthe court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b). Absent a Rule 54(b) certification, \u201ca judgment is final only if it disposes of all of the claims of all of the parties.\u201d <em>Maritime Elec. Co., Inc., </em>959 F.2d at 1208 (quoting <em>Matter of Vitreous Steel Products Co., </em>911 F.2d 1223, 1230 n. 3 (7th Cir.1990)) (internal quotation marks omitted); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) (\u201c[A]ny order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties .... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Under this rule, \u201ca decision that fixes the parties\u2019 liability but leaves damages unspecified is not final, and the adjudication of liability is not immediately appeal-able.\u201d <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. New A.C. Chevrolet, Inc., </em>263 F.3d 296, 311 n. 3 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. F. &amp; M. Schaefer Brewing Co., </em>356 U.S. 227, 233-34, 78 S.Ct. 674, 2 L.Ed.2d 721 (1958), and <em>Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Benefits Review Bd., </em>535 F.2d 758, 760 (3d Cir.1976) (per curiam)); <em>see also Marshak v. Treadwell, </em>240 F.3d 184, 190 (3d Cir. 2001) (\u201cA finding of liability that does not also specify damages is not a final decision.\u201d). Under these circumstances, we will exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 only when an order \u201cis not technically final but resolves all issues that are not purely ministerial.\u201d <em>Marshak, </em>240 F.3d at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Here, the parties have explained in a letter to this Court that the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a default judgment against Homeloan Financial on September 20, 2004. In that order, the Court scheduled a hearing to determine damages on May 6, 2005. That hearing was continued to June 10, 2005, and again to September 13, 2005. However, it has yet to take place. In the same letter, it is stated that \u201c[cjounsel for appellants has advised that he entered into settlement negotiations with a representative from Homeloan Financial, Inc., but that no settlement agreement was ever signed.\u201d This history reflects the fact that no damages have been assessed against Homeloan Financial, a party to this action, and the difficulty reaching finality on the calculation of damages militates against the conclusion that the issue is \u201cpurely ministerial.\u201d <em>See Marshak, </em>240 F.3d at 191 (concluding that a district court\u2019s order that fixed liability and ordered the defendant \u201cto account to [the plaintiff] for the profits he earned in each year, beginning with the first act of infringement in 1970 and ending with the first day of trial testimony in this case\u201d was not \u201cmerely ministerial\u201d). Thus, at the current time there is no final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we do not have the power to hear the Oscars\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-21\">. The Bankruptcy Court granted a motion for default judgment against WMC Mortgage Corporation, and assessed damages on March 25, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
