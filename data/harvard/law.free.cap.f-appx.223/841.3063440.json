Griffin stipulated at trial that two guns were found in his apartment, and that a gun, bulletproof vest, and ID badge were found in his car, and failed to object to testimony concerning these items. Nonetheless, Griffin now argues that the introduction of this evidence was unnecessarily cumulative and suggestive in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 403. Under these facts, we find no error in the admission of these items into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
