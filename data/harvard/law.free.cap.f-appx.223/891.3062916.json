Holland now appeals, raising a number of evidentiary issues. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">Because most of the evidence adduced in Holland\u2019s case is not in dispute, we recite it only briefly, so as to provide some background. On 30 September 2004, Holland, a convicted felon, pawned a Remington model 742, .308 caliber rifle to a pawn shop in Darien, Georgia. A subsequent investigation by the government determined the following facts: that Holland had prior felony convictions; that the receipt by which the gun was conveyed to the pawn shop identified \u201cMichael A. Holland\u201d as the weapon\u2019s seller and that the document contained his signature; that Holland had been identified as a regular customer at the pawn shop; and that the serial number on the pawn shop receipt matched a Remington model 742 rifle that was subsequently recovered by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">In light of this evidence, in February 2006, Holland was charged in a one-count indictment with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e). After a jury trial, Holland was convicted and was sentenced to 180 months of imprisonment, which is the statutory minimum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">On appeal, Holland argues that the district court made a number of evidentiary errors during the course of his trial. Specifically, Holland argues that: (1) the district court abused its discretion in permitting the government\u2019s expert witness to testify at his trial, where the government failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 16(a)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which governs the disclosure of expert witnesses; (2) the district court abused its discretion by not permitting his witness, pawn shop owner Mike Morey, to testify as to the truthfulness of the shop employee who received the rifle from Holland; and (3) the district court abused its discretion in permitting one of the government\u2019s witness to testify about a phone conversation he had with Holland, because the Best Evidence Rule, Federal Rule of Evidence 1002, required the admission of an original recording of the conversation. We address each of these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b920-15\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-16\">Holland\u2019s appeal is based on number of evidentiary rulings that the district court made, both prior to and during his trial. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, including those involving expert witnesses, for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>459 F.3d 1276, 1295 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>447 F.3d 1327, 1334 (11th Cir.2006). In the context of evidentiary rulings we have defined an abuse of discretion as a situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>\u201cwhere the district court applies the wrong law, follows the wrong procedure, bases its decision on clearly erroneous facts, or commits a clear error in judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>415 F.3d 1257, 1266 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">As a practical matter, however, \u201cthe abuse of discretion standard means that the district court has a range of choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1265. \u201cWe recognize a significant range of choice for the district court on evidentiary issues, which is to say we defer to its decisions to a considerable extent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, as we have stated, \u201c[t]he theme that shapes appellate review in this area is the limited nature of it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Guided by that standard, we now turn to the issues raised by Holland on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">B. <em>District Court\u2019s Decision to Permit Government\u2019s Expert Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Holland first contends that the district court abused its discretion in permitting the government\u2019s expert witness, Tobias (\u201cToby\u201d) Taylor, to testify as an expert at trial. Holland argues that the government failed to comply with the disclosure requirements for expert witnesses set forth in Rule 16(a)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Specifically, he maintains that the government\u2019s pre-trial disclosure concerning expert witness Taylor did not include \u201cthe witness\u2019s opinions\u201d or \u201cthe bases and reasons for those opinions,\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(G), and that therefore the district court abused its discretion in permitting Taylor to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Rule 16(a)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure imposes specific disclosure requirements on the government with regards to expert witnesses that the government plans to utilize at trial. The rule provides, in pertinent part, that, \u201c[a]t the defendant\u2019s request,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the government must give to the defendant a written summary of any [expert] testimony that the government intends to use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201csummary\u201d provided by the government must include the expert witness\u2019s \u201copinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness\u2019s qualifications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The commentary to the Rule further provides that the government\u2019s summary \u201cshould cover not only written and oral reports, tests, reports, and investigations, but any information that might be recognized as a legitimate basis for an opinion....\u201d Id, Advisory Comm. Notes, 1993 Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">Here, the government made its expert witness testimony disclosure on 20 June 2006, approximately one month before trial. In that disclosure, which was titled \u201cGovernment\u2019s Notice Re: Expert Witness Testimony\u201d and which cited Rule 16, the government stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-13\">Toby Taylor is a Special Agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Savannah, Georgia. He will testify as to the origin and interstate nexus of the firearm at issue in this case. His curriculum vitae is attached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-14\">Rl-32. Subsequent to that disclosure, on 5 July 2006, the government sent a supplemental e-mail, entitled \u201cAddendum to Interstate Nexus Witness,\u201d to Holland\u2019s counsel. The e-mail stated: \u201cTaylor will testify that the Remington rifle in question was manufactured in New York State.\u201d Rl-55, Exh. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-15\">Prior to trial, Holland\u2019s counsel filed a written objection to the admission of Taylor as an expert witness. He argued that the government had failed to provide him with either Taylor\u2019s opinion or the basis for that opinion, as was required under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>Rule 16(a)(1)(G). Holland\u2019s counsel contended that, due to the government\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 16, he did not have a sense of what Taylor would testify to, nor was he capable of deciding, prior to trial, whether and how to rebut his testimony. At trial, he renewed this objection. The district court overruled the objection, however, and permitted Taylor to testify. At trial, Taylor essentially testified that the Remington rifle that Holland had pawned had been manufactured in New York.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">On appeal, Holland contends that the government violated Rule 16 with its inadequate disclosure as to its expert witness, that the violation \u201cambush[ed]\u201d him at trial and left him unable to formulate an effective defense, and that, consequently, the district court abused its discretion in permitting Taylor to testify. Br. of Appellant at 11. While we agree that the government\u2019s conduct as to its expert witness fell short of the requirements of Rule 16(a)(1)(G), Holland has failed to establish that the admission of the expert\u2019s testimony actually prejudiced him. Consequently, we cannot find that the violation warrants a reversal of his conviction. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Davis, </em>397 F.3d 173, 178 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201cAlthough we agree with defendants that the government failed to adequately satisfy this requirement [of Rule 16] ... a new trial is only warranted if the [district [c]ourt\u2019s actions [in admitting the testimony] resulted in prejudice to the defendant.\u201d) (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">As to the government\u2019s expert testimony disclosure and the initial question of whether it accorded with the protocol of Rule 16, we conclude that it did not. The Rule makes clear that the government is required to provide a criminal defendant with the both witness\u2019s ultimate opinion and \u201cthe bases and reasons for those opinions,\u201d including \u201cnot only written and oral reports, tests, reports, and investigations, but any information that might be recognized as a legitimate basis for an opinion....\u201d Fed. R.Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(G), Fed. R.Crim. P. 16, Advisory Comm. Notes, 1993 Amendment. In this case, the government provided a terse letter \u2014 which stated only that witness Toby Taylor would testify as to the interstate nexus of the Remington rifle at issue \u2014 followed by an equally terse e-mail stating that Taylor would state that the Rifle was manufactured in New York state. The government failed to provide any additional information as to \u201cthe bases and reasons\u201d for Taylor\u2019s conclusion that the rifle was made in New York; indeed, its disclosure was devoid of any mention of \u201ctests, reports, [ ] investigations,\u201d or \u201cany information that might be recognized as a legitimate basis\u201d for that opinion. Fed. R.Crim. P. 16, Advisory Comm. Notes, 1993 Amendment. In short, we agree that the government\u2019s conduct with respect to this witness disclosure was \u201cnot impressfive],\u201d <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1348 (11th Cir.1999), and that, under the plain language of Rule 16, the government was required to provide a more detailed explanation of Taylor\u2019s anticipated expert witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">That determination, however, does not automatically lead to the conclusion that Holland\u2019s conviction must be reversed. Rather, we have held that where there is a violation of Rule 16 and the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>nonetheless admits the testimony, the defendant must establish that he or she suffered actual prejudice from the district court\u2019s decision to admit the testimony. <em>See id. </em>at 1348 (\u201cViolations of Rule 16 will result in a reversal of conviction only if such a violation prejudices a defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d). <em>See also Davis, </em>397 F.3d at 178 (same); <em>United States v. Watson, </em>669 F.2d 1374, 1384 (11th Cir.1982) (assessing not only whether Rule 16 was complied with, but also whether district court\u2019s choice to admit the testimony \u201cprejudiced the substantial rights of the party seeking the reversal\u201d). We have construed actual prejudice as a showing that the Rule 16 violation affected the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense. <em>See Chastain, </em>198 F.3d at 1348. In other words, the defendant alleging the Rule 16 violation must establish \u201ca likelihood that the verdict would have been different had the government complied with the discovery rules.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>397 F.3d at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Here, although Holland contends that the admission of Taylor\u2019s expert testimony \u201cambush[ed]\u201d him at trial, Br. of Appellant at 11, he has failed to demonstrate how, if at all, the admission of Taylor\u2019s testimony caused him prejudice. Taylor\u2019s testimony at trial was simple and straightforward; he confirmed that the rifle that was pawned in Georgia had been manufactured in New York. Any lay person could have observed this fact, because the gun indicated on its barrel that the weapon was manufactured in New York. While Taylor also testified as to his familiarity with the weapons that had been manufactured by Remington since the company\u2019s inception, he stated that the fact that Holland\u2019s weapon had been made in New York easily could have been discovered through the company\u2019s website. Not only did Taylor testify exactly as the government\u2019s (inadequate) disclosure had indicated that he would, but Holland\u2019s counsel, despite his claimed lack of notice, engaged in a thorough cross-examination of the witness as to where Taylor obtained the (largely commonplace) information on which he based his opinion about the gun\u2019s origins.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Moreover, Holland has not demonstrated on appeal that the government\u2019s failure to fully comply with Rule 16 had an effect on the jury\u2019s verdict, or that it is likely that the \u201cthe verdict would have been different had the government complied with the discovery rules.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>397 F.3d at 178. The sole purpose of Taylor\u2019s testimony was to establish that the weapon at issue had been \u201cshipp[ed],\u201d \u201ctransported],\u201d or \u201cpossess[ed]\u201d in or affecting interstate commerce, or that the weapon had been \u201creeeive[d]\u201d by a felon after being \u201cshipped or transported in interstate commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Put simply, as Holland had pawned the gun in Georgia, Taylor\u2019s testimony needed only to establish that the weapon\u2019s origins had been in a state other than Georgia. He confirmed in his testimony that, since Remington\u2019s inception in 1828, the company had manufactured weapons only in three states \u2014 New York, Connecticut, and Kentucky \u2014 and that, implicitly, <em>any </em>Remington weapon bought, sold, possessed, or received in the state of Georgia would have traveled in interstate commerce. <em>See </em>R2 at 69-71. Although Holland contends that a more thorough disclosure by the government would have allowed him to prepare a rebuttal witness to refute Taylor, we \u201cfail to see how a defense expert could have refuted\u201d what was testimony of an \u201cobvious\u201d nature. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>446 F.3d 870, 876 (8th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted). Because Holland has not established that \u201cthe failure to disclose the existence of this expert adversely affected [his] ability to present a defense,\u201d <em>Chastain, </em>198 F.3d at 1348, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>cannot find that a reversal of his conviction is warranted. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision to admit the testimony of expert Taylor is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">C. <em>District Court\u2019s Decision to Exclude the Testimony of Defense Witness Morey</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Holland next argues that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the testimony of his witness, pawn shop manager Mike Morey, who Holland sought to use to provide reputation and opinion testimony as to the truthfulness of government witness James Riley Allen (\u201cAllen\u201d). The evidence in Holland\u2019s case established that Allen had been an employee at the pawn shop when Holland allegedly pawned the Remington rifle to the store; Allen had completed the paperwork in the transaction, and he subsequently identified Holland as the person who pawned the rifle. The government sought to call Allen to testify as to these facts. However, it was subsequently discovered that Allen had been terminated by the pawn shop for stealing money from the shop. (In fact, Allen later admitted that he had stolen money from the shop.) Pri- or to trial it became clear that Holland wanted to draw attention to this conduct by calling as a witness Mike Morey, the pawn shop\u2019s owner. Holland hoped to use Morey\u2019s testimony about the theft incident so as to cast doubt on Allen\u2019s veracity as a government witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Anticipating this issue, the government filed a motion in limine, seeking to exclude all references to Allen\u2019s act of theft. The government contended that the theft incident constituted a specific instance of misconduct, which Holland was seeking to use \u201cfor the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness\u2019s character for truthfulness.\u201d Fed. R. Ev. 608(b). As such, the government argued that, under the plain language of Rule 608(b), Allen\u2019s specific instance of misconduct could not be asked about during Morey\u2019s direct testimony, although it could \u201cbe inquired into on cross-examination\u201d of Allen. <em>Id. </em>In response, Holland conceded that he could not examine Morey regarding specific instances of misconduct by Allen under Rule 608, but Holland contended that Morey <em>could </em>provide testimony concerning Allen\u2019s \u201ccharacter for truthfulness\u201d in the form of his opinion and his testimony about Allen\u2019s general reputation in the community. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Ev. 608(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">After hearing from the parties on this issue prior to trial, the district court ruled that Holland <em>would </em>be allowed to cross-examine Allen about the specific instance of theft at the store, <em>see </em>Fed. R. Ev. 608(b), but that Holland would not be permitted to call Morey as a witness to testify about Allen\u2019s reputation for truthfulness in the community or to provide an opinion as to Allen\u2019s character for truthfulness. At trial, after Allen had testified about the gun transaction with Holland as part of the government\u2019s case-in-chief, Holland\u2019s counsel cross-examined Allen about the fact that he had stolen money from the pawn shop. Before the jury, Allen admitted to stealing money from the shop, stating that \u201c[tjhose allegations were true.\u201d R2 at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">Holland, however, was not permitted to call Morey as a witness to testify about his opinion of Allen\u2019s character for truthfulness. The district court permitted Holland to make an offer of proof outside of the jury\u2019s presence; in that testimony Morey stated his opinion that witness Allen was not \u201ctoo trustworthy.\u201d R2 at 88. On appeal, Holland contends that the district court\u2019s decision to preclude him from calling Morey as a witness to give his opinion of Allen\u2019s veracity was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>We disagree. Although Federal Rule of Evidence 608(a) permits a party to challenge the credibility of a witness using \u201cevidence in the form of reputation and opinion,\u201d a district court is not <em>required </em>to admit such testimony. <em>See id. </em>(stating that such evidence <em>\u201cmay\u201d </em>be admitted) (emphasis added). In fact, Rule 403 expressly vests the district court with discretion to exclude otherwise admissible testimony in certain circumstances. That Rule provides that, \u201c[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by ... considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">In this case, Holland was permitted to bring out during his cross-examination of Allen the fact that Allen had stolen money from the pawn shop. This testimony was sufficient to draw the jury\u2019s attention to Allen\u2019s character for truthfulness (or lack thereof). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1273 (11th Cir.2004) <em>{en banc) </em>(finding that the district court\u2019s exclusion of certain portions of expert testimony \u201cdid not prevent [the defendant] from introducing key elements of his defense and placing his story before the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Moreover, we agree that calling an additional opinion witness to testify on the question of witness Allen\u2019s honesty would have been redundant. As such, we cannot find that the district court abused its discretion in excluding Morey\u2019s testimony under Rule 403, on the basis that such evidence was cumulative in nature and of negligible probative value. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Haynes, </em>554 F.2d 231, 234 (5th Cir.1977) (finding no abuse of discretion where district court declined to admit more than one witness\u2019s testimony about a DEA agent\u2019s reputation for veracity, since the additional testimony would have been \u201cthe same,\u201d and \u201cthus the testimony would [have been] cumulative\u201d and thus excludable under Rule 403).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Finally, it bears noting that the district court has a large amount of discretion in making evidentiary' rulings as to which witnesses \u2014 and how many \u2014 may be permitted to testify at trial. We have stated that \u201cthe district court is uniquely situated to make nuanced judgments on questions that require the careful balancing of fact-specific concerns like probativeness and prejudice,\u201d and that therefore \u201cwe are loath to disturb the sound exercise of its discretion in these areas.\u201d <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1285 (11th Cir.2003). Our case law has reiterated that a district court\u2019s rulings on \u201ccharacter evidence [under 608] will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Haynes, </em>554 F.2d at 234. <em>See also Watson, </em>669 F.2d at 1382 (\u201c[T]rial courts ... may limit the number of character witnesses a party may call and, absent an abuse of discretion, the district court\u2019s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d) (citation omitted). Here, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s decision to exclude Morey\u2019s opinion testimony about Allen\u2019s honesty \u2014 an issue that had implicitly been raised during the cross-examination of Allen \u2014 constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">D. <em>District Court\u2019s Decision to Permit Lou Valoze\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">Holland also argues that the district court erred in admitting the testimony of Louis Valoze. Valoze, a special agent with the ATF who had initially investigated Holland\u2019s pawn of the Remington rifle to the pawn shop, was called by the government as a witness. Valoze testified that, after discovering that Holland had pawned his rifle, he had a conversation with Holland, via phone, to obtain more detailed information about the transaction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>As Valoze began to testify as to what he and Holland discussed by phone, Holland\u2019s counsel lodged an objection. The basis of the objection was Federal Rule of Evidence 1002, the so-called \u201cBest Evidence Rule.\u201d Specifically, Holland\u2019s counsel argued that because a recording had been made of the phone conversation between Valoze and Holland, the original recording of the conversation was required to be admitted into evidence in lieu of Valoze\u2019s testimony about that conversation. The district court overruled this objection, and allowed Valoze\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Holland argues that this was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">The Best Evidence Rule states that \u201c[t]o prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original writing, recording, or photograph is required.\u201d Fed. R. Ev. 1002. \u201cThe purpose of the Rule is to prevent inaccuracy and fraud when attempting to prove the contents of a writing [or recording].\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>33 F.3d 1507, 1513 (11th Cir.1994). However, the Best Evidence Rule only applies when the <em>contents </em>of the writing or recording are sought to be proved. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Ev. 1002, Advisory Comm. Notes (\u201cApplication of the rule requires a resolution of the question whether the contents are sought to be proved.\u201d); <em>United States v. Howard, </em>953 F.2d 610, 612 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(per curiam </em>) (\u201cThe best evidence rule ... requires the introduction of original recordings, if at all, only when the content of the recording itself is a factual issue relevant to the use.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Here, Valoze\u2019s testimony was not offered to prove the contents of the tape recording; Valoze was testifying as to his recollection of the conversation with Holland, based on his own personal knowledge, and the fact that a corroborative tape recording of that phone conversation was made is inconsequential. Under such circumstances the Best Evidence Rule is not implicated at all. <em>See, e.g., Howard, </em>953 F.2d at 612-13 (\u201cSince the proffered testimony was offered not to prove the content of the tapes, but rather, the content of the conversations, the best evidence rule does not apply and [the witness\u2019s testimonial recollection of the conversations] was properly admitted.\u201d); <em>United States v. Fagan, </em>821 F.2d 1002, 1009 n. 1 (5th Cir. 1987) (\u201cThe prosecution is not trying to show the contents of the tape, but rather the contents of the conversation, and, therefore, as the Advisory Committee notes suggests, the best evidence rule is inapplicable.\u201d); <em>United States v. Rose, </em>590 F.2d 232, 236-37 (7th Cir.1978) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">Because Holland\u2019s objection to the admission of Valoze\u2019s testimony based on the Best Evidence Rule was \u201ccompletely without merit,\u201d <em>see Fagan, </em>821 F.2d at 1009 n. 1, the district court acted properly in admitting Valoze\u2019s testimony about the conversation. We reject his argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Holland has appealed his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm, arguing that the district court committed a number of evidentiary errors both prior to and during his jury trial. Having carefully reviewed the record, we discern no error. Accordingly, Holland\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-9\">. In this case it is not disputed that Holland requested the disclosure of any anticipated expert witness testimony as part of his discovery request to the government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b922-6\">. This testimony was necessary to establish the \"interstate commerce\u201d element of the charged offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (stating that it is unlawful for a person with a prior felony conviction \"to ship or transport in interstate commerce, or possess in or affecting interstate commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate commerce\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b926-5\">. In debating the merits of Holland's objection, the attorney for the government responded that \"the best evidence rule only applies to writings.\u201d R2 at 39. This statement was incorrect, as the Rule itself makes clear that it applies to \"writing[s], recording[s], or photograph[s].\u201d Fed. R. Ev. 1002. <em>See also McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 233 (6th ed. 2006) (stating that the \"common law rule that [the best evidence rule] is not applicable to any evidence other than writings\u201d has been \"abandon[ed]\u201d by the modern incarnation of Rule 1002).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">To the extent that the district court based its overruling of Holland's objection on the flawed legal argument of the government, it acted in error. However, as is discussed subsequently, because we find that the Best Evidence Rule was not implicated at all by Agent Valoze\u2019s testimony, we find that admission of the testimony was proper, irrespective of how the court construed the scope of the Best Evidence Rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
