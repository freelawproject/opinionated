Page, <em>Immigration </em>Judge) denying Mitchell\u2019s application for cancellation of removal under Section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1229b(a). <em>In re Ervington Sinclair Mitchell, </em>No. A39 746 010 (B.I.A. Jan. 10, 2006), <em>aff'g In re Ervington Sinclair Mitchell, </em>No. A39 746 010 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 9, 2005). We lack \u201cjurisdiction to review ... any judgment regarding the granting of relief under ... [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 1229b.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). The IJ\u2019s decision to deny cancellation of removal in this case was such a judgment. <em>See, e.g., Rodriguez v. Gonzales, </em>451 F.3d 60, 62 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">Although we would have jurisdiction to consider a challenge to the constitutionality of the BIA\u2019s decision, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Mitchell\u2019s contention that he was deprived of \u201cdue process,\u201d on the theory that the IJ and the BIA did not properly weigh the equities in his case, amounts to no more than a challenge to the merits of the IJ\u2019s discretionary decision that Mitchell should not be granted relief. Notwithstanding 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), \u201cwe remain deprived of jurisdiction to review decisions under the INA when the petition for review essentially disputes the correctness of an IJ\u2019s fact-finding or the wisdom of his exercise of discretion and raises neither a constitutional claim nor a question of law.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition to review the decision of the BIA is hereby DISMISSED. The pending motion for a stay of deportation is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
