Smith argues that the district court failed to impose a reasonable sentence, and challenges the district court\u2019s consideration of alternative sentences. -</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">In this case, under our precedent, the district court correctly calculated the guideline range, understood that the guidelines were advisory, considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) as well as Smith\u2019s arguments, and ultimately imposed a sentence at the low end of the applicable guideline range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we cannot conclude that his sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-12\">. To the extent Smith argues that the district court erred in basing the sentence upon a drug amount that exceeded the jury\u2019s verdict, this argument is without merit. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we need not address Smith\u2019s arguments concerning the district court's alternative sentencing calculations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
