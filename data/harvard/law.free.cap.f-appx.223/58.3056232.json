Feb. 10, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 959 854 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 31, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-16\">The IJ denied A1 Sarti\u2019s motion to reopen on the ground that A1 Sarti presented \u201cno new evidence ... to this court that would alter its prior determination.\u201d On appeal to the BIA, A1 Sarti argued that he \u201cnever received notice of the date of the rescheduled\u201d Citizenship and Immigration Services interview for which he did not appear, and that the IJ\u2019s consideration of his non-appearance was therefore error.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>A1 Sarti\u2019s petition for review in this Court is based entirely on a new argument: that under <em>In re Velarde-Pacheco, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 253, 256 (B.I.A.2002), his motion to reopen could have been granted because the government\u2019s opposition to the motion was \u201cbased solely upon [a] completely incorrect ... recitation of the facts of the matter,\u201d and was therefore \u201ca nullity.\u201d Al Sarti concedes that this argument was not raised before the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u201cTo preserve a claim, we require \u2018[petitioner to raise <em>issues </em>to the BIA in order to preserve them for judicial review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir. 2004) <em>(per curiam) (quoting Cervantes-Ascencio v. INS, </em>326 F.3d 83, 87 (2d Cir. 2003)) (emphasis in <em>Foster). </em>As the government points out in its brief, A1 Sarti\u2019s sole issue on this appeal was not presented to the BIA. Therefore, the argument \u201cis precluded by his failure to exhaust the claim below.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the petition is hereby DISMISSED in part and DENIED in remaining part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
