On appeal, Patino argues that his sentence is unreasonable because: (1) the district court relied on an impermissible factor, namely, the government\u2019s recommendation to sentence him to the high end of the guideline range; (2) the court did not adequately consider the mitigating factors; and (3) his sentence was greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245-46 (11th Cir.2005). Having reviewed the record in this case, we find no reversible error. Among other considerations, the district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposed a sentence that was reasonable on the facts of this case. The court explained that it imposed a sentence at the high end of the Guidelines range because the sentence \u201csufficiently punish[ed] [Patino] for his criminal conduct.\u201d The court stated that it had considered Patino\u2019s violent background and the need for the sentence to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to promote respect for the law, and to protect the public from further crimes by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">We also reject as meritless Patino\u2019s argument that the district court considered as an impermissible factor its initial belief that the government was going to recommend a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range. Furthermore, we find no merit in Patino\u2019s claim that the district court violated \u00a7 3553(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
