Robert d. SACK, Circuit Judges, Hon. DONALD C. POGUE,<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> Judge.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b98-11\"> The Court was informed on the eve of the scheduled oral argument that Mr. Nash was, for ample reason, unable to attend. At the time of the scheduled argument, the appellees presented no substantive argument. We then took this case under submission on the express understanding that if any one of the three members of the panel was of the view that oral argument would likely be helpful, the panel would reconvene to hear it. Upon further consideration, no member of the panel has asked for such oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b98-19\"> The Honorable Donald C. Pogue, of the United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b98-8\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Defendant-appellant Gristedes Operating Corp. challenges the district court\u2019s denial of its motion to compel production of various documents related to tax payments made in connection with the disposition of settlement proceeds from a Fair Labor Standards Act lawsuit. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">The gist of Gristedes\u2019 appeal is that (1) it faces potential liability for taxes it admits are owed not by it, but rather by a qualified settlement fund established by a settlement agreement between the parties in this action; and (2) as a result, it is entitled to \u201cpolice and supervise\u201d the settlement fund to determine its compliance with the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">Gristedes cites no authority for these propositions or the other assertions made in its brief. And we find no basis in the record upon which to conclude that the district court\u2019s denial of its motion was an abuse of discretion or otherwise erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-15\">Gristedes also appealed a May 16, 2006 Order releasing its final installment payment into the settlement fund from escrow. We note, however, that it has now abandoned that appeal. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 1, n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-16\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
