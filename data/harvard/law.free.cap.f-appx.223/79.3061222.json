Aug. 28, 2003), <em>aff'g </em>No. A78 046 324 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 5, 2002). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-19\">Where (as here) an alien files a timely petition from the affirmance of the removal order, but not from the denial of a subsequent motion, the Court may review only the affirmance. <em>Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 167 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-20\">Lu\u2019s brief to this Court only challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider, and erroneously states that he has never petitioned for review of the decision affirming the removal order. Because Lu\u2019s brief to this Court fails to sufficiently challenge the only BIA decision from which he has appealed, we deem all such arguments waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-21\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
