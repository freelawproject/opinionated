We need not decide the appropriate standard of review for a sentence imposed on revocation of supervised release in the wake of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because Daniel has not shown that his sentence was either unreasonable or plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006). Although it is in excess of the recommended range, Daniel\u2019s sentence is within the statutory maximum sentence that the district court could have imposed. Furthermore, a review of the record demonstrates that the district court considered the relevant sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). Daniel\u2019s sentence was neither unreasonable nor plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b462-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
