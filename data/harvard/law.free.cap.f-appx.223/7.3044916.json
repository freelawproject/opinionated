B\u00e1ez and S\u00e1nchez were indicted for aiding and abetting each other to distribute 220 kilograms of cocaine and for illegally importing cocaine into the United States. B\u00e1ez pled guilty on July 5, 2005. He appeals from his sentence of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment on the ground that the district court erred in denying his request for a downward departure. For the following reasons, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-26\">On appeal, B\u00e1ez argues that the District Court erroneously failed to recognize that the government\u2019s conduct in revealing B\u00e1ez as the source of certain statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>against his co-conspirators, who are charged in a separate action, constituted grounds for a downward departure under either U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Importantly, B\u00e1ez does not challenge the reasonableness of his sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Cf., e.g., United States v. Martinez-Vives, </em>475 F.3d 48, 54 (1st Cir.2007) (\u201cMartinez challenges his 33-month sentence as unreasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">A sentencing court\u2019s denial of a downward departure is discretionary and unreviewable unless the court refuses the request based \u201con a view that it lacks legal authority to consider a departure or ... base[d] ... on an error of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Melendez-Torres, </em>420 F.3d 45, 50 (1st Cir.2005). Neither exception occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">B\u00e1ez contends that certain statements made during the sentencing proceeding demonstrate that the sentencing court believed it lacked authority to grant a downward departure based on the government\u2019s disclosure to B\u00e1ez\u2019s co-conspirators that he was the source of statements made against them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, B\u00e1ez cites the court\u2019s response to defense counsel\u2019s question during the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, if they weren\u2019t using him as a witness, if they weren\u2019t giving him the benefit of cooperation, then we can see no other reason why his statement would be provided to defense counsel [in the co-conspirators\u2019 case] other than to lead defense counsel in that case to induce their clients to plead guilty because this defendant would be available to testify against them; when now the government says that it won\u2019t be using my client as a witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-10\">THE COURT: They don\u2019t say it now. They have always said it from day one. In my case, in this case, they\u2019ve said that they are not going to use it in the other case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Then why was a statement, Your Honor, provided in Criminal Case 05-302?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-12\">THE COURT: You will have to ask the government. But that\u2019s an issue that has nothing to do with sentencing in this case. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">Sentencing Hr\u2019g Tr. 43-44, Apr. 26, 2006. When defense counsel continued to argue that the government was benefitting from the use of B\u00e1ez\u2019s statement in his co-conspirators\u2019 case and that defense counsel had not been told that B\u00e1ez would not be a witness in that case, the court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">I\u2019m sure they have, because [Government Counsel] are not going to come here as officers of the court and state to me that they are not going to be using it. And they have been stating it since day one, since the first time we asked them, and then go around and go over to [the judge in the other case] and defense counsel and tell them we\u2019re going to use [B\u00e1ez] as a witness, because [Government Counsel] would get into a lot of trouble. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Counsel, I told you that was a good faith mistake, that they turned it over. And [Government Counsel] explained it to you and to me a long time ago, that it was a mistake, they are sorry for it, that they should have not done it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 47. Government counsel agreed that the government had informed the judge and defense counsel in the other case that B\u00e1ez would not be a witness in that case and also noted that none of the defendants in the other case had entered guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Taken in context, the sentencing court\u2019s statements show it found that the government\u2019s disclosure of B\u00e1ez\u2019s statement did not constitute misconduct which could affect B\u00e1ez\u2019s sentencing. <em>See United States v. Snyder, </em>235 F.3d 42, 50 n. 8 (1st Cir. 2000) (\u201c[Government misconduct may serve as a ground for departure, but only if relevant in some particular way to sentencing.\u201d). We conclude from our review of the record in this case that the sentencing court was aware of its authority to depart based on government misconduct, but in the exercise of its discretion, the court declined to do so under the circumstances as it found them to be. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s discretionary decision denying B\u00e1ez\u2019s request for a downward departure. <em>Melendez-Torres, </em>420 F.3d at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The appeal is <em>dismissed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\">. Although B\u00e1ez cites \u00a7 3553 in his appellate brief, he makes no developed argument under any provision of that statute, and instead relies on \u00a7 5K2.0. During the sentencing proceeding, however, B\u00e1ez did not raise \u00a7 5K2.0 and instead relied on \u00a7 3553. Generally, arguments not raised below are reviewed only for plain error. <em>United States v. Milkiewicz, </em>470 F.3d 390, 401 (1st Cir.2006). Because we conclude that jurisdiction is lacking to review B\u00e1ez's claim on appeal, the standard of review is not an issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b36-15\">. Defense counsel also argued a variety of other grounds for downward departure that are not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
