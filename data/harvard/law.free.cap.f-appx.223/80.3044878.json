Emanuel was sentenced principally to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment and Anthony to three years\u2019 probation. In this appeal, each defendant has raised discrete challenges to his conviction. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts of the case, its procedural history and the arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-20\">\n<em>Emanuel Scott\u2019s Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b109-21\">Emanuel first challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during an inventory search of his Mercedes after it was impounded at the time of Anthony\u2019s arrest. He claims the impoundment violated the Fourth Amendment primarily because (1) the police did not have probable cause to arrest Anthony for \u201creckless endangerment,\u201d and (2) even if they did, the police should have notified Emanuel to come pick up the vehicle rather than impound it. We agree with the district court that Anthony\u2019s driving the wrong way down a one-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>way street, among other conduct, gave the officers probable cause to arrest him for reckless endangerment. <em>See United States v. Scopo, </em>19 F.3d 777, 780-82 (2d Cir.1994) (holding that an officer who observes a traffic offense has probable cause to stop and arrest the driver). Following the valid arrest, the police were permitted to impound the vehicle and conduct an inventory search pursuant to standard procedures. <em>See United States v. Perea, </em>986 F.2d 633, 643-44 (2d Cir.1993); <em>see also Colorado v. Bertine, </em>479 U.S. 367, 373-74, 107 S.Ct. 738, 93 L.Ed.2d 739 (1987) (holding that the Fourth Amendment does not require police to use less intrusive means than impoundment); <em>People v. Figueroa, </em>6 A.D.3d 720, 776 N.Y.S.2d 574, 575 (2d Dep\u2019t 2004) (holding that, following defendant\u2019s arrest for driving without a license, impoundment of his vehicle was proper).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Second, Emanuel testified in his own defense. On cross-examination, the prosecutor was permitted to ask him about his earlier refusal, during the police investigation, to provide the explanation of his innocence that he had just presented at trial. Emanuel contends that this line of questioning violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination because it encouraged the jury to draw a negative inference from his earlier privileged decision to remain silent. On direct examination, however, Emanuel testified that prior to trial, the police had \u201cnever\u201d asked him to explain his role and that it was only at trial that he \u201cfinally g[o]t to tell what happened that night.\u201d Tr. at 466. Because this testimony \u201copened the door\u201d to the cross-examination questions, the court did not err in permitting the questions and providing a limiting instruction to the jury. <em>See United States v. Matthews, </em>20 F.3d 538, 552 (2d Cir.1994) (\u201c[WJhile comment on a defendant\u2019s silence is usually improper, such comment may be permissible when the defendant, by the impression he has sought to create, has opened the door.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Finally, Emanuel objects to the district court\u2019s omission of a missing witness instruction with respect to the government\u2019s failure to call Robert Jarvis. Emanuel concedes that he did not request this charge below, and so our review is for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). On appeal, Emanuel points to no evidence supporting his speculation that Jarvis was within the government\u2019s control and that it could have located him but chose not to do so. The district court therefore did not commit plain error in failing to include the instruction. <em>See United States v. Mittelstaedt, </em>31 F.3d 1208, 1216 (2d Cir.1994) (\u201cA missing witness charge inviting the jury to infer that the testimony of an uncalled witness might have favored a specified party is appropriate if production of that witness is peculiarly within the power of the other party.\u201d (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">\n<em>Anthony Scott\u2019s Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Reviewing the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Taubman, </em>297 F.3d 161, 164 (2d Cir.2002), we find no merit to Anthony\u2019s argument that we should grant a new trial because the district court improperly excluded an exculpatory statement made by Jarvis to Agent Michael De Martino. We need not determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Jarvis\u2019s statement was nonhearsay that should have been admitted, because even if we assume error for purposes of this appeal, the error was harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 165 (ruling that \u201cany error in the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings was, in the particular circumstances presented, harmless\u201d). Indeed, Anthony claims that the exclusion of Jarvis\u2019s statement affected the verdict by not permitting the jury to hear evidence of De Martino\u2019s state of mind when he decided that Jarvis was no longer a suspect in the crime. But the jury heard testimony from De Martino at trial that he had ruled Jarvis out given that his fingerprints were not on the Western Union documents, that \u201cit wasn\u2019t his vehicle that the [counterfeit] money was found in,\u201d and that the stolen identification cards \u201cwere not found on his person.\u201d It is clear that the exclusion of De Martino\u2019s statement did not have a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d <em>United States v. Dukagjini, </em>326 F.3d 45, 62 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotations omitted), and thus any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Anthony has also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction, conceding that in doing so he \u201cshoulders a heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>393 F.3d 107, 111 (2d Cir.2004). We agree with Anthony that the government\u2019s speculation that he \u201cprobably\u201d recognized them in the alleyway, as well as evidence equally inculpating both Anthony and Emanuel,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> would not, standing alone, support the jury\u2019s finding that he had knowledge that the bills were counterfeit and that he had intent to defraud. The jury was also presented with evidence, however, that (a) the Western Union forms, which were fraudulently made out in Elizabeth Scheessele\u2019s name, were written in Anthony\u2019s handwriting,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (b) Anthony\u2019s fingerprints appeared on the Western Union forms and counterfeit bills. In light of this evidence, a rational trier of fact could have concluded that Anthony was aware the bills were counterfeit and therefore sought to disguise the transfer. <em>See United States v. Autuori, </em>212 F.3d 105, 114 (2d Cir.2000) (holding that a jury verdict must be upheld if a rational trier of fact \u201ccould have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-5\">. Emanuel appears also to contend that the inventory search was not a valid search incident to arrest. However, this argument does not bear on whether the vehicle was appropriately <em>impounded </em>pursuant to the arrest, which provides an independent basis for the search. <em>See Perea, </em>986 F.2d at 643-44 (explaining that searches incident to arrest and inventory searches of impounded property rely on different rationales).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-6\">. For example, the government adduced evidence that the cell phone fraudulently taken out in Elizabeth Scheessele's name repeatedly called the apartment where Anthony lived and Emanuel stayed, and that the Western Union forms were addressed to individuals known to both brothers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\">. The handwriting expert\u2019s testimony that Anthony \"probably\u201d wrote the handwriting on the forms indicated that she was \"virtually certain\u201d that her analysis provided \"strong evidence pointing towards\u201d a match between Anthony\u2019s handwriting and that on the forms. Furthermore, the jury was free to draw conclusions from its own comparison of the handwriting samples. <em>See United States v. Samet, </em>466 F.3d 251, 255 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that a jury is capable of making handwriting comparisons).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
