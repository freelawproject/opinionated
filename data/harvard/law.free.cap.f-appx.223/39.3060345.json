Because the District Court dismissed plaintiff's complaint <em>sua sponte </em>before defendant was served with a complaint, defendant is not a party to this appeal, and joins as <em>amicus curiae. See, e.g., Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 446 n. 2 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b67-18\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b67-19\">Plaintiff-Appellant Norman Saferstein appeals <em>pro se </em>from a judgment of the District Court dismissing his complaint <em>sua sponte </em>for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Plaintiff originally filed suit in New York State court pursuant to New York Civil Practice Law and Rules Article 78 challenging defendant\u2019s administrative determination rejecting plaintiffs claim of losses in the amount of $325,000 caused by his former attorney. The New York Supreme Court dismissed plaintiffs action as time-barred under the statute of limitations. The Appellate Division, Third Department, affirmed, and the New York Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-20\">Plaintiff filed the instant action in District Court on June 18, 2003 alleging that both defendant and New York State courts violated his right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment. In an order dated January 5, 2005, the District Court dismissed plaintiffs action <em>sua sponte </em>pursuant to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, under which the lower federal courts are precluded from reviewing the judicial decisions of state courts. <em>See, e.g., Campbell v. Greisberger, </em>80 F.3d 703, 706-07 (2d Cir.1996). Plaintiff appealed to this Court, and we remanded to the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Court for consideration of whether the District Court\u2019s dismissal was consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005), decided after entry of the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See Saferstein v. Lawyers\u2019 Fund for Client Protection, </em>142 Fed.Appx. 494 (2d Cir.2005). On remand, the District Court again dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine in an order dated February 15, 2006. As an alternative ground for its dismissal, the District Court relied on <em>Davis v. Lansing, </em>851 F.2d 72, 74 (2d Cir.1988) for the principle that \u201cfederal courts have no general power to interfere in state court proceedings or to compel action by state officials.\u201d Defendant appeals the District Court\u2019s February 15, 2006 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">We conclude that petitioner\u2019s arguments are without merit. First, insofar as plaintiff alleges that the New York State courts violated his due process rights by finding his claims untimely, review by a federal district court is squarely foreclosed by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine as articulated most recently in <em>Exxon Mobil Corp., </em>544 U.S. at 291, 125 S.Ct. 1517 (barring district court review where \u201cthe losing party in state court filed suit in federal court after the state proceedings ended, complaining of an injury caused by the state-court judgment and seeking review and rejection of that judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Second, insofar as plaintiff claims that defendant (as opposed to New York State courts) violated his due process rights, we need not address the applicability of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine to the instant case. Instead, plaintiffs claims in this regard are barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>because the state courts\u2019 dismissal of these claims as untimely constituted a \u201cfinal judgment on the merits of an action\u201d which \u201cprecludes the parties ... from re-litigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.\u201d <em>King v. Fox, </em>418 F.3d 121, 131 (2d Cir.2005). <em>See Bray v. N.Y. Life Ins., </em>851 F.2d 60, 63-64 (2d Cir.1988) (holding that a state court decision on statute of limitations grounds is a judgment on the merits that is given preclusive effect in federal courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
