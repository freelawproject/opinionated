In our prior decision, we affirmed Brooks\u2019s convictions of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute an unspecified quantity of oxycodone, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846 (2000), and carrying on the oxycodone conspiracy within 1000 feet of a protected area, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 849 (2000). <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>111 Fed.Appx. 701 (4th Cir.2004). In compliance with the mandate of the Supreme Court that vacated our decision, we vacated Brooks\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>157 Fed.Appx. 603 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">On remand, the district court utilized the same Guidelines <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> calculations that were applied at Brooks\u2019s initial sentencing \u2014 a total offense level of thirty-seven, criminal history category I and a sentencing range of 210 to 262 months. At the resentencing hearing, Brooks continued his objections to the drug quantity determinations but did not state any new or specific objections, and moved for a downward departure based on his medical condition. The district court denied Brooks\u2019s departure motion and sentenced Brooks to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. Brooks timely appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">On appeal, Brooks asserts that the district court failed to comply with this court\u2019s mandate remanding for resentencing. He relies on the following language from the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-17\">The facts that are supported by the verdict of the jury are that Brooks is responsible for an unspecified quantity of oxycodone as part of the conspiracy of which he was a part, and that the conspiracy occurred near a protected area. These facts correspond with an offense level of eight, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>'\u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(17), 2D1.2(a)(l) (2003), and a sentencing range of zero to six months\u2019 imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-18\"><em>Brooks, </em>157 Fed-Appx. at 604-05. He argues that this part of the opinion established the Guidelines offense level and sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>tencing range, and the district court was not permitted to deviate from this range in resentencing him. Brooks does not challenge the accuracy of the district court\u2019s factual findings and resultant Guidelines determinations, but argues that the district court\u2019s sentence on remand is erroneous because it is an unjustified and unreasonable departure from the Guidelines range and is based on facts not found by the jury or admitted by Brooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Contrary to Brooks\u2019s assertions, our opinion did not prescribe the sentencing range to be used on remand. Rather, we only referenced specific offense levels in the context of describing the <em>Booker </em>error. Our specific guidance to the district court was stated as follows: \u201cOn remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>157 Fed.Appx at 605. The district court fully complied with and followed this mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">After <em>Booker, </em>a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir. 2005) . However, in imposing a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable Guidelines range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">The district court explicitly treated the Guidelines as advisory, and sentenced Brooks only after considering the Sentencing Guidelines, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and counsel\u2019s arguments. Although the district court did not recite facts to support each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, the court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345. Thus, the Sixth Amendment error that occurred at the first sentencing was cured by Brooks\u2019s resentencing under an advisory Guidelines scheme. We also conclude that Brooks\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">We therefore affirm Brooks\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-19\"> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
