We must defer to the BIA\u2019s decision unless substantial evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.2005). Where, as here, the BIA has adopted and affirmed the decision of the immigration judge (IJ), this court has jurisdiction to review both decisions. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">First, Maredia seeks review of the determination that he is not entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). He attempts to rely upon reports by the State Department as evidence that violence against Muslims has occurred in India since he departed the country. However, the IJ did not accept the reports into evidence. Maredia offers nothing else in support of his claim, other than conclusory assertions that Muslims are subject to false arrest in India and that the Indian government is willing to assist Hindu extremists in the destruction of Muslim communities. He fails to cite any evidence in the record to support his allegations. Accordingly, he fails to show that the evidence is \u201cso compelling [that his life or freedom would be threatened if he returns to India] that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">Next Maredia seeks review of his claim that he entitled to relief under the CAT. He offers only conclusory, unsupported assertions that the Indian government will instigate or condone his torture if he returns to India. His claim is therefore unavailing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.16(c), 208.18(a)(1); <em>Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">Finally, Maredia asserts that the IJ misstated Indian law governing the arrest and detention of suspects. Assuming arguendo that Maredia is correct, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-18\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
