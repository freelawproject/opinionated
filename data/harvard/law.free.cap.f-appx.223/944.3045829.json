No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Cabezas challenges the sentencing court\u2019s imposition of a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for possessing a pistol and ammunition in connection with another felony offense. Section 2K2.1(b)(5) provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-9\">If the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense; or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense, increase by 4 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">Authorities found a pistol, two extended magazines and 24 rounds of ammunition in a box on the shelf in Cabezas\u2019s closet; also found in that box were 86 grams of marijuana and marijuana seeds, six glass bongs, and 80.7 grams of psilocybin mushrooms. Possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana is a felony offense under Florida law. Another closet in Cabezas\u2019s bedroom was found to house disassembled marijuana-grow equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">At sentencing, Cabezas objected that the four-level U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement should have no application because the firearm was \u201cmerely present\u201d in the same box as the marijuana and \u201cno nexus\u201d had been shown between the firearm and the marijuana found. The district court overruled the objection. With the four-level enhancement, the resulting guidelines range was 27 to 33 months; the 27-month sentence imposed was at the low end of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">Cabezas\u2019s argument on appeal is that for purposes of satisfying the \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement of section 2K2.1(b)(5), the government must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the possession of the weapon facilitated the commission of the other crime. The guidelines provide no definition of the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d in section 2K2.1(b)(5). But, as Cabezas acknowledges, we have addressed this issue in <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">To construe \u201cin connection with\u201d in section 2K2.1 (b)(5), <em>Rhind </em>first reviewed caselaw interpreting the identical phrase in other sentencing guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 695. That review supported an expansive \u2014 not restrictive \u2014 construction of the phrase. <em>Id. </em>And, that expansive interpretation, considered in harmony with the ordinary and natural meaning of the words, supported no requirement that the firearm be shown to facilitate the other felony offense. <em>Id. </em>Instead, \u201cin connection with\u201d \u201cmerely reflects the context of [the defendant\u2019s] possession of the firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citation omitted). So long as the weapon\u2019s presence is not attributable only to accident or mere coincidence, a section 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement is warranted under <em>Rhind </em>if the firearm is available during the commission of the underlying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-16\">Cabezas concedes the \u201cfacilitation\u201d standard he advocates has been rejected by decisions of this Circuit. He advances the issue on appeal so that it may be pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>served in the event <em>Rhind </em>is overruled. <em>Rhind </em>is controlling authority unless or until the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>overrules it. This panel\u2014 as was the district court \u2014 is bound to apply <em>Rhind. See Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe law of this circuit is \u2018emphatic\u2019 that only the Supreme Court or this court sitting en banc can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The district court interpreted correctly the guidelines;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the four-level section 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement appropriately was applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-12\">. Cabezas was sentenced under the 1 November 2005 version of the guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b974-17\">.
