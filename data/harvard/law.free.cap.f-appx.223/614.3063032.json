Because he raises a question of law, we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Passano claims that the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) violated his due process rights by not informing him of the possibility of pre-hearing voluntary departure. To succeed on this claim, Passano must show \u201cthat the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Passano was ineligible for pre-hearing voluntary departure, he cannot make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">Passano was convicted of two aggravated felonies in 1991. Although an IJ found that Passano was deportable in 1994 based on these convictions, the IJ granted Passano\u2019s application for a waiver of deportability under former INA \u00a7 212(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, a section 212(c) waiver of deportability does not waive consideration of prior convictions for future deportation proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-15\">Thus, Passano\u2019s 1991 convictions may be considered for purposes of determining whether he was eligible for pre-hearing voluntary departure. Because his 1991 convictions were for aggravated felonies, Passano was not eligible for pre-hearing voluntary departure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, the IJ\u2019s failure to inform Passano about the possibility of pre-hearing voluntary departure did not violate Passano\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b643-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-12\">. <em>Ibarra-Flores v.
