Pineda-Salas\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that she finds no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning the validity of Pineda-Salas\u2019s guilty plea, the effectiveness of his counsel, and the reasonableness of his sentence. The Government did not file an answering brief. Although informed of his right to file a supplemental brief, Pineda-Salas did not file a brief. We have reviewed the record and, finding no reversible error, affirm Pineda-Salas\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-21\">Appellate counsel first questions whether the district court complied with Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Pineda-Salas\u2019s guilty plea. Because Pineda-Salas did not move to withdraw his guilty plea, we review any challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). We find no plain error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of Pineda-Salas\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-22\">Pineda-Salas also argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). To allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant generally must bring his ineffective assistance claims in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). An exception exists where the record conclusively shows ineffective assistance. <em>Id. </em>Here, the record on its face does not conclusively demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-23\">Pineda-Salas also contests the reasonableness of his sentence. A sentence imposed in a system of advisory sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>guidelines must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005) (internal citation omitted). A sentence imposed within a correctly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">We find Pineda-Salas\u2019s sentence of 198 months\u2019 imprisonment was reasonable because it \u201cwas selected pursuant to a reasoned process in accordance with the law, in which the court did not give excessive weight to any relevant factor, and which effected a fair and just result in light of the relevant facts and law.\u201d <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457. Accordingly, because the sentence was within the advisory guideline range and was determined according to a reasoned process, the challenge to its reasonableness fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Pineda-Salas\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Pineda-Salas, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Pineda-Salas requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Pineda-Salas. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
