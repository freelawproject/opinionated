United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Orduno contends <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such contentions because <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Orduno properly concedes his claim is foreclosed in the light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent; he raises it only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-24\">The district court erred in enhancing Orduno\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) by determining his state conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d. See <em>United States v. Estrada-Mendoza, </em>475 F.3d 258, 259 (2007). Consequently, Orduno\u2019s sentence is vacated and this matter remanded for resentencing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Accordingly, we need <em>not </em>reach his claim, raised for the first time on appeal, that restricting the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1 early-disposition program to certain geographical locations violated his due-process and equal-protection rights. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\n<em>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
