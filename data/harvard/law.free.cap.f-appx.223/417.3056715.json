In April 2005, an Immigration Judge (IJ) ordered Chen removed in absentia. In March 2006, after two prior motions to reopen had been denied, Chen filed her third motion to reopen. The BIA denied Chen\u2019s third motion to reopen as numerically barred pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) and also noted that, even if the motion were not number barred, it would be denied for failing to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Chen argues that the BIA erred in finding that she had not established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and that, as a result, the BIA abused its discretion in finding her motion numerically barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-21\">As Chen previously filed two other motions to reopen, her third motion to reopen was barred by the numerical limitation set forth in \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), which permits only one motion to reopen. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chen\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000). Furthermore, we agree with the BIA\u2019s observation regarding Chen\u2019s failure to establish a viable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Chen\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
