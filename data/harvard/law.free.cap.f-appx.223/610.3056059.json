We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The parties are familiar with the background facts and prior proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">A. <em>District Court\u2019s Evidentiary Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">We review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Beckman, </em>298 F.3d 788, 792 (9th Cir.2002), but only prejudicial error will justify reversal, <em>United States v. Ives, </em>609 F.2d 930, 934 (9th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">1. <em>Medical Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">Wolling presented a defense of diminished capacity, utilizing expert witness testimony from Dr. Bruce Yanofsky. Wolling contends that the district court erred in excluding certain medical records from the evidence. The medical records at issue are the records of Dr. Gordon Zilberman, the psychologist who evaluated Wolling\u2019s competency to stand trial in the present case when Wolling was incarcerated at San Diego\u2019s Metropolitan Correctional Center (\u201cMCC\u201d), and 2003 records from Patton State Hospital (\u201cPatton\u201d), detailing Wolling\u2019s competency evaluation related to pri- or state burglary and theft charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-17\">Although the parties stipulated as to the authenticity of the medical records, the district court excluded them pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 403.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court reasoned that if the jury examined the medical records, the jury might erroneously conclude that Wolling was previously arrested and charged with theft, but not convicted based upon an evaluation of incompetency to stand trial. Wolling was in fact restored to competency and convicted of the prior theft charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-18\">Dr. Yanofsky testified that in formulating his opinions about Wolling\u2019s diminished capacity he relied upon the Patton records. Dr. Yanofsky explained to the jury the medical diagnoses contained in those records. Dr. Yanofsky also testified that in formulating his opinion he relied upon the medical report of Dr. Zilberman, and he explained Dr. Zilberman\u2019s medical diagnosis to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-19\">We review exclusion of evidence under Rule 403 for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Etsitty, </em>130 F.3d 420, 423 (9th Cir.1997). The district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the medical records. The competency evaluations potentially could confuse or mislead the jury as to Wolling\u2019s competency to stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>trial, which is not at issue. Additionally, and importantly, Wolling\u2019s medical history and his doctors\u2019 diagnoses in the medical reports were fully and adequately explained to the jury through the testimony of Dr. Yanofsky. Viewed as a whole, the evidence was more than sufficient for a jury to fully consider Wolling\u2019s diminished capacity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">During jury deliberations, the jury sent a note asking whether it could review \u201cthe psychological reports from Patton and MCC.\u201d The district court responded to the jury: \u201cThe reports were referenced by Dr. Yanofsky only to show the type of information he relied upon to form his opinions. The reports themselves were not received into evidence, and, therefore, are not available to the jury.\u201d The court\u2019s response to the jury was not in error. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 703; <em>United States v. Sims, </em>514 F.2d 147, 149 (9th Cir.1975) (explaining that Rule 703 permits the admission of otherwise inadmissible evidence upon which an expert relies for the purpose of explaining the expert\u2019s opinion, but the evidence is not admissible as substantive evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">2. <em>Introduction of Post-Arrest Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Wolling challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress, arguing that his statement \u201cI could talk some\u201d constituted an ambiguous invocation of his right to silence, requiring further clarification. Wolling argues that the investigating agent did not further clarify his statement, therefore Wolling\u2019s subsequent written waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s determination that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights under the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Fouche, </em>833 F.2d 1284, 1286 (9th Cir.1987). The district court\u2019s conclusion that Wolling voluntarily and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights is not clearly erroneous. The record does not support the contention that the officers failed to clarify an equivocal request to remain silent. Nor does the record suggest that Wolling was interrogated in violation of his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">3. <em>Evidence of Pregnancy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">Wolling argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting testimony about the smuggled alien\u2019s pregnancy because the testimony\u2019s prejudicial value outweighed its relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">The testimony regarding the alien\u2019s pregnancy was not unduly prejudicial. Its relevance to Wolling\u2019s specific intent outweighs the potential prejudice. <em>See United States v. Schemenauer, </em>394 F.3d 746, 752 (9th Cir.2005) (explaining that evidence of conditions requiring \u201cexpeditious retrieval\u201d was relevant to knowledge element of \u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">4. <em>Limitations on Defense Expert\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-16\">Wolling argues that the district court erred in precluding Dr. Yanofsky from testifying to his opinion that Wolling \u201cwas guided by his delusional thinking on the day of his arrest.\u201d The district court correctly articulated the applicable admissibility standard under Federal Rule of Evidence 704(b) of an expert witness testifying with respect to the mental state or condition of a defendant in a criminal case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-17\">The district court correctly limited Dr. Yanofsky from testifying that Wolling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>\u201cwas guided by\u201d his delusions on the day of his arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such testimony would constitute an opinion as to Wolling\u2019s intent, which is a question for the trier of fact under Rule 704(b). Moreover, Dr. Yanofsky testified, without objection, that Wolling was \u201csuffering from that delusional disorder on the day of his arrest.\u201d Any issues of Wolling\u2019s diminished capacity were fairly presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">B. <em>Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Wolling argues that the district court erroneously denied a downward departure for diminished mental capacity, \u00a7 5K2.13 of the Sentencing Guidelines. Wolling argues that because the court stated, \u201cI agree with the jurors\u2019 decision [rejecting a diminished capacity defense],\u201d the court erroneously applied a \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard of proof for the departure, rather than a preponderance standard. This argument is unsupported by the record. The district court stated that the \u201cevidence was insufficient\u201d to warrant a downward departure. The record fails to support the contention that the district court applied an erroneously high standard of proof in denying the downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Wolling argues that the district court erred in its \u201cmere mention\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), without explicitly addressing the factors listed in that section. We have previously rejected this argument. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Argueta, </em>447 F.3d 1167, 1171 (9th Cir.2006) (explaining that the district court is not required to discuss all of the section 3553 factors). Wolling also argues that the district court gave the guidelines \u201cexaggerated weight\u201d when it stated it was utilizing \u201cthe presumptive midrange.\u201d The sentencing record of the district court in this case provides \u201csufficiently specific language to allow appellate review.\u201d <em>United States v. Menyweather, </em>447 F.3d 625, 635 (9th Cir.2006) (internal citation omitted). The record reveals that the district court was well-informed as to its discretion and the relevant law, and imposed a sentence which, it its estimation, was reasonable and appropriate. No sentencing error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b640-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
