O\u2019Malley, Office of United States Attorney, Newark, NJ, for United States of America.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b222-17\">Before: RENDELL, GARTH and COWEN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b222-19\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"AD5\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b222-20\">Tosin Adegbuji appeals the District Court\u2019s order granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. The procedural history of this ease and the details of appellant\u2019s claims are well-known to the parties, set forth in the District Court\u2019s opinions, and need not be discussed at length. Adegbuji filed a complaint alleging several claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). By order entered March 2, 2005, the District Court dismissed his claims of abuse of process, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and prolonged detention for failure to state a claim. The government filed a motion to dismiss the remaining claims of assault, battery, and excessive force for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because Adegbuji failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The District Court granted the motion to dismiss, and Adegbuji filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-21\">On appeal, Adegbuji challenges his removal proceedings as well as his detention during them. He argues that the government maliciously prosecuted him, falsely imprisoned him, and abused a legitimate process. He also contends that the District Court erred in dismissing his claims of assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-22\">This Court has addressed Adegbuji\u2019s allegations concerning his removal proceedings in prior opinions. In <em>Adegubji v. INS, </em>C.A. No. 03-2848, we noted that \u201c[bjecause Adegbuji is inadmissible for having committed a crime involving moral turpitude, detention while he was in removal proceedings was mandatory under \u00a7 236(c)(1)(A).\u201d In <em>Adegbuji v. Fifteen Immigration and Customs Enforcement </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number><em>Agents, </em>169 Fed.Appx. 733 (3d Cir.2006) we informed Adegbuji that Sections 1252(g) and 1252(a)(2)(A) of the REAL ID Act bar judicial review of his claims for damages \u201carising out of the decision to commence removal proceedings\u201d or \u201carising from or relating to the implementation of or operation of an order of removal.\u201d We also noted that we would decline to review claims challenging his removal because Adegbuji has raised them in a Petition for Review that is currently pending in this Court. <em>See Adegbuji v. Atty. Gen., </em>C.A. No. 05-3894. We will not review these claims here for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Adegbuji\u2019s claims of assault, battery, and excessive force for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Gould Electronics Inc. v. United States, </em>220 F.3d 169, 176 (3d Cir.2000). We agree with the District Court that it lacked jurisdiction over these claims because Adegbuji failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
