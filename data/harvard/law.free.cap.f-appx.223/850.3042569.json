On appeal, Boatwright argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary and exceeds the government\u2019s recommended sentence. Because we find the district court\u2019s sentence reasonable, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>In particular, Boatwright argues that the district court\u2019s sentence is unreasonable because it fails to take into consideration (1) his good employment history; (2) that he is caring for six minor children; (3) that he has no prior felony convictions; and (4) that he did not use the Department of Housing and Urban Development-funded housing assistance payments to purchase luxury items, but to provide his family with the basic necessities of life. Moreover, Boatwright contends that the district court, in imposing its sentence, should have considered his statement at the sentencing hearing as to why the offense was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">We review sentences imposed under the <em>post-Booker </em>advisory Guideline scheme for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-45 (11th Cir. 2005); <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-63, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (holding that appellate courts review sentences for unreasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors). Following the <em>Booker </em>decision, the district court first must correctly calculate the range provided by the sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Next, the district court must consider the factors identified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to determine a reasonable sentence. <em>Id. </em>We have held that once the district court has correctly calculated the advisory Guideline range, it may then impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as it is reasonable. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Our review for reasonableness is deferential. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201cWe must evaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a),\u201d and in evaluating a sentence for reasonableness, \u201cwe recognize that there is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-8\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 786; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We also have noted that \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guideline range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">In <em>United States v. Scott, </em>we held that a district court\u2019s statement that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the defendant\u2019s arguments about those factors is sufficient in post <em>-Booker </em>sentences to indicate that it considered the factors. 426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005). We further held \u201cthat nothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329. Moreover, we concluded that the defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable because the district court accurately calculated the guideline range and the defendant\u2019s sentence at the low end of the range reflected the court\u2019s consideration of his evidence in mitigation. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">In this case, the district court\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>rectly calculated the applicable guideline range and adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Before imposing the sentence, the district court expressly stated that it had considered the statements of all parties, the presentence investigation report, and the statutory factors. The court specifically considered the mitigating factors that Boatwright offered. Although the district court did not explicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor, it was not required to do so. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30. Finally, the district court\u2019s sentence of three years\u2019 probation with a special condition of six months\u2019 home detention was within the Guideline range and did not exceed the statutory maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Based on our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm Boat-wright\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
