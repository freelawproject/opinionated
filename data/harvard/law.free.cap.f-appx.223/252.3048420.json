Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Yiferu fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Yiferu cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). In addition, we uphold the IJ\u2019s finding that Yiferu failed to establish that it was more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to Ethiopia. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
