Sprizzo, <em>Judge), </em>sentencing him principally to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment upon his plea of guilty to one count of conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 846, and three counts of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute various amounts of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 812, 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the balance of facts, procedural history, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">We conclude that the District Court\u2019s sentence was procedurally proper. The District Court did not give the Sentencing Guidelines a presumption of reasonableness, but merely used them as a starting point against which it considered all the other relevant sentencing factors \u2014 an analytical sequence that we have expressly approved. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, 443 </em>F.3d <em>19, 34 </em>n. 11 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cIt was not error for Judge Cote to employ the Guidelines range as a starting point and then to determine whether the arguments presented pursuant to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors warranted \u2018lightening]\u2019 of or fashioning of \u2018an alteration to,\u2019 the advisory Guidelines sentence (or, in other words, imposing a non-Guidelines sentence).\u201d) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">We also conclude that the District Court properly rejected Diaz\u2019s claim that it \u201chad the authority to reject the 100:1 crack/powder cocaine ratio.\u201d <em>See United States v. Castillo, </em>460 F.3d 337 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">For those reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
