We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>Leisek v. Brightwood Corp., </em>278 F.3d 895, 898 (9th Cir.2002), and determination that an action is barred by res judicata, <em>Manufactured Home Cmtys. Inc. v. City of San Jose, </em>420 F.3d 1022, 1025 (9th Cir.2005). We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to not consider evidence presented for the first time in objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. <em>Brown v. Roe, </em>279 F.3d 742, 744 (9th Cir.2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-17\">Even if the USERRA applied to De Cuir\u2019s 1990 failure to hire claim, the district court properly granted summary judgment because De Cuir failed to create a triable issue as to whether his veteran status was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in defendants\u2019 action. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(c)(1); <em>Leisek, </em>278 F.3d at 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-18\">The district court also properly concluded that De Cuir\u2019s retaliation claim based on his citation and subsequent prosecution in 1996 for fare evasion aboard a Metrolink train was barred by res judica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>ta, because he had previously brought a federal action based on the same \u201ctransactional nucleus of facts.\u201d <em>See Tahoe-Sierra Pres. Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, </em>322 F.3d 1064, 1077-81 (9th Cir.2003) (discussing the three elements of a res judicata defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to consider evidence De Cuir presented for the first time in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report recommending summary judgment for defendants. <em>See United States v. Howell, </em>231 F.3d 615, 621 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201ca district court has discretion, but is not required, to consider evidence presented for the first time in a party\u2019s objection to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b668-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
