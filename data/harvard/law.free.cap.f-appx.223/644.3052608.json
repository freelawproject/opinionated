We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\n<em>1. Jury Instructions.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">There was no error in Instruction 3 or 3A. Idaho recognizes the theory of substantial performance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court adequately distinguished this term and the term substantial completion in the contract. St. Clair did not need to substantially complete by the date set in the contract in order to claim substantial performance because the contract provided for the possibility of extensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">There was no error in Instruction 22. Idaho law approves the giving of a futility instruction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Given the evidence of the City\u2019s decision that it would not allow any further requests for time extensions, it was appropriate to instruct the jury on futility where St. Clair was in part arguing that it was futile to ask for any further extensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">At trial, the City did not object to Instruction 7A based on its lack of guidance as to how to calculate damages. And Instruction 7A, which is patterned on the model Idaho instructions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is not plainly erroneous;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it provides sufficient guidance to find damages consistent with Idaho law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-15\">Even if one of these instructions were erroneous, the error would be harmless. Which party breached, and how much damage it caused, was fairly put before the jury and the instruction as a whole fairly informed the jury how to decide the matter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-16\">\n<em>2. Damages.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-17\">The evidence was sufficient to justify the jury\u2019s award. The testimony of Randall St. Clair, together with the documentary evidence of the company\u2019s financial position before, during, and after the events at issue, showed a close enough connection between the City\u2019s termination of the contract, St. Clair\u2019s loss of bonding ability, and the economic losses subsequently suffered to justify the jury in finding that St. Clair\u2019s losses were proximately caused by the City\u2019s breach. The same evidence also justified the jury in finding the business devastation damages proved with reasonable certainty. This is all Idaho law requires.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-18\">\n<em>3. Attorney\u2019s Fees.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-19\">The court found that the hours expended, and the hourly rate charged, by the prevailing parties\u2019 attorneys were reasonable. This finding was sufficient to justify the lodestar award.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>judge\u2019s decision to make the City principally liable for Wausau\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee (St. Clair only pays if the City cannot) was also reasonable given the roles of each party.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b673-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
