The court reasoned that Owens-Bey failed to comply with its prior order directing him to file a copy of the right-to-sue letter issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and either to pay the filing fee or to apply to proceed in forma pauperis. Our review of the record discloses that Owens-Bey timely filed a copy of the right-to-sue letter and filed an affidavit declaring he was unemployed and owned no property or automobiles. Because Owens-Bey complied with the district court\u2019s prior order, we vacate the court\u2019s order dismissing the action without prejudice and remand for further proceedings. We grant Owens-Bey leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
