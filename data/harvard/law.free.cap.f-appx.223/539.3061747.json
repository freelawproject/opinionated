In a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel argues that the district court miscalculated Zastoupil\u2019s total offense level under the Guidelines, and Zastoupil asserts other claims in pro se submissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Following de novo review of the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines, <em>see United States v. Kiel, </em>454 F.3d 819, 822 (8th Cir.2006), we find that the court correctly increased Zastoupil\u2019s adjusted offense level of 35 by 4 levels to account for the two offenses against each of the two victims, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(l), \u00a7 3D1.2(d) (excluding \u00a7 2G2.1 offenses from grouping of closely related counts), \u00a7 3D1.4(a) (to calculate combined offense level, count group with highest offense level as one unit, and count one additional unit for each group that is equally serious or from 1 to 4 levels less serious; for 3^-5 units, increase offense level by 4 levels); <em>Kiel, </em>454 F.3d at 822-23 (upholding multiple-count adjustment under \u00a7 3D1.4 and explaining that under \u00a7 2G2.1, concerning sexual exploitation of minors by production of sexually explicit visual material, Chapter 3 Part D provisions concerning multiple counts shall be applied as if exploitation of each minor had been contained in separate count of conviction, and multiple counts involving exploitation of multiple minors are not to be grouped together under \u00a7 3D1.2). Given Zastoupil\u2019s total offense level of 39, his Category V criminal history, and the resulting Guidelines imprisonment range of 360 months to life, with a statutory maximum prison term of 50 years as to Count 1, and 20 years as to Count 2, the district court sentenced Zastoupil to concurrent terms of 50 years in prison and 3 years of supervised release on Count 1, and 20 years in prison and 3 years of supervised release on Count 2. In so doing, the court found that the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) justified a sentence at the statutory maximum available under federal law, in part based on the disturbing offense conduct and the statement of an evaluating doctor that Zastoupil continued to demonstrate cognitive distortions and irrational thought patterns, and that he presented a high level of serious risk to the community. We conclude that Zastoupil\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-64, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Turning to the additional arguments raised in Zastoupil\u2019s pro se supplemental filings, we note that claims related to counsel\u2019s performance before and during trial should be asserted in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, where the record can be properly developed. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>330 F.3d 1068, 1069 (8th Cir. 2003). In addition, we reject Zastoupil\u2019s argument that he was sentenced beyond the statutory maximum, which he based in part on his contention that his prior state conviction for corruption of a minor did not qualify as a prior sexual-exploitation conviction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2243(a) (sexual abuse of minor includes knowingly engaging in sexual act with person 12-15 years old), 2251(e), 2252(b)(2). Further, Zastoupil\u2019s arguments concerning the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment and, relatedly, the criminal court\u2019s jurisdiction over him are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">We have reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\">. The Honorable Daniel L. Hovland, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of North Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
