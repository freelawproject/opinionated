R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Pe\u00f1a\u2019s motion to cancel oral argument is denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b617-25\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-26\">Angel Pe\u00f1a appeals the sentence imposed after he pleaded guilty to violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846, conspiring to distribute methamphetamine. Pe\u00f1a received the mandatory minimum ten-year sentence provided by \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) because the conspiracy related to possession of more than 50 grams of methamphetamine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pe\u00f1a argues that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>court erred in sentencing him because (1) he did not admit that the amount of drugs was more than 50 grams, (2) the court should have treated the statutory minimum as advisory, and (3) the court failed to consider factors required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Pe\u00f1a\u2019s assertion that he never admitted to the amount of drugs involved is not supported by the record. Although Pe\u00f1a initially stated that he did not know how much methamphetamine there was, when the court asked if \u201cthe conspiracy related to 298 grams of ... methamphetamine,\u201d Pe\u00f1a responded Wes.\u201d Because the conspiracy related to more than 50 grams of methamphetamine, by Pe\u00f1a\u2019s admission, the court properly determined the minimum sentence to be ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Pe\u00f1a next argues that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), gave courts discretion to depart from mandatory minimum sentences. However, this argument is precluded by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Dare, </em>425 F.3d 634 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Booker </em>did not affect mandatory minimum sentences).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Finally, Pe\u00f1a contends that the court failed to consider factors required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We have held that sentencing courts need only consider relevant \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>462 F.3d 1067, 1071 (9th Cir.2006). Where, as here, the prosecution requests no higher sentence than the statutory minimum and the district court imposes the minimum, there is no need for the court to address \u00a7 3553(a) factors because they are not relevant to determining the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b617-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-28\">.
