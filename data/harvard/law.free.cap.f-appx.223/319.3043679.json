Pasco and Brian K. Pasco, by and through their grandmother and next friend, Beverly A. Pasco (collectively, \u201cAppellants\u201d), appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellant Brad Knoblauch on their claim that Knoblauch intentionally caused the death of Roy G. Pasco (\u201cPasco\u201d) in the course of a high speed car chase, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. We find that the record taken as a whole raises an issue as to Knoblauch\u2019s intent and reverse and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-17\">Knoblauch at all pertinent times was a police officer for Holly Springs, Mississippi. While on patrol around 3:00 a.m. on April 29, 2000, Knoblauch began following Pasco. When Pasco ran a stop sign, Knoblauch attempted to make a stop. Although Pasco initially pulled over, when Knoblauch left his patrol car and began to walk over to Pasco\u2019s car, Pasco sped off. Knoblauch returned to his car and began a high speed chase. Knoblauch reported this to his dispatcher at 3:18 a.m. At 3:19 a.m., Knoblauch was instructed to termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>nate the pursuit. At this point, the two sides\u2019 accounts of events diverge.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Knoblauch claims that: (1) he terminated pursuit as instructed; (2) he turned around and headed back towards town; (3) he encountered Jason Martin, another Holly Springs officer who had headed out to assist Knoblauch; (4) after conferring with Martin, Knoblauch again reversed direction and headed back away from Holly Springs looking for a cross street to pinpoint their location for the county sheriffs department, which was to continue the pursuit; (5) he drove down some long driveways to see if Pasco had pulled into one; (6) he noticed gravel in the road, causing him to look more closely, at which point he noticed Pasco\u2019s car at the bottom of a ravine alongside the road; and (7) at 3:23 a.m., he notified dispatch of his discovery. Appellants claim that Knoblauch did not break off the pursuit as instructed, intentionally struck Pasco\u2019s car from behind, forcing his car off the road and down into the ravine, killing Pasco.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In support of their position, Appellants offered the expert testimony of Lamon Griggs, an accident reconstruction expert. Griggs offered the following opinions (and/or observations): (1) it would have been physically impossible for Knoblauch to have seen Pasco\u2019s car at the bottom of the embankment from inside Knoblauch\u2019s patrol car, as Knoblauch claimed; (2) \u201cyaw marks,\u201d or scuffs on the pavement, indicate that Pasco\u2019s car left the road in a side-slip position, traveling from right to left; (3) Pasco\u2019s car did not vault over the side of the road at high speed, but left the road at a slow enough speed to track down the embankment; (4) Pasco\u2019s rear bumper bore a scratch and paint had been rubbed off; (5) Pasco\u2019s car did not travel backwards at any time as it headed down the embankment; and (6) Pasco\u2019s car was bumped from behind, forcing it off the road and into the ravine. The district court excluded the last opinion under <em>Daubert,</em><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but permitted all of the others.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">Appellants also offered additional summary judgment proof establishing: (1) there was no missing paint or scratch on Pasco\u2019s car\u2019s bumper the day before the incident; (2) Knoblauch\u2019s patrol car was in the police department maintenance bay the morning after the incident; and (3) Knoblauch told Pasco\u2019s sister that he did not terminate the pursuit as instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">The district court found that Appellants had not raised any fact issue regarding Knoblauch\u2019s intent, a necessary element of their Fourth Amendment claim:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cthat the vehicle could not have been found without personal knowledge of where the vehicle went does not prove that Knoblauch intentionally bumped Pasco\u2019s car and caused the accident that killed him.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the customary standard of resolving all disputes in the record in favor of Appellants, and giving the Appellants the benefit of all reasonable inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>from the record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">We agree with the district court\u2019s apparent conclusion that the summary judgment record establishes<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that Knoblauch\u2019s account of how he found Pasco\u2019s car was false, and that he had personal knowledge of where the vehicle went. We also hold there to be sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer that Knoblauch\u2019s patrol car bumped Pasco\u2019s car and sent him down the embankment. This inference is supported by Griggs\u2019 subsidiary opinions, even in the absence of his ultimate opinion, together with Appellants\u2019 additional evidence of contact, and the fact that the jury can infer guilty knowledge from Knoblauch\u2019s fabricated story of how he found the car.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">We are left with the question of whether the district court properly granted summary judgment for Knoblauch because of the lack of evidence of intent. We conclude that the better course is for a jury to resolve the question of Knoblauch\u2019s intent after hearing all of the evidence, rather than for the court to decide it summarily.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> First, \u201c[t]he award of summary judgment to the defense in deadly force cases may be made only with <em>particular care where the officer defendant is the only witness left alive to </em>testify.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, \u201csummary judgment is rarely proper when an issue of intent is involved.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Finally, Knoblauch\u2019s fabrication is itself \u201caffirmative evidence of guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b348-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
