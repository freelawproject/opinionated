Tummins pleaded guilty in 2001 to possession of materials to manufacture methamphetamine, and he was sentenced to probation for a term of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">On November 10, 2004, Tummins\u2019s probation was revoked, and he was remanded that day to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) for 15 months of incarceration. Tummins also pleaded guilty to methamphetamine possession in a separate criminal proceeding, and on April 6, 2005, he was sentenced on that charge to be imprisoned for a term of 60 months to run concurrent to the 15-month sentence for probation revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The BOP determined that his 60-month sentence did not begin until it was imposed on April 6, 2005, and that the four months and 27 days he had already served since November 10, 2004, would not reduce the 60-month period of imprisonment. Tummins argues that the start of his 60-month sentence was retroactive to November 10, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">This court \u201creview[s] a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition on the pleadings de novo.\u201d <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). To obtain federal habeas relief, a petitioner must show a violation of his federal rights. \u00a7\u2022 2241(c)(3). Tummins has failed to come forward with any evidence showing that the district court intended for his 60-month sentence to have begun retroactively on November 10, 2004. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
