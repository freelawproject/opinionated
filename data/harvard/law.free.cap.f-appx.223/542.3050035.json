Williams, </em>429 F.3d 767 (8th Cir.2005). His counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and moved to withdraw, and Caldwell has filed a pro se supplemental brief. We conclude that Caldwell\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel should be raised, if at all, in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. RamirezHernandez, </em>449 F.3d 824, 827 (8th Cir. 2006). The challenges to his convictions and sentence that he attempts to raise in this appeal after remand had to be raised in his first appeal and are beyond the scope of this court\u2019s remand. <em>See United States v. Walterman, </em>408 F.3d 1084, 1085-86 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-23\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and finding no non-frivolous issues, we affirm the judgment of the district court, grant counsel\u2019s withdrawal motion, and deny as moot Caldwell\u2019s motion for the appointment of new counsel on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-19\">.
