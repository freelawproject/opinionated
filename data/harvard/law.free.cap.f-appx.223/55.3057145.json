Feb. 18, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>A 31 312 326 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 14, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-17\">We reject Rodriguez-Brito\u2019s contention that his due process rights were violated by the IJ\u2019s failure to accept documents that were untimely filed. The BIA considered these documents and concluded that they would not \u201cchange the result in these proceedings.\u201d Contrary to Rodriguez-Brito\u2019s argument, this was not improper fact-finding by the BIA. The BIA considered the late submissions in order to rule on Rodriguez-Brito\u2019s alternative request for remand. <em>See Sanusi v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 193, 201 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam) (citing <em>Matter of Coelho, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 464, 473 (B.I.A.1992) (\u201c[T]he Board ordinarily will not consider a discretionary grant of a motion to remand unless the moving party meets a \u2018heavy burden\u2019 and presents evidence of such a nature that the Board is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>satisfied that if proceedings before the immigration judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence offered would likely change the result in the case.\u201d)). Accordingly, the BIA did not commit legal error, and we lack jurisdiction to examine the correctness of the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the \u00a7 212(c) factors did not warrant a grant of discretionary relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>1252(a)(2)(B)(i)</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>;De La Vega v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 141, 144, 146-47 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review \u201cthe BIA\u2019s discretionary determinations concerning whether to grant cancellation of removal,\u201d and that \u201c[sjection 106 of the REAL ID Act does not override the jurisdiction-denying provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u201d unless the petitioner raises a \u201cconstitutional claim [ ] or question[ ] of law\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)); <em>see also Wallace v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 135, 140-41 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED IN PART and DISMISSED IN PART. Our review having been completed, the pending motion for stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-6\">. Prior to the REAL ID Act of 2005, this case would have been governed by IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules because Rodriguez-Brito was in deportation proceedings before April 1, 1997, and the final order of deportation was entered more than 30 days after September 30, 1996. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-626 (1996); <em>Mariuta v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 361, 363 n. 3 (2d Cir.2005). Section 106(d) of the REAL ID Act, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 311 (2005), requires that this Court treat the case as if it had been filed under the IIRIRA\u2019s permanent rules (as amended by the REAL ID Act). <em>See Jun Min Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 172, 175 (2d Cir.2006). We note, however, that even under IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules, we would lack jurisdiction to review \"any discretionary decision under section 212(c).\u201d IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
