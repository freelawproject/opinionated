Stafford appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging defendants violated his constitutional rights during his participation in sex offender treatment as a condition of his parole. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1195 (9th Cir.1998) (order), and we may affirm for any reason supported by the record, <em>Tanaka v. Univ. of S. Cal., </em>252 F.3d 1059, 1062 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The district court did not err in dismissing this action, because the majority of the claims were or could have been litigated in Stafford\u2019s prior federal action, <em>Stafford v. Cassidy, </em>no. 04-cv-03078-HO (D.Oregon). <em>See Tahoe Sierra Pres. Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Reg\u2019l Planning Agency, </em>322 F.3d 1064, 1077 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cRes judicata is applicable whenever there is (1) an identity of claims, (2) a final judgment on the merits, and (3) privity between parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The district court also properly concluded Stafford failed to state a claim against remaining defendant Milligan for failing to recognize Stafford had been convicted for activity that did not amount to a crime, because a judgment in Stafford\u2019s favor on this claim would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Moreover, the district court properly concluded Stafford failed to state a claim that Milligan violated his constitutional rights by requiring him to accept responsibility for his conviction as a condition of continuing treatment under her care. <em>See United States v. Bee, </em>162 F.3d 1232, 1234-35 (9th Cir.1998) (discussing permissible probation conditions for convicted sex offenders); <em>see also Neal v. Shimoda, </em>131 F.3d 818, 833 (9th Cir.1997) (forced participation of convicted sex offender in a treatment program does not amount to cruel and unusual punishment).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Stafford\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b659-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
