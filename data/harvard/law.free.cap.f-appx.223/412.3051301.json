Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <em>post-Booker </em>sentences are reviewed for \u201creasonableness\u201d, guided by the factors stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>E.g., United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). In that regard, a district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error; its interpretation and application of the Guidelines, <em>de novo. E.g., United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">Frank contests his Guideline\u2019s \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(B) offense-level enhancement, applicable if a person was \u201cphysically restrained to facilitate commission of the offense or to facilitate escape\u201d. He claims reversible error because the victims of the robbery of a casino were not tied, bound, or locked up.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-17\">The presentence investigation report stated that Frank and his codefendants escorted a security guard and several casino employees to the casino manager\u2019s office at gunpoint and instructed them not to leave. Accordingly, the enhancement was applicable. <em>See United States v. Hickman, </em>151 F.3d 446, 460-61 (5th Cir.1998), <em>reinstated, in relevant part on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>179 F.3d 230, 231 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-18\">Frank also contends his above-the-guidelines sentence is unreasonable. \u201cWhere, as here, a district court imposes a <em>post-Booker </em>non-Guidelines sentence \u2014 that is, one that deviates ... above ... the relevant Guidelines sentence as opposed to departing with reference to an applicable Guidelines departure provision \u2014 we conduct our reasonableness review through an abuse-of-discretion lens, paying particular attention to the specific reasons given for deviating from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Armendariz, </em>451 F.3d 352, 358 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-19\">Frank\u2019s sentence was properly based on the district court\u2019s consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including: the nature and circumstances of the instant offense; Frank\u2019s history and characteristics; the need to promote respect for the law; and the need to protect the public from Frank\u2019s further crimes (in the factual stipulation for his guilty plea, he admitted: to joining a conspiracy to commit armed robberies of approximately 17 truck-stop casinos; and to participating in two armed robberies of casinos). <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707-10 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
