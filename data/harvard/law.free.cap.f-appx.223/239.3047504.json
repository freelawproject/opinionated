Specifically, the action alleged claims of products liability, negligence, breach of express and implied warranty, unjust enrichment and loss of consortium with respect to Patricia\u2019s initial heart attack and later death. GlaxoSmithKline then filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Faulise failed to timely file his action. The district court agreed and granted summary judgment to GlaxoSmithKline. Faulise timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment may only be granted when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">A three-year statute of limitations governs Faulise\u2019s claims as they relate to Patricia\u2019s personal injuries. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-52(1) and (5). However, \u201c[u] nless otherwise provided by statute, [a cause of action] for personal injury ... shall not accrue until bodily harm to the claimant or physical damage to his property becomes apparent or ought reasonably to have become apparent to the claimant, whichever event first occurs.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-52(16). As Faulise filed the instant action more than three years after Patricia acknowledged that she suspected Imitrex caused her heart problems, we conclude that the claims related to Patricia\u2019s personal injuries were not timely filed. Moreover, while Faulise argues that Patricia incurred congestive heart failure within the three-year limitations period, \u201c[fjurther damage incurred after the date of accrual is only an aggravation of the original injury and does not restart the statutory limitations period.\u201d <em>Pembee Mfg. Corp. v. Cape Fear Constr. Co., </em>313 N.C. 488, 329 S.E.2d 350, 354 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">A two-year statute of limitations governs the claims with respect to Patricia\u2019s death. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1-53. However, \u201cwhenever the decedent would have been barred, had he lived, from bringing an action for bodily harm because of the provisions of G.S. 1 \u2014 15(c) or 1-52(16), no action for his death may be brought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the claims for Patricia\u2019s injuries that occurred before her death were not filed in a timely fashion, we conclude that Faulise is barred from asserting his claims with respect to Patricia\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to GlaxoSmithKline. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
