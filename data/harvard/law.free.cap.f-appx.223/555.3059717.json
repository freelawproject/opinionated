R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b584-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-23\">Raymond S. Kaplan appeals the decision of the Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\u201cBAP\u201d) affirming the dismissal of his involuntary petition against alleged debtor WLB-RSK Venture (\u201cVenture\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-24\">The facts are well known to the parties, and we do not recite them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-25\">We begin by addressing Appellees\u2019 argument that this appeal is moot because Venture\u2019s principal asset has been sold in foreclosure sale. A \u201cmootness inquiry focuses upon whether we can still grant relief between the parties.\u201d <em>In re Pattullo, </em>271 F.3d 898, 901 (9th Cir.2001) (order). \u201cIf an event occurs while a case is pending on appeal that makes it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever to a prevailing party, the appeal is moot and must be dismissed.... However, while a court may not be able to return the parties to the status quo ante ..., an appeal is not moot if the court can fashion <em>some </em>form of meaningful relief .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Arkison (In re Cascade Rds.), </em>34 F.3d 756, 759 (9th Cir. 1994) (ellipses in original)). \u201cCollateral consequences of a judgment may forestall the mootness of a case.\u201d <em>Allard v. DeLo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number><em>rean, </em>884 F.2d 464, 466 n. 1 (9th Cir.1989) (citing Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, 13A Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 3533.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">This appeal is not moot. Regardless of Venture\u2019s loss of its principal asset in a state foreclosure sale, this court is not deprived of the ability \u201cto grant any effectual relief whatever to a prevailing party.\u201d <em>Pattullo, </em>271 F.3d at 901. This is not an appeal of an order confirming a foreclosure sale, where the debtor\u2019s failure to obtain a stay of the order deprives this court of jurisdiction. <em>Cf. Algeran, Inc. v. Advance Ross Corp., </em>759 F.2d 1421 (9th Cir.1985). Depending on what we decide, our decision may bear directly on Appellees\u2019 appeal, stayed in the district court below, of the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of sanctions for a bad faith filing. <em>Cf. </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(i)(2) (providing separately for damages in bad faith cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We review a BAP decision <em>de novo. In re Mitchell, </em>209 F.3d 1111, 1115 (9th Cir. 2000), <em>abrogation on other grounds recognized by Hibbs v. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>273 F.3d 844 (9th Cir.2001). \u201cIn other words, we independently review the bankruptcy court\u2019s rulings on appeal from the BAP.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>and findings and conclusions of fact for clear error. <em>In re Vortex Fishing Sys., Inc., </em>277 F.3d 1057, 1064 (9th Cir.2002). We review whether there is a \u201cbona fide dispute\u201d over a debt under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303 for clear error. <em>Id. </em>We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Kim, </em>130 F.3d 863, 865 (9th Cir.1997). We review for abuse of discretion the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision whether to appoint an interim Chapter 11 trustee. <em>In re Lowenschuss, </em>171 F.3d 673, 685 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(h)(1), in an involuntary case, the bankruptcy court shall order relief against the debtor only if \u201cthe debtor is generally not paying such debt- or\u2019s debts as such debts become due unless such debts are the subject of a bona fide dispute.\u201d The Ninth Circuit employs a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test to determine whether this requirement is met. <em>Vortex Fishing, </em>277 F.3d at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Having independently reviewed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, we affirm the dismissal of the involuntary petition on the ground that there were no debts not subject to a bona fide dispute. As the BAP held and the bankruptcy court found, each of Venture\u2019s four allegedly undisputed debts was, in fact, disputed. Agreeing with the BAP\u2019s analysis in its entirety, we do not reiterate it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Because the bankruptcy court correctly determined that the involuntary petition could be dismissed for lack of undisputed debts under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(h)(1), Kaplan\u2019s motion for the appointment of a Chapter 11 interim trustee became moot, and the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Because we affirm on the ground that Venture had no undisputed debts, we need not reach the question whether Kaplan filed the involuntary petition in bad faith. We express no opinion on the merits of that portion of the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">We grant the three requests for judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b584-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
