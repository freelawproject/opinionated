However, at trial, Rockland failed to renew its motion for judgment as a matter of law and thus did not comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b). <em>See McCann v. Tex. City Refining, Inc., </em>984 F.2d 667, 671 (5th Cir.1993). Therefore, we review for plain error and determine \u201conly whether the plaintiff has presented any evidence in support of his claim.\u201d <em>Polanco v. City of Austin, Tex., </em>78 F.3d 968, 974 (5th Cir. 1996). Under this standard of review, the evidence was plainly sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s award of lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-24\">As to the testimony of Dick Abram, Rockland withdrew its objection at trial, and Abram therefore testified without objection. Regardless, there was no abuse of discretion in admitting his testimony. <em>See DIJO, Inc. v. Hilton Hotels Corp., </em>351 F.3d 679, 685-87 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-25\">Rockland argues that Momax negated its breach of implied warranty claims because the product was safe to consume. Momax\u2019s customers, however, were the stores that would carry the product, not the ultimate consumers. Rockland stipulated to the unsuitability of swollen bottles for sale to Momax\u2019s grocery store customers. It is therefore irrelevant whether the product would have caused harm to human beings upon consumption. Momax did not negate its implied warranty claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-26\">Finally, Momax has moved for recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code \u00a7 38.001. Bound as we are by Texas law, and unpersuaded that a substantial body of Texas caselaw is incorrect, we may not award attorneys\u2019 fees in a breach of warranty case such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>this one. <em>See JCW Elecs., Inc. v. Garza, </em>176 S.W.3d 618, 633-34 (Tex.App.2005); <em>JHC Ventures, L.P. v. Fast Trucking, Inc., </em>94 S.W.3d 762, 769 (Tex.App.2002); <em>Ellis v.
