McKay, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b586-29\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-30\">The district court concluded correctly that because Appellants\u2019 arrest and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>imprisonment occurred in Mexico, the foreign country exception to liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act immunized the United States from suit for tortious conduct. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(k); <em>see also Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, </em>542 U.S. 692, 711, 124 S.Ct. 2739, 159 L.Ed.2d 718 (2004) (holding \u201cthat the FTCA\u2019s foreign country exception bars all claims based on any injury suffered in a foreign country, regardless of where the tortious act or omission occurred\u201d). In any event, the United States was dismissed as a party to this appeal pursuant to plaintiffs motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Appellants argue that California tort law required EG&amp;G to exercise reasonable care by inspecting the car sold to appellants, to prevent the reasonably foreseeable injury of appellants\u2019 arrest and imprisonment. However, a company contracting with the federal government cannot be held liable for injuries third parties incur as a result of the contract\u2019s execution, where the contract is legal and the company does not breach the terms of the contract. <em>See Myers v. United States, </em>323 F.2d 580, 583 (9th Cir.1963). In such circumstances, any legal duty to a third party must be found in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">According to the terms of its contract with the United States, EG &amp; G had no obligation to inspect the car for contraband. Any independent search of a vehicle had to be authorized via a disposition order issued by the U.S. Customs Service. Appellants have presented no evidence of such an order, they do not allege that EG&amp;G breached the terms of its contract, and there was no contractual duty to inspect the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Unable in the district court to prove the existence of a legal duty, appellants assert for the first time on appeal that EG&amp;G is hable in tort on a products liability theory. Because this claim was not properly pled against EG&amp;G in the district court and it does not otherwise meet any of the recognized exceptions, we decline to consider this issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See Bolker v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>760 F.2d 1039, 1042 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b586-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
