Although the BIA disagreed with one part of the IJ\u2019s decision, we deny the petition because we affirm the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s finding that Chan failed to demonstrate a likelihood of persecution or torture in Cambodia.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Chan raised three arguments before this Court. First, Chan claimed the IJ erred by finding her an \u201caggravated felon.\u201d Second, Chan asserted the document notifying her that removal proceedings would be initiated against her because of her previous criminal convictions did not meet the requirements for due process. Third, Chan argued that the IJ disregarded the evidence presented that she would be persecuted and tortured if forced to return to her native Cambodia.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Chan\u2019s first two arguments fail because Chan did not raise and exhaust these issues before the IJ and the BIA. In fact, at her preliminary hearing before the IJ, Chan, through her counsel, admitted all of the factual allegations and charges in the Notice to Appear and conceded her removability. Chan also admitted she reviewed the NTA, conceded proper service, and waived formal reading and explanation of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">As to Chan\u2019s third argument, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision that the record did not support the conclusion that it was more likely than not that she would be tortured if required to return to Cambodia. We review these findings under the \u201csubstantial evidence standard,\u201d under which findings of fact are \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Tawadrus v. Ashcroft, </em>864 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">While there is some evidence of isolated mistreatment of those deported from the United States to Cambodia, and Chan testified she feared being raped and tortured, and even killed, this evidence is not enough to compel this Court to grant the petition in light of the heightened standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">Accordingly, because the evidence does not compel a decision to the contrary, we affirm the administrative findings of the IJ and the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b676-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\">.
