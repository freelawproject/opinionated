Apr. 3, 2006), <em>aff'g, </em>No. 96 423 935 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 14, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-18\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Ming Xia Chen v. BIA </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 156-58 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir. 2004). We give \u201cparticular deference to the credibility determinations of the IJ.\u201d <em>Montero v. INS, </em>124 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-19\">On appeal, petitioner argues that the IJ erred in making an adverse credibility determination with respect to certain aspects of petitioner\u2019s testimony, and in concluding on the basis thereof that petitioner failed to establish his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened ... because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d if he were returned to his home country of Indonesia. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Petitioner claimed before the IJ that he would be persecuted by extremist Muslim groups in Indonesia on account of his Christian faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">We conclude that substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s request for withholding of removal. In particular, the IJ\u2019s observations that (1) petitioner did not mention any of the claimed incidents of persecution in his original asylum application despite instructions from his lawyer to include any and all such incidents; (2) petitioner\u2019s father did not mention any incidents of persecution in his letter to the Immigration Court; and (3) according to the background materials provided, there was by 2003 a \u201csharp drop in Christian Muslim violence in Indonesia,\u201d all provide sufficient support for the IJ\u2019s negative credibility determination such that a reasonable fact-finder would not be \u201ccompelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We have considered all of petitioner\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Af\">. Petitioner also made claims for asylum and for relief under the Convention Against Torture before the Immigration Court. Nevertheless, petitioner concedes that those claims are not currently before this Court on appeal because (1) this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s refusal to consider his untimely asylum application, Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. at 7; and (2) petitioner did not exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his CAT claim by appealing the IJ\u2019s denial of that claim to the BIA. Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. at 8, n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
