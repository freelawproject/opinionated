Abrams denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>See In re Ranjana Subedi </em>No. A97 517 569 (B.I.A. June 19, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 517 569 (Immig.Ct.Jamaica, Queens, N.Y. Mar. 7, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yu Yin Yang v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 84, 85 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). However, this Court will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">We grant Subedi\u2019s petition and remand for clarification to ascertain whether the agency\u2019s denial of Subedi\u2019s petition was based on an adverse credibility determination. We remand to provide the agency with the opportunity to explain in the first instance whether it found Subedi\u2019s account credible but nonetheless determined that she was not entitled to asylum or withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">Because Subedi failed to raise any challenge to the denial of her CAT claim in her brief to this Court, that claim is waived and must be denied. <em>See, e.g., Jian Wen Wang v. BCIS, </em>437 F.3d 276, 278 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">This panel retains jurisdiction to rule upon the instant petition and decide the issues on appeal following the disposition of the remand. <em>See Gui Ci Pan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>449 F.3d 408, 412, 415 (2d Cir.2006) (retaining jurisdiction to rule upon petition following remand for, <em>inter alia, </em>a credibility determination); <em>cf. United States v. Jacobson, </em>15 F.3d 19, 21-22 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">For the foregoing reasons, Subedi\u2019s petition for review is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
