Waid was sentenced to 147 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">In his sole issue on appeal, Waid argues that, because he did not personally possess the firearm in question and because he had no personal knowledge of that particular firearm, there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Because Waid did not move for a judgment of acquittal in the trial court, we review this issue only to determine whether the record is devoid of evidence to support the conviction. <em>United States v. Herrera, </em>313 F.3d 882, 885 (5th Cir.2002) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">That count of the indictment at issue cited both 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Section 2 states that \u201c[wjhoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him ... would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.\u201d \u00a7 2(b). There was trial testimony that Waid instructed Gregory Holden, a codefendant, to obtain a firearm to be used in connection with a grocery store robbery they intended to carry out. Holden actually acquired two firearms: a sawed-off shotgun and a .38 caliber handgun. Waid knew of the shotgun but was unaware of the .38 caliber handgun. It was the handgun that Holden actually used in the robbery attempt. Because Holden possessed the firearms at Waid\u2019s instruction, Waid was a principal to the possession thereof. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-15\">Because there is record evidence to support Waid\u2019s conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm, his conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
