On appeal, his counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved to withdraw, and Tafolla has filed a pro se supplemental brief. They argue that the evidence was insufficient, but we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>that the evidence, which must be viewed in the light most favorable to the government, was sufficient for the jury to find the elements of each of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Garcia, </em>461 F.3d 939, 945 (8th Cir.2006) (standard of review). After reviewing the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we conclude that there are no non-frivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s withdrawal motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-24\">. The Honorable James E.
