For reversal, Mills argues the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> erred in concluding that his escape conviction was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), resulting in his classification as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-21\">As Mills acknowledges, this court has held that all escapes, even non-violent \u201cwalk-away\u201d escapes, are crimes of violence within the meaning of section 4B1.2. <em>See United States v. Nation, </em>243 F.3d 467, 472 (8th Cir.2001). We are bound to follow this precedent. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>22 F.3d 787, 788 (8th Cir.1994) (panel of this court is bound by prior Eighth Circuit decision unless prior decision is overruled by this court sitting en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-22\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-19\">. The Honorable Donovan W. Frank, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
