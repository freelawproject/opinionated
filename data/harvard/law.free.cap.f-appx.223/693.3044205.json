We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">We review the denial of a habeas petition <em>de novo. Lara v. Ryan, </em>455 F.3d 1080, 1084 (9th Cir.2006). In reviewing the merits of the petition, we apply the deferential standards of review set forth in the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Under AEDPA, a habeas petition cannot be granted unless the state court decision was: (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or was (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(2). A federal court must presume the correctness of the state court\u2019s factual findings. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-13\">Galbraith first argues that Officer Pope violated his Fifth Amendment rights by eliciting incriminating statements from him without the benefit of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The state court held no warnings were necessary because the interview was not custodial. <em>See Jackson v. Giurbino, </em>364 F.3d 1002, 1008 (9th Cir.2004) <em>(\u201cMiranda </em>rights vest in the context of custodial interrogations.\u201d). This finding was not objectively unreasonable. Even if Officer Pope was aware of Galbraith\u2019s status as a suspect, there was no evidence that her objective conduct communicated to a reasonable person in Galbraith\u2019s position that he \u201cwas not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Keohane, </em>516 U.S. 99, 112, 116 S.Ct. 457, 133 L.Ed.2d 383 (1995). Under clearly established federal law, her subjective knowledge and intent were irrelevant. <em>Yarborough v. Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 662, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004) (holding that the custody determination is objective and that \u201chow much the police knew about the suspect ... [is] irrelevant\u201d); <em>Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 441-42, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984) (similar).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-14\">Galbraith next argues that his statements to Officers Joyner and Yoell were not given pursuant to a valid <em>Miranda </em>waiver. The state court held the waiver to be \u201cknowing and intelligent,\u201d and this holding was not objectively unreasonable. The fact that Galbraith was young and had only minimal contact with the criminal justice system did not make his waiver per se involuntary. <em>See Juan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number><em>H. v. Allen, </em>408 F.3d 1262, 1271 (9th Cir. 2005). Additionally, there was nothing in the facts of the case to suggest that Galbraith did not understand the <em>Miranda </em>warnings or the consequences of their waiver. While Galbraith was on pain medication, he expressly stated during the interview that he was \u201cthinking real clearly\u201d because the medication had worn off. Finally, the interviewing officers secured Galbraith\u2019s waiver in multiple forms. <em>See Fare v. Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 724-25, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 61 L.Ed.2d 197 (1979) (Whether a waiver is \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d is determined by assessing the \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation.\u201d) (citing <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 475-77, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Galbraith next argues that his statements to the officers were involuntary and taken in violation of his due process rights. <em>Clark v. Murphy, </em>331 F.3d 1062, 1072 (9th Cir.2003) (noting that in determining voluntariness, a court must assess the totality of the circumstances and ask \u201cwhether the defendant\u2019s will was overborne at the time he confessed\u201d) (quoting <em>Haynes v. Washington, </em>373 U.S. 503, 513, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 10 L.Ed.2d 513 (1963)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The state court\u2019s finding that Galbraith\u2019s will was not overborne was not objectively unreasonable in light of: (1) the officer\u2019s trial testimony, in which he \u201cdenied making any promises of leniency during the interview\u201d; (2) Galbraith\u2019s recorded statement, in which he expressly \u201cdenied that [the officers] had threatened him during the interview, promised him anything, physically abused him, or prevented him from using the bathroom or getting a drink of water\u201d; and (3) the state court\u2019s independent review of the interrogation audiotape and its subsequent determination of voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Galbraith next argues that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to require the prosecution to prove a prima facie case. <em>See Edsel P. v. Superior Court, </em>165 Cal.App.3d 763, 786-87, 211 Cal.Rptr. 869 (1985) (holding that before a presumption of unfitness for juvenile court treatment could attach, a minor has the right to require the prosecution to establish a prima facie case against him).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This argument is based in part on the faulty premise that Galbraith\u2019s statements were taken in violation of his constitutional rights. Because we find no constitutional violation, we cannot say that Galbraith was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s alleged errors. <em>See Young v. Runnels, </em>435 F.3d 1038, 1043-44 (9th Cir.2006) (applying the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland </em>to reject defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Finally, Galbraith argues that \u201ceven if his statements to the police were deemed voluntary,\u201d the prosecution would still have failed to establish a prima facie case against him. We disagree, and hold that the prosecution would have been able to prove to a probable cause standard that Galbraith was a \u201cmajor participant\u201d in the robbery, and that he \u201cact[ed] with reckless indifference to human life.\u201d <em>See </em>Cal. Wei. <em>&amp; </em>Inst.Code \u00a7 707(e). We note that the prosecution ultimately satisfied the higher burden of proving Galbraith guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Because Galbraith cannot show that he was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to put the prosecution to its initial burden of proof, we reject Galbraith\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b722-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
