Daudin\u2019s argument that he was denied relief based on erroneous adverse credibility determinations is without merit because the BIA specifically declined to make an adverse credibility finding. With respect to his assertion of past persecution based on an imputed political opinion, Daudin\u2019s claim of derivative persecution failed because Daudin failed to set forth any evidence that his mother\u2019s political opinion would be imputed to him. <em>See, e.g., Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138-39 (5th Cir.2004). The immigration judge thus did not err by requiring Daudin to show a clear probability of future persecution on account of one of the protected grounds. <em>Id. </em>Because Daudin failed to make such a showing, the immigration judge did not err by subsequently apportioning to Daudin the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>proof in establishing that a change in the conditions in Haiti made him unable to return to that country. Finally, the immigration judge did not err in evaluating Daudin\u2019s request for relief under the CAT. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906-07 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
