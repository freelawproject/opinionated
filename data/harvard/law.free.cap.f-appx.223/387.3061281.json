Cardenas challenges the constitutionality of the treatment of his prior drug convictions as sentencing factors rather than offense elements that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-25\">Cardenas\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Cardenas contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and a majority of the current Court would overrule it in the light of <em>Apprendi </em>and subsequent Supreme Court authority. We have repeatedly re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>jected such contentions because <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Cardenas properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Cardenas also argues that the district court committed plain error by failing to ask whether he affirmed or denied his prior convictions, as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b). Because Cardenas has not alleged that he did not commit the prior offenses or that the convictions were unconstitutionally obtained, he has not shown plain error. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>348 F.3d 78, 86-87 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under tire limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
