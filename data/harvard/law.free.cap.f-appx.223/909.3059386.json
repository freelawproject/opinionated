This count resulted from Casey\u2019s involvement in a burglary and high-speed chase through heavy traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">On appeal of his first 120-month sentence, we remanded his case to the district court \u201cwith instructions that Casey is to be resentenced in accord with the <em>[United States v.] Booker[, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)] decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Casey (Casey I), </em>153 Fed.Appx. 669, 670 (11th Cir.2005) (unpublished). Taking the sentencing guidelines as merely advisory, the district court on remand imposed a sentence identical to the one Casey received at his first sentence hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">Casey now appeals this new 120-month sentence. He offers two grounds in support of a second remand, but neither of those grounds entitle him to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-14\">First, Casey makes a contention that he could have raised (but did not raise) in either his first sentence hearing or on his first appeal: He says that he should not be subjected to a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3C1.2 (Nov.2003). Whatever the merits of this contention, we cannot say the district court erred at resentencing by leaving the enhancement intact. <em>See United States v. Mesa, </em>247 F.3d 1165, 1166 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that a district court need not \u201cconsider an issue at re-sentencing on remand that is not within the scope of the mandate and which Defendant failed to raise in his prior sentencing and appeal therefrom\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Pineiro, </em>470 F.3d 200, 206-07 (5th Cir.2006) (holding that by recalculating the defendant\u2019s offense level, the district court exceeded the scope of its mandate to \u201cresentenc[e] in accordance with <em>Booker </em>\u201d). Our resentencing mandate in Casey\u2019s first appeal covered the \u201conly issue he raise[d],\u201d which was the effect of the \u201cnon-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error\u201d on his sentence and not the calculation of his guideline range. <em>See Casey I, </em>153 Fed.Appx. at 670. Casey has waived the enhancement issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-15\">Second, Casey contends that his new 120-month sentence is unreasonable in light of the district court\u2019s comments at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>the original sentence hearing about Casey\u2019s willingness to deal head-on with his drug addiction: \u201cI want you to know I would like to have the opportunity if I am able to have greater discretion in this case,\u201d the district court said. On appeal, Casey maintains that this comment at the first sentence hearing is \u201cinconsistent with the imposition of a reasonable sentence in the second hearing.\u201d And by re-imposing a 120-month sentence at the second hearing, Casey says, the district court necessarily must have failed to take into account all of the sentencing factors it was obligated to consider under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">On appeal, when \u201creviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). As the party challenging the sentence, Casey has the burden of establishing its unreasonableness. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Merely identifying one <em>of </em>several thoughts on the district court\u2019s mind during the original sentence hearing, as Casey has done here, does not fulfill this burden. For instance, Casey has not addressed the fact that the district court explicitly stated that it had considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, a statement that alone suffices in <em>post-Booker </em>cases to establish a court\u2019s consideration of those factors. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005). And Casey similarly has left unaddressed the district court\u2019s lengthy discussion at the second sentence hearing of: (1) his criminal history; (2) the seriousness of the circumstances leading to his arrest; (3) the need to protect the public; (4) the need to deter him from engaging in future criminal conduct; and (5) the prospect of him receiving drug treatment while in prison. Each of these considerations are \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, and each, in our view, underscore the reasonableness of Casey\u2019s 120-month prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
