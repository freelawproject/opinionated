The indictment specifically alleged that the defendant \u201cstated and represented in the Form DSP-11, \u2018Application for a United States Passport,\u2019 that he was in fact Sherrod Sylvester McClain when, then and there, Defendant knew that he was not Sherrod Sylvester McClain.\u201d Along with the passport application, Green submitted an application for a Texas identification card that bore right and left thumbprints and a photograph, also purporting to be those of McClain.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-23\">At the time of the indictment, Green was known to law enforcement officials only by McClain, the alias he had used to commit the underlying offense of making a false statement on a passport application. Post-indictment, agents entered the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>they had on Green, including his physical description, into the National Crime Information Center system. Because agents suspected that the defendant was involved in drug trafficking, copies of the warrant and photographs of the subject were given to a Houston police sergeant involved with a drug task force in December 1998, and to a Drug Enforcement Administration agent in January 1999. On August 30, 2002, agents ran a records check using the defendant\u2019s alias, but the effort turned up no new information.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In September 2002, agents used fingerprint technology to match the unknown thumbprints from the Texas identification card application with those of Green, whose thumbprints were on file with the FBI. Agents also compared a photograph of Green with the one on the application and determined they were the same person. That same month, agents retrieved Green\u2019s arrest records from Waller County, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In October 2002, agents learned and verified that Green was incarcerated in the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and had been there since 2000. In October 2003, agents received Green\u2019s booking photograph and fingerprint card from Wisconsin authorities. Thereafter, agents gathered the necessary documentation and sent Green\u2019s prints to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) forensic laboratory for comparison. In August 2004, the agents received confirmation from ICE of Green\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">In September 2004, a detainer was placed on Green at the Wisconsin facility where he was incarcerated. On November 16, 2004, the United States Attorney filed an application for writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, requesting that Green be brought before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. On January 4, 2005, Green made his initial appearance in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">On February 18, 2005, Green filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the post-indictment delay violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. On March 8, 2005, the district court denied Green\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">Following a stipulated bench trial in March 2005, Green was convicted and sentenced to one month in prison, to be served concurrently with an existing state court sentence and to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">Green now appeals his judgment of conviction and sentence, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment. Green contends that the post-indictment delay, from the issuance of the indictment in August 1998 to the filing of the detainer on Green in September 2004, violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">Green\u2019s speedy trial claim is controlled by the four-factor balancing test in <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972). Under that test, the court considers: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the defendant\u2019s diligence in asserting his Sixth Amendment right; and (4) the prejudice to the defendant caused by the delay. <em>United States v. Cardona, </em>302 F.3d 494, 496 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530-33, 92 S.Ct. 2182).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">In <em>Doggett v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 112 S.Ct. 2686, 120 L.Ed.2d 520 (1992), the Supreme Court clarified how the four factors are to be weighed and the burden each party carries. The threshold inquiry is whether the delay is long enough to trigger a speedy trial analysis. <em>United States v. Bergfeld, </em>280 F.3d 486, 488 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 651-52, 112 S.Ct. 2686). Generally, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>post-accusation delay approaching one year is sufficient. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 652 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 2686).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u201cIf a court undertakes a full <em>Barker-analysis, </em>it evaluates the first three factors (delay-length; reason for it; diligence in asserting right) in order to determine whether prejudice will be presumed or whether actual prejudice must be shown.\u201d <em>United States v. Frye, </em>372 F.3d 729, 736 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cIn all of this, courts do <em>not </em>engage in a rigid analysis, but engage in the \u2018functional analysis of the right in the particular context of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 522, 92 S.Ct. 2182).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In analyzing Green\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim, the district court recognized that it was required to engage in a full <em>Barker-analysis </em>because of the length of the post-indictment delay. <em>See </em>Tr. of Mot. Hr\u2019g at 43, <em>United States v. Green, </em>No. H-98-CR-311 (S.D.Tex. Mar. 8, 2005). Green\u2019s counsel told the district court that Green was relying entirely on the presumption of prejudice for his claim. <em>See id. </em>at 4. This statement, along with the court\u2019s finding that there was absolutely no evidence of actual prejudice, required the court to balance the first three factors under <em>Barker </em>and <em>Doggett </em>to determine if prejudice would be presumed. <em>See id. </em>at 43-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In addressing the first two factors, the district court found that \u201cthe Defendant contributed to the problems significantly because he admittedly used false information and as a result he was indicted as a John Doe. Clearly, his efforts to prevent the Government from figuring out who he was contributed to the delay in the Government\u2019s figuring out who he was.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43. The court also found that \u201cthere were periods of time in which the Government had available to it the means of resolving that confusion that it did not avail itself of as early as it might have done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded \u201cthat there was a relatively short period of delay that is attributable to some degree of governmental negligence[,]\u201d but attributed the \u201cmuch longer period of delay ... to a combination of the Defendant\u2019s efforts to hide his identity and the Government\u2019s failure, although they made attempts to find the Defendant, to locate him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46. The court found that there was \u201ccertainly no degree of culpability [by the Government] that is higher than a low degree of negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, in addressing the third factor, the court found that Green had diligently asserted his constitutional right. Based on these factors, the court concluded that although \u201c[a] combination of those factors makes this a relatively close case\u201d on whether it should presume prejudice, it did not \u201csee a basis for dismissing the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Having reviewed the briefs, the district court\u2019s oral ruling, and the pertinent portions of the record, we find no errors of law or fact warranting reversal. Essentially for the reasons stated by the district court, we agree that the length of the delay attributable to the government\u2019s negligence, even when considered in light of the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, is not sufficient for a presumption of prejudice. <em>Cf. United States v. Serna-Villarreal, </em>352 F.3d 225, 232 &amp; 233 n. 5 (5th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>541 U.S. 981, 124 S.Ct. 1896, 158 L.Ed.2d 481 (2004) (stating that \u201cthis Court and others generally have found presumed prejudice only in cases in which the post-indictment delay lasted at least five years\u201d and noting that \u201c[t]he portion of the post-indictment delay attributable to government negligence in <em>Doggett, Bergfeld, </em>and <em>Cardona, </em>was six years, five years, and five years, respectively\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Accordingly, because Green relied solely on presumptive prejudice and because he cannot show actual prejudice, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\">. Although Green argues that this circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Sema-Villarreat </em>conflicts with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Barker, </em>it is a well-established rule that one panel of this court may not overrule a prior panel's decision, absent an en banc or intervening Supreme Court decision. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Treft, </em>447 F.3d 421, 425 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 555, 166 L.Ed.2d 413 (2006). We therefore decline to consider this argument any further on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
