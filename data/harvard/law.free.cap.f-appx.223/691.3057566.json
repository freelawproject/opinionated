Reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>for abuse of discretion, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The BIA acted within its discretion in denying Badillo-Tena\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed over one year after the BIA\u2019s final removal order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision was rendered).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The BIA acted within its discretion by not applying equitable tolling because Badillo-Tena did not explain how he was prevented from complying with the filing deadline. <em>See Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 897 (equitable tolling applies where an alien is prevented from timely filing because of deception, fraud, or error); <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (equitable tolling applies where an alien demonstrates that he was ignorant of the filing deadline due to circumstances beyond his control).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">To the extent Badillo-Tena challenges the BIA\u2019s April 28, 2004 order affirming, without opinion, an immigration judge\u2019s order denying his prior motion to reconsider, we lack jurisdiction because the petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">In light of these holdings, we do not reach Badillo-Tena\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b719-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
