We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the dismissal of a complaint on statute of limitation grounds, <em>Mann v. American Airlines, </em>324 F.3d 1088, 1090 (9th Cir.2003), and we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Peralta\u2019s complaint alleges that defendants improperly forced him to bunk in a top bunk, in violation of doctor\u2019s orders, from August 19, 2000, to October 9, 2000. Peralta commenced the administrative grievance process on October 7, 2004, two days before the statute of limitations expired. <em>See </em>Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 335.1 (statute of limitations for personal injury actions in California is two years); Cal.Civ. Proc.Code \u00a7 352.1(a) (the limitations period is tolled for an additional two years for incarcerated individuals); <em>Jones v. Blanas, </em>393 F.3d 918, 927 (9th Cir.2004) (for actions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, courts apply the forum state\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury actions, along with the forum state\u2019s law regarding tolling, except to the extent any of these laws is inconsistent with federal law); <em>Brown v. Valoff, </em>422 F.3d 926, 943 (9th Cir.2005) (the applicable statute of limitations must be tolled while a prisoner completes the mandatory exhaustion process). The district court erred when it dismissed Peralta\u2019s action as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
