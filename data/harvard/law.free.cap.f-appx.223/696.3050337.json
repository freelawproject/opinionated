We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, see <em>Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-21\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that, taking Tytarenko\u2019s testimony as true, she failed to establish past persecution on account of a protected ground. Although official retaliation for whistleblowing may amount to persecution, the record here, does not compel such a conclusion. <em>Cf. Grava v. INS, </em>205 F.3d 1177, 1181 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-22\">In her opening brief, Tytarenko fails to address, and therefore has waived any challenge to, the agency\u2019s determination that she is ineligible for withholding of removal and CAT protection. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that issues which are not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b724-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
