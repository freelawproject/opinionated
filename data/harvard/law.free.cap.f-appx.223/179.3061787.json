Hill appeals the District Court\u2019s order dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. For the reasons given below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AE8\">Hill was convicted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base and marijuana (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)) and unlawful possession of ammunition (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1)). After the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, <em>United States v. Hill, </em>142 F.3d 305 (6th Cir.1998), he filed a motion for collateral relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was denied. <em>Hill v. United States, </em>109 F.Supp.2d 741 (N.D.Ohio 2000). Hill does not appear to have appealed the denial of that motion. He then filed a Rule 60(b) motion, which the court construed as an unauthorized second \u00a7 2255 motion and transferred to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to be treated as an application for such authorization. The application was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"A0K\">From his prison at USP Lewisburg, Hill subsequently filed a habeas corpus petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241, arguing that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and ineffective because \u201cits limitations of procedure does [sic] not afford review of a claim based upon an unconstitutional statute, the now excised Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) ... and ... the new interpretation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.\u201d Without mentioning the cases by name, he argues that in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), his indictment and conviction are invalid because the indictment did not specify, and the jury did not find, drug type and quantity, and that following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), ^ Digtrict Court lacked jurisdiction to sentence kjm</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">The District Court dismissed the petition. The court explained that such claims should ordinarily be brought via \u00a7 2255 and bbey do no^ mee^ the standard for resorting to \u00a7 2241 as set forth by this Court in <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d (3d Cir.2002), and <em>In re Dorsain </em>F.3d 245 (3d Cir.1997). The court noted that even if this were not the case, Hill\u2019s claims would fail on the merits be\" cause <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroaetive- ^ to cases on collateral review such as tlills- <em>^ee United States v. Swinton, </em>333 F.3d 481 (3d Cir.2003). This appeal foll\u00b0wed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AX\">We Mly agree ^ the District Court&gt;s explanation of why \u00a7 2255 is not \u201cinadequate and ineffeetive\u00bb ^ respect to Hffl,s claims. It fo]lows&gt; as the District Court concluded; that \u00a7 2241 is not the proper meang of raiging thoge daimg and; thus, that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to address them. <em>See Application of Galante, </em>437 F.2d 1164 (3d Cir.1971). Because the Hill\u2019s appeal does not present a substantial issue, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ay0\">. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is plenary. <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
