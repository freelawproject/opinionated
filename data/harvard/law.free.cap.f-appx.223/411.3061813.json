Plaintiffs also raised pendant state law claims. Appellees moved for summary judgment arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the undisputed facts established probable cause and that the suit was barred by qualified immunity. The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion, finding the arrest and detention supported by probable cause and holding that, in the alternative, Appellants\u2019 claims were barred by qualified immunity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-23\">Based on our de novo review, we agree with the district court that the undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>facts establish that probable cause existed as a matter of law. Probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances as known to the officers at the time would \u201cwarrant a prudent man [to] believe[ ] that the [Appellants] had committed or [were] committing an offense.\u201d <em>Martin v. Thomas, </em>973 F.2d 449, 453 (5th Cir.1992). It is irrelevant that the Appellants were not ultimately convicted. <em>See Morris v. Dillard Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc., </em>277 F.3d 743, 754 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Because we find Appellants\u2019 arrest supported by probable cause, we need not decide whether Appellees are entitled to qualified immunity. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b439-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-25\">. The court also dismissed Appellants\u2019 state law claims, a ruling they do not appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
