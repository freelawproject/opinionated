Finding no reversible error, we affirm the revocation order and the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">LaSalle contends that his sentence is unreasonable. We note that the sentence was within the advisory guideline range of seven to thirteen months, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a) (2000), and it was within the applicable statutory maximum of five years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000). Additionally, before imposing sentence, the court heard the parties\u2019 arguments concerning the application of the permissible 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006) factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). We conclude that LaSalle\u2019s thirteen-month sentence was not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007); <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking LaSalle\u2019s supervised release and imposing a thirteen-month sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
