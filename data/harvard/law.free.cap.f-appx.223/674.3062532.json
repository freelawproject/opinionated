We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing de novo Lara Jimenez\u2019s due process claim, <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-22\">Lara Jimenez\u2019s contentions that his due process rights were violated are unpersuasive because he has failed to establish that the proceedings before the IJ were \u201cso fundamentally unfair that [he] was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The facts here are distinguishable from those in <em>Cano-Merida v. INS </em>because here the IJ elicited testimony regarding Lara Jimenez\u2019s asylum claim and provided a reasonable opportunity for him to present additional evidence, and Lara Jimenez\u2019s counsel later affirmed to the IJ that the applications for asylum and withholding of removal were withdrawn. <em>See </em>311 F.3d 960, 964-65 (9th Cir.2002) (finding due process violation where pro se asylum applicant withdrew application after IJ informed him off the record and prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>to hearing evidence that claim was merit-less).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b703-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
