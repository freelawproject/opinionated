The district court sentenced him to a total of 78 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release, and ordered him to pay $200 in special assessments. Matthews directed trial counsel to file a notice of appeal, but his newly appointed lawyer moves to withdraw because she cannot discern a nonfrivolous basis for the appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Matthews has not accepted our invitation to comment on counsel\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>Cir. R. 51(b). Because counsel\u2019s supporting brief is facially adequate, we limit our review to the potential issues identified by counsel. <em>See United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-20\">Counsel first considers whether Matthews could argue that his guilty pleas were involuntary. But counsel informs us that Matthews does not want his pleas vacated, and so counsel should not have considered this potential argument. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 671-72 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-21\">Counsel next considers whether Matthews could challenge the reasonableness of his overall prison sentence. The drug offense involved more than five kilograms of cocaine and thus carried a mandatory minimum penalty of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii), and the gun offense carried a mandatory, consecutive term of five years, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (1) (A) (i), yielding a guidelines range of 180 months, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (\u201cWhere a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d); <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>5 F.3d 292, 294-95 (7th Cir.1993). In accord with the plea agreement, the government moved for a sentence below the statutory minimum on the drug count because Matthews had cooperated and provided substantial assistance. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e); <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 182, 112 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). The district court granted the motion and sentenced Matthews to 18 months on the drug count and a consecutive 60 months on the gun count. The court justified the overall sentence in light of the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the circumstances giving rise to the offense and Matthews\u2019s lack of prior criminality, and counsel is unable to identify any other factor that would have compelled a lower sentence. We therefore agree with counsel that any potential challenge to the reasonableness of Matthews\u2019s significantly reduced sentence would be frivolous, <em>see United States v. George, </em>403 F.3d 470, 473 (7th Cir.2005) (observing that it will be an unusual case where a below-guidelines sentence is unreasonable), and would arrive at the same conclusion even if we granted no special weight to the length of the sentence relative to the guidelines range, <em>see United States v. Rita, </em>177 Fed.Appx. 357 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. granted </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
