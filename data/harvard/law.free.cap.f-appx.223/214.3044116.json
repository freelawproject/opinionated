The district court sentenced Scott to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the bottom of the sentencing guidelines range. Scott appealed. Counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>contending there are no meritorious issues for appeal but requesting this Court to review the propriety of Scott\u2019s sentence. In his pro se supplemental brief, Scott asserts the district court improperly enhanced his sentence based on facts not admitted by him or proven beyond a reasonable doubt and erroneously considered the sentencing guidelines mandatory.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The Government declined to file a responding brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the sentencing court must calculate the appropriate advisory guideline range, making any necessary factual findings. The court then should consider that range in conjunction with the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006) sentencing factors and determine a proper sentence. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). The sentence must be within the statutorily prescribed range and reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005) (citations omitted). A sentence within the properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). In light of these principles, we find no error in Scott\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Scott\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Scott, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Scott requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-9\"> Scott also alleges ineffective assistance of counsel. This claim is not cognizable on appeal because ineffective assistance does not conclusively appear on the record. <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>* We note that this argument relates only to the 240-month sentence imposed on EcheverriaMendez\u2019s conviction for illegal re-entry. His offense level for that crime was increased by sixteen levels based on his prior conviction. His 360-month sentences for the drug trafficking crimes were based only on the applicable drug quantities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
