We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the issues on appeal and the procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">\u2018We review the District Court\u2019s decision to deny [a defendant\u2019s] Rule 33 motion!] for abuse of discretion, upholding findings of fact that were made in the course of deciding the motion! ] unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>433 F.3d 273, 295 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Wong, </em>78 F.3d 73, 78-79 (2d Cir.1996)). \u201cA district judge\u2019s ruling is given deference because the judge presided over the trial and is in a better position than an appellate court to determine the probable effect of new evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivas, </em>377 F.3d 195, 199 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">Having carefully reviewed all of defendant\u2019s arguments, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision for substantially the same reasons set forth in the Order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">We have considered all of defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
