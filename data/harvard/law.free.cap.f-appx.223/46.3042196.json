In it, he claims that Consumer Information &amp; Dispute Resolution (\u201cCIDR\u201d) terminated him from his position as a Security Coordinator and Supervisor in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101 \u2014 12117. We assume that the parties and counsel are familiar with the facts and the procedural history of this case, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">We review the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>See Tenenbaum v. Williams, </em>193 F.3d 581, 593 (2d Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1098, 120 S.Ct. 1832, 146 L.Ed.2d 776 (2000). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201conly if the record indicates that \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). When the nonmoving party will bear the ultimate burden of proof at trial, the moving party\u2019s burden is satisfied if it can point to an absence of evidence to support an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). If the moving party has carried its burden, we must determine whether the nonmoving party has \u201ccome forward with evidence that would be sufficient to support a jury verdict in its favor.\u201d <em>Burt Rigid Box, Inc. v. Travelers Prop. Cas. Corp., </em>302 F.3d 83, 91 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">The ADA prohibits discrimination against a \u201cqualified individual with a disability because of the disability\u201d in the \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). However, \u201c[n]ot every impairment is a \u2018disability\u2019 within the meaning of the ADA; rather, there are two requirements: the impairment must limit a major life activity and the limitation must be substantial.\u201d <em>Capobianco v. City of New York, </em>422 F.3d 47, 56 (2d Cir.2005) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">Evans, however, has not identified anything that the law regards as a major life activity that has been impaired by his alleged mental illness. To the contrary, the only evidence that he provided on this score suggests that he has <em>not </em>been impaired in the one major life activity covered by the ADA that is relevant to his case \u2014 his ability to work. <em>See E.E.O.C. v. J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc., </em>321 F.3d 69, 75 (2d Cir.2003); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2\u00ae. He has therefore failed to present evidence on an essential element of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">We have considered each of Evans\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal, and conclude they are without merit. To the extent that he seeks to raise issues for the first time on appeal, we decline to review them. <em>See Amalgamated Clothing &amp; Textile Workers Union v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>54 F.3d 69, 73 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
