We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Barry v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 741, 744 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1147, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-26\">The denial of a motion to reopen must be reviewed with extreme deference, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor such motions. <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc). This court reverses the Board\u2019s denial of such a motion only if the denial is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Barry, </em>445 F.3d at 745. We find the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-27\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
