R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b29-28\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the petition for review be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-29\">Clair Aero et al. seek review of the Board\u2019s affirmance of the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s revocation of their operational and airman certificates for conducting a \u201ccomplimentary\u201d flight for the British Virgin Islands Tourism Board while their Part 135 operating license was suspended. No person may work as a commercial operator, that is, carry persons or property by aircraft for compensation or hire, without a valid certificate. 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 119.5(g); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1.1. Agency precedent establishes that the receipt of intangible benefits such as goodwill or the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>pectation of future economic benefits is compensation under the regulations, <em>see, e.g., Administrator v. Platt, </em>NTSB Order No. EA-4012, 1993 WL 478319 (Nov. 17, 1993), and the agency\u2019s finding that Clair Aero received such compensation from its \u201ccomplimentary\u201d flight for the Tourism Board is supported by substantial evidence. Agency precedent also indicates \u201c[kjnowingly operating an aircraft while under suspension is one of the most serious violations an airman can commit,\u201d <em>Administrator v. Darst, </em>NTSB Order No. EA-4963, 2002 WL 507359 (Mar. 29, 2002), and revocation of the petitioners\u2019 licenses when, as experienced commercial operators, they should have known that the flight was prohibited, is not arbitrary or capricious. Their claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. See Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
