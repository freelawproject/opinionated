Allbritton was convicted after a jury trial on four counts of making false entries in a bank book, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005, and four counts of misapplication of monies, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656. Allbritton did not file a timely notice of appeal. Instead, she filed several post-judgment motions seeking extensions of time to file a notice of appeal, reconsideration of the district court\u2019s denial of an extension of time, and an out-of-time appeal. The district court denied each of Allbritton\u2019s post-judgment motions. She then filed a notice of appeal purporting to appeal from the district court\u2019s orders but has not briefed the denial of her motions. Allbritton\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely as to any of the district court\u2019s orders. The appeal is therefore dismissed for failure to comply with the rule requiring a timely notice of appeal. <em>See Burnley v. City of San Antonio, </em>470 F.3d 189, 192 n. 1 (5th Cir.2006); Fed.
