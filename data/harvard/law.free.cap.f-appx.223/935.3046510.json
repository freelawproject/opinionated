Convention Against Torture, and the BIA\u2019s September 5, 2006 order denying their motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>We are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation omitted). We have jurisdiction over a \u201cfinal order of removal,\u201d so long as the petition for review is filed within 30 days. INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394-95, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1543-44, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (providing that \u201cdeportation orders are to be reviewed in a timely fashion after issuance, irrespective of the later filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider,\u201d and that \u201cthe filing of the reconsideration motion does not toll the time to petition for review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). A motion for reconsideration \u201cshall specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Because Petitioners did not file their petition for review within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s July 6, 2006 decision, and because the filing of a motion to reconsider does not toll this statutory time-period, we lack jurisdiction to review the July 6, 2006 decision and therefore dismiss the petition as it relates to that decision. Although we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s September 5, 2006 order, Petitioners have abandoned any claim of error as to that order by failing to raise any argument about it in their brief. Hence, as to that order, their petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">PETITION DISMISSED, in part; DENIED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-11\">. Petitioners seek asylum on the ground that they suffered past persecution from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, guerrilla organization, on account of their political activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
