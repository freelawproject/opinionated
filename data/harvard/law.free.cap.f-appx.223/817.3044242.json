Pursuant to a plea agreement, he waived his right to appeal his sentence unless the sentence either exceeded the statutory maximum penalty or was above the high end of the guidelines range. The statutory maximum sentence was life imprisonment and Mr. Gerhartz\u2019s guidelines sentencing range was 121 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Mr. Gerhartz to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Despite the appeal waiver, he filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-20\">The government has moved to enforce the plea agreement. Mr. Gerhartz\u2019s counsel responded to the motion, stating, in total, that there is \u201cno colorable argument to offer in resistance to the government\u2019s motion.\u201d Resp. to Mot. to Enforce Plea Agreement at 1. This court gave Mr. Gerhartz an opportunity to file a pro se response to the motion to enforce. To date, he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-21\">Nevertheless, we have reviewed the plea agreement, the change of plea hearing transcript, the sentencing hearing transcript, and the motion to enforce. We conclude that the following three factors have been satisfied: (1) \u201cthe disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights\u201d; (2) Mr. Gerhartz \u201cknowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights\u201d; and (3) \u201cenforcing the waiver would [not] result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1325 (10th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (en banc). Accordingly, Mr. Gerhartz\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-22\">We therefore GRANT the government\u2019s motion to enforce the appeal waiver and DISMISS the appeal. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b845-18\">This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
