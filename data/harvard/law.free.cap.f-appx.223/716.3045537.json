Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s April 27, 2005 order denying Singh\u2019s motion to reopen because he failed to petition this court for review of that decision. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">We also lack jurisdiction to review Singh\u2019s contention that the IJ prevented him from presenting his case, because he failed to raise it before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that due process challenges that are \u201cprocedural in nature\u201d must be exhausted).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on significant inconsistencies between Singh\u2019s testimony and his written asylum application regarding his alleged beating in 1987. These inconsistencies, regarding how Singh escaped from his assailants and whether he was beaten unconscious, go to the heart of his claim. <em>See Li, </em>378 F.3d at 964. In the absence of credible testimony, Singh failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">Because Singh\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony that the agency found not credible, and he points to no other evidence the agency should have considered, his CAT claim also fails. <em>Id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b745-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
