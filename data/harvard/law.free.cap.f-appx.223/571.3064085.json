To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Martinez-Cuadra failed to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice as a result of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See id. </em>at 889-900 (to establish a valid due process claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must show that she was prejudiced by the attorney\u2019s deficient performance). The BIA properly determined that Martinez-Cuadra failed to demonstrate how submission of additional tax returns and evidence regarding his father\u2019s illness would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Martinez-Cuadra\u2019s contention that his prior counsel should have called his wife as a witness, because he failed to raise that issue before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that exhaustion of an alleged procedural error is mandatory and jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b599-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
