Elstein denying Prendi\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Pjerin Prendi, </em>No. A 79 419 210 (B.I.A. Sept. 22, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 79 419 210 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 18, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">As an initial matter, we cannot review Prendi\u2019s claim for relief under the CAT, as he failed to raise it before the BIA and the government objects to his failure to exhaust that claim. <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 122-25 (2d Cir. 2007). We also decline to review Prendi\u2019s asylum claim, because he failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that his application was untimely either in his appeal to the BIA or in his petition for review before this Court. <em>Id. </em>We further decline to review the BIA\u2019s denial of his withholding of removal claim, since Prendi has waived that claim by failing to raise it in his brief on appeal. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">Nevertheless, we note that even if we were to review his asylum and withholding claims, they would fail on the merits. The agency\u2019s finding that Prendi failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ\u2019s decision indicates that she considered in the aggregate the harms that Prendi alleged. <em>See Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 79-80 (2d Cir.2005). The IJ discussed the incident at the voting center as well as the threats to Prendi before finding that he \u201chas not demonstrated anything that reaches the level of past persecution,\u201d a conclusion with which we agree. <em>See Cao He Lin v, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 400 (2d Cir.2005) (noting that an IJ must consider all the evidence in the record that has probative value).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">Further, Prendi failed to present \u201creliable, specific, and supporting evidence\u201d to establish the objective reasonableness of his fear of future persecution. <em>Cordero-Trejo v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 482, 491 (1st Cir. 1994). Nothing in the record indicates that the Socialist Party continued to threaten Prendi or his family in Albania. While Prendi conclusorily asserted' that \u201chis life is in danger\u201d if he returned to Albania, he neither testified nor presented any evidence that Democratic Party activists are persecuted in Albania, and he does not point to anything in the record to support that contention. Therefore, the BIA properly found that Prendi\u2019s fear of persecution was not objectively reasonable. Since Prendi\u2019s asylum claims fails, his withholding claim, which was based on the same grounds, necessarily fails. <em>Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
