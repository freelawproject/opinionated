MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">Appellant Liovardo Galvan Valgara pleaded guilty to a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Pursuant to the terms of a plea agreement, the Government agreed to recommend a sentence consistent with the application of a base offense level of fourteen. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated Valgara\u2019s criminal history at VI and his base offense level at twenty. The base offense level was affected by Valgara\u2019s pri- or Colorado conviction for third-degree assault. Valgara filed a response to the PSR, seeking both a downward departure and a variance from the advisory guidelines range under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court lowered Valgara\u2019s Criminal History Category to V but rejected his request for a variance. The court sentenced Valgara to forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of the advisory guidelines range. Valgara then filed this appeal, arguing his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm Valgara\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b828-15\">On July 3, 2005, a police officer in Greeley, Colorado, observed Valgara walking through the parking lot of the Greeley Mall toward a broken-down vehicle. The officer suspected Valgara was associated with the vehicle and decided to contact him. During the subsequent encounter between the officer and Valgara, the officer observed the butt end of a handgun protruding from Valgara\u2019s waistband. Valgara was arrested at the scene and the unloaded weapon was seized. When Valgara was interviewed, he admitted to possessing the weapon but told officers he took it from a man who had used it to threaten his friend during an argument. Valgara further stated he was apprehended only a short time later, as he walked from the friend\u2019s apartment to his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>A federal grand jury indicted Valgara for possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). Valgara entered into a written plea agreement wherein he agreed to plead guilty to the charge and the Government agreed to recommend a three-level reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility if his offense level exceeded sixteen. Valgara and the Government also acknowledged that Valgara\u2019s prior Colorado conviction for third-degree assault would likely be treated as a crime of violence for purpose of the calculation of his base offense level, resulting in a base offense level of twenty. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4); <em>United States v. Paxton, </em>422 F.3d 1203, 1207 (10th Cir.2005). The Government and Valgara agreed that \u201capplying a base offense level of twenty results in a sentence greater than necessary to satisfy the goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d Accordingly, the Government further agreed to recommend that the district court impose a sentence calculated by applying a total offense level of twelve.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">A PSR was prepared and it calculated Valgara\u2019s criminal history at Category VI based on seventeen criminal history points. The PSR calculated Valgara\u2019s base offense level at twenty, with a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of seventeen. Neither Valgara nor the Government filed an objection to the PSR. Valgara, however, filed a response to the PSR, moving for a downward departure and requesting a sentence below the advisory guidelines range. In support of his request for a downward departure, Valgara argued (1) Criminal History Category VI overrepresented his criminal history and (2) his family ties and responsibilities were present to an exceptional degree. In support of his request for a variance based on the application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), Valgara asked the district court to consider the nature of the offense and his history and characteristics. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Specifically, Valgara referenced the unusual circumstances surrounding the crime of conviction, his exemplary behavior while on pretrial release, his excellent employment history, and his success in overcoming a drinking problem. He also argued the imposition of a six-level increase in his base offense level resulted in an unfair sentencing disparity between him and other defendants sentenced for similar conduct because his Colorado third-degree assault conviction was not as serious as many other crimes of violence which trigger the six-level increase.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Valgara expressly asked the district court to sentence him \u201cas if the six-level enhancement did not apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">After considering Valgara\u2019s response, the probation officer who authored the PSR filed a Sentencing Recommendation adopting the position that Criminal History Category V better represented Valgara\u2019s criminal history. The Sentencing Recommendation further recommended the imposition of a forty-six-month sentence, reasoning that Valgara\u2019s prior sentences of probation and incarceration had not deterred him from continued criminal behavior. At the sentencing hearing, the district court adjusted Valgara\u2019s criminal history from Category VI to Category V, concluding Valgara\u2019s criminal history was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>overrepresented. The court, however, determined Valgara\u2019s family ties and responsibilities were not extraordinary and, accordingly, the court refused to depart downward based on those grounds. <em>See United States v. McClatchey, </em>316 F.3d 1122, 1131 (10th Cir.2003) (\u201cThe fact that a defendant cares for a family member with a mental or physical disability is not by itself sufficient to make the circumstances \u2018exceptional.\u2019 \u201d). The district court also refused to impose a sentence below the low end of the advisory guidelines range, stating, \u201cThe Court believes that the guideline sentence adequately reflects the balancing of all the factors specified in Title 18 United States Code Section 3553(a).\u201d The court sentenced Valgara to forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of the advisory guidelines range based on Criminal History Category V and an offense level of seventeen. Valgara then brought this appeal, challenging the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">This court reviews Valgara\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-61, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because \u201c[rjeasonableness has both procedural and substantive components,\u201d our review \u201cencompasses both the reasonableness of the length of the sentence, as well as the <em>method </em>by which the sentence was calculated.\u201d <em>United States v. Cage, </em>451 F.3d 585, 591 (10th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1055 (10th Cir.2006). Valgara argues his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">\n<em>A. Procedural Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Valgara bases his first challenge to the procedural reasonableness of his sen-fence on his assertion the district court misapprehended the nature of its sentencing discretion. After <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court must consider both the properly calculated guidelines range and the sentencing factors articulated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Lynch, </em>397 F.3d 1270, 1272 (10th Cir.2005). At sentencing, Valgara did not challenge the calculation of his base offense level pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). <em>See Paxton, </em>422 F.3d at 1207 (holding Colorado\u2019s third degree assault statute is a crime of violence under USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)); USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 1 (stating the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the base offense level of twenty set out in \u00a7 2K1.2(a)(4) \u201chas the meaning given that term in \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) and Application Note 1 of the Commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2\u201d). Valgara, however, argued he should be sentenced below the advisory guidelines range based on a consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">Section 3553(a)(6) requires district courts to consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Valgara argued his prior conviction for third-degree assault was a relatively minor offense and contrasted sharply with the more serious nature of other crimes triggering the application of the base offense level of twenty under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(4)(A). <em>See United States v. Trujillo-Terrazas, </em>405 F.3d 814, 819-20 (10th Cir.2005) (concluding that an analysis of the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a) properly includes consideration of the factual nature of prior convictions). Valgara asserted his situation is more analogous to that of a prohibited person<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> without a prior crime-of-violence conviction subsequently convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>\u00a7 922(g)(1). Accordingly, he urged the district court to sentence him as though a base offense level of fourteen applied, arguing such a sentence would achieve the objective of imposing uniform sentences on defendants convicted of similar conduct. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6) (assigning a base offense level of fourteen to prohibited persons convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The district court denied Valgara\u2019s request, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-6\">The Base Offense Level is 20. There is simply no way to avoid that. To do as the parties are suggesting here would be just a flagrant misapplication of the guidelines. The Tenth Circuit is very clear, this is a crime of violence, and we might as well toss the guidelines out the window if we don\u2019t apply them in an intellectually honest manner. And I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s intellectually honest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Valgara argues the district court\u2019s statement \u201cevidences a complete misapprehension of the discretion that <em>Booker </em>explicitly restored to sentencing judges.\u201d We disagree. A review of the complete transcript of the sentencing hearing demonstrates the district court was fully aware of its sentencing discretion and its obligation to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Valgara, quite simply, was asking the district court to use that discretion as an end-run around the application of USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) by applying a guidelines range identical to one calculated without regard to his prior third-degree assault conviction. The court\u2019s comment at sentencing reflects the court\u2019s view that such an approach would be tantamount to wholly ignoring the effect of Valgara\u2019s prior conviction on the calculation of his base offense level and, hence, his advisory guidelines range. The district court was unwilling to take this approach, concluding it would be a \u201cflagrant misapplication of the guidelines\u201d and a disregard of circuit precedent. The court\u2019s refusal to exercise its discretion in the manner sought by Valgara was not procedurally unreasonable. Valgara also argues the district court failed to adequately explain its reasoning for denying him a variance from the advisory guidelines range. After entertaining all Valgara\u2019s arguments, the court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-9\">The defendant has moved for an imposition below the guideline range recommended by the Sentencing Commission on the grounds that the statutory factors do not justify following the guidelines here. The Court disagrees with the exception of the guideline departure for overrepresentation of his criminal history. The Court believes that the guideline sentence adequately reflects the balancing of all the factors specified in Title 18 United States Code Section 3553(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADR\">Because Valgara did not raise this procedural challenge during the sentencing hearing, the issue is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Ruiz-Terrazas, 477 </em>F.3d 1196, 1199 (10th Cir.2007). Thus, Valgara must demonstrate \u201c(i) error, (ii) that is plain, which (iii) affects [his] substantial rights, and which (iv) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is unnecessary for this court to analyze all four plain error factors because it is clear the district court did not commit error when it sentenced Valgara.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">We have recently held that \u201ca specific discussion of Section 3553(a) factors is not required for sentences falling within the ranges suggested by the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1202. Because Valgara does not dispute his sentence falls within a properly calculated guideline range, the district court was not required to specifically explain why it rejected each argument he made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>support of his request for a below-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Jarrillo-Luna, </em>478 F.3d 1226, 1230 (10th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[A] district court\u2019s duty to explain why it chose the given sentence does not also require it to explain why it decided against a different sentence.\u201d). It is clear from the record, including the district court\u2019s statement, that the court considered Valgara\u2019s arguments, the Guidelines, and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Thus, the court satisfied its procedural obligation to indicate it did not \u201crest on the guidelines alone, but considered whether the guideline sentence actually conforms, in the circumstances to the statutory factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Accordingly, Valgara has not shown the sentence imposed by the district court was procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">\n<em>B. Substantive Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Valgara concedes his sentence falls within a properly calculated guidelines range but nevertheless argues it is substantively unreasonable. When a district court \u201ccorrectly applies the Guidelines and imposes a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range, that sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Townley, </em>472 F.3d 1267, 1276 (10th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). Consistent with <em>Booker, </em>our \u201c[r]easonableness review is guided by the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Kristi, </em>437 F.3d at 1053. Those factors \u201cinclude the nature of the offense and characteristics of the defendant, as well as the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the crime, to provide adequate deterrence, to protect the public, and to provide the defendant with needed training or treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Valgara presents several arguments that his sentence is unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including (1) his criminal history overstates the seriousness of his criminal past and is not predictive of future recidivism, (2) his Social Security records indicate he has an excellent employment history, (3) he is the sole source of support for his wife and four children, (4) the crime of conviction was atypical because the gun was not loaded and it was not used in the commission of another offense, and (5) his criminal activity ceased three years ago when he addressed his alcohol abuse problem. Having reviewed and considered Valgara\u2019s arguments, we conclude they are insufficient, both individually and in the aggregate, to rebut the presumption of reasonableness regarding his sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">The sentence imposed by the district court is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b828-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-6\">. Although Valgara characterizes his offense level as including a six-level \u201cincrease\u201d or \"enhancement\u201d because of his prior assault conviction, his characterization is incorrect. Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6), a prohibited person without a prior crime-of-violence conviction is assigned a base offense level of fourteen. A prohibited person with a prior crime-of-violence conviction, like Valgara, is assigned a base offense level of twenty pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2 K2.1(a)(4)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-8\">. For purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) and (a)(6), a prohibited person is \"any person described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) or \u00a7 922(n).\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b832-6\">. Even in the absence of the <em>Kristi </em>presumption, we would conclude Valgara's sentence is substantively reasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
