In general, this court reviews only the decisions of the BIA, except where, as here, the BIA has adopted the analysis and conclusions of the IJ, in which case the IJ\u2019s findings are also reviewed. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-21\">Zewdie complains that the IJ should not have admitted into evidence for impeachment purposes an asylum officer\u2019s referral assessment because the document was not produced to her prior to the immigration hearing and because the asylum officer was not called as a witness by the Government. The referral statement was probative and its admission was not fundamentally unfair. <em>See Bustos-Torres v. INS, </em>898 F.2d 1053, 1055 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-22\">Most of Zewdie\u2019s contentions challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that her testimony was not credible, which is a finding that this court will not review. <em>See Garcia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 662 (5th Cir.2003). \u201cWe will not substitute our judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to the credibility of the witnesses or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). The record does not compel a contrary finding. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78-79 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-23\">Zewdie contends that the evidence she presented was \u201cunrefuted\u201d and compels the conclusion that she is entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. Zewdie has the burden of showing that the evidence supporting her application was compelling. <em>See id. </em>at 78. Because the IJ determined that Zewdie\u2019s testimony was not credible and because this court will not review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, Zewdie cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>carry that burden. <em>See Garcia-Melendez, </em>351 F.3d at 662. The petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
