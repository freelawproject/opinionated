We review the denial of motions to reopen for abuse of discretion, and we review questions of law, including ineffective assistance of counsel claims, de novo. <em>See Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Begum\u2019s motion to reopen because she filed it more than ninety days after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), and failed to satisfy the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), <em>see Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 824 (9th Cir.2003) (setting forth requirements for complying with <em>Matter of Lozada). </em>Begum argues that she did not have to comply with <em>Lozada </em>because the ineffective assistance of her former counsel is clear and manifest. <em>See Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 525-26 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that the failure to comply with the <em>Lozada </em>requirements is not fatal where the alleged ineffective assistance is plain on the face of the administrative record). A review of the record, however, does not support Begum\u2019s characterization. <em>Cf. id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b746-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
