We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A for failure to state a claim, <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">The district court properly dismissed this action because Smith has access to court-appointed counsel. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>690 F.2d 1267, 1272 (9th Cir.1982) (the offer of court-appointed counsel satisfies the Fifth Amendment obligation to provide meaningful access to the courts, even where detainee is denied pretrial access to a law library); <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 350-51, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (prisoners have no per se right to a law library).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">To the extent Smith contends that his court-appointed counsel is inadequate, he must raise this issue in his ongoing criminal proceedings, not in a civil rights complaint in federal court. <em>See Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 44-46, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">Contrary to Smith\u2019s contention, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing his complaint without leave to amend because further amendment would have been futile. <em>See Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b730-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
