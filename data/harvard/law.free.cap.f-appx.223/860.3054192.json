The IJ denied their application for relief under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), finding that their application for asylum was time-barred and that they were ineligible for withholding of removal. We find that we lack jurisdiction to review their asylum petition and that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we dismiss the asylum appeal and affirm the IJ\u2019s decision as to withholding relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-25\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b889-26\">Sarmiento, and derivatively, his wife, applied for asylum and withholding relief in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>2001. In a hearing before the IJ, he claimed that he was politically active in the Liberal Party in Columbia and had participated in campaigns intended to defend democracy and human rights. Additionally, he stated that he had worked for the government and various multinational companies. He alleged that as a result, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) abducted him in 1999 and demanded a war tax from him. He claimed that they threatened to torture and murder him if he did not comply with their demands, forcing him to flee Colombia. A portion of Sarmiento\u2019s testimony with regard to his abduction and political activity was not properly recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The IJ found that Sarmiento\u2019s asylum claim was time-barred since it was not filed within one year of his arrival in the United States. Sarmiento testified that the delay occurred because he was unaware that Colombians were eligible for such relief. The IJ found that this explanation did not constitute an extraordinary circumstance meriting waiver of the one-year requirement. Additionally, the IJ found that Sarmiento was ineligible for withholding relief because any alleged persecution was not based on an actual or imputed political opinion. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">\n<em>Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Absent \u201cthe existence of changed circumstances which materially affect [an] applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay,\u201d asylum applications must be filed within a year of an applicant\u2019s arrival in the United States. INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B) &amp; (D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) &amp; (D). Courts do not have the jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s determinations with regard to this requirement. INA \u00a7 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to review \u201ca decision regarding whether an applicant complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. Jurisdictional provisions in the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 310 (2005), do not affect this jurisdictional rule. <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we find that we may not consider Sarmiento\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">However, we retain jurisdiction over Sarmiento\u2019s withholding claim. In evaluating this claim, we review the IJ\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir. 2001). Conversely, we review the IJ\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence standard and \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">To be eligible for withholding of removal under the INA, an applicant must demonstrate that there is a clear probability of future persecution on account of race, religion, ethnicity, political opinion or social group. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Political persecution within the meaning of the INA may be based on an imputed political opinion, whether correctly or incorrectly attributed. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. To prevail on an imputed political opinion theory, the applicant must show that \u201cthe persecutor falsely attributed an opinion to [him], and then persecuted [him] because of that mistaken belief about [his] views.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number><em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted)(alterations in original). To show the nexus between the imputed opinion and the persecution, the applicant must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of such an opinion.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (emphasis in original). \u201cIt is not enough to show that [the applicant] was or will be persecuted or tortured due to [the applicant\u2019s] refusal to cooperate with the guerillas.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The IJ found that any harassment suffered by Sarmiento was motivated by his economic and business interests. Sarmiento testified that he did contract work for the government and that the guerilla group sought such government contracts to fund their organization.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> FARC\u2019s interest in Sarmiento appears to have been limited to the payment of a war tax and the demand that he cease working on such competing contracts. This evidence lends support to the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Sarmiento did not establish a nexus between the FARC\u2019s alleged persecution and his political opinion because any alleged persecution rested on financial rather than political grounds. Accordingly, we deny Sarmiento\u2019s petition for review of his withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-18\">. Sarmiento also applied for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). Sarmiento makes no arguments on appeal concerning the denial of his request for CAT relief. Therefore, he has waived that issue. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-10\">. The transcript of Sarmiento\u2019s asylum hearing contains many notations of \"indiscernible\u201d and \"inaudible\u201d in place of Sarmiento\u2019s testimony, and Sarmiento argues that this incomplete transcript prejudiced him. However, when rendering the oral decision, the IJ restated the pertinent missing portions, so we are able to review the substance of Sarmiento\u2019s testimony. Sarmiento asserts that the IJ\u2019s version was incomplete, but he does not point to any specific inaccuracies or missing facts. Therefore, Sarmiento has not shown that the transcript deficiencies resulted in prejudice, and we decline to afford him relief on this basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
