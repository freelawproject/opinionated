Fort Wayne police officers obtained a search warrant for Burt\u2019s apartment after the second sale, and during their search, found a large amount of crack cocaine, several crack pipes, and a loaded .22 caliber handgun. In September 2005 Burt was indicted on one count of possessing and one count of distributing crack cocaine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Burt pleaded guilty to possessing crack cocaine in August 2006, and the district court sentenced him to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of the advisory guidelines range. As part of his plea agreement, Burt expressly waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence \u201cto any Court on any ground, including any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel....\u201d Despite the waiver, Burt filed a notice of appeal. His appointed lawyer now moves to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), because he is unable to discern a nonfrivolous basis for the appeal. Counsel\u2019s supporting brief is facially adequate, and Burt has not responded to counsel\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), so we limit our review of the record to the potential issues counsel has identified. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Counsel first questions whether Burt might withdraw his plea. But, as counsel notes, Burt has never expressed a desire to withdraw his plea so any discussion about the plea would be inappropriate. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 671 (7th Cir.2002). Counsel also considers challenging Burt\u2019s sentence, or raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but given the broadly worded appeal waiver, we agree that these potential arguments would be frivolous. <em>See United States v. Lockwood, </em>416 F.3d 604, 607-08 (7th Cir. 2005); <em>United States v. Whitlow, </em>287 F.3d 638, 640 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
