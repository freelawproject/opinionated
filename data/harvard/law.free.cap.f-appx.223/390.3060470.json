Arevalo-San<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>chez\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Arevalo-Sanchez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of Apprendi <em>v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Arevalo-Sanchez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Arevalo-Sanchez contends that his 1993 and 1995 convictions for simple possession of a controlled substance should not have been treated as aggravated felonies for purposes of an eight-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). During the pendency of this case, the Supreme Court decided <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 625, 633, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), which held that a state offense meets the definition of a \u201c \u2018felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u2019 only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law.\u201d In the light of <em>Lopez, </em>Arevalo-Sanchez\u2019s argument has merit. <em>See United States v. Estrada-Mendoza, </em>475 F.3d 258, 260-61 (5th Cir.2007). Arevalo-Sanchez\u2019s unopposed motion to remand his case for resentencing is GRANTED. Arevalo-Sanchez\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED; Arevalo-Sanchez\u2019s sentence is VACATED and REMANDED for resentencing in accordance with <em>Lopez. </em>We express no opinion on the issue whether the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) enhancement was appropriate because Arevalo-Sanchez\u2019s 1995 possession offense qualified as \u201crecidivist possession.\u201d <em>See Lopez, </em>127 S.Ct. at 630 n. 6; <em>United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d 572, 576-77 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
