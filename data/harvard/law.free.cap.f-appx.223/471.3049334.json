Leon Jordan, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Tennessee, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b500-6\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Jason Settle challenges his 120-month prison sentence. Because the district court did not commit reversible error in applying a cross-reference provision to calculate Settle\u2019s guidelines range and because it otherwise imposed a reasonable sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">On July 4, 2002, Memphis police officers observed Jason Settle driving a car with license plates registered to a different vehicle. Before the officers could pull him over for the violation, Settle stopped, exited his car, tossed a pistol to the ground and began to run away. The officers caught him after a short chase and issued Settle a misdemeanor citation for driving an unregistered vehicle, possessing a weapon and evading arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">The officers confiscated the gun, but it apparently did not take long for Settle to re-arm himself. On July 17 he used a semiautomatic handgun to shoot Lonnie Young outside a local market, paralyzing Young from the waist down. He also shot Young\u2019s companion, Taurus Jennings, in the hand during the confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">Tennessee issued a warrant for Settle\u2019s arrest on July 19, but that seemingly did not dissuade him. \u201c[0]n the run\u201d from the authorities, JA 137, Settle moved from motel to motel over the next few weeks. On August 16, in need of money, Settle robbed a woman in her home, firing shots into the house as he fled. The next day he demanded money at gunpoint from Dorian Boothe, a man who had known Settle for a long time and who had \u201cpractically raised him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Boothe resisted and tried to escape, but Settle caught up with him, shot him twice in the thigh and took $3,800 in cash. And on August 21, Settle fired shots at two individuals for talking to the police about his crimes. The police finally arrested Settle on August 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-15\">A month later, a federal grand jury indicted him on one count of violating the federal felon-in-possession statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), relying on the pistol he threw to the ground while attempting to evade police on July 4. Settle pleaded guilty to the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">In preparing Settle\u2019s pre-sentence report, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c), the probation officer learned that the July 17 shooting was not an isolated incident. Settle and Young, it turns out, had been involved in an ongoing dispute since May when Settle stole $250 from Young during a craps game. At some point in May or June, Young retaliated by firing three shots at Settle. The shots missed their mark but hit the car Settle was driving. While explaining these bullet holes to his mother, Settle promised that \u201che was going to do something to Young when he saw him.\u201d JA 138. And just before shooting Young on July 17, Settle exclaimed that \u201cI told you that I was going to blow your ass off.\u201d JA 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-17\">At sentencing, the district court applied \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l) of the guidelines, a cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>reference provision that directs courts to sentence weapons offenders under \u00a7 2X1.1 if they have \u201cused ... any firearm ... in connection with ... another offense.\u201d Reasoning that Settle tried to Mil Young on July 17, the district court used the attempted murder guideline to set Settle\u2019s base offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Xl.l(a), 2A2.1(a)(l) (2008 version). After enhancements for obstruction of justice and for permanently injuring a victim, that left Settle\u2019s total offense level at 34. This, together with Settle\u2019s category III criminal history, resulted in a guidelines range of 188-235 months. The district court sentenced Settle to 120 months, the statutory maximum for his felon-in-possession offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Settle appealed his conviction and sentence, we affirmed, <em>see United States v. Settle, </em>394 F.3d 422, 435 (6th Cir.2005), and the Supreme Court granted Settle\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated our decision and remanded in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <em>see Settle v. United States, </em>545 U.S. 1102, 125 S.Ct. 2560, 162 L.Ed.2d 273 (2005). On remand, we reinstated our opinion as to Settle\u2019s conviction, amended those aspects of the opinion addressing his sentence and remanded the case to the district court for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Settle, </em>414 F.3d 629, 634 (6th Cir.2005). We instructed the district court to (1) decide anew whether to enhance his offense level based on \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l), reasoning that it could apply the provision if it found \u201ca clear connection between the firearm that Settle possessed on July 4, 2002 and any different firearm he possessed thereafter in order to shoot Young,\u201d <em>id., </em>and (2) to \u201cimpose a reasonable sentence that takes into account the [\u00a7 3553(a) ] sentencing factors,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The district court followed our instructions. It again applied the cross-reference provision, determining that the various guns Settle used were connected to the underlying crime, and again arrived at a guidelines range of 188-235 months. It then reimposed the 120-month statutory maximum, adding that it would have sentenced Settle \u201cwith[in] the guidelines\u201d had it been free to do so. JA 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Settle\u2019s appeal brings this case before us for a third time. He again argues that the cross-reference provision in \u00a7 2K2.1 should not apply to him, and he also challenges the reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">Settle\u2019s \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l) argument is largely foreclosed by the amended opinion we entered after the Supreme Court remanded the case to us. He begins by alleging that his behavior after the police recovered the gun underlying his felon-in-possession conviction is not \u201crelevant conduct\u201d under \u00a7 1B1.3 of the guidelines, and that any such behavior thus cannot be taken into account when deciding whether to apply \u00a7 2K2.1\u2019s cross-reference provision. While Settle is correct that \u00a7 1B1.3 generally defines relevant conduct for the purposes of applying the guidelines, we made clear in our prior opinion that, \u201c[i]n determining the relevant conduct for Settle\u2019s offense, the district court will be free to consult Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l).\u201d <em>Settle, </em>414 F.3d at 632; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(4) (relevant conduct includes \u201cany other information specified in the applicable guideline\u201d). That provision broadly encompasses the use or possession of \u201cany firearm ... in connection with the commission or attempted commission of another offense,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l), limited only by our previously stated requirement that the district court find \u201ca clear connection\u201d between the firearm charged in the offense of conviction and the firearm used in connection with the other offense, <em>Settle, </em>414 F.3d at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Settle next contends that the district court erred in finding a clear connection between the gun police recovered on July 4 and the gun Settle used to shoot Young on July 17. We addressed this matter in our amended opinion as well, noting that the facts \u201cset forth in the presentence report ... demonstrate a clear connection between the firearm Settle possessed on July 4, 2002 ... and the other firearms he possessed thereafter (in order to shoot Young and to avoid detection for that shooting).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631 n. 1. Settle did not challenge these facts during the most recent sentencing hearing, and this court\u2019s view of them has not changed in the interim. The uncontested facts show that Settle and Young became embroiled in a dispute in May of 2002; that Young fired shots at Settle at some point in May or June as part of the dispute; that in response to this incident Settle told his mother that \u201che was going to do something to Young when he saw him,\u201d JA 138; and that Settle taunted Young before shooting him on July 17, saying \u201cI told you that I was going to blow your ass off,\u201d JA 136. It is quite reasonable to infer from this evidence that Settle\u2019s desire to \u201cdo something\u201d to Young motivated his \u201cgoing armed\u201d on July 4, JA 56 \u2014 connecting the weapon he carried on that date to the weapon he used to shoot Young on July 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Settle also challenges the propriety of his 120-month sentence. We disagree, as the sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>403 F.3d 373, 383 (6th Cir.2005). The district court fulfilled its procedural obligations by correctly calculating the guidelines range (as we have discussed above), appreciating the advisory nature of the guidelines, <em>see </em>JA 86 (explaining that it needed to determine an appropriate sentence \u201cunder <em>Booker </em>and under 18 [U.S.C. \u00a7 35]53\u201d), and considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in crafting Settle\u2019s sentence, <em>see </em>JA 86-90 (expressly addressing each sentencing factor in light of Settle\u2019s conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The sentence also is substantively reasonable. A 120-month sentence already represents a (roughly) one-third decrease from the bottom of the guidelines range, and Settle offers no sustainable argument why that is unreasonable. The nature and circumstances of the felon-in-possession conviction do not help Settle, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), as he possessed the firearm in connection with an ongoing dispute that prompted him to shoot and paralyze Young, to fire shots at witnesses to Young\u2019s shooting who had talked to police and to rob two individuals at gun point to fund his effort to escape arrest (one of whom, Boothe, Settle shot twice). These facts also bear on Settle\u2019s history and characteristics, <em>see id., </em>as does his \u201clong criminal history starting as a very young person,\u201d JA 87. And they bespeak the seriousness of Settle\u2019s offense, the need to protect the public from him and the necessity of a significant prison sentence to deter him from committing future crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Settle counters that a state court invalidated the felony underlying his felon-in-possession conviction (aggravated assault) after he entered his guilty plea in this case. (Tennessee thought that Settle was 18 rather than 17 when he committed the crime and thus mistakenly tried him in Tennessee Criminal Court rather than juvenile court.) We have already rejected Settle\u2019s contention that this fact undermines his conviction, <em>see Settle, </em>394 F.3d at 430 (reasoning that \u201cCongress clearly intended that the defendant clear his status <em>before </em>obtaining a firearm\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted), and it does not show at any rate that a 120-month sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Settle finally takes the district court to task for seeking to impose a \u201creasonable\u201d sentence, rather than aiming to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of section 3553(a)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Foreman, </em>436 F.3d 638, 644 n. 1 (6th Cir.2006). We have repeatedly held, however, that such a mistake offers no basis for vacating a sentence when, as here, \u201c[t]he district judge\u2019s thorough consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors ... confirms that he did not take his eye off the central sentencing considerations before him.\u201d <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>461 F.3d 752, 755 (6th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Gale, </em>468 F.3d 929, 933 n. 4 (6th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>458 F.3d 505, 511 (6th Cir.2006); <em>cf. Settle, </em>414 F.3d at 632 (\u201cOn remand, the district court must impose a reasonable sentence.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
