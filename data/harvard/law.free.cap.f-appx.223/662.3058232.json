The facts and procedural posture of the case are known to the parties, and we do not repeat them here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-20\">Appellant contends that two distinct errors \u2014 the omission of the willfulness element from the jury instructions and the exclusion of a defense witness\u2019s testimony \u2014 independently require reversal. Since Appellant did not object at trial to the instructions, we review the jury instructions for plain error. <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>116 F.3d 840, 845-48 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc). We review the exclusion of testimony for abuse of discretion, and we will reverse only where the erroneous evidentiary ruling \u201cmore likely than not affected the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>Pang, </em>362 F.3d 1187, 1192 (9th Cir.2004). We reject both of Appellant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">First, we conclude that the omission of an instruction on one element of the crime was not plain error because it did not \u201cseriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). The good faith instruction likely compensated for the omission, and the \u201crecord contains \u2018strong and convincing evidence\u2019 that the missing element of the crime was adequately proved by the prosecution, such that it is \u2018extremely unlikely\u2019 that a properly instructed jury would not have convicted.\u201d <em>United States v. Romm, </em>455 F.3d 990, 1003-05 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting <em>Perez, </em>116 F.3d at 848); <em>see also United States v. Lacy, </em>119 F.3d 742, 747-48 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Second, we hold that exclusion of the defense witness did not \u201cmore likely than not affect[] the verdict\u201d because of the exiguous value of the witness\u2019s opinion and the cumulative nature of the government witnesses\u2019 testimony to which he was intended to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b691-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-22\">.
