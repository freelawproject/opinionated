We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review questions of law de novo, and we review the BIA\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Hernandez-Montiel v. INS, </em>225 F.3d 1084, 1090 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Pham has not established that former prostitutes or repatriates in Vietnam constitute particular social groups.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 1093 (defining \u201cparticular social group\u201d as \u201cone united by a voluntary association, including a former association, <em>or, </em>by an innate characteristic that is so fundamental to the identities or consciences of its members that members either cannot or should not be required to change it.\u201d); <em>see also Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that a \u201cparticular social group\u201d must be narrowly defined); <em>Sanchez-Trujillo v. INS, </em>801 F.2d 1571, 1577 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Even if Pham had established that former prostitutes or repatriates in Vietnam constituted particular social groups, the evidence does not compel the conclusion that Pham has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of being a former prostitute or a repatriate. First, Pham did not establish past persecution. The police did not arrest or physically harm Pham; they required her to report to the police station and threatened to send her to a reeducation camp if she did not leave Vietnam. The harassment she endured from local police during her visit to Vietnam did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See, e.g., Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003). Thus, Pham is not entitled to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Ladha v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">Second, the record evidence reflects that prostitution is widely tolerated by the Vietnamese government, which permits efforts by non-governmental entities to help victims of prostitution. Similarly, the evidence shows that while the government monitors repatriates, it is generally ambivalent toward them. <em>Cf. Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995) (persecution defined as \u201cthe infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ ... in a way regarded as offensive.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, Pham has not \u201cadducted] credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record of facts that would support a reasonable fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Ladha, </em>215 F.3d at 897 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b768-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\">. Pham also argues on appeal that close relatives of people deemed security threats constitute a \"particular social group\u201d and that she is a member of this group because her father was sent to a reeducation camp for a few years after the Vietnam war. We do not address this argument because Pham did not claim this as a ground in her asylum application. She asserted a fear of persecution \"based on [her] membership in particular social groups, women who have worked as prostitutes, and as an individual who has left Vietnam permanently.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
