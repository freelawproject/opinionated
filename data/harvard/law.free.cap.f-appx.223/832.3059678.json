The BIA denied Uddin\u2019s motion to reconsider on the grounds that he did not present additional legal arguments, changes of law, or arguments or aspects of the case that were previously overlooked. We dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-28\">As an initial matter, we note that the instant petition for review, which was filed on May 25, 2006, is untimely as to BIA\u2019s underlying order affirming the denial of Uddin\u2019s motion to reopen, as the petition for review was not filed within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s December 12, 2005 order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). This deadline is not suspended or tolled by the filing of a motion for reconsideration or \u201ca motion to reopen removal proceedings.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Stone v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number><em>INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)) (construing the former 90-day period for filing a petition for review under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(6)). Because the statutory time limit is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional,\u201d we lack jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of Uddin\u2019s motion to reopen and we can review only the BIA\u2019s denial of reconsideration of that affirmance. <em>Stone, </em>115 S.Ct. at 1549 (1995). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review as to the BIA\u2019s underlying order affirming the denial of Uddin\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Uddin asserts the BIA erred by denying his motion to reconsider the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the denial of his motion to reopen. A petitioner alleging errors of fact or law may file a motion to reconsider with the BIA. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b). The BIA has explained that a motion to reconsider \u201cis a request that the [BIA] reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked.\u201d <em>Matter of Cerna, </em>20 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 399, 405 n. 2. However, such motions are disfavored in removal proceedings because, \u201cas a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Cf. INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (motions to reopen). Thus, we review the BIA\u2019s denial of such a motion for an abuse of discretion only. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). Our review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Here, in denying Uddin\u2019s motion to reconsider, the BIA explained that the motion did not present sufficient additional legal arguments, changes of law, or arguments or aspects of the case that were previously overlooked to merit reconsideration. After review of the record, with particular attention to the motion for reconsideration, we discern no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Uddin\u2019s motion did not meet the controlling standard under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b). Accordingly, we cannot say the BIA\u2019s order constituted an arbitrary or capricious exercise of administrative discretion. <em>Garcia-Mir, </em>766 F.2d at 1490. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review of the motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
