Joyce appeals from the May 17, 2006 judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Dorsey, /.), denying his petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Regarding petitioner\u2019s claim that he was \u201cdeprived of his fundamental rights to confront witnesses and to present a defense,\u201d the sole question is: whether the Connecticut Appellate Court\u2019s holding\u2014 \u201cthat the trial court\u2019s limitation of [Detective Sergeant] Prentice\u2019s impeachment for bias was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d <em>State v. Joyce, </em>45 Conn.App. 390, 696 A.2d 993, 999 (1997) \u2014 constitutes an \u201cunreasonable application ... of clearly established federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">[A]n <em>unreasonable </em>application of federal law is different from an <em>incorrect </em>application of federal law.... Congress specifically used the word \u201cunreasonable,\u201d and not a term like \u201cerroneous\u201d or \u201cincorrect.\u201d Under \u00a7 2254(d)(l)\u2019s \u201cunreasonable application\u201d clause, then, a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly. Rather, that application must also be unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-13\"><em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 410-11, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">In its harmless-error analysis, the Connecticut Appellate Court considered the factors deemed pertinent by <em>State v. Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 630 A.2d 577 (1993), which track, verbatim, those identified by the Supreme Court in <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall: </em>\u201cthe importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s ease, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d 475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986); <em>Joyce, </em>696 A.2d at 999; <em>Colton, </em>630 A.2d at 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-15\">Most importantly, the Appellate Court noted that \u201c[o]verall, the state had a strong case against the defendant.\u201d <em>Joyce, </em>696 A.2d at 999. This is demonstrably correct: (i) three witnesses inside the market made in-court identifications of petitioner; (ii) one of the three witnesses also testified that the petitioner had been shot in the head during the robbery; (iii) another witness identified the petitioner as the individual with \u201cblood coming off his forehead\u201d who robbed her at gunpoint of her purse and stole her car outside the market; (iv) the car and purse were discover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>ed in Hartford near the apartment in which petitioner was also found; and (v) when found by the Hartford Police, petitioner had a gunshot wound to his head. The Connecticut Appellate Court compared Prentice\u2019s testimony against this evidence, and found that \u201cPrentice\u2019s testimony was ... cumulative and corroborative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In these circumstances, we agree with the district court that \u201cthe evidence against [petitioner was overwhelming,\u201d and that the Connecticut Appellate Court\u2019s finding \u201cwas, at the very least, a reasonable application of the harmless-error factors.\u201d <em>Joyce v. Lantz, </em>No. 3:03 Civ. 655(PCD), 2006 WL 1455598, at *5 (D.Conn. May 16, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We affirm the denial of petitioner\u2019s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel for substantially the reasons set forth by the district court. <em>See Joyce, </em>2006 WL 1455598, at *6-*9.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
