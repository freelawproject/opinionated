We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence. <em>Lopez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 847, 850-51 (9th Cir.2004). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding because Flores Ahumada\u2019s testimony was materially inconsistent. <em>Cf. Vera-Villegas v. INS, </em>330 F.3d 1222, 1231-34 (9th Cir.2003). The IJ gave Flores Ahumada ample opportunity to clarify his whereabouts during 1994, but his clarifications were not sufficient. Moreover, his supporting documentary evidence of presence during 1994 did not compel a conclusion to the contrary. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that an IJ may require documentary evidence when he either does not believe an applicant or does not know what to believe). The IJ therefore properly concluded that Flores Ahumada did not meet his burden to establish his continuous physical presence in the United States after May 31, 1992. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b713-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
