WINTER, JOS\u00c9 A. CABRANES, PETER W. HALL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b71-12\"> The Clerk of Court is directed to correct the official caption to reflect the correct spelling of defendants-appellants\u2019 names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b72-10\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Defendants Cleofas Contreras Vazquez and Jose Ernesto Garcia appeal their convictions, after a jury trial, for conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms and more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">Turning first to the issues raised in Vazquez\u2019s appeal, we conclude that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. \u201c[A] defendant making an insufficiency claim bears a very heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Desena, </em>287 F.3d 170, 177 (2d Cir.2002). Vazquez cannot meet that burden here because the evidence presented at trial showed the existence of a large-scale narcotics conspiracy, and \u2014 through wiretap and live testimony \u2014 Vazquez\u2019s active and knowing involvement in that conspiracy. The District\u2019s Court\u2019s denial of Vazquez\u2019s motion for a new trial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 also was appropriate for this reason. We conclude further that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Government Exhibit 74 pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). <em>See United States v. Pascarella, </em>84 F.3d 61, 69 (2d Cir.1996) (admission of Rule 404(b) evidence reviewed for \u201cclear abuse of discretion\u201d). The tape-recorded conversation, in which Vazquez appeared to be actively involved in an illegal marijuana distribution conspiracy, was admissible to rebut Vazquez\u2019s argument that he lacked the knowledge and intent necessary for him to be convicted for his involvement in the charged conspiracy. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in admitting the evidence. Finally, we conclude that Government Exhibit 75 was properly admitted into evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">Turning to the issues raised in Garcia\u2019s appeal, we conclude that the District Court did not err in denying Garcia\u2019s Rule 33 motion for a new trial because Garcia has failed to explain how the alleged suppression of impeachment material prejudiced him in any way: the cooperating witness\u2019s intoxication and drug addiction were made known to defendants, and defendants made extensive use of this information during cross-examination of the witness. We also determine, substantially for the reasons stated by the District Court, <em>see United States v. Garcia, </em>No. 04 Cr. 603(HB), 2005 WL 589627, at *6-*7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 14, 2005), that the Government satisfied the probable cause and necessity requirements of the wiretap statute. Finally, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to give an <em>Allen </em>charge, and that the District Court\u2019s brief statement at the conclusion of the charge did not coerce the jury into reaching a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">We have considered all of defendants\u2019 arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
