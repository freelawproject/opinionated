Georgia, </em>450 U.S. 261, 271, 101 S.Ct. 1097, 67 L.Ed.2d 220 (1981). Accordingly, defense counsel owe their clients a \u201cduty to avoid conflicts of interests.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-23\">\u201cIn order to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment [based on a conflict of interest], a defendant who raised no objection at trial must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>ed his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). A defendant who makes this showing need not show prejudice to the outcome of the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 349-50,100 S.Ct. 1708.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Thus, \u201c[t]o show an actual conflict resulting in an adverse effect, [a defendant] must demonstrate that some plausible alternative defense strategy or tactic might have been pursued but was not and that the alternative defense was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney\u2019s other loyalties or interests.\u201d <em>Hovey v. Ayers, </em>458 F.3d 892, 908 (9th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Wells, </em>394 F.3d 725, 733 (9th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Conflicts of interest can arise in the context of simultaneous representation. <em>United States v. Elliot, </em>463 F.3d 858, 865 (9th Cir.2006). Here, defense counsel identified Ms. Norma Holstrom (\u201cHolstrom\u201d) as a potential defense witness because Holstrom\u2019s testimony could assist the defense in establishing a pattern of coercive conduct by the investigator who obtained McClelland\u2019s confession, thereby supporting the defense\u2019s theory that McClelland\u2019s confession was false. Despite his duty to avoid conflicts of interest, McClelland\u2019s defense counsel took Holstrom on as a client, knowing that by doing so Holstrom might subsequently be impeded from testifying on McClelland\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">When the district court learned of defense counsel\u2019s simultaneous representation of Holstrom and McClelland, it ruled that Holstrom would not be permitted to testify until independent counsel for Holstrom appeared in court and assured the court Holstrom had been fully advised of her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Defense counsel, however, neither arranged for independent counsel to appear in court with Holstrom nor attempted again to call Holstrom as a witness. Rather, defense counsel informed McClelland the court had not allowed Holstrom to testify and that decision might \u201cbe an issue that she might be able to raise on appeal and she might want to look at that and talk to another attorney later on if we did not win the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to grant McClelland\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion <em>de novo. See United States v. Fry, </em>322 F.3d 1198, 1200 (9th Cir.2003). The district court\u2019s factual findings underlying the decision to grant McClelland\u2019s motion, however, are reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Alaimalo, </em>313 F.3d 1188, 1191 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">On this record, the district court properly determined McClelland\u2019s Sixth Amendment Right to conflict-free counsel was violated by defense counsel\u2019s simultaneous representation of Holstrom. The district court, despite speculating that Holstrom\u2019s testimony might be cumulative, ultimately found that the testimony was relevant and advantageous. Moreover, the district court found the loss of Holstrom\u2019s testimony \u201cwas entirely due to the fact that [defense counsel] had that actual conflict.\u201d Based on the record before us, these factual finding are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">The district court, therefore, did not err in granting McClelland\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion because calling Holstrom as a witness was a \u201ctactic [that] might have been pursued but was not\u201d because it \u201cwas inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to [defense counsel\u2019s] other loyalties or interests.\u201d <em>Hovey, </em>458 F.3d at 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">The Government\u2019s argument that Holstrom\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights would equally have been a concern had she not been represented by McClelland\u2019s defense counsel is unavailing because the relevant question is whether defense counsel failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>to pursue \u201csome plausible alternative defense strategy or tactic\u201d that may have resulted in Holstrom testifying at McClelland\u2019s trial, not whether the foregone strategy would have been successful. <em>See United States v. Elliot, </em>463 F.3d 858, 866 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The Government\u2019s argument that under <em>United States v. Mett, </em>65 F.3d 1531, 1534-1535 (9th Cir.1995) the loss of Holstrom\u2019s testimony was at most the loss of the benefit of defense counsel\u2019s joint representation of McClelland, not an adverse affect on that representation, is also unavailing. <em>Mett </em>is factually inapposite. Unlike the defendants in <em>Mett, </em>McClelland did not hire conflicted defense counsel. Rather, at the time she hired defense counsel, he did not represent Holstrom, and there is no evidence she had reason to believe he would be representing Holstrom. In accepting Holstrom as a client, McClelland\u2019s defense counsel violated his duty to avoid conflicts of interest. Thus, McClelland lost the preexisting benefit of her defense counsel\u2019s preparation, not the potential benefit of hiring an attorney with a known conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Contrary to the Government\u2019s final argument, a defense counsel\u2019s representation .is significantly worsened when his competing obligation causes him to abandon efforts to have a witness testify for the defendant. <em>Mett, </em>65 F.3d at 1535 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b770-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
