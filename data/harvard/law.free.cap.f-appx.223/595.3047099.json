We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Jones v. Blanas, </em>393 F.3d 918, 926 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants where the record shows that physicians and staff at High Desert State Prison monitored Hill on several occasions, treated his hypertension with prescription drugs and his pain with Motrin, ordered x-rays of his knee, and referred him for an orthopedic consult. The record also shows the Medical Authorization Review (\u201cMAR\u201d) Committee approved Hill\u2019s request for arthroscopic knee surgery and denied his request for a cardiology consultation because it concluded his hypertension was adequately treated by monitoring and medication. Hill\u2019s surgeon later can-celled his knee surgery because of Hill\u2019s high blood pressure and recommended a cardiac consultation. This evidence merely shows a difference of opinion between Hill and his treating physicians and the MAR, and between the MAR and Hill\u2019s surgeon, which does not constitute an Eighth Amendment violation. <em>See Sanchez v. Vild, </em>891 F.2d 240, 242 (9th Cir. 1989), Hill\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AUE\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
