December 17, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-19\">On appeal, petitioner contends that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings because petitioner \u201cdid not receive notice of hearing due to a change of address\u201d and \u201cwas not informed of a requirement to advise the INS of any change of address.\u201d Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-20\">Upon a review of the record, we conclude that the BIA acted well within its broad discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s <em>third </em>motion to reopen his removal proceedings, which was filed more than <em>eleven years </em>after issuance of the IJ\u2019s exclusion order. <em>See, e.g., INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (noting that \u201cthe Attorney General has broad discretion to grant or deny\u201d motions to reopen deportation proceedings) (internal quotation marks omitted). The IJ properly concluded, when adjudicating one of petitioner\u2019s previous motions to reopen, that petitioner failed to show \u201creasonable cause for his absence\u201d from his removal proceedings. <em>See Yong Bin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>Mei, </em>No. A 72 455 938 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 12, 1993). Accordingly, in denying petitioner\u2019s instant motion, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the Id\u2019s <em>in absentia </em>removal order was proper. Nor did the BIA abuse its discretion in relying for further support of its denial on (1) the length of time elapsed between petitioner\u2019s removal proceedings and the filing of the instant motion to reopen; and (2) petitioner\u2019s failure to demonstrate eligibility for asylum or other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We have considered all of petitioner\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
