Specifically, Dick\u2019s contends that its violations of the Gun Control Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921-31, were not \u201cwillful\u201d within the meaning of the statute and therefore revocation of its license was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-15\">Having reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the applicable law, and having the benefit of oral argument, we conclude that a panel opinion further addressing the issues raised would serve no jurisprudential purpose. Therefore, on the grounds identified by the district court, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
