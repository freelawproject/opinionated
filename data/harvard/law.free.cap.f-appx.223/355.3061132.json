Marediya argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>that he was entitled to withholding of removal and relief under the CAT because he has been persecuted by Hindus in India on account of his Islamic faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The record supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Marediya failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted due to his religious affiliation if he returned to India. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 303-04 (5th Cir. 1997). The BIA\u2019s decision affirming the denial of withholding of removal and relief under the CAT is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138-39 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
