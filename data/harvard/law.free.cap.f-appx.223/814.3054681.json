McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b842-20\">In this pro se state prisoner \u00a7 1983 appeal, Plaintiff alleges that he was assaulted by a prison guard and subsequently subjected to disciplinary charges arising out of the incident. The matter was referred to a magistrate judge, who relied on <em>Steele v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>355 F.3d 1204 (10th Cir.2003), and <em>Ross v. County of Bernalillo, </em>365 F.3d 1181 (10th Cir.2004), for the respective propositions that \u201c[ejxhaustion is a pleading requirement, rather than an affirmative defense\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>(Doc. # 93 at 6) and that the \u201ctotal exhaustion rule\u201d requires dismissal where some claims are exhausted but others remain unexhausted <em>(id. </em>at 11). The district court adopted this section of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and therefore dismissed Plaintiffs suit without prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Defendants appropriately concede that <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 910, 925-26, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007), did away with the total exhaustion requirement. <em>See also Freeman v. Watkins, </em>479 F.3d 1257, 1259 (10th Cir.2007). Of course, <em>Jones </em>also overruled <em>Steele </em>by concluding that exhaustion is an affirmative defense. Thus, the district erred in adopting these aspects of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. Accordingly, we REVERSE and REMAND the district court\u2019s dismissal of this action for a reexamination consistent with <em>Jones. </em>We note our recent clarification in <em>Roberts v. Barreras, </em>484 F.3d 1236 (10th Cir.2007), of the burden of proof associated with the exhaustion affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Lastly, we GRANT Plaintiffs request for <em>in forma pauperis </em>status for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-21\">After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-10\">. The magistrate judge also addressed the motion for summary judgment brought by Defendant Nelson, the only defendant against whom Plaintiff adequately exhausted his claim for excessive force. The district court, however, denied as moot Defendant Nelson\u2019s motion for summary judgement given its dismissal for lack of total exhaustion in accordance with <em>Ross. </em>Therefore, no aspect of that motion is before this court on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
