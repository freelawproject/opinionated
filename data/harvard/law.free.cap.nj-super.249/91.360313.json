In <em>Midland Ins. Co. v. Colatrella, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>612, 617, 510 A.2d 30 (1986), the Supreme Court held that the lien attached where the UM claim was settled under the policy limits. However, the Court left unresolved \u201cthe more difficult question whether the workers\u2019 compensation lien should attach when the uninsured motorist coverage is less than the full amount of plaintiff\u2019s damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619, 510 A.2d 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">In the present case, plaintiff obtained a compensation award and settled his UM claim for the policy limit, but contends that he has still not been paid the full amount of his damages. The Law Division found that the compensation carrier nevertheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>is entitled to be repaid from the UM recovery. We find that result neither necessary nor fair and accordingly reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The facts are uncomplicated. During the course of his employment, plaintiff was involved in a motor vehicle accident with a hit and run driver. As a result of his injuries, which included a fracture of the left femur shaft and both feet, as well as cartilage injury to the left knee, plaintiff recovered $158,819.59 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits from defendant, his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier. Plaintiff also made a claim for UM coverage under his own automobile insurance policy which, coincidentally, was also issued by defendant. Defendant tendered the policy limit, $100,000, and by stipulation the net proceeds (after deduction of counsel fees and costs) were placed in escrow pending a determination as to whether they were subject to a compensation lien. Plaintiff thereupon instituted the present declaratory judgment action for a determination as to whether the lien attaches. Relying on <em>Midland, </em>the Law Division judge held that defendant was entitled to retain the net UM proceeds as partial reimbursement of its compensation payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">In <em>Midland, </em>Colatrella had settled his UM claim for $27,500, which was $2,500 less than the $30,000 policy limit. The Supreme Court permitted Midland, the compensation carrier, to recapture from the UM settlement the $9,270.52 it had paid in compensation benefits, finding in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-40 a legislative intent \u201cthat a compensation lien should attach to the recovery from a third-party tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 510 <em>A.</em>2d 30; <em>see also Christy v. City of Newark, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>598, 609-610, 510 A.2d 22 (1986). But the Court specifically declined to characterize an uninsured motorist or its carrier as a \u201cthird person\u201d within the meaning of the statute and instead relied \u201con the belief that the primary concern of the Legislature here, as in other work-related injuries caused by third-party tortfeasors, is to integrate the sources of recovery.\u201d <em>Midland, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 618, 510 A.2d 30. Indeed, if the insured motorist or its carrier were a \u201cthird person\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-40, there would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>appear no need or basis for the Court to reserve \u201cthe more difficult question whether the workers\u2019 compensation lien should attach when the uninsured motorist coverage is less than the full amount of plaintiff\u2019s damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619, 510 A.2d 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Midland </em>thus found no statutory lien, but rather imposed a lien as a judicial remedy to assure that \u201c[i]n the present case, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and the uninsured motorist statute worked as the Legislature intended.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That remedy \u201cworked\u201d, the Court explained, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">Colatrella promptly received benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and later settled his uninsured motorist claim <em>under the policy limits. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-7\"><em>Ibid. </em>It was \u201c[bjecause of that settlement\u201d that the Court found it unnecessary to decide \u201cthe more difficult question\u201d whether the lien should attach when the UM coverage is less than the full amount of plaintiff\u2019s damages. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The significance of the UM settlement under the policy limits was that it established that Colatrella had obtained duplicate recoveries for the same expenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Where an injured party\u2019s combined compensation and UM recoveries do not indemnify him in full for his loss, the remedy fashioned in <em>Midland </em>to forestall a double recovery is inappropriate and unjust. The relevant equitable principle is that \u201cthe right of subrogation does not arise until the injured party has been made whole.\u201d <em>Culver v. Ins. Co. of North America, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>493, 500, 535 A.2d 15 (App.Div.1987), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 115 <em>N.J. </em>451, 559 A.2d 400 (1989).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">... [D]espite the insurer\u2019s general subrogation right, it is clear that if an insured who has recovered only part of his loss from his insurer then recovers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>an additional payment from the tortfeasor, he has no liability to repay the insurer unless the total recovery exceeds his total loss. The rule formulated by <em>Camden Fire Ins. Asso. v. Prezioso, </em>93 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>318, 320 [116 <em>A. </em>694] (Ch.1922), is that \u201cthe insured can be called upon to account to the insurer-subrogee, only if he has recovered more from the insurer and the wrong-doer than the total of his loss, and then only for the excess. The excess he holds in trust for the insurer.\u201d <em>See also, </em>adopting this formulation, <em>Federal Insurance Co. v. Engelkom, </em>141 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>349, 351 [57 A.2d 478] (E. &amp; A.1947).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\"><em>Id. </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 501-502, 535 A.2d 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Application of those equitable principles here gives maximum effect to both the purposes of workers\u2019 compensation third-party practice and the UM statute. Professor Larson states the analysis cogently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">The theory of third party procedure in compensation law rests on the assumption that typically the third-party recovery will cover all of plaintiffs loss, and that therefore to retain the tort recovery and compensation would result in double recovery of the first sort, that is, exceeding actual loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">What throws everything out of balance when third party procedure is extended to the proceeds of uninsured motorist endorsements is that typically the injured person\u2019s recovery under that endorsement, because of low policy limits such as $5,000 or $10,000, will <em>not </em>cover all his loss. Usually any \u201cdouble recovery,\u201d then, would be of the second sort, that is, falling short of actual loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">We are now ready to ask: is the second sort of double recovery obnoxious to the policies of compensation acts or uninsured motorist acts, or to public policy in general? The question almost answers itself. There can be no conceivable policy objection to allowing an injured person to retain two recoveries that, when combined, still do not make him whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">2A Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 71.23(h) at 14-37 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">Professor Larson also states what we find to be a persuasive response to defendant\u2019s argument that a UM recovery should be subject to the same rules as any other third-party recovery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-13\">But this overlooks one crucial difference: the uninsured motorist proceeds were the product of insurance paid for by the employee. There is no conceivable reason why a compensation carrier should have any claim on them. In the normal third-party situation, however, the tort proceeds owe nothing to the employee\u2019s expenditure. It should be added that, since this kind of markedly inadequate tort recovery is not usual in regular third party practice, it only distorts matters to use it as a basis for making policy as to uninsured motorist cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 14-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-15\">The judgment awarding defendant the UM proceeds is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>versed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for a determination of the full amount of plaintiffs damages and for the entry of judgment imposing a lien on the UM proceeds only if and to the extent those proceeds, together with the compensation payments, exceed the full amount of plaintiff\u2019s damages.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-10\"> <em>See Midland Ins.
