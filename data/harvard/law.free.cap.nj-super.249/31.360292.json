On November 1, 1986, Owen Bello owned an automobile that he purchased, registered and insured in Florida. Allstate, which is authorized to transact automobile and motor vehicle liability insurance business in Florida and New Jersey, issued its automobile policy to Owen Bello in Florida prior to November 1, 1986. After Allstate issued the policy, Owen Bello moved to New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">On November 1, 1986, Eric Bello, Owen Bello\u2019s brother, was employed by defendant Hurley Limousines, Inc. (Hurley), which owned a 1983 Chevrolet four-door sedan (motor vehicle). The Hurley motor vehicle was registered as a limousine and bore the \u201cOL,\u201d omnibus livery, license plates. Hurley used the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>motor vehicle as a limousine to transport passengers for consideration and apparently it was rented with a driver employed by Hurley. On November 1, 1986, Fireman\u2019s Fund insured the Hurley motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Sometime before November 1, 1986 and while living in New Jersey, Owen Bello separated from his wife, Nancy. Owen Bello had custody of the two infant children bom of the marriage, Justine and Katrina, and lived with them in Rahway, New Jersey. At the time, Nancy was involved in an adulterous relationship with Eric Bello and they shared an apartment in Roselle Park, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">At about 1:00 p.m. on Sunday, November 1,1986, Owen Bello, Eric Bello, Nancy and the two infant children were in Rahway Park. Owen Bello stood outside of his parked automobile, which had its engine off, looking in the trunk for a band-aid for his daughter Katrina, who stood with him. The Hurley motor vehicle was parked behind Owen Bello\u2019s automobile with its engine off. Eric Bello sat in the driver\u2019s seat and Nancy sat in the front passenger seat with Justine on her lap. Eric Bello then started the engine of the Hurley motor vehicle with Nancy and Justine inside. Apparently perceiving this, Owen Bello began to bang and pull on the partially opened driver\u2019s side window of the Hurley motor vehicle. Eric Bello immediately drove the Hurley motor vehicle forward causing Owen Bello\u2019s left arm to catch in the partially opened window. Eric Bello continued to drive forward with Owen Bello caught on the outside of the Hurley motor vehicle. After the Hurley motor vehicle traveled approximately 100 feet with Eric Bello \u201caccelerating and decelerating\u201d the Hurley motor vehicle to dislodge his brother, Owen Bello was fully freed. Owen Bello then \u201cflipped into the air, bounced onto and off the vehicle\u2019s trunk and onto the roadway, sustaining massive head injuries.\u201d Owen Bello was rendered unconscious and remained in a coma from November 1,1986, the date of the accident, until his death from complications of his original injuries on May 25, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>This action was instituted against Eric Bello, Hurley and Nancy Bello to recover damages for Owen Bello\u2019s personal injuries sustained as a result of this accident. Subsequently, the complaint was amended to seek personal injury protection benefits under both Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s and Allstate\u2019s insurance policies. While the matter was pending below, Owen Bello died and Eaquel Bello, Owen Bello\u2019s sister, was appointed administratrix ad prosequendum and general administratrix of Owen Bello\u2019s estate. All defendants filed answers with the exception of Nancy Bello, against whom a default judgment was entered. Fireman\u2019s Fund moved for summary judgment, contending that it was not responsible for personal injury protection benefits because its policy specifically excluded recovery for such benefits when the injuries incurred were the result of intentional acts. Allstate moved for summary judgment, contending that it was not under any liability to pay personal injury protection benefits under its policy because the accident involved a limousine, not an automobile as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2a. Plaintiff filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, seeking a declaration of coverage under both policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">At the conclusion of the argument, the trial court granted the motions of Fireman\u2019s Fund and Allstate and denied the motion of plaintiff. With respect to Fireman\u2019s Fund, the trial court held that coverage was excluded because Owen Bello\u2019s conduct contributed to his bodily injuries. According to the trial court \u201c[t]he uncontroverted facts of this tragic event indicate [that Owen Bello] was attempting to forcibly keep the vehicle and its passenger from leaving the area, running along side the accelerating vehicle, holding on, and eventually falling away from the moving vehicle.\u201d With respect to Allstate, the trial court held that it was not under any liability to plaintiff because the accident involved a limousine, not an automobile, as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2a. Thereafter, plaintiff settled the claims against Hurley and Eric Bello with Fireman\u2019s Fund for its liability insurance policy limits of $500,000. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">With respect to plaintiffs appeal as to Allstate, the critical issue is whether the motor vehicle owned by Hurley and operated by Eric Bello was an \u201cautomobile\u201d as defined by the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act (Act). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1 to -35. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 of the Act, as it was in effect at the time of the accident, mandated personal injury protection coverage and provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">Every automobile liability insurance policy insuring an automobile as defined in this act against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury, death and property damage sustained by any person arising out of ownership, operation, maintenance or use of an automobile shall provide personal injury protection coverage, as defined hereinbelow, under provisions approved by the Commissioner of Insurance, for the payment of benefits without regard to negligence, liability or fault of any kind, to the named insured and members of his family residing in his household who sustained bodily injury as a result of an accident while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile, <em>or as a pedestrian, being struck by an automobile or </em>by an object propelled by or from an automobile, to other persons sustaining bodily injury while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using the automobile of the named insured, with the permission of the named insured, and to pedestrians, sustaining bodily injury caused by the named insured\u2019s automobile or struck by an object propelled by or from such automobile. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">As used in the Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2a defines \u201cautomobile\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">\u201cAutomobile\u201d means a private passenger automobile of a private passenger or station wagon type that is owned or hired <em>and is neither used as a public or livery conveyance for passengers nor rented to others with a </em>driver____ [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">It is fundamental that \u201cthe meaning of a statute must ... be sought in the language in which the act is framed, and if that is plain, ... the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d <em>Sheeran v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., Inc., </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>548, 556, 404 <em>A.</em>2d 625 (1979) (quoting <em>Caminetti v. United States, </em>242 <em>U.S. </em>470, 485, 37 <em>S.Ct. </em>192, 194, 61 <em>L.Ed. </em>442, 452 (1917)). <em>See State v. Maguire, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>508, 528, 423 A.2d 294 (1980); <em>Vreeland v. Byrne, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>292, 302, 370 A.2d 825 (1977); <em>DeHart v. Bambrick, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>541, 549, 427 A.2d 113 (App.Div.1981). <em>See also </em>2A <em>Suther</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>land, Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 46.01 at 48-49 (C. Sands 4th Ed.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">This principle applied here leaves no room for judicial interpretation. The plain language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2a clearly eliminates the Hurley motor vehicle as an automobile for purposes of the Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2a defines automobile in clear and unambiguous terms as a private passenger or station wagon type that is owned or hired but is neither used as a public or livery conveyance for passengers nor rented to others with a driver. Although the Hurley motor vehicle was a private passenger type automobile, it was registered and used as a public or lively conveyance for passengers and rented to others with a driver. Its status was a limousine, not an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The motor vehicle\u2019s classification as a public or livery conveyance for passengers does not change by its temporary or transitory use for some other purpose. Rather, the motor vehicle\u2019s general status controls its classification. Had the Legislature intended that the motor vehicle\u2019s use at the precise time of the accident controlled its classification, it is reasonable to conclude that the Legislature would have included language to that effect in the Act. The Legislature did not include such language and in our view it is clear that the Legislature did not intend to do so. Consequently, Eric Bello\u2019s operation of the Hurley motor vehicle for his personal use at the time of the accident did not change its classification to an automobile within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Moreover, classifying vehicles by their use at the precise time of the accident would create chaos and undermine the purposes of the Act. New Jersey\u2019s no-fault law is designed to limit litigation in the area of personal injury claims by providing a system of personal injury protection regardless of fault. One of the no-fault law\u2019s purposes is to insure prompt payment of medical and hospital bills, without the injured party having to engage in or await the outcome of lengthy and costly litigation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>In our view, it would not be in the public interest to classify vehicles on the basis of their use at the precise time of the accident, and certainly, such manner of classification was not intended by the Legislature in passing the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Accordingly, the trial court properly held that the Allstate policy did not provide personal injury protection benefits to plaintiff for Owen Bello\u2019s injuries sustained in this accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">However, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Fireman\u2019s Fund. Because Fireman's Fund\u2019s policy did not insure an automobile within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2a, Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s personal injury protection coverage was mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3. The critical issue on this appeal, therefore, is whether the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy exclusions bar Owen Bello\u2019s estate from collecting personal injury protection benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Summary judgment is a stringent remedy and should not be granted unless the pleadings, affidavits and other papers show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Moreover, where, as here, a subjective element is involved, such as Owen Bello\u2019s intent when he banged and pulled on the window of the Hurley motor vehicle, summary judgment is to be granted with caution. <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>67, 76, 110 A.2d 24 (1954); <em>Exxon Corporation v. Wagner, </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, 541, 382 A.2d 45 (App.Div.1977); <em>Allen v. Planning Bd. of Evesham Tp., </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>359, 363-64, 349 A.2d 99 (App.Div.1975). In evaluating such a motion, we are guided by the standards set forth in <em>United Advertising Corp. v. Metuchen, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>193, 195-96, 172 A.2d 429 (1961), <em>reaff'd, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>1, 198 A.2d 447 (1964), which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">Although it must be recognized that the summary judgment procedure has a needful place in our judicial system as a protection \u201cagainst groundless claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>and frivolous defenses, not only to save antagonists the expense of protracted litigation but also to reserve judicial manpower and facilities to cases which meritoriously command attention,\u201d <em>Robbins v. Jersey City, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>229 [128 A.2d 673] (1957), sight should never be lost of the fact that such procedure is no substitute for a full plenary trial. <em>Battle v. General Cellulose Co., </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>538 [129 A.2d 865] (1957). Only where it is palpably disclosed that there is no genuine issue of fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law should the motion be granted, <em>R.R. </em>4:58. It is the movant\u2019s burden to exclude any reasonable doubt as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. All inferences of doubt are drawn in favor of the opponent of the motion. <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>67 [110 A.2d 24] (1954); <em>Frank Rizzo, Inc. v. Alatsas, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>400 [142 A.2d 861] (1958).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In resolving the motion, the moving papers and all inferences therefrom are to be considered in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Ruvolo v. American Cas. Co., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>490, 499, 189 A.2d 204 (1963); <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>at 75, 110 A.2d 24. If there is the slightest doubt as to the existence of a material issue of fact, the motion should be denied. <em>Garley v. Waddington, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>173, 179, 425 A.2d 1084 (App.Div.1981). As stated in <em>Brenner and Co. v. Perl, </em>72 <em>N.J.Super. </em>160, 167-68, 178 A.2d 19 (App.Div.1962):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">The factual issues ... involved cannot be resolved on the basis of affidavits and depositions where inferences for and against the truth of facts grounding the existence of a cause of action arise therefrom, no matter how strongly they point in one direction or the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The point is that summary judgment should not be granted unless the right thereto appears so clearly as to leave no room for controversy. Considered in this light, we are satisfied that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Fireman\u2019s Fund. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> mandated personal injury protection benefits coverage and provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">Every liability insurance policy issued in this State on a motor vehicle, exclusive of an automobile as defined in section 2 of P.L.1972, c. 70 (C. 39:6A-2), but including a motorcycle, insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury, death, and property damage sustained by any person arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>vehicle shall provide personal injury protection coverage benefits, in accordance with section 4 of P.L.1972, c. 70 (C. 39:6A-4), to pedestrians who sustain bodily injury in the State caused by the named insured\u2019s motor vehicle or by being struck by an object propelled by or from the motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The pertinent exclusionary provisions of the policy relied upon by the trial court in determining that the Fireman\u2019s Fund did not provide personal injury protection benefits to Owen Bello, read:</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Exclusions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">The insurance under this endorsement does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">(a) to bodily injury to a person whose conduct contributed to the injury in any of the following ways:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-10\">(1) while committing a high misdemeanor or a felony or seeking to avoid lawful apprehension or arrest by a policy [sic] officer, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-11\">(2) while acting with specific intent to cause injury or damage to himself or others;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-12\"><em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-7 (authorizing the above exclusions). Contrary to plaintiff's argument, the exclusions authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-7 apply to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-7 are <em>in pari materia </em>with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3 and therefore, must be read together.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">Our function in construing these provisions of the Fireman\u2019s Fund insurance policy, as with any other contract, is to search broadly for the probable common intent of the parties to find a reasonable meaning in keeping with the express general purposes thereof. <em>See Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Robert, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>561, 567, 178 A.2d 185 (1962); <em>Tooker v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>217, 222-23, 319 A.2d 743 (App.Div.1974); <em>The Insurance Co. of State of Penna. v. Palmieri, </em>81 <em>N.J.Super. </em>170, 179, 195 A.2d 205 (App.Div.1963), <em>certif. denied, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>389, 197 A.2d 15 (1964). In this pursuit, a broad and liberal view should be taken so that the policy is construed in favor of the insured. In addition, we must also be mindful of the corollary rule of construction that if the clause in question is one of exclusion or exception designed to limit the protection afforded by the general coverage provisions of the policy, a strict interpretation is in order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>See Butler v. Bonner &amp; Barnewall, Inc., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>567, 574, 267 A.2d 527 (1970); <em>Mazzilli v. Accident &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. of Winterthur, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7-8, 170 A.2d 800 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">With these principles in mind, there cannot be the slightest doubt that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Owen Bello was acting with specific intent to cause injury or damage to himself or others at the time he sustained his bodily injury. In sum, reasonable minds could differ as to Owen Bello\u2019s specific intent when he banged and pulled on the window of the moving Hurley motor vehicle. The record submitted on the motions for summary judgment does no more than create genuine issues of material fact, precluding the granting of summary judgment in favor of either plaintiff or Fireman\u2019s Fund. In any event, Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s failure to exclude all reasonable doubt as to these material factual issues mandates a plenary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Accordingly, the summary judgment in favor of Fireman\u2019s Fund is reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3 was amended, effective after the date of the accident herein, to include a motorized bicycle.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
