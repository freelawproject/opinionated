Pursuant to the negotiated disposition, thirteen other counts were to be dismissed, a maximum custodial recommendation was made by the Attorney General, defendant agreed to testify against others, and the parties advised the plea judge that if they could not agree on the amount of forfeiture pursuant to the racketeering conviction <em>{see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-3b), the \u201cforfeiture issue would be brought before a jury.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">At the time of plea, defendant admitted his involvement with his brother Dennis and others \u201cin the illegal manufacture and distribution of CDS\u201d and \u201cparticularly methamphetamine during the time period as stated in the indictment, roughly 1983 through 1987.\u201d He further admitted \u201cthe ordering of certain precursors for the manufacture of methamphetamine\u201d including participation in the purchase of \u201cApproximately five gallons\u201d of P2P and the purchases of P2P from his brother Dennis. He further admitted manufacture and distribution with others for profit and income tax evasion between January 1, 1984 and April 15, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">The parties were unable to reach an agreement regarding the amount of forfeiture, and that matter was ultimately tried to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>jury. The jury returned a special verdict, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-3f, finding that defendant had \u201can interest, directly or indirectly,\u201d in the marital residence at 8 Kristin Way, Hamilton Township, a condominium unit in the Grandville Arms, 516 Silver Court, Hamilton Township, and $298,917 in currency, and that his interest in each \u201cderive[d], c[a]me from, or resulted] from proceeds, monies or cash obtained or realized directly or indirectly as a result of [his] admitted violation of the New Jersey racketeering law.\u201d The jury further concluded that \u201c[a] hundred percent\u201d of each of these items should be forfeited.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Consistent with the negotiated plea, defendant was subsequently sentenced to concurrent ten-year sentences on counts one and two, with a four-year period of parole ineligibility on count one. On count three, a term of eighteen months was imposed, to be served consecutively with the sentences on counts one and two.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No final judgment of forfeiture pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-3c is included in the record, although an order restraining the sale, conveyance or disposition of the real prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>erties has been entered. We are told that actual forfeiture has been stayed pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">On this appeal, addressed only to the forfeiture issues, defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">POINT I DEFENSE COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE AND THUS THE DEFENDANT WAS DEPRIVED OF A FAIR TRIAL IN VIOLATION OF THE SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AS WELL AS ARTICLE I PARAGRAPH 7 OF THE NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">POINT II THE COURT ERRED IN DENYING DEFENDANT\u2019S REQUEST FOR AN ADJOURNMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">POINT III PERMITTING DENNIS SPARANO TO TESTIFY AS AN EXPERT WITNESS WAS PLAIN ERROR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">POINT IV THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN QUALIFYING AND PERMITTING INVESTIGATOR ANTHONY HIGHAM TO TESTIFY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">POINT V THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-11\">POINT VI THE STATE\u2019S CLOSING ARGUMENT EXCEEDED ALL BOUNDS [OF] PROPRIETY THEREBY PREJUDICING DEFENDANT[\u2019]S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-12\">POINT VII THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DECLINING TO CHARGE A PRESUMPTION OF NON-FORFEITURE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-13\">POINT VIII THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S CHARGE IMPERMISSIBLY SHIFTED THE BURDEN OF PROOF TO THE DEFENDANT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that these contentions and the arguments in support of them are without merit and do not warrant extended discussion, R. 2:ll-3(e)(2), except as noted herein with respect to some aspects of several of the points.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-15\">The primary issue in the trial was whether defendant\u2019s interest in the $298,000 cash and the real properties were directly or indirectly derived from his admitted illegal drug business. The State endeavored to prove that defendant\u2019s expenditures during the period covered by the indictment far exceeded his known legitimate sources of income, while defendant contended that he and his wife, Donna, had generated considerable (although not necessarily reported) cash income from legitimate business ventures. Suffice it to say that there was more than sufficient evidence presented at the eight day trial to permit the finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>that defendant\u2019s income far exceeded his earnings from legitimate sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Anthony Higham, an accountant/investigator with the Narcotics Task Force who did a source and expenditure of funds analysis on the Sparanos \u201cfrom 1982 through 1987,\u201d concluded that they spent \u201c$353,000 ... in excess of known funds\u201d during that period. Defendant did not deny the fact that he failed to report income; in fact, he pled guilty to one count of the indictment to that effect. His defense was that the income he failed to report was from legitimate cash businesses unrelated to his drug activities. However, through counsel, he acknowledged that defendant was \u201cin the narcotics business to make profit. And, in fact, he admitted before this Judge <em>he </em>was.\u201d He subsequently argued to the jury that \u201cI said to you there was some profit. And I almost say, unfortunately, it\u2019s your burden to find out what that profit is.\u201d In other words, while he did not and could not deny that he benefitted economically from his illegal narcotics activities, he emphasized the State\u2019s burdens with respect to relating them to the property the State sought to forfeit by virtue of the allegations in count two of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The State offered the testimony of defendant\u2019s brother, Dennis, who testified regarding his knowledge of defendant\u2019s legitimate business ventures, including an arcade game business (\u201cSpace Station\u201d) and liquor store (Mercer Wines and Liquors) which he concluded were unsuccessful. He testified that defendant \u201clived good,\u201d, \u201cwanted for nothing\u201d and lived off \u201cthe drug business.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dennis testified that during the relevant period he and others sold P2P to defendant for the manufacture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>of methamphetamine. Defendant did not testify, although his wife and parents did.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Defendant argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his trial attorney inadequately investigated and prepared the case. Before entering his guilty plea, defendant moved for leave to substitute new counsel for the trial. The court denied the motion, finding that the substitution at the late date when the trial was \u201cvery ready to proceed\u201d would result in many \u201cproblems\u201d and that the motion was motivated by a desire to postpone the proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">At the subsequent plea, defendant stated in the plea form that he was satisfied with counsel\u2019s representation. The same appeared to be the case during the in-court proceedings. No question about counsel was thereafter raised until four months later when the forfeiture proceeding was scheduled to begin. Defendant again moved for an adjournment in order to allow him to retain new counsel. The judge found that defendant was \u201cagain\u201d trying to postpone the case \u201con the eve of trial.\u201d During the trial, defendant retained present counsel to assist with the financial aspects of the case. Present counsel, in fact, cross examined Investigator Higham and conducted the direct examination of Donna Sparano, her friend and her mother. He was also active in discussions and objections regarding the charge and objections to the State\u2019s summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">In order to show ineffective assistance of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction ... resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable. <em>[Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 687, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 2064, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>674, 693 (1984)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">However, there is a \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance ...\u201d, 466 <em>U.S. </em>at 689,104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2065, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 694, and a defendant must show that there is \u201ca reasonable probability, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d 466 <em>U.S. </em>at 694, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2068, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 698. The <em>Strickland, </em>standard has been held applicable with respect to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under our State constitution. <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 58, 519 A.2d 336 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The record does not support defendant\u2019s conclusion that the <em>Strickland </em>standard has been satisfied. Further, some of the judge\u2019s statements in denying adjournments suggest findings to the contrary with respect to some of the claims. But we cannot speculate as to the reasons for counsel\u2019s conduct or accept without a more fully developed record the State\u2019s explanations for that conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Generally, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be raised on direct appeal. Rather, defendant must develop a record at a hearing at which counsel can explain the reasons for his conduct and inaction and at which the trial judge can rule upon the claims including the issue of prejudice. <em>See State v. </em>Fritz, <em>supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 67, 519 <em>A.2d </em>336; <em>State v. Savage, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>594, 609-626, 577 A.2d 455 (1990); <em>State v. Deutsch, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>374, 376, 389, 551 A.2d 991 (App.Div.1988) (decisions after remand). <em>See also United States v. Gambino, </em>788 <em>F.2d </em>938, 950-951 (3rd Cir.1986), <em>cert. den. </em>479 <em>U.S. </em>825, 107 <em>SCt. </em>98, 93 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>49 (1986). Thus, while we conclude that this record is inadequate to support defendant\u2019s claim, our affirmance is without prejudice to defendant\u2019s petition for post conviction relief on the subject. We add, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>that we imply no view of the merits and see no basis for any further stays pending those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">We cannot conclude that the trial judge abused his discretion in declining to adjourn the forfeiture trial. At the time of plea defendant knew there would have to be a trial if negotiations did not culminate in an agreement as to the amount of forfeiture. Over four months elapsed following the plea without an agreement as to forfeiture. Despite defendant\u2019s stated dissatisfaction with counsel in advance of the originally scheduled guilt phase, he maintained the same attorney to negotiate the amount of forfeiture after the plea. Defendant did not endeavor to substitute counsel during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Given the assertion that defendant was dissatisfied with counsel just prior to the scheduled guilt phase, we can understand the trial judge\u2019s reaction to a similar adjournment application made at the commencement of the forfeiture proceedings. We find no reversible error in the trial judge\u2019s refusal to adjourn the trial. <em>See State v. Ferguson, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>395, 401-402, 487 A.2d 730 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>266, 501 A.2d 933 (1985); <em>State v. Lamb, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209, 213, 310 A.2d 102 (App.Div.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Defendant argues that his conviction must be reversed because his brother, Dennis, was permitted to testify that he pled guilty and forfeited over $1,000,000 worth of assets as substantive evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, and because his brother was, in effect, permitted to testify \u201cas an expert witness\u201d regarding defendant\u2019s business operations and illegal drug activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">We, of course, agree with defendant that post-conspiratorial statements, including a plea or testimony, of a co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>conspirator are not admissible against defendant. <em>See Evid.R. </em>63(9). <em>See also e.g. State v. Phelps, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>500, 510, 476 A.2d 1199 (1984); <em>Bisaccia v. Attorney General of N.J., </em>623 F.2d 307, 312 (3rd Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>1042, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>622, 66 L.Ed.2d 504 (1980). However, the challenged testimony was not presented as substantive evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt of a conspiracy but as bearing on fact questions relating to defendant, his sources of income and whether his property was purchased from sources other than illegal drug proceeds. The fact that Dennis pled guilty and forfeited funds may not have been relevant, but his knowledge of illegal transactions was certainly relevant and evidenced to the jury his criminal involvement. Further, the defense developed the impact of defendant\u2019s plea on Dennis\u2019s situation, thereby affecting his credibility.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In any event, since defendant did not object to the testimony, he must demonstrate that its admission was clearly capable of producing an unjust result. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The thrust of the State\u2019s case was that defendant made money from drugs and had no substantial income from other sources. Dennis\u2019s testimony supported its contention that defendant\u2019s properties and money were derived from illegal drug activity. The jury was clearly instructed that the State had to prove \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s racketeering activities enable[d] him to acquire or maintain ... the monies and properties in question.\u201d It was never instructed that Dennis\u2019s plea or forfeiture was relevant to the amount of defendant\u2019s profits from drug activities or his interest in particular property. We cannot conclude that the brother\u2019s testimony was so prejudicial that it was clearly capable of producing\u2019 an unjust result.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Nor did it constitute inadmissible expert testimony. Dennis\u2019s testimony relative to the process of manufacturing methamphetamine and the street price of the final product did not constitute \u201copinions\u201d on which expert testimony was required, but rather related facts and personal experiences. Dennis was not offered as an \u201cexpert\u201d and the provisions of <em>Evid.R. </em>19 control the admissibility of his testimony. That Rule provides that \u201c[a]s a prerequisite for the testimony of a witness there must be evidence that he has personal knowledge of the matter, or experience, training, or education, if such be required. Such evidence may be provided by the testimony of the witness himself.\u201d By virtue of his admitted involvement in the sale and manufacture of methamphetamine and the transactions with his brother, Dennis Sparano was properly allowed to testify as to facts related to his involvement in the manufacturing of methamphetamine, the income which the product generated, and his transactions in this context with defendant, to whom he supplied the basic ingredients for methamphetamine. <em>Cf. State v. LaBrutto, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>187, 553 A.2d 335 (1989). <em>See also State v. Odom, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>65, 560 A.2d 1198 (1989).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Defendant contends that he was entitled to a jury instruction that there was a presumption of non-forfeiture, similar to the charge on the presumption of innocence given at the guilt phase. He reasons that the presumption flows from the fact that the forfeiture proceeding is part of the criminal process to which the presumption applies. He also challenges the instruction which explained that, when an individual uses illegal money for living expenses, that illegal money can be considered to have indirectly maintained an asset which the individual purchased with money which can be traced to legitimate sources. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The theory is that without the illegal income, the individual would not have been able to preserve his other legitimate resources to purchase the property. We conclude that the instructions were adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">New Jersey\u2019s racketeering statute, enacted in 1987, is derived from the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1961-1968. <em>See Cannel, New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-1 (1990). The Act essentially incorporated relevant federal case law with respect to the federal act. <em>Cf. State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 203-205, 524 A.2d 188 (1987); <em>see also State v. Passante, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>439, 442, 542 A.2d 952 (Law Div. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2G:41-1 defines the crimes which can constitute \u201cracketeering activity.\u201d They include manufacture, distribution and possession of a controlled dangerous substance under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:85-5. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-la(l)(u). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-1(d) defines what constitutes a \u201c[p]attern of racketeering activity,\u201d and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-2 makes it \u201cunlawful for any person who has received any income derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity ... to use or invest directly or indirectly, any part of the income or the proceeds of the income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of any enterprise which is engaged in or the activities of which affect trade or commerce.\u201d There is no contest as to the validity of defendant\u2019s plea. He pled guilty to count two charging \u201cracketeering\u201d in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-2c.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">In addition to classifying the crime of \u201cracketeering\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-8b provides that persons convicted of racketeering under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-2 shall forfeit \u201c(1) Any interest includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>ing money or anything of value which he has acquired or maintained in violation of [chapter 41] and (2) Any interest in, security of, claim against, or property or contractual right of any kind affording a source of influence over any enterprise which he has established, acquired, maintained, operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in the conduct of, in violation of\u201d the chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The forfeiture is, thus, part of the sentence imposed on a defendant after he or she has been found or pled guilty. <em>United States v. Horak, </em>833 <em>F.2d </em>1235, 1246 (7th Cir.1987); <em>United States v. Ginsburg, </em>773 <em>F.2d </em>798, 800-801 (7th Cir.1985) <em>(en banc), cert. denied </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>1011, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1186, 89 L.Ed.2d 302 (1986). Hence, defendant is not entitled to a charge on a presumption of non-forfeiture. To the contrary, having pled guilty to \u201cracketeering\u201d there was no longer any such presumption, and issues relating to sentencing (as opposed to guilt) need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See e.g. State v. Stewart, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>596, 606, 477 <em>A.</em>2d 300 (1984) (Graves Act). <em>See also McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, </em>91-92, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2411, 2418-19, 91 <em>L.Ed.2d 61, </em>80 (1986) (reasonable doubt standard does not apply to sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The court instructed the jury that the State was required to prove \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that defendant had \u201can ownership interest\u201d in the properties which the State argued should be forfeited and must also prove \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Sparano\u2019s racketeering activities were a cause of the acquisition or maintenance of these interests, or some portion of them.\u201d It thus instructed the jury, in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-3b, requiring forfeiture of interests \u201cacquired or maintained\u201d in violation of chapter 41.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In adding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d requirement, the judge properly followed federal RICO case law, <em>see e.g., United States v. Horak, supra, </em>833 <em>F.2d </em>at 1243-1244; <em>United States v. McKeithen, </em>822 <em>F.2d </em>310, 312 (2nd Cir.1987), even though such was not necessarily required by the statute or our case law and although we do not hold that it is constitutionally required in this sentencing context. <em>See McMillan v. Pennsylvania, supra; United States v. Sandini, </em>816 F.2d 869 (3rd Cir.1987); <em>compare Patterson v. New York, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>197, 210, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2319, 2327, 53 L.Ed.2d 281, 292 (1977); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>358, 364, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1068, 1072, 25 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>368, 375 (1970). <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Even though the judge advised the jury that defendant, by his guilty plea to count two, \u201chas admitted to the requisite pattern of racketeering activity called for in the statute,\u201d <em>State v. Ingenito, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>204, 432 A.2d 912 (1981), on which he relies, is not relevant in this context. <em>Ing\u00e9nito </em>concerned the State\u2019s obligation to prove defendant guilty of possession, notwithstanding a prior verdict on another offense involving the same element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The statute does not mean that a defendant who inherited a substantial estate or legitimately made substantial income before his criminal wrongdoing must forfeit all his legitimate assets. The State must prove that \u201cbut for\u201d his \u201cracketeering\u201d defendant would not have acquired the asset or property which the State seeks to forfeit. <em>Cf. N.J.S.A. </em>20:2-3 (causation); <em>State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J </em>2, 578 <em>A.2d </em>1359 (1990) (relating to elements of offense). Hence, a defendant may be required to forfeit some but not all of his property, or a percentage of a given asset, depending on the amount of assets he has and the percentage of net worth that is legitimate as compared with that which is not. The jury can determine that only a portion of the defendant\u2019s interest in property resulted from the illegal gain. <em>See United States v. McKeithen, supra, </em>822 <em>F.2d </em>at 813-315 (forfeiture of 43%, not entire interest, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>real property warranted). The trial judge adequately conveyed this concept to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Defendant argues that the State had to prove only that the illegal funds had to be a source of the property acquired or maintained because of the judge\u2019s reference to both the \u201cdirect use\u201d and \u201cindirect use\u201d of the drug proceeds. Defendant, in essence, contends that under the judge\u2019s instructions, all his property is presumed to be forfeited, because, even if purchased with legitimate funds, the purchases would be considered to be subsidized by the use of illegal monies for other purposes. The argument, however, is really addressed to legislative policy. The statute expressly talks of income derived \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from the racketeering enterprise. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-2a.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">Since RICO forfeiture is a sanction against the individual defendant rather than the property itself, \u201cit follows the defendant as part of the penalty and thus it does not require that the government trace it, even though the forfeiture is not due until after conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Conner, </em>752 F.2d [566, 576 (11th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Taylor v. U.S., </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>821, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>72, 88 <em>L.Ed.24 </em>59 (1985)]. <em>[United States v. Ginsburg, supra, </em>773 <em>F.24 </em>at 801].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">In <em>Ginsburg, </em>the Seventh Circuit, sitting <em>en banc, </em>explained the rationale in response to a similar argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">What the defendant\u2019s argument overlooks is the fact that a racketeer who dissipates the profits or proceeds of his racketeering activity on wine, women, and song has profited from organized crime to the same extent as if he had put the money in his bank account. Every dollar that the racketeer derives from illicit activities and then spends on such items as food, entertainment, college tuition, and charity, is a dollar that should not have been available for him to spend for those purposes. In order to truly separate the racketeer from his dishonest gains, therefore, the statute requires him to forfeit to the United States the total amount of the proceeds of his racketeering activity, regardless of whether the specific dollars received from that activity are still in his possession. To require less would seriously undermine the intended deterrent effect of RICO forfeiture; a racketeer would have no incentive to discontinue his racketeering activity if he could freely use the proceeds of that activity to enrich his life up until the moment of his eventual conviction, at which time he would only be required to forfeit whatever was left over. In sum, the legislative history of RICO does not support the defendant\u2019s interpretation of section 1963(a)(1) as requiring the government to trace the proceeds of racketeering activity in order to prove that they are still in existence at the time of conviction. [773 <em>F.</em>2d at 802].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>We thus hold that there need not be a \u201cdirect\u201d connection between racketeering profits and the acquired property-sought to be forfeited, so long as the State proves that the property was acquired by funds equivalent to the fruits of the criminal activity. As the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit has said in <em>United States v. Navarro-Ordas, 770 F.2d </em>959, 970 (11th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Rodriguez v. U.S., </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>1016, 106 <em>S.Ct </em>1200, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>313 (1986), regarding the federal RICO statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">To limit the forfeiture to profits actually traced to assets [one defendant] held at the time the forfeiture order issued would simply provide an incentive for racketeers to engage in complicated financial transactions to hide their spoils. The legislative history leaves mo doubt that, in the view of Congress, the economic power organized crime enjoys is derived from its huge illegal profits. To carry out Congress\u2019 intent, a court must order forfeiture of the amount of the profits and place the burden of satisfying the order on the convicted defendant, regardless of what he may actually have done with his profits. To do otherwise \u201cwould mean that \u2018[w]hole areas of organized criminal activity would be placed beyond\u2019 the reach of the statute.\u201d <em>Russello </em>[v. <em>U.S.] </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>[16] at 24, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>[296] at 301 [78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983)] (quoting <em>United States v. Turkette, </em>452 <em>U.S. </em>576, 589, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2524, 2531, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Thus, a defendant convicted of \u201cracketeering\u201d may be required to forfeit property equal in value to the proceeds of his illegal activity o</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">The charge in this case taken as a whole was satisfactory. Considering defendant\u2019s admissions, coupled with his brother\u2019s testimony concerning defendant\u2019s purchases and sales and the amount of saleable methamphetamine derived from this substance, and the testimony of Investigator Higham, there was more than adequate evidence that defendant earned far more from Ms illegal drug activity than the value of the residence and condominium purchased for $86,500 and $88,000, respectively, and the currency forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\">Defendant also agreed to \"waive any appeal rights as a result of the plea offer.\" The essential issues before us relate to subsequent proceedings and are not impacted by the \"waiver.\" <em>See State v. Robinson, </em>224 <em>N.J. Super. </em>495, 498, 540 A.2d 1313 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The Kristin Way property was owned jointly with his wife, Donna, and the Silver Court condominium unit was entirely in her name. The jury decided that defendant had an interest in these assets and that 100% of his interest should be forfeited. While not raised or briefed before us, and despite the Attorney General\u2019s statement of the issue in his summation, we note that we do not necessarily read the charge or verdict sheet to address the percentage of interest defendant had in the property, as opposed to the percentage of his interest which must be forfeited. While there was proof of Donna Sparano's work efforts and business interests, there is no satisfactory proof that the condominium was purchased from proceeds derived completely independent of defendant. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-3d allows the Attorney General to seize forfeited assets \"subject to the rights of innocent persons such as any prior lienholders.\u201d The Attorney General may sell such properties, \"making due provision for the rights of innocent persons.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-3e. These provisions would allow the State to make some accommodation for the legitimate interest, if any, of Donna Sparano, the wife, in the properties. We need not discuss the rights of persons with interest in property the State seeks to forfeit to notice, and opportunity to be heard, in other circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Only eleven of the thirteen other counts are dismissed in the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Dennis denied that his credibility was affected because defendant had agreed to testify against him and their other co-defendants in connection with his guilty plea.
