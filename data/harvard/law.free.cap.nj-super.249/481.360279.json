Plaintiff took the position that he could not be dispossessed without proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>under the Anti-Eviction Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1, and that he suffered \u201cexpenses ... emotional distress and ... physical hardship\u201d by virtue of the wrongful dispossess. He also claims that defendants\u2019 \u201cforcible entry and detainer upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises\u201d violated <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:89-1 <em>et seq., </em>giving rise to monetary damages under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:39-8, including treble damages if repossession \u201cis inappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">An order to show cause issued, and at the following trial, the proofs substantially conformed to the factual allegations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">As a result of a \u201c[h]it-and-run\u201d automobile accident and resulting disabilities, plaintiff, his wife and his children were forced to leave their prior residence and, on December 5, 1987, moved into the Alexander Hamilton Hotel. Plaintiff\u2019s family lived in the hotel for approximately two and-a-half years before the \u201clockout.\u201d They paid rent of approximately $180 to $190 a week (which included stove, oven, and refrigerator), but plaintiff\u2019s wife had her own linens and did housekeeping for the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Plaintiff testified that when permitted to return to work by his doctors he would do so, and that upon returning to work he would want to find another and more suitable home for his family. Plaintiff further testified that he had unsuccessfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>applied for Social Security benefits, but that a hearing was still pending, and by agreeing with his wife\u2019s stricken testimony, plaintiff stated that his children attended a local school based on their residence at the hotel, and that his wife registered to vote from her residence there.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">On March 23, 1990 plaintiff\u2019s room was padlocked while the family members were not there. Plaintiff testified that he owed the defendant over $500 for back rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">On cross-examination plaintiff testified that by the time he got his \u201cdisability\u201d his former residence was \u201ctom down\u201d and that he had moved into the hotel because of the accident and disability. He answered affirmatively to the question, \u201c[a]nd was it not your intention to at some point go back to living in an apartment when you were better and went back to work?\u201d He stated that when they moved into the hotel \u201cwe planned on\u2014on staying there for awhile\u201d and \u201c[i]f the doctor says I could go back to work. If not, we\u2014we wouldn\u2019t have no place else to go but the hotel.\u201d He acknowledged that he \u201cplanned on getting another apartment once [he was] able to go back to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The trial judge concluded that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1 \u201cdoes not exempt the hotel from the provisions of the Anti-Eviction Act\u201d, but that <em>Poroznoff v. Alberti, </em>161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>414, 391 <em>A.2d </em>984 (Cty.D.Ct.1978), <em>aff'd </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>140, 401 A.2d 1124 (App. Div.1979), controlled the case and that plaintiff and his family were \u201ctransient guests\u201d of the hotel and, thus, not entitled to the protection of the Anti-Eviction Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. He found plaintiff's \u201ccross examination was indeed telling\u201d and that when \u201cMr. and Mrs. Williams began to occupy this hotel ... their intention was to remain temporarily; that they still have an intention to live in more suitable quarters.\u201d On a motion for reconsideration, while sympathetic to plaintiff, he adhered to the view that he was bound by our decision in <em>Poroznoff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The critical fact-finding turned upon the plaintiffs testimony that he did not intend to remain in the hotel after he could return to work and find a more suitable residence for Ms family.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">In <em>Poroznoff, supra, </em>the plaintiff lived in a room at the Young Men\u2019s Christian Association in Passaic \u201con a week-to-week basis.\u201d 161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 416, 391 <em>A.</em>2d 984. When he became drunk and disorderly and was arrested by the local police, his room was locked and he was not permitted to reenter upon return. He ultimately filed a complaint for possession and recovery of treble damages pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:39-8, the \u201cforcible entry and detainer\u201d statute. The trial judge denied relief, finding that there was a difference between a \u201clessee\u201d and \u201ctenant\u201d, on the one hand, and a nonresident or \u201ctransient\u201d on the other. The trial judge concluded that \u201ca week-to-week resident of a Y.M.G.A.\u201d could not be considered either a \u201clessee\u201d or \u201ctenant\u201d entitled to protection under New Jersey\u2019s Anti-Eviction statute and that \u201c[u]ntil new legislation clarifies the ambiguities left in our eviction statutes,\u201d 161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 422, 891 A.2d 984, he was required to follow the out-of-state precedent which led him to conclude that the plaintiff there was entitled to no protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">We affirmed on a narrow ground stating that \u201c[pjlaintiffs assertion on this appeal that he occupied a room at the Passaic Y.M.C.A. as his only residence is insufficient to establish that he was not a transient guest within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1.\u201d 168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 141-142, 401 A.2d 1124. We further stated that \u201c[t]here is no basis for concluding that plaintiff and defendants entered into a tenancy that gave plaintiff a legal status other than that of a transient guest residing on a week-to-week basis at the Passaic Y.M.C.A., which plaintiff conceded to be a hotel for purposes of this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142, 401 A.2d 1124. We also noted that \u201c[t]he protections afforded by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1 expressly do not apply to a transient or seasonal tenants residing at a hotel, motel or other guest house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we concurred in the ultimate conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>sions of the trial judge \u201cthat plaintiff failed to establish a claim for being locked out of his room at the Y.M.C.A., without defendants having first obtained a judgment of possession pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-53.\u201d However, we did not hold that a resident of a hotel could never become a \u201clessee\u201d or \u201ctenant,\u201d or a \u201cnon-transient\u201d guest entitled to the Act\u2019s protection. <em>Cf. Vasquez v. Glassboro Service Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>86, 97, 415 A.2d 1156 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">While under <em>Poroznoff </em>the mere assertion that a room in a hotel or Y.M.C.A. or similar premises is the \u201conly residence\u201d does not suffice to make one a \u201clessee or tenant\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1, the case before us involves a plaintiff who lived in the Alexander Hamilton Hotel for over two years with his family members who attended school and registered to vote as a result of their residence at the premises. Further, while the plaintiff had an intention to ultimately leave the premises and find a \u201cmore suitable\u201d residence for his family, he had no present intention or ability to do so within any particular time or fixed duration, or to leave the premises until after he could return to work and obtain the funds for doing that.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">It is for the Legislature to decide whether occupancy of a hotel for any fixed duration of time <em>(e.g., </em>90 days, six months or one year) should give rise to \u201ctenancy\u201d status, and we do not hold that the mere fact that some person has the intention to remain an indefinite period when he arrives, or in fact stays there for a particular period, gives rise to that status. However, we are satisfied under the aggregate facts of this case, which involve both actual residence for over two years and an intention to remain there for an indefinite period of time until certain contingencies might occur, that a \u201ctenancy\u201d at the time of the \u201clock out\u201d existed and that the Anti-Eviction Act protects these \u201ctenants\u201d as a matter of law. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial judge, while understandably relying on <em>Poroznoff, </em>reached the wrong legal conclusion with respect to its application in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>We denied a stay pending appeal in this ease. Therefore, we cannot direct that plaintiff is entitled to repossession. However, by virtue of the fact that plaintiff was wrongfully dispossessed without proper adherence to the Anti-Eviction statute, he would still be entitled to prove damages which flowed therefrom under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:39-8. That statute provides for treble damages where \u201ca return to possession would be an inappropriate remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">We note that as plaintiff admittedly owed arrearages at the time of his lockout, he may well have no damages. However, we do not address any issues which might arise under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:39-8 on the remand, but leave to the parties the development of proofs and issues which flow therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-14\">The individual owner of the Alexander Hamilton Hotel was also a named defendant. The case was dismissed against him in the same judgment. No issue was raised about that dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Plaintiffs wife, Deborah, and plaintiff testified during the trial on April 2, 1990. During her cross-examination Deborah became \u201coverwrought by [the] proceedings\u201d and was \u201cunable to proceed.\u201d Her testimony was \u201dstrike[n],\u201d but the court and counsel agreed to a \u2018'shortcut\u201d whereby plaintiff could indicate that \u201chis answers to the questions that were addressed to Mrs. Williams would have been the same....\u201d He thereafter agreed with his wife\u2019s testimony that they \u201cresided in the Alexander Hamilton Hotel for two and a half years ... that the [weekly] rent was \u00a7190.80 ... that the rent now owed is over $500; that the last time any rent was paid was $200 on March 30th, leaving a balance due of S451.10; that she lives together with [plaintiff] and [their] two children, ages 15 and 6; that [the] children go to Public School Number 2; that she was registered to vote at [that] address; ... that she has her own linens; that she refuses maid service and does her own cleaning and change of linens____\u201d He noted there were different \"daily rates, weekly rates, and monthly rates\u201d which explained some differences in their testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Recent amendments to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1 embodied in L.1991, c. 91, \u00a7 68 do not affect the issues in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
