Defendant and his passenger fled the scene on foot. The police found cocaine and a switchblade knife in the abandoned car. Defendant was arrested several hours later.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The jury found defendant guilty of first degree aggravated manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4a, and unlawful possession of cocaine, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(1). The trial judge sentenced defendant to a twenty-year prison term for the aggravated manslaughter and a concurrent four-year term for cocaine possession. He also imposed a $50 lab fee, $1,000 DEDR penalty, $60 VCCB penalty and suspended defendant\u2019s driving privileges for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">We reverse the count for aggravated manslaughter because the trial judge improperly admitted inflammatory photographs of the victim\u2019s body into evidence and because of the prosecutor\u2019s improper questions on cross-examination of defendant and his comments on summation. We affirm the cocaine conviction because there was overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt of that offense untainted by these trial errors, and because defendant admitted his guilt of this offense when he testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">There was abundant evidence that defendant recklessly operated his vehicle. He struck the pedestrian crossing the street from right to left, when he drove to the left of an automobile waiting at a red light. His speed on this twenty-five mile per hour street was variously estimated at forty miles per hour (by defendant at time of impact), between fifty and fifty-five miles per hour (by defendant before impact and by the officers in the pursuing police car) and ninety to one hundred miles per hour (by the occupant of the vehicle which defendant passed on the left immediately before he struck the pedestrian). Upon collision, the victim\u2019s body flew into the air with considerable force. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>When defendant testified, he admitted he was drinking earlier and was driving recklessly at the time of impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The essential question for the jury to determine was whether defendant\u2019s driving recklessly caused the death of the pedestrian (third degree death by auto, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-5) or whether his driving recklessly caused the pedestrian\u2019s death under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life (first degree manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4a). The jury\u2019s opportunity to objectively and dispassionately evaluate whether defendant was guilty of the lesser or the greater offense was tainted by the admission of prejudicial photographs and the highly improper conduct of the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Five of the eight offered pre-autopsy photographs were admitted into evidence. They are in color. They are gruesome. Three are particularly grisly. One depicts the shaved crown on the victim\u2019s skull, laying bare an ugly laceration on the top of his head. Another depicts the decedent\u2019s bloody right leg. The third photo is a full-front view of decedent's swollen, black and blue face, showing his mouth pried open with medical instruments. The prosecutor argued that the photographs should be admitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">To demonstrate the nature of the injuries sustained by the victim and also corroborate, in part, the high rate of speed when the impact occurred and the legs of the victim were virtually severed due to the impact from the automobile. <em>And the medical examiner, in order to adequately explain to the jury the nature of injuries, must be able to express these quite candidly, </em>[emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">In other words, the photographs were offered to inflame the jury. We see no other purpose for their admission. They were of little, if any, relevance to show one of the purposes proposed by the prosecutor, the speed of defendant\u2019s vehicle at the time of impact. In the absence of any foundation testimony, it is difficult to perceive how pictures of a mutilated corpse can be proof that defendant\u2019s vehicle was traveling at twenty, thirty, fifty or one hundred miles per hour at the time of impact. Moreover, even if these pictures were remotely relevant, their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>inordinately high capacity for prejudice far exceeded any probative value. <em>Evid.R. </em>4. The jury saw pictures of defendant\u2019s damaged vehicle and heard testimony about his excessive speed and the force with which the decedent was propelled into the air and forward upon impact. Admission of these photographs into evidence was an abuse of the trial judge\u2019s discretion because their tenuous relevance was overwhelmed by their inherently prejudicial nature. <em>State v. Thompson, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>396, 420-21, 283 A.2d 513 (1971): \u201c[E]ven relevant evidence of an inflammatory nature may not be admitted under <em>Evid.R. </em>4, regardless of the availability of limiting instruction, if probative, non-inflammatory evidence on the same point is available.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>341, 366, 561 A.2d 1082 (1989). We note that the trial judge did not give a limiting instruction as to the purpose of these photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The record is redolent with instances of prosecutorial misbehavior, both on cross-examination and in summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">On cross-examination the prosecutor:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">1. Knowing it to be untrue, asked defendant if he had previously been convicted of possession of cocaine. The prosecutor knew that defendant\u2019s prior conviction was for unlawful possession of prescription pills (Doriden-Empiren compound);</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">2. Without any factual basis for the question, asked defendant if he had consumed any drugs earlier that day;</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">3. Knowing it to be untrue, asked defendant if the car he was driving was stolen by him from his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">In summation, the prosecutor:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">1. Accused defense counsel of attempting to deceive the jury. He argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\">Why don\u2019t we cut through all the smut, we have all this discussion about legality, probability, possibility, we\u2019ll start out with the defendant guilt[y] of death by auto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>It is typical when the best defense counsel, when the evidence is so overwhelming that it really makes your gut wrench, what do you do, you don\u2019t say look at the evidence, you say look over in the comer of the room, by God, look at some smoke in the comer of the room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">MR. CARLUCCI: I\u2019ll object to this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">MR. MANN: I haven\u2019t finished my comments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll allow it so far.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">MR. MANN: You say look at the smoke over here, because I don\u2019t want you to you look in this direction, I don\u2019t want you to look at the defendant\u2019s conduct, I don\u2019t want you to look at the circumstances of the case, I don\u2019t want you to look at the facts because, if you look at the facts, I\u2019m crushed. My defendant is guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">A prosecutor is not permitted to cast unjustified aspersions on defense counsel\u2019s motives. <em>State v. Sherman, </em>230 <em>N.J. Super. </em>10, 16, 552 A.2d 621 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">2. Falsely suggested that defendant smiled after striking the victim with his automobile. In discussing defendant\u2019s flight from the accident scene, the prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\">This guy didn\u2019t care about anything and how do we know that additionally. When he got out, he took off. Did he stay and say, well, gee, let me see if I can help this man out, gee, I was in an accident, this is terrible, call an ambulance, the police, I\u2019ll stay here. He took off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-12\"><em>Why, why did, he smile then, we don\u2019t know. We weren\u2019t there but we know he took off. </em>[emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">There is no evidence of this baseless accusation. The jury would be justified in concluding that a driver who smiled after striking down a helpless pedestrian certainly manifested extreme indifference to human life. The statement was highly prejudicial. \u201cIt is axiomatic that a prosecutor is duty-bound to confine his summation to facts revealed during the trial and the reasonable inferences which may properly be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>State v. Marks, </em>201 <em>N.J. Super. </em>514, 534, 493 A.2d 596 (App.Div.1985), <em>certif. denied, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>393, 508 A.2d 253 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">3. Improperly urged the jury to convict out of sympathy for the deceased victim. The prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-15\">Now one thing that we didn\u2019t talk about during this case too much and I don\u2019t think you have to, you can\u2019t afford to lose sight of it, because despite the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>we\u2019re in courtroom and lot of technical matters that come up, the Judge will charge you on the law, it\u2019s extremely technical, you will have to pay real close attention to that. Despite the fact we\u2019re all lawyers and perhaps you don\u2019t like lawyers, or being jurors, there is one thing we don\u2019t or can\u2019t lose sight of, Keith Johnson was a 35 year old man. I never met him, we never will obviously. And underlying this, despite whatever your decision is, you have to maintain humanity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">You have to do the right thing and the right thing, I submit to you, is to find this man guilty of aggravated manslaughter. But while you are doing that, remember that Keith Johnson lost his life. A man bom of a woman, a man with family, with friends, a man doing nothing other than crossing the street by his house at 69 Fabyian. And because of the conduct of this man, his life was snuffed out like that. In a most horrible way. Absolutely horrible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">And what you must not forget, while you\u2019re considering the guilt or innocence of this defendant, is that Keith Johnson has lost his life and that when he lost his life, because of the conduct of this man, we were all diminished, it took something away from all of us. When a church bell tolled for Keith Johnson, we all heard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">Because when someone dies, it effects all of us, directly or indirectly, we\u2019re all part of humanity. Whatever you do, because you have to live with yourself, whatever your verdict, is, you have to live with yourself, you can\u2019t forget a man, a real man died, they\u2019re not just terrible pictures of a mutilated man, that\u2019s not what it is about, it is not a case of a piece of meat having lost it\u2019s life, that\u2019s what it looks like, doesn\u2019t it. This is a viable human being who lost his life. Someone has to take the responsibility for it, you can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that this man lived, and he died. You cannot lose sight of the fact that he died because of the conduct of this man, because he was reckless and because he didn\u2019t care who lived or died. Thank you, Judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">When the victim\u2019s character has no bearing on the substantive issue of guilt, the prosecutor may not comment on the evidence in a manner that highlights the victim\u2019s virtues in order to inflame the jury. <em>State v. Williams, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>393, 451-52, 550 A.2d 1172 (1988); <em>State v. Muniz, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>492, 500, 550 A.2d 487 (App.Div.1988), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>319, 571 A.2d 948 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">We assume that a prosecutor will \u201csum up the State\u2019s case graphically and forcefully.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>489, 510-11, 158 A.2d 11 (1960). We do not expect the prosecutor to perform this burdensome obligation with the daintiness of a participant in a minuet. <em>See State v. Marks, supra, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 534-35, 493 A.2d 596. The prosecutor is nevertheless obligated \u201cto stay within bounds, that no [person] be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>convicted unjustly.\u201d <em>State v. Bogen, </em>13 <em>N.J. </em>137, 141, 98 A.2d 295 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The accumulation of error deprived defendant of a fair trial on the charge of aggravated assault. <em>State v. Orecchio, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>125, 129, 106 A.2d 541 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">We note that the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury made reference to the \u201chomicide\u201d of the victim committed by defendant. It is true that \u201chomicide\u201d is defined as the killing of one person by another. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1083 (1981). However, we believe that the word has different connotations to a large segment of the public, and that it suggests that an individual has committed a criminal act in killing another person. The use of the word \u201chomicide\u201d as a definition for the killing of another should be avoided in a criminal charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The judgment of conviction for unlawful possession of cocaine is affirmed. The conviction for aggravated manslaughter is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Law Division for a new trial on that charge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
