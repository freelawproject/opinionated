Thompson in his December 5, 1990 letter opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The impasse between the Council and the Mayor generating this appeal developed when the Mayor laid off two subordinates of the municipal clerk. At issue is the Mayor\u2019s authority under the Faulkner Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-1 <em>et seq., </em>in light of Orange\u2019s ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Orange operates under a mayor-council plan of government. Its council exercises legislative power. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-36. The council by statute is limited in its role concerning municipal employees, and \u201cshall deal with employees of the department of administration and other administrative departments solely through the mayor....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-37.1. The council appoints the municipal clerk, who serves as clerk of the council, to compile its ordinances and resolutions, \u201cand perform such functions as may be required by law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-38. Each municipality is required to have a municipal clerk. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9-133. Such clerks achieve tenure, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9-133.7, and \u201cshall not be removed [from office] except for good cause shown after ... [a] hearing\u201d. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9-134. No ordinance may reduce the salary of a municipal clerk during term. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4QA:9-165. The governing body may also by ordinance create the office of deputy municipal clerk, \u201cand provide for appointments thereto.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9-135.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">Respecting the appointment power of the council, 1985 amendments to the Faulkner Act also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The legislative power of the municipality shall be exercised by the municipal council, subject to the procedures set forth in this plan of government ... and may ... be exercised by resolution, including, but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">j. The election, appointment, setting of salaries and removal of officers and employees of the council, subject to any pertinent civil service requirements and any pertinent contractual obligations, and within the general limits of the municipal budget;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-36j.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The 1985 legislative amendments were preceded by a comprehensive committee report which described the council power at that time as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">The council is limited to legislative functions, with its only appointment based upon the charter being that of the municipal clerk. It has various investigative and fiscal control powers, but may remove municipal officers only for cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-9\"><em>The Changing Structure of New Jersey Municipal Government, </em>incorporated as the Thirtieth Report of the County and Municipal Government Study Commission, at 26 (1985). That report characterized the result as \u201cleading to an atmosphere of contention and conflict between mayor and council.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Governor Kean, returning the draft of the ensuing 1985 legislation, known as the Lynch Act, specifically urged that amendments \u201cmake clear that the municipal council shall be able to set the salaries of council employees, subject to [civil service, contract and budget].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The prior draft provided only for election, appointment and removal of council employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Under the present Faulkner Act, including the 1985 amendments, the mayor is the chief executive and responsible for supervising the departments of the municipal government. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:6M-82b; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-40. The mayor is responsible for all administrative or executive functions \u201cassigned by general law to the governing body,\u201d whereas the council is responsible for \u201cany legislative and investigative functions assigned by general law to the governing body.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A~32b. The mayor has the statutory duty to \u201csupervise the ... personnel ... procedures as may be authorized by ordinance....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-40i. The mayor runs the municipal departments which are established by ordinance. All administrative functions, \u201cother than those vested in the offices of the municipal clerk ... shall be allocated and assigned\u201d within administrative departments under the mayor. <em>N.J.S.A.. </em>40:69A-43(a). The mayor\u2019s duties include enforcement of \u201cthe charter and ordinances of the municipality and all general laws applicable thereto____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-40a.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Department heads, appointed by the mayor, with consent of council, may be removed by the mayor who may also remove \u201cany other municipal executive officers, subject to council disapproval.\u201d N.J.<em>S.A. </em>40:69A-43(c). Department heads appoint subordinate personnel and may remove them with the consent of the mayor. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-43(d). The office of the municipal clerk \u201cshall be subject to such general administrative procedures ... as are departments ... including, but not limited to, ... personnel procedures and regulations ... as are generally required of departments.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-48(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">A municipality however may selectively change the delegation of authority where that authority is not mandated to be exercised by one part of government or the other.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">Each municipality governed by an optional form of government pursuant to this act shall, subject to the provisions of this act or other general laws, have full power to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-11\">(a) Organize and regulate its internal affairs and to establish, alter, and abolish offices, positions and employments and to define the functions, powers and duties thereof and fix their terms, tenure and compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-12\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-29. <em>See Hutt v. Robbins, </em>98 <em>N.J.Super. </em>99, 106, 236 <em>A.</em>2d 172 (App.Div.1967), <em>certif. denied, </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>185, 238 A.2d 471 (1968) (power to allocate municipal powers cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>validate ordinance interpretation giving council power to prevent department head from exercising statutory power to remove subordinate).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Orange, N.J., Code \u00a7 4-15, following the statute, mandates that the City Council \u201cshall appoint a clerk ... to provide such ... staff services as the members shall require.\u201d The clerk \u201cshall select subordinate personnel, with the advice and consent of the Council, to such positions as the Council may authorize.\u201d Respecting \u201clayoffs\u201d, however, the city ordinance provided for uniform procedures applicable to all city employees, adhering to the provisions of the civil service regulations, including a definition of \u201clayoff.\u201d That term was defined as, \u201cthe involuntary separation of an employee from the City of Orange Township for reasons other than delinquency or misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The ordinance further provided in the section which is crucial to this appeal, that \u201c[ljayoffs, and demotions in lieu of layoffs, <em>shall be ordered by the Mayor in accordance with Civil Service Procedures.\u201d </em>Orange, N.J., Code \u00a7 23-32C(l) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Thus, the ordinances provided that the clerk could select subordinates. While the power to select may imply a power to remove, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-36j, the ordinance did not provide specific authority in the clerk or council to \u201clay off\u201d the subordinates. The ordinance specifically allocated that power to the mayor. Although the municipality has power to \u201calter, and abolish ... employments,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-29(a), neither that power, nor the power to \u201clay off\u201d personnel, appears in the Faulkner Act as mandatorily allocated either to the mayor or to the council. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>11A:8-1. Thus there was no prohibition against Orange allocating a lay-off power to either the mayor or the council. <em>See Hutt v. Robbins, supra, </em>98 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 106, 236 A.2d 172. When Orange used the term \u201clayoff\u201d to denote a power delegated exclusively to the Mayor, particularly when juxtaposed with a reference to observing civil service procedures, we must conclude there was an intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>selection of terms. <em>See generally JCRA v. Tug and Barge Urban Removal Corp., </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>88, 99, 548 A.2d 1167 (Law Div.1987), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>24, 548 A.2d 1133 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The aim of courts in construing ordinances, like statutes, is to determine legislative intent. Ordinances should be liberally construed in favor of the municipality. <em>White Castle v. Planning Board of Clifton, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>688, 691, 583 A.2d 406 (App.Div.1990); <em>L &amp; L Clinics, Inc. v. Town of Irvington, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>332, 336, 460 A.2d 152 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>540, 468 A.2d 191 (1983). When construing any legislation, we apply first its plain meaning. <em>See Dept. of Law &amp; Public Safety v. Bigham, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>646, 650, 575 A.2d 868 (1990); <em>County of Essex v. Waldman, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>647, 656, 583 A.2d 384 (App.Div.1990). Specific meaning supercedes a general one in interpreting legislative intent. <em>See </em>2A <em>Sutherland, Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 49.02 at 348 (4th ed. 1984). While we do not have the benefit of any legislative history concerning the ordinances in question, we do not find a clear deviation from the presumed purpose of municipal legislation concerning its government, that it be efficient and cost-effective. Such overall purpose guides our determination of legislative intent. <em>See State v. Olivio, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>550, 556, 589 A.2d 597 (1991); <em>In the Matter of Woodhaven Lumber and Mill Work and State of New Jersey v. Asbury Park Press, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>481, 489, 589 <em>A.2d </em>135 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">In effect the Council concedes that the \u201clayoff\u201d ordinance leaves little room for statutory construction. The Council claimed at trial and on appeal, that the ordinance interpretation violated the doctrine of separation of powers, since it gave the executive power to render the legislature ineffective as evidenced by the Mayor\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The judge took testimony on this issue. The evidence showed that the municipality had severe fiscal problems and a high tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>rate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Over the summer of 1990 the Council cut Orange\u2019s municipal budget. The Mayor then issued an order that, \u201cin order for this Administration to follow the spending plan set and passed by the City Council, various employees, both provisional and permanent must be eliminated from employment----\u201d Among those proposed to be laid off were Teresa Luongo, assistant municipal clerk, and Marie Marzano, a principal account clerk.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>4A:8-1.4, the Mayor submitted a proposed \u201cCity of Orange Layoff Plan\u201d to the New Jersey Department of Personnel on September 20, 1990.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The Council proffered to the judge that its 1990 budget, as promulgated, provided sufficient money for the laid-off employees. In support of the Mayor\u2019s position that layoffs were, essentially, across the board, Thomas J. Morrison III, the business administrator of Orange, testified that his staff was reduced and that departmental layoffs also occurred in Administrative Services, the Public Works Department, the Director\u2019s Office, Equipment and Vehicle Maintenance, and the Parks and Public Property Department. The Council challenged this testimony, urging that there had been increases in personnel. Morrison testified that certain increases in staff were attributable to a prior administration. The Council also proffered evidence that the staffing levels of other various Clerk\u2019s Offices in Essex County demonstrated that the Mayor\u2019s action was discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">As the Mayor notes, the doctrine of \u201cseparation of powers\u201d has generally not been applied to municipalities, <em>Smith v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>Township of Hazlet, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>523, 530, 309 A.2d 210 (1973), although the intent of the Lynch amendments to the Faulkner Act was certainly to separate more clearly the function of the mayor from those of the council, subject to the ability of the municipality to sort out powers not otherwise mandated. <em>See In re Shain, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>524, 537, 457 A.2d 828 (1983).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The judge obviously found without merit the Council\u2019s claims the Mayor had violated the council\u2019s powers intentionally in order to retaliate for budget cuts. Nothing else in the record supported the bare assertion that the Council\u2019s legislative powers were actually interfered with, or that all of its legislative powers could not be exercised by the Council with the assistance of its two remaining employees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">It is arguable that, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-36, the Council could pass a resolution appointing either one of the two laid-off employees, and the Mayor could lay off that employee almost simultaneously, leading to an impasse. Fortunately, responsible representatives of government took no such action. We thus need not pass upon whether the ordinance, properly construed, gave the Council the power to appoint the clerk\u2019s subordinates, although we have noted that the Mayor is not empowered to remove department head subordinates unilaterally. The clerk is similar to a department head, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-43(a), and the council is the clerk\u2019s appointing authority, <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>S.A. </em>40:69A-38, as is the mayor for department heads, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-43(c). In any event, if the municipality desires to allocate to the Council or to the municipal clerk, with the consent of the Council, the power to lay off these personnel, it must redraft its ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Having determined that the Mayor had the authority to lay off the subordinates of the municipal clerk, we need not consider defendant\u2019s alternative arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-12\">The municipal clerk, as the secretary to the governing body, acts as an election official and administrative official, whose status \"depends upon gaining and maintaining the complete confidence of the governing body, the press, the taxpayer, and the citizen.\u201d <em>Zold v.
