Provided further, however, that amputation of any part of the body or loss of any or all of the vision of one or both eyes shall be considered as a permanent injury or physical condition. (Acts 1929, ch. 172,. \u00a7 33, p. 536; 1945, ch. 284, \u00a7 2, p. 1261)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">This statute was amended in 1945 and is a distinct departure from the law as it existed before its amendment. Under the former law, the sum total of the prior condition and the increase or aggravation thereof by a subsequent injury was compensable. The amendment is contained in the first proviso found in the above section and the facts in this case present a case clearly within the provisions within the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The appellee had sustained former injuries that had resulted in permanent partial impairment in his left arm and this condition existed before the accident referred to in the appellee\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"AqUd8\">The statute imposes on the Full Board the obligation to make and file a finding of facts upon which an award is based. \u00a7 40-1511, Burns\u2019 1940 Replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The Full Industrial Board, however failed to find and determine the extent of the previously sustained permanent injury or physical condition and likewise failed to find and determine the extent of the increase thereof caused by the accidental injuries referred to in appellee\u2019s application herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">It is thoroughly established under our law that the Industrial Board must make a finding of facts on every issue presented to it. <em>Northern Ind. Power Co. </em>v. <em>Hawkins </em>(1925), 82 Ind. App. 552, 146 N. E. 879; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Sheehan Construction Co. </em>(1944), 222 Ind. 274, 53 N.

E. 2d 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">This cause is remanded to the Industrial Board of Indiana and said board is directed to discharge its statutory duty by making findings on the essential facts, and by entering an award based thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Draper, J., not participating.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 92 N.
