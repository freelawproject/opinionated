The board filed its demurrer to the petition. The demurrer was overruled and the board ruled to answer. It failed and refused to plead further. Thereupon the court rendered judgment that the decision of the board be reversed and its order granting the variance be set aside, annulled, cancelled and reversed. Appellant assails the order overruling the demurrer as being erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">The statute, Burns\u2019 1933 (1949 Supp.), \u00a753-785, provides in part: \u201cIf such board fails to show to the satisfaction of the court that a writ should not issue then the court may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the board of zoning appeals. The writ shall prescribe the time in which a return shall be made to it.\u201d Burns\u2019 1933 (1949 Supp.), \u00a7 53-788, then provides for a deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>mination of the matter and the rendering of judgment after the return has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">The statutory procedure was not followed in this case, and there was no basis for the judgment at the time it was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We do not believe that we should decide at this time whether the court committed error in overruling the demurrer. It is possible that when the case is determined in accordance with the statutory procedure appellant will not have been harmed by the ruling, if it be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded with instructions for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Royse, J., not participating.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 95 N.
