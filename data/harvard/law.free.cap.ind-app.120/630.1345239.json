First, the appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to warrant the jury in finding that his conduct in the operation of his car was wanton or willful and therefore the so-called \u201cguest statute,\u201d pertaining to the operation of motor vehicles in Indiana,' prohibits a recovery. Burns\u2019 1940 Replacement, \u00a7 47-1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">The' facts most favorable to the appellee are substantially these. On the night of D\u00e9cember 3\u00cd, 1947, shortly before 11 o\u2019clock p. m. the appellee, his wife Vera and one Betty Lloyd were seated in a - restaurant in the city of Gary when they were approached by the appellant and invited to accompany him, in his automobile, to the Turkey Creek Country Club. The proposition. was agreeable and they set forth with the appellant driving the automobile, Betty Lloyd seated at , his right, and the appellee and wife in the rear seat. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>\u2019they proceeded south on Broadway the' appellant gradually increased the speed of ' said' 'automobile to such ;ah extent that at 11th Avenue the appellee saw fit to caution him. He paid no heed and! at 17th Avenue he ran through a red traffic light at\u2019 ever increasing : speed and was again cautioned and'asked to slow down. There was- a cold mist in the air which froze on contact with'the pavement and when they- reached 25th Avenue \u00e1nd Broadway the streets were a sheet of ice. The \u2019 appellant was then driving at 58 to 60 miles p\u00e9r hour, as indicated by the speedometer, and when the car ran'onto the ic\u00e9 h\u00e9 almost lost control of it. Tlie appellee thereupon said, \u201cY\u00f3\u00fa can either slow dowwor let us out.\u201d The appellant replied, \u201cOh, I \u00e1m doing alright,\u201d and proce\u00e9ded without slackening his speed ' notwithstanding, as one witness expressed' it, \u201cback end of the car was just dancing around on that ice.\u201d Just after they crossed the Little Calumet River bridge \"on Broadway the appellee saw three or four cars ' approximately 100 yards' ahead of them that had been \u2019 \u201cpiled up\u201d in an accident and which completely blocked the west side of the street. At that time the appellant \u2019was not looking ahead but was engaged in conversation With Betty Lloyd. When his attention was called to \u2019 the situation he \u201cslammed on the brakes,\u201d the car went \"into' a skid and slid 60 or 70 feet sidewise along the street into a car involved in the aforesaid accident and then shot across the street, over the curb on-the east 'side thereof, across the sidewalk and down a nine foot embankment Where it came to rest right side up.</p>\n<p id=\"Afs7\">To constitute 1 \u201cwanton or willful misconduct,\u201d as used in our' automobile guest statute, it must appear that the driver of the automobile is conscious of his conduct, and with an appreciation of existing conditions knows that his conduct,' if persisted in, will probably result in injury to his guest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>and yet, with reckless indifference to consequences, he consciously or intentionally persists in such conduct and as the result thereof his guest is injured. <em>Lee Brothers </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1944), 114 Ind. App. 688, 54 N. E. 2d 108; <em>Bedwell </em>v. <em>DeBolt </em>(1943), 221 Ind. 600, 50 N. E. 2d 875. It is difficult to imagine a set of facts that more precisely meet the requirements of the above definition than do those of the present case. The appellant seems to feel that because he did everything in his power to avert the accident after he discovered its imminence, his conduct cannot be characterized as willful or wanton. That, however, is not the test. The question should be determined by a consideration of his whole course of conduct leading up to the accident and the inquiry will not be confined to occurrences at the immediate time and place thereof. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Clemens </em>(1943), 113 Ind. App. 65, 46 N. E. 2d 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">It is next urged that damages in the sum of $5,000 are excessive and were prompted largely through prejudice against the appellant because he was a married man and was out on New Year\u2019s Eve with a woman who was not his wife. If such facts prejudiced the jury we are unable to say that such prejudice is reflected in the verdict. When the appellant\u2019s car pitched over the embankment above mentioned the appellee\u2019s head came in contact with the back portion of the front seat with such violence that his nose was torn from his face to the extent that it could be lifted up and one could see into his throat through the nasal pharynx. By reason of the proximity of the injury to his brain his nose was repaired without a general anesthetic. He was strapped to an operating table while this was done and suffered intense pain during the process. He was hospitalized six days and since the accident has developed a tic in the muscles of his eyelids which causes a constant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>blinking of the eyes accompanied by a dilation of the nostrils. His eyes water excessively and he suffers frequent severe headaches which have grown steadily worse since the accident. By reason of his physical condition he lost 66 days work in the first 18 months after the accident and the jury might reasonably have inferred, from the gradual worsening of his condition with the passage of time, that his periodic incapacity for work would occur indefinitely. His doctor bill was $300. We can find no prejudice in the verdict nor can we say, in these days of high prices and cheap money, that the $5,000 awarded the appellee represents anything more than monetary compensation for the injuries suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">During the course of the trial the appellant offered in evidence a written and signed statement executed by the appellee and alleged to contain admissions against his interests. Upon the appellee\u2019s objection the court rejected the document. The appellant insists that this was error but an examination of the record discloses that the objections to the exhibit are not set out in his motion for a new trial. Both this and the Supreme Court have repeatedly held that under these circumstances no question as to such assigned error is presented to us. <em>Rageas </em>v. <em>Hohman-Clinton Realty Co. </em>(1949), 119 Ind. App. 426, 88 N. E. 2d 255; <em>Shank Fireproof Warehouse Co. </em>v. <em>Harlan </em>(1940), 108 Ind. App. 592, 29 N. E. 2d 1003; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Wampler </em>(1937), 104 Ind. App. 173, 8 N.

E. 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>' After the above exhibit had been rejected the appellant sought to prove its contents by parol evidence which the court refused' to permit. Here also the motion for a new trial fails to set out the objections to the procedure and, under the above authorities, we have no question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"AKUB\">Complaint is next made of the conduct of appellee\u2019s counsel in commenting on'the appellant\u2019s marital status in his summation to the jury. In order that the misconduct of counsel in argument may be presented on appeal, the matter constituting such misconduct, the objections and motions of the injured party and the court\u2019s rulings thereon must be brought into the record by a bill of exceptions. <em>Ramseyer, Exr. </em>v. <em>Dennis </em>(1918), 187 Ind. 420, 116 N. E. 417, 119 N. E. 716; <em>McPherson </em>v. <em>State </em>(1912), 178 Ind. 583, 99 N. E. 984; <em>Cotner </em>v. <em>State </em>(1909), 173 Ind. 168, 89 N. E. 847; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>State ex rel. Snyder </em>(1917), 63 Ind. App. 653, 115 N. E. 59. Our sole information as to alleged misconduct of counsel is derived from allegations or assertions in the appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial. This is not sufficient as such matters cannot b\u2019e shown in that manner. <em>Heath </em>v. <em>State </em>(1910), 173 Ind. 296, 90 N. E. 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Concerning the question of damages the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">\u201cIf you find for the plaintiff on the allegations of this complaint, and if you further find from a fair preponderance of all the evidence that the plaintiff has sustained injuries as alleged in his complaint and has sustained said injuries as a sole, direct, and proximate result of the wrongful a,cts, if any, by the defendant as alleged in the complaint, then it will be your duty to assess the damages, if any, that he has hereby sustained. In making such assessment, of actual damages, .in the event you find plaintiff has thus sustained injuries, it is proper for you to take into consideration the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>character of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and whether they are temporary or permanent. It is also proper in such event for you to consider the physical pain, if any, which plaintiff may have' endured' from the time of .such injury, up to the present time, and also the physical pain and suffering which he is. reasonably certain to endure in the future, if any. It is also proper in such event for you to consider the decrease, if any, in his physical ability to work and earn a living during the remainder of his life from the time of the alleged injury forward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">\u201cEach of the elements of damage which I have stated to you that you may consider must be the sole, direct and proximate result of said injuries in order to be a proper element of damages. From a consideration of these matters, if any, you will assess plaintiff\u2019s actual damages in such a sum as will, in your judgment,, fairly and adequately compensate him for such elements of damages, if any, which you may find he has received as a sole, direct and proximate result of defendant\u2019s alleged wrongful acts, as aforesaid, not to exceed the amount prayed for in the prayer of the complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An6K\">The appellant objected to this instruction on the ground, that, if given, it would permit the jury to return a verdict based on elements of damage concerning which there is no evidence. While we do not agree that the instruction is altogether open to such objection, it will be noted that the court, in enumerating the various elements of damage the jury might consider in reaching its verdict, uses the words \u201cif any\u201d in connection, with each. Concerning a similar instruction the Supreme Court said: \u201cWhere, as in this case, the jury is instructed that it may allow compensation for expenses, <em>if any, </em>necessarily inc\u00fcrred by the plaintiff in attempting to effect a cure of his injuries, the charge, in effect, prohibits such. allowance unless said expenses and their amounts are shown by the evidence and the presumption is that the jury so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>understood the instructions.\u201d (Our emphasis) <em>Indianapolis Traction Co. </em>v. <em>Hensley </em>(1917), 186 Ind. 479, 115 N. E. 934, 117 N. E. 854.</p>\n<p id=\"A-y\">We are urged to consider other objections to this instruction but they are not included in those made to the trial court and Rule 1-7 makes them unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Draper, J., not participating.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 93 N.
