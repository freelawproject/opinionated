Antuna-Moran argues that the district court erred by enhancing his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) based upon a determination that his Texas conviction for aggravated assault of a peace officer was a crime of violence. He also argues that the district court\u2019s statement that it would have sentenced him to 46 months of imprisonment, even if its guidelines calculations were incorrect, does not render the alleged sentencing error by the district court harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">Given our decision in <em>United States v. Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d 324, 326, 329-30 (5th Cir.2006), the district court erred in enhancing Antuna-Moran\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based upon his prior Texas conviction for aggravated assault on a peace officer. When a district court misapplies the Guidelines, remand is appropriate unless this court concludes, \u201con the record as a whole, that the error was harmless, i.e., that the error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>478 F.3d 266, 273 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">Here, Antuna-Moran\u2019s sentence was not the result of the district court\u2019s incorrect application of the Guidelines because the district court stated that, even if it had miscalculated the Guidelines, the resulting guidelines range would be unreasonably low and that it would impose the same 46-month sentence. <em>See United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 525-26 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, the alternate non-guidelines sentence imposed by the district court is reasonable considering the case-specific factors cited by the district court. <em>See id. </em>at 527-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">Antuna-Moran also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Antuna-Moran contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Antuna-Moran properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, and that he raises it here only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. Antuna-Moran\u2019s motion to expedite his appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-12\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
