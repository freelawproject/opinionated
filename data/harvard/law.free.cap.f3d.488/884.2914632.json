Because the record supports the conclusion that Rodriguez was threatened for his refusal to provide dental services to guerillas, and not because of his political opinion, the record does not compel reversal of the BIA\u2019s finding that Rodriguez failed to demonstrate a nexus between his political opinion and his persecution, as required for asylum relief or withholding of removal. Moreover, because Rodriguez testified that the authorities were helpful in protecting him from the guerillas, the record does not compel a finding that the authorities acquiesced to any alleged torture, as required for CAT relief. Accordingly, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-20\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-21\">Rodriguez entered the United States as a non-immigrant visitor, with authorization to remain here for a temporary period not to exceed 26 November 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In July 2002, he applied for asylum and withholding of removal on the basis of persecution for political opinion. In his application, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>stated that the FARC,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a guerilla group, threatened to kidnap and kill him if he did not \u201cwork for them in their hospitals and serve [them] with their medical needs.\u201d AR at 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">He attached a written statement, in which he stated that he was a well-known dentist in the rural municipality of Que-tame, where he occasionally provided dental services to the needy. According to his statement, one day, as he was traveling to a medical center, he was approached by two men, who identified themselves as members of the FARC, and asked him to become part of their group and deliver dental services to their members. He told them that he could not be part of any organization that killed people, and quickly left with a group of other doctors. Several months later, he received an anonymous phone call, stating that his brother-in-law had been kidnaped, and he later received a second call, stating that the brother-in-law\u2019s body had been found. He speculated that the killing may have had something to do with his confrontation with FARC members.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Rodriguez\u2019s statement went on to provide that he later was informed by three police officers of rumors that the FARC was planning an attempt on his life. The police provided him with a truck and police escorts for his protection, to help him relocate his office to an area called Caqueza. However, he received several phone calls while in Caqueza, in which the caller threatened to kill his family if he did not provide dental services to the FARC, but he continued to refuse to cooperate. He again relocated his office, this time to Bo-gata, where he continued to receive threatening phone calls. One day, a man who had been a regular patient stated that he was a member of the FARC, and told Rodriguez to come with him, or Rodriguez would be killed. Rodriguez escaped by saying that he first had to tend to another patient and slipping out of the back door. He reported the incident to the police, but decided not to attend a meeting with the prosecutor, because he feared for his life. Instead, he moved his family out of the country and came to the United States. He stated that, because of these incidents, he and his family had suffered greatly.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">At his removal hearing, Rodriguez submitted several exhibits, including: (1) a 2004 State Department Country Report on Colombia (\u201cCountry Report\u201d), stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that conflicts perpetrated by guerrilla groups caused between 3,000-4000 deaths in 2004; (2) a psychological report from the Florida Center for Survivors of Torture, stating that, based on Rodriguez\u2019s statements regarding his encounters with the FARC, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder; and (3) several official reports, stating that Rodriguez had been threatened by the FARC in Colombia. In addition, Rodriguez testified that, in March 1998, three men approached him as he was leaving his office, identifying themselves as members of the FARC, and asked him to join them as a dentist and a link to peasants in the area. He told the men that he would not join them because he did not agree with their political views and their use of violence. A week later, someone called his office, identifying himself as a member of FARC, and, when Rodriguez again declined the offer to work with the FARC, the caller said that Rodriguez soon would receive a call that would change his mind. A few months later, another individual called him and told him that his brother-in-law had been kidnaped, and, a week later, he received another call, in which the caller stated that his brother-in-law had been killed and that Rodriguez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>was the cause of the murder. About a week later, someone called and told him that \u201cthey were not playing around.\u201d AR at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">In July, three police officers came to Rodriguez\u2019s office and warned him that they had reason to believe that the guerillas were planning an attempt on his life, and they recommended that he relocate to another city. Rodriguez went to the may- or\u2019s office to report what had happened, and then went to the commander of the police, who provided Rodriguez with a truck and two police officers to assist him in moving his office to a nearby city. Eight months after relocating, he received a phone call from a guerilla, stating that the FARC had located him, there was no use in hiding, and \u201cif [he] was not with them, [he] was against them.\u201d AR at 129-30. Again, Rodriguez told the caller that he would not join them, to which the caller replied that they considered Rodriguez their enemy and a military objective. After this, he again relocated his family, this time to Bogota.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">A year and a half later, Rodriguez found a piece of paper slipped under his door, on which was written a \u201cprayer for the dead,\u201d stating that he soon would die. After this, he moved his family to another part of Bogota. One day, a patient stated that he belonged to the FARC and that several people were waiting for Rodriguez outside. Rodriguez said that he had to attend to another patient and snuck out of a back door, at which point he drove to his home and told his wife to take their family to another city. On the road, he encountered a guerilla roadblock, but the man who came to his car recognized that Rodriguez was a dentist who had helped him in the past, and let Rodriguez leave, after warning him that he was on a list of people to be retained \u201cdead or alive.\u201d AR at 133-34. After this, he and his family fled to the United States. Rodriguez testified that he refused to work with the FARC because he disagreed with their political ideals and use of violence, and he feared that he would be killed if he returned to Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">In closing arguments, Rodriguez\u2019s counsel argued that Rodriguez had suffered persecution based on an imputed political opinion, because the FARC had interpreted his refusal to work with them as a rejection of their political ideals. The government argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the record contained evidence that the Colombian authorities attempted to assist Rodriguez, but Rodriguez left before the authorities could take appropriate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">The IJ denied Rodriguez\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, finding that, although Rodriguez\u2019s testimony was credible, he had not shown persecution on account of one of the five grounds recognized as a basis for political asylum. First, the IJ found that Rodriguez had not demonstrated past persecution because, while he testified that he had received threats, neither he nor any member of his immediate family was detained or physically harmed by the FARC. The IJ noted that generally harsh conditions, experienced by many other persons in a country, do not constitute persecution. Second, the IJ found, Rodriguez failed to show that he was threatened or harassed because of his politics, but rather, he was threatened because the FARC wanted to recruit him as a dentist. The IJ found that a guerilla group\u2019s attempt to coerce a person into performing a service does not constitute persecution based on a protected ground. Furthermore, the IJ found, Rodriguez had not demonstrated a probability that he would be persecuted based on a protected ground, in order to qualify for withholding of removal, and had not shown that he would be tortured by, or with the acquiescence of, the Colombian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>government, in order to qualify for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Rodriguez appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. In his brief, he asserted that he had been persecuted for multiple reasons, both because he refused to provide dental services and because of his political opinion against the FARC, and the IJ erred in requiring that he show that he was persecuted solely on the basis of his political opinion. He argued that, because the FARC wanted to use him to recruit peasants into their political cause, and he rejected their political ideals, the record supported a finding that he was persecuted based on his political beliefs. He also asserted that he was eligible for withholding of removal, and argued that he was eligible for CAT relief because the FARC\u2019s tactics constituted psychological torture, and the Colombian government\u2019s inaction constituted acquiescence to this torture. Finally, he argued that mental distress can constitute persecution, and the IJ erred in finding that the FARC\u2019s threats against him did not constitute persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">The BIA dismissed Rodriguez\u2019s appeal, affirming the IJ\u2019s decision that Rodriguez had failed to establish that the harm that he feared was on account of a protected ground. The BIA found that, while an alien need not show that he was persecuted solely based on his political opinion, he must produce evidence from which it is reasonable to conclude that the harm was motivated, at least in part, by an actual or imputed political opinion. The BIA found that there was no evidence that the FARC persecuted Rodriguez based on his political opinion, but rather, the evidence demonstrated that they wanted him to render dental services to their organization and to help them recruit peasants. The BIA noted that a petitioner must demonstrate that he was persecuted based on his own opinion, and not because of the persecutor\u2019s, and therefore, Rodriguez had failed to demonstrate a nexus between his political opinion and his alleged persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">The BIA next concluded that, because Rodriguez had failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, he also had failed to meet the higher burden required for withholding of removal. Regarding his CAT claim, the BIA found that, because the evidence showed that the Colombian authorities had been \u201cvery helpful\u201d in response to Rodriguez\u2019s complaints about harassment, he had not shown that the government had acquiesced to any psychological torture perpetrated by the FARC. The BIA declined to reach the question of whether psychological injury constituted torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">On appeal, Rodriguez asserts that he was persecuted for dual reasons, namely, because the FARC wanted to employ his dental services, and because of his political opposition to the FARC, and argues that the BIA erred in finding that he was not persecuted for his political opinion. Moreover, he asserts, the FARC had a \u201cpolitical motive\u201d for persecuting him, in that it wanted him to join the organization and to communicate with the peasants on its behalf. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 17. In addition, he notes his testimony that, during a phone call in which he refused to join the FARC, the caller stated that \u201cif [Rodriguez] was not with them he was against them,\u201d which showed that his persecution was \u201cwholly political.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He <em>next ar-g\u00fces </em>that he was entitled to withholding of removal, asserting that the evidence that he presented, including the Country Report, established that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would be persecuted upon his return to Colombia. <em>Id. </em>at 20. Finally, he argues that he should have been granted CAT relief, asserting that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>suffered psychological torture, and the Colombian government acquiesced to his torture in that they were \u201cpassively] compliant]\u201d with it. <em>Id. </em>at 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">When, as here, the BIA issues its own opinion, we review only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s finding that an alien has not established persecution on the basis of a protected ground, our review is limited to whether the BIA\u2019s decision was \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (internal quotation and citation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the [BIA\u2019s] fact findings, [this Court] must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). Only in a \u201crare case\u201d does the record compel the conclusion that an alien has suffered past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1239 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">To establish asylum eligibility based on political opinion, the alien carries the burden to prove, with credible evidence, either that (1) he suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion, or (2) he has a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his political opinion will cause him to be persecuted. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citation omitted). \u201cThe asylum applicant must establish eligibility for asylum by offering \u2018credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). Establishing a history of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption that the alien has a fear of future persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">To warrant reversal of the BIA\u2019s finding that an alien has failed to demonstrate a sufficient nexus between his political opinion and his alleged persecution, we must be compelled to find that the alien will be persecuted <em>\u201cbecause of\u2019 </em>his political opinion. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. at 816 (emphasis in original). The fact that the guerillas\u2019 actions are motivated by the guerillas\u2019 political belief is \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the question of whether the alien was persecuted on account of the <em>alien\u2019s </em>political belief. <em>Id. </em>at 481-82, 112 S.Ct. at 815-16. In <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>the Supreme Court held that the record did not compel a finding of a nexus between the alleged persecution and the alien\u2019s political opinion, where the alien\u2019s family had refused to join anti-government guerrilla forces because the \u201cguerillas [were] against the government,\u201d and the family feared retaliation from the government. <em>Id. </em>at 479-80, 112 S.Ct. at 814-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">In the context of a claim for withholding of removal, we have held that \u201c[i]t is not enough to show that [the alien] was or will be persecuted or tortured due to [the alien\u2019s] refusal to cooperate with the guerrillas.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). In <em>Sanchez </em>we held that the record did not compel a finding of a nexus between the alien\u2019s political opinion and her alleged persecution, even though the FARC threatened the alien for refusal to cooperate with them because she was \u201cnot in agreement with the way the FARC had destroyed the country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436-38 (alteration omitted); <em>see also Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>No. 06-10209, slip op., 487 F.3d 815, 2007 WL 1485954 (11th Cir. May 23, 2007) (evidence that petitioners were persecuted for failure to pay \u201cwar tax\u201d to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>FARC did not compel finding that persecution was on account of political opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The record does not compel a finding of a nexus between Rodriguez\u2019s alleged persecution and his actual or imputed political opinion. Rodriguez\u2019s testified that the FARC sought him out because they wanted him to perform dental services for their members. <em>(See </em>AR at 126-30). While Rodriguez argues that the FARC also wanted him to help in spreading their political views, making the FARC\u2019s motives \u201cpolitical,\u201d that evidence of the FARC\u2019s motive does not constitute evidence that the guerrillas persecuted him \u201cbecause of\u2019 <em>his </em>political opinion. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481-82, 112 S.Ct. at 815-16. Moreover, Rodriguez\u2019s testimony, that the FARC threatened him after he told them that he disagreed with their cause, could support an inference of persecution because of his political beliefs, but the evidence equally supports an inference that he was threatened simply because of his refusal to provide dental services, and the record does not \u201ccompel\u201d this Court to hold otherwise. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">To qualify for withholding of removal or CAT relief, an alien must establish standards more stringent that those for asylum eligibility; thus, an alien unable to prove a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution based on a protected ground, as required for asylum relief, necessarily fails to demonstrate a \u201cclear probability of persecution,\u201d the \u201cstandard applicable to a claim for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 764 (11th Cir.2007). In addition, to qualify for CAT relief, an alien must demonstrate a likelihood that he will be tortured at the \u201cacquiescence\u201d of the government, meaning that the government was aware of the torture, yet breached its responsibility to intervene. <em>Reyes-Sanchez, </em>369 F.3d at 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Because the record does not compel the conclusion that Rodriguez\u2019s has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground, the record also does not compel the conclusion that he satisfies the more stringent standard applicable to a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.2006). Moreover, the record does not compel a reversal of the BIA\u2019s finding that the Colombian government did not \u201cacquiesce\u201d to the FARC\u2019s activities, in order to qualify him for CAT relief, especially given Rodriguez\u2019s testimony that the police provided him with protection and assistance in relocating his business, and investigated his complaints as they arose. <em>See </em>AR at 129-30, 213.
