The consecutive sentencing provision of \u00a7 7401(3) mandates that prison terms for the enumerated drug offenses must run consecutively with sentences imposed for other felonies. The issue is whether the consecutive sentencing provision of \u00a7 7401(3) falls within the term \u201cpenalty\u201d in the conspiracy statute. In <em>People v Banks </em>and <em>People v Tucker, </em>we are asked to determine whether consecutive sentences for an enumerated drug offense and for conspiracy to commit the enumerated drug offense, committed in the same criminal transaction, violates the protection against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">We hold that the Legislature intended the consecutive sentencing provision of \u00a7 7401(3) to fall within the term \u201cpenalty\u201d in the conspiracy statute because \u00a7 7401(3), like the conspiracy statute, is directed at the sentencing court, the entity that imposes penalties. We further hold that consecutive sentences for an enumerated drug offense and for conspiracy to commit the enumerated drug offense do not violate double jeopardy, even when the offenses are committed in the same criminal transaction. We base this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>holding on our conclusion that the Legislature intended multiple punishments at a single trial for persons who commit a drug offense enumerated in \u00a7 7401(3) and conspiracy to commit that drug offense. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision in <em>People v Denio </em>and affirm the Court of Appeals decisions in <em>People v Banks </em>and <em>People v Tucker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"AC2r\">\n<em>PEOPLE v DENIO</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">On August 3, 1994, during trial, Kimber Denio pleaded guilty of conspiracy to deliver less than fifty grams of cocaine, MCL 750.157a; MSA 28.354(1), MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(iv); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(iv), and conspiracy to deliver marijuana, MCL 750.157a; MSA 28.354(1), MCL 333.7401(2)(d); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On September 7, 1994, pursuant to the consecutive sentencing provision of \u00a7 7401(3), the trial court sentenced Denio to consecutive terms of three to twenty years in prison on the conspiracy to deliver cocaine conviction and two to four years in prison on the conspiracy to deliver marijuana conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">Denio appealed his sentences, arguing that the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences.

Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law, see <em>St George Greek Orthodox Church of Southgate v Laupmanis Associates, PC, </em>204 Mich App 278, 282; 514 NW2d 516 (1994), which we review de novo. <em>Cardinal Mooney High School v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number><em>Michigan High School Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>437 Mich 75, 80; 467 NW2d 21 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">The purpose of statutory interpretation is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>People v Morris, </em>450 Mich 316, 326; 537 NW2d 842 (1995). If a statute is clear, we enforce it as plainly written. <em>Id. </em>However, if a statute is susceptible to more than one interpretation, we must engage in judicial construction and interpret the statute. <em>Id.; Piper v Pettibone Corp, </em>450 Mich 565, 571; 542 NW2d 269 (1995). Furthermore, a statute that is unambiguous on its face can be \u201c \u2018rendered ambiguous by its interaction with and its relation to other statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Jahner, </em>433 Mich 490, 496; 446 NW2d 151 (1989), quoting 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction, \u00a7 46.04, pp 86-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">In inteipreting a statute, words are to be given their common, generally accepted meaning. MCL 8.3a; MSA 2.212(1); <em>Hawley v Snider, </em>346 Mich 181, 185; 77 NW2d 754 (1956). Furthermore, when terms are not expressly defined by a statute, a court may consult dictionary definitions. See <em>In re Forfeiture of Bail Bond, </em>209 Mich App 540, 544; 531 NW2d 806. (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">The \u201crule of lenity\u201d provides that courts should mitigate punishment when the punishment in a criminal statute is unclear. <em>Jahner, supra </em>at 499-500. This rule, however, does not apply when construing the consecutive sentencing provision of \u00a7 7401(3) because our Legislature mandated in MCL 333.1111(2); MSA 14.15(1 111)(2) that provisions of the Public Health Code, which include \u00a7 7401(3), are to be \u201cliberally construed for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the people of this state.\u201d <em>Morris, supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>326-327. Furthermore, the \u201crule of lenity\u201d does not apply in this case, given the penal nature of \u00a7 7401(3) and the conspiracy statute. See <em>Morris, supra </em>at 327.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Turning to the case now before us, Denio argues that \u00a7 7401(3) did not authorize the trial court to impose consecutive sentences because he was not convicted of a drug offense enumerated in that section; rather, he was convicted of conspiracy to commit an enumerated drug offense. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">Denio was convicted of conspiracy to deliver less than fifty grams of cocaine and conspiracy to deliver marijuana. The conspiracy statute provides that a person convicted of conspiracy</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-8\">shall be punished by <em>&amp; penalty </em>equal to that which could be imposed if he had been convicted of committing the crime he conspired to commit and in the discretion of the court an additional penalty of a fine of $10,000.00 may be imposed. [MCL 750.157a(a); MSA 28.354(l)(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">A person convicted of delivery of less than fifty grams of cocaine \u201cshall be imprisoned for not less than 1 year nor more than 20 years, and may be fined not more than $25,000.00, or placed on probation for life.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At the time of Demo\u2019s trial, a person convicted of delivery of marijuana could be punished \u201cby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>imprisonment for not more than 2 years, or . . . fine[d] . . . [for] not more than $2,000.00, or both.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The trial court sentenced Denio to consecutive terms of imprisonment for his convictions pursuant to \u00a7 7401(3), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-6\">A term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to subsection (2)(a) or section 7403(2)(a)(i), 00, (in), or (iv) shall be imposed to run consecutively with any term of imprisonment imposed for the commission of another felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">The parties do not dispute that the conspiracy statute unambiguously mandates that a person convicted of conspiracy must be punished by the same \u201cpenalty\u201d as if he were convicted of the substantive crime he conspired to commit. They also do not dispute that \u00a7 7401(3) unambiguously mandates that prison terms for the enumerated drug offenses must run consecutively with sentences imposed for other felonies. The parties differ, however, in their definition of the term \u201cpenalty\u201d in the conspiracy statute. Essentially, Denio argues that the consecutive sentencing provision of \u00a7 7401(3) does not fall within the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>\u201cpenalty\u201d; the people argue it does. We believe both definitions are plausible, and therefore engage in statutory construction to interpret the conspiracy statute. See <em>Morris, supra </em>at 326; <em>Piper, supra </em>at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">This Court interpreted the term \u201cpenalty\u201d in the conspiracy statute in <em>Jahner, supra, </em>where we addressed whether a person sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder is eligible for parole consideration under MCL 791.234(4); MSA 28.2304(4). Section 234(4), the so-called \u201clifer law,\u201d provides that those sentenced to life for first-degree murder or to a minimum term of imprisonment for a major controlled substance offense, are not eligible for parole consideration. We concluded that a person convicted of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder was eligible for parole consideration because the term \u201cpenalty\u201d in the conspiracy statute does not include the parole considerations set forth in the \u201clifer law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502-503. We reasoned that the Legislature could not have intended parole considerations to fall within the term \u201cpenalty\u201d in the conspiracy statute because the conspiracy statute is directed at the sentencing court, the entity that imposes penalties, and the \u201clifer law\u201d is directed at the Parole Board, the independent body that reduces penalties imposed by trial courts on the basis of rehabilitation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-6\">While the conspiracy statute and the \u201clifer law\u201d both address in general terms the punishment of criminal activity and therefore should be read in pari materia, the two statutes address separate and distinct considerations. The conspiracy statute is directed to the trial court and requires that it impose a particular \u201cpenalty\u201d for the offense. However, the statutory command is discharged at the time of sentencing. By contrast, the \u201clifer law\u201d is not directed at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>sentencing court, but rather governs the power and authority of the Parole Board to grant parole under certain circumstances. Given the autonomy granted to the Parole Board and the separate function which it serves, we do not believe that the term \u201cpenalty\u201d as it is used in the conspiracy statute encompasses the parole considerations set forth in the \u201clifer law.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 502.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Unlike parole considerations directed to the Parole Board, the consecutive sentencing provision of \u00a7 7401(3), like the conspiracy statute, is directed at the sentencing courts. Accordingly, we hold that the consecutive sentencing provision of \u00a7 7401(3) constitutes a \u201cpenalty\u201d as that term is used in the conspiracy statute. Thus, being a \u201cpenalty,\u201d the trial court was required to impose Denio\u2019s sentence for conspiracy to deliver less , than fifty grams of cocaine to run consecutively with his sentence for conspiracy to deliver marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">We note that our holding is consistent with the legislative purpose of the consecutive sentencing provision of \u00a7 7401(3), which was to deter drug offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-7\">The enhancement of punishment through consecutive sentencing is a legislative action taken for the ostensible purpose of deterring certain criminal behavior. <em>People v Harden, </em>434 Mich 196, 201; 454 NW2d 371 (1990). With its ' focus on enhancement of the punishment for commission of certain controlled substance offenses, it is apparent that the aim of \u00a7 7401(3) is to deter commission of those offenses by mandating that sentences imposed for the drug crimes enumerated in the statute run consecutively to sentences imposed for other felonies. <em>[Morris, supra </em>at 327-328.] ,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Furthermore, the need for deterrence is not diminished when the crime at issue is conspiracy to commit the enumerated drug offense rather than the enu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>merated drug offense itself. In fact, the need for deterrence is arguably more dire given the number of people involved in the crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-4\">\u201c[Collective criminal agreement \u2014 partnership in crime\u2014 presents a greater potential threat to the public than individual delicts. Concerted action both increases the likelihood that the criminal object will be successfully attained and decreases the probability that the individuals involved will depart from their path of criminality. Group association for criminal purposes often, if not normally, makes possible the attainment of ends more complex than those which one criminal could accomplish. Nor is the danger of a conspiratorial group limited to the particular end toward which it has embarked. Combination in crime makes more likely the commission of crimes unrelated to the original purpose for which the group was formed. In sum, the danger which a conspiracy generates is not confined to the substantive offense which is the immediate aim of the enterprise.\u201d <em>[People v Carter, </em>415 Mich 558, 570; 330 NW2d 314 (1982), quoting <em>Callanan v United States, </em>364 US 587, 593-594; 81 S Ct 321; 5 L Ed 2d 312 (1961).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Finally, the common meaning of \u201cpenalty\u201d supports our holding. The <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>defines \u201cpenalty\u201d as \u201ca punishment imposed or incurred for a violation of law [or] rule . . . .\u201d A sentencing court imposes punishment. By contrast, the Parole Board relaxes the punishment already imposed by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">Accordingly, because the consecutive sentencing provision of \u00a7 7401(3) falls within the term \u201cpenalty\u201d in the conspiracy statute, the trial court properly imposed Demo\u2019s cocaine conspiracy sentence to run consecutively with his marijuana conspiracy sentence. Thus, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision that reversed the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\"><em>PEOPLE v BANKS </em>AND <em>PEOPLE v TUCKER</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8H\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Banks and Tucker initially argue that their respective sentencing judges erred in imposing consecutive sentences because conspiracy to commit an enumerated drug offense does not constitute \u201canother felony\u201d as used in \u00a7 7401(3), especially because they committed both the enumerated drug offense and the other felony in the same criminal transaction. We reject defendants\u2019 arguments without further analysis because this Court in <em>Morris, supra, </em>held that \u201canother felony\u201d includes <em>\u201cany </em>other felony violation for which a defendant is being sentenced,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 328 (emphasis added), \u201cregardless of whether the offenses were committed as part of the same transaction or in different and distinct transactions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Defendants also argue that consecutive sentences for an enumerated drug offense and for conspiracy to commit the enumerated drug offense, committed in the same criminal transaction, violate the protection against double jeopardy. This alternative argument proffered by Banks and Tucker is an issue of first impression. It was left unresolved by <em>Morris.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We address that issue today, and, for the reasons that follow, find no double jeopardy violation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AbL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">The guarantee against double jeopardy protects against multiple prosecutions and multiple punishments for the \u201csame offense.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> At issue in the cases before us is whether a drug offense enumerated in \u00a7 7401(3) and conspiracy to commit that enumerated drug offense, when committed in the same criminal transaction, constitutes the \u201csame offense\u201d for double jeopardy purposes. The intent of the Legislature is the determining factor under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States and Michigan Constitutions. <em>People v Robideau, </em>419 Mich 458, 485; 355 NW2d 592 (1984). Therefore, the issue, stated more precisely, is whether the Legislature intended multiple punishments at a single trial for persons who commit, in the same criminal transaction, a drug offense enumerated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>in \u00a7 7401(3) and conspiracy to commit that drug offense.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the test enumerated in <em>Blockburger v United States, </em>284 US 299, 304; 52 S Ct 180; 76 L Ed 306 (1932), is to be used to determine legislative intent in analyzing the protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-6\">For over half a century we have determined whether a' defendant has been punished twice for the \u201csame offense\u201d by applying the rule set forth in <em>Blockburger v United States, </em>284 US 299, 304; 52 S Ct 180; 76 L Ed 306 (1932). If \u201cthe same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In subsequent applications of the test, we have often concluded that two different statutes define the \u201csame offense,\u201d typically because one is a lesser included offense of the other. <em>[Rutledge v United States, </em>517 US 292,_; 116 S Ct 1241; 134 L Ed 2d 419, 426 (1996).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">If the <em>Blockburger </em>test is satisfied, it is presumed that the Legislature did not intend to punish the defendant under both statutes. <em>Whalen v United States, </em>445 US 684, 691-692; 100 S Ct 1432; 63 L Ed 2d 715 (1980). This presumption is rebutted, however, by a clear indication that the Legislature intended punishment under both statutes. <em>Albernaz v United States, </em>450 US 333, 340; 101 S Ct 1137; 67 L Ed 2d 275 (1981); <em>Mis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number><em>souri v Hunter, </em>459 US 359, 368-369; 103 S Ct 673; 74 L Ed 2d 535 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">This Court has rejected the <em>Blockburger </em>test in analyzing the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Michigan Constitution, and instead uses traditional means to determine the intent of the Legislature, such as the subject, language, and history of the statutes. <em>Robideau, supra </em>at 486-487. In <em>Robideau, supra </em>at 487-488, we provided some guidance in furtherance of this task:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-6\">Statutes prohibiting conduct that is violative of distinct social norms can generally be viewed as separate and amenable to permitting multiple punishments. A court must identify the type of harm the Legislature intended to prevent. Where two statutes prohibit violations of the same social norm, albeit in a somewhat different manner, as a general principle it can be concluded that the Legislature did not intend multiple punishments. For example, the crimes of larceny over $100, MCL 750.356; MSA 28.588, and larceny in a building, MCL 750.360; MSA 28.592, although having separate elements, are aimed at conduct too similar to conclude that multiple punishment was intended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-7\">A further source of legislative intent can be found in the amount of punishment expressly authorized by the Legislature. Our criminal statutes often build upon one another. Where one statute incorporates most of the elements of a base statute and then increases the penalty as compared to the base statute, it is evidence that the Legislature did not intend punishment under both statutes. The Legislature has taken conduct from the base statute, decided that aggravating conduct deserves additional punishment, and imposed it accordingly, instead of imposing dual convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-8\">We do not intend these principles to be an exclusive list. Whatever sources of legislative intent exist should be considered. If no conclusive evidence of legislative intent can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>be discerned, the rule of lenity requires the conclusion that separate punishments were not intended.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">In analyzing the intent of the Legislature, it must be remembered that \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s authority to define a single criminal \u2018act\u2019 or \u2018offense\u2019 is not diminished by the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d <em>People v Wakeford, </em>418 Mich 95, 108; 341 NW2d 68 (1983). The Legislature is free to determine what activity constitutes a criminal offense subject to criminal penalty. <em>Id.; Robideau, supra </em>at 485. The Double Jeopardy Clauses restrict the courts from imposing more punishment than that intended by the Legislature. <em>Wakeford, supra </em>at 108; <em>Robideau, supra </em>at 469. Thus, if the Legislature desires, it may specifically authorize penalties for what would otherwise be the \u201csame offense.\u201d <em>People v Sturgis, </em>427 Mich 392, 403; 397 NW2d 783 (1986). \u201c]C]umulative punishment of the same conduct under two different statutes in a single trial does not run afoul of the Double Jeopardy Clause in either the federal or state system.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">Turning to the cases now before us, we conclude that the trial courts\u2019 imposition of consecutive sentences for Banks\u2019 and Tucker\u2019s conspiracy and drug convictions did not run afoul of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States or Michigan Constitution. Under both federal and state analyses, it is clear that the Legislature intended to separately punish a defendant convicted both of conspiracy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>commit a drug offense and of the substantive drug offense, even if he committed the offenses in the same criminal transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">With regard to the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution, Banks\u2019 and Tucker\u2019s conspiracy and drug offenses do not constitute the \u201csame offense\u201d under the <em>Blockburger </em>test because conspiracy requires a combination or agreement and the drug offenses require possession of an illegal drug. Accordingly, defendants\u2019 consecutive sentences, imposed pursuant to \u00a7 7401(3), do not violate the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">The consecutive sentencing provision of \u00a7 7401(3) also does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Michigan Constitution. Focusing on the first source of legislative intent enumerated in <em>Robideau, supra </em>at 487-488, harm to society, the crimes of conspiracy and drug possession violate distinct social norms. The crime of conspiracy is a continuing offense; it \u201cis presumed to continue until there is affirmative evidence of abandonment, withdrawal, disavowal, or defeat of the object of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v Castro, </em>972 F2d 1107, 1112 (CA 9, 1992). Accordingly, the crime of conspiracy poses a greater threat to society than the substantive crime forming the object of the conspiracy because \u201ceach day\u2019s acts bring a renewed threat of the substantive evil [the legislature] sought to prevent.\u201d <em>Toussie v United States, </em>397 US 112, 122; 90 S Ct 858; 25 L Ed 2d 156 (1970).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As the New Jersey Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>The [drag] conspiracy evidenced continuing and prolonged, rather than episodic, involvement in crime. The object of the conspiracy constituted a direct threat to society, as well as the indirect, albeit real, harm to persons who eventually would be mired in drags. <em>[In re Goldberg, </em>105 NJ 278, 283; 520 A2d 1147 (1987).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">In contrast to the overreaching and perpetual harm to society caused by the crime of conspiracy, the specific aim of the Legislature in enacting \u00a7 7401 was to curb drug trafficking. As indicated in the legislative analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-6\">\u201cSome persons claim that the state has failed to stem drag traffic because the penalties for drag dealing are not severe enough, and law enforcement tools are inadequate. They contend that the potential for profit in drag dealing is so great that Michigan\u2019s present penalties pose little or no deterrent to would-be violators, with lenient probation and parole policies weakening the threat of imprisonment still further.\u201d <em>[People v Fields, </em>448 Mich 58, 64; 528 NW2d 176 (1995), quoting House Legislative Analysis, HB 4190, Third Analysis, May 17, 1978.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">Another distinction between conspiracy and the substantive drug offense is that \u201cthe conspiracy statute punishes the planning of the offense\u201d and the drug statute \u201cpunishes the actual commission of the crime.\u201d Carter, <em>supra </em>at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">The second source of legislative intent enumerated in <em>Robideau, supra </em>at 487-488, the amount of punishment expressly authorized by the Legislature, is. not relevant to the cases now before us because the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>spiracy statute does not incoiporate \u201cmost of the elements\u201d of the drug statute. See <em>id. </em>at 487. We note, however, that the conspiracy statute provides for punishment equal to the substantive crime; it does not impose an hierarchical, harsher penalty based on the presence of aggravating factors.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Finally, the fact that Banks and Tucker committed the conspiracy and the substantive drug offense in the same criminal transaction is of no consequence. We have repeatedly held that conspiracy is a crime that is separate and distinct from the substantive crime that is its object. <em>Carter, supra </em>at 569; <em>People v Tinskey, </em>394 Mich 108; 228 NW2d 782 (1975); <em>People v Chambers, </em>279 Mich 73; 271 NW 556 (1937). Furthermore, the crime of conspiracy does not merge into the offense committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. MCL 768.4; MSA 28.1027 (abolishing the merger doctrine); <em>People v Causley, </em>299 Mich 340; 300 NW 111 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">Therefore, we hold, on the basis of the intent of the Legislature, that it does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of either the United States or Michigan Constitution to sentence a defendant to consecutive prison terms for conviction of a drug offense enumerated in \u00a7 7401(3) and conspiracy to commit that offense, even if committed in the same criminal transaction. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals properly affirmed the trial courts\u2019 imposition of consecutive sentences.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>in</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision in <em>People v Denio </em>holding that the trial court was without authority to impose consecutive sentences pursuant to \u00a7 7401(3). Consecutive sentences were proper. Furthermore, we affirm the Court of Appeals decisions in <em>People v Banks </em>and <em>People v Tucker, </em>Contrary to defendants\u2019 arguments, their consecutive sentences, imposed pursuant to \u00a7 7401(3), did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of either the United States or Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<judges id=\"b963-5\">Mallett, C.J., and Brickley, Boyle, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-7\"> Section 157a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-8\">Any person who conspires together with 1 or more persons to commit an offense prohibited by law, or to commit a legal act in an illegal manner is guilty of the crime of conspiracy punishable as provided herein:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-9\">(a) except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) if commission of the offense prohibited by law is punishable by imprisonment for 1 year or more, the person convicted under this section shall be punished by a penalty equal to that which could be imposed if he had been convicted of committing the crime he conspired to commit and in the discretion of the court an additional penalty of a fine of $10,000.00 may be imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-10\">(b) Any person convicted of conspiring to violate any provision of this act relative to illegal gambling or wagering or any other acts or ordinances relative to illegal gambling or wagering shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than 5 years or by a fine of not more than $10,000.00, or both such fine and imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-11\">(c) If commission of the offense prohibited by law is punishable by imprisonment for less than 1 year, except as provided in paragraph (b), the person convicted under this section shall be imprisoned for not more than 1 year nor fined more than $1,000.00, or both such fine and imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-12\">(d) Any person convicted of conspiring to commit a legal act in an illegal manner shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than 5 years or by a fine of not more than $10,000.00, or both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b944-13\"> Section 7401(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>A term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to subsection (2) (a) or section 7403(2)(a)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) shall be imposed to run consecutively with any term of imprisonment imposed for the commission of another felony.

This Court in <em>Peo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number><em>ple v New, </em>427 Mich 482, 491; 398 NW2d 358 (1986), relying on federal precedent, concluded that a defendant pleading guilty could raise on appeal double jeopardy claims, unless his claim \u201crelates solely to the capacity of the state to prove defendant\u2019s factual guilt . . . .\u2019\u2019In <em>United States v Broce, </em>488 US 563, 575-576; 109 S Ct 757; 102 L Ed 2d 927 (1989), the United States Supreme Court held that a guilty plea waives a defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim if the court must rely on evidence outside the guilty plea record to determine the merits of his claim. Accordingly, Banks\u2019 argument that his sentences violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Michigan Constitution on the basis of \u201cfactual double jeopardy,\u201d see <em>Carter, supra </em>at 583-584, is waived.

We recognize this potential for abuse. However, we believe that the procedural safeguards in place sufficiently guard against such concern.

MCL 766.13; MSA 28.931 (preliminary examination); MCL 767.42; MSA 28.982 (preliminary examination condition precedent to filing information); MCR 6.110(F) . Pfirther, if the magistrate finds probable cause exists, the defendant can seek review of that decision in the circuit court. <em>Genesee Prosecutor v Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>391 Mich 115, 119-120; 215 NW2d 145 (1974). With these safeguards noted, we bring this potential for abuse to the attention of the magistrates and remind them of the important role they play in safeguarding the rights of both the defendant and the people of the State of Michigan. The reviewing magistrate should carefully examine the conspiracy charge to ensure that sufficient evidence exists for each of the elements of that separate crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b963-6\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2qs\">(dissenting).

It seems obvious that the conspiracy statute\u2019s reference to the underlying substantive offense is simply a shortcut for allotting prison terms without having to enact separate statutory provisions for conspiracy that are merely repetitions of the allowable prison terms or fines enumerated for every underlying substantive offense in the Penal Code and the controlled substances act.

Notwithstanding the majority\u2019s tortured parsing of the term \u201cpenalty\u201d and its heavy reliance on the mere truism that <em>sentencing </em>provisions are directed at <em>sentencing </em>courts, the dispositive fact is that neither charge to which he pleaded guilty subjected him to a term of imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>ment pursuant to \u00a7 7401(2)(a) or any of the subsections of \u00a7 7403(2) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">The majority also ignores the black-letter principle that the specific controls the general.
