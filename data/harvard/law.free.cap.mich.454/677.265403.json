The Court of Appeals found that the prior inconsistent statements were inadmissible hearsay that could not be used for the purpose of impeachment, reversed defendant\u2019s convictions and remanded the case for a new trial. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">After a jury trial in the Eaton Circuit Court, Robert Kilboum, the defendant, was convicted of two counts of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The events giving rise to the charges related to the firing of a firearm into the home of Pamela and Gary McNamara. Testimony at trial established that on the evening of August 18, 1991, at approximately 8 o\u2019clock, Mr. and Mrs. McNamara were walking outside their home when they heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>loud noises coming from the direction of the Kilboum residence. According to Pamela McNamara\u2019s testimony at trial, she and her husband saw several people at the Kilboum residence that appeared to be fighting. Mrs. McNamara immediately called the Eaton County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Two deputy sheriffs responded to the call. No arrests were made. Mrs. McNamara testified that soon thereafter she received a threatening phone call from Robert Kilbourri, Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Pamela McNamara further testified that on that same evening, at approximately 11 o\u2019clock, she and her husband were awakened by a loud crashing noise in their kitchen. As Mr. McNamara got up from bed to investigate the noise, a gun went off, and a bullet passed directly over his head. Both Mr. and Mrs. McNamara retreated to the floor for safety. They heard an additional four to five shots being fired near or at their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Shortly thereafter, Deputy Michael Schnepp and Deputy Leland Taylor arrived at the McNamara residence in response to a \u201c911\u201d call from Mr. McNamara. At trial, Deputy Schnepp testified that when he arrived at the McNamara residence, he found both Mr. and Mrs. McNamara in their home, visibly terrified. After investigating the McNamara home, Deputy Schnepp discovered a broken axe handle just outside the broken kitchen window. He also observed several bullet holes in the McNamara home. Both Mrs. McNamara and Detective Leonard Benden testified that a trail of damage revealed that the miscreants had withdrawn from the McNamara residence in the direction of the Kilboum residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Robert Kilboum, Sr., the defendant\u2019s father, was called as a witness in the State\u2019s case in chief. Mr. Kilboum testified that on the day of the incident, he and his three sons \u2014 including the defendant \u2014 defendant\u2019s girlfriend and friend, were at his trailer drinking, talking, and partying. According to Mr. Kilboum, he and his guests drank approximately three fifths and half a gallon of whiskey that evening. After police finished their inquiry into the report of domestic violence and noise at the Kilboum residence, Mr. Kilboum testified that he called the McNamaras simply to ask them to first call him before calling the police. He testified that Pamela McNamara became irate with him on the telephone, and that he did not threaten her in any way. Mr. Kilboum could not remember if he had discussed the phone call with any of his sons.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">During the prosecutor\u2019s direct examination of Mr. Kilboum, the following exchange regarding prior conversations between Mr. Kilboum, Sr., and Detective Bender occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-6\"><em>Q. </em>[In] [o]ne of those conversations did you indicate to Detective Benden that Robert Wesley Kilboum [defendant] was responsible for the shooting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-7\"><em>A. </em>No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-8\"><em>Q. </em>You don\u2019t recall that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-9\"><em>A. </em>No. I recall telling Detective Benden that Robert would turn himself in. That\u2019s when Detective Benden told me that Craig had already called and admitted doing the shooting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Later in the state\u2019s case in chief, on redirect examination, the following exchange between the prosecutor and Detective Benden occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number><em>Q. </em>Sir, did you have a discussion with Robert Kilboum, Sr. on the telephone when you were trying to get everyone together to talk to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-5\"><em>A. </em>I had quite a few conversations with Mr. Kilboum on the phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-6\"><em>Q. </em>Directing your attention [to] the 26th of August 1991, did you receive a phone call from him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-7\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-8\">Q. On that date did he [Robert Kilboum, Sr.] indicate who was responsible for the shooting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-9\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-10\"><em>Q. </em>What did he state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-11\"><em>A. </em>That little Bob [defendant] was the one who shot into the house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">Defendant objected to this questioning on the basis that the officer\u2019s testimony regarding statements purportedly made by Mr. Kilboum was inadmissible hearsay. The trial judge overruled the objection, holding that it was admissible for impeachment purposes to contradict Mr. Kilboum, Sr.\u2019s, previous in-court denial of making the statement. The trial judge instmcted the jury that the testimony of Detective Benden regarding Mr. Kilboum, Sr.\u2019s, prior inconsistent statement could only be used to evaluate the credibility of Mr. Kilboum, Sr., and not to decide defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">A jury found defendant guilty of two counts of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder. The trial court judge sentenced defendant to 60 to 120 months in prison. The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s convictions and remanded the case for a new trial. We granted leave to appeal, lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>ited to the issue of admissibility of the prior inconsistent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">In reversing defendant\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeals held that the testimony by Detective Benden regarding out-of-court statements purportedly made by Robert Kilboum, Sr., which implicated defendant as the person who had shot into the victims\u2019 house, was inadmissible. The Court of Appeals held that the statements were hearsay and \u201cdid not become admissible for impeachment purposes merely because the prosecutor had previously elicited a denial of the purported statements] by Robert Kilboum, Sr.\u201d Unpublished memorandum opinion, issued September 22, 1995 (Docket No. 155397). In support of this, the Court of Appeals relied on <em>People v </em>Stanaway, 446 Mich 643; 521 NW2d 557 (1994). However, it apparently misread the rale set forth by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Under the current provision of MRE 607 the government can impeach its own witness. The general rule is that evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of the witness may be admitted to impeach a witness even though the statement tends directly to inculpate the defendant. <em>United States v Miller, </em>664 F2d 94 (CA 5, 1981). <em>People v Stanaway </em>provided an exception to this mle: A prosecutor cannot use a statement that directly tends to inculpate the defendant under the guise of impeachment when there is no other testimony from the witness for which his credibility is relevant to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">In <em>People v Stanaway, </em>the defendant was charged with three counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.520d(l)(a); MSA 28.788(4)(l)(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>involving sexual intercourse with the complainant when she was fourteen years old. During the prosecution\u2019s case in chief, Stanaway\u2019s nephew was called to testify. When asked by the prosecutor if he had made a statement to Officer Peters regarding an incriminating statement Stanaway had made to the witness, the witness denied ever having made such a statement. The prosecution then called Officer Peters to the stand. The officer testified, over hearsay objections, that the nephew told the officer that Stanaway had said he had had sexual relations with a young girl and would be in a lot of trouble if caught. This Court held that the prior inconsistent statements could not be used to impeach credibility under MRE 613. The reasoning behind this is that the witness had no direct knowledge of any of the alleged incidents and was out of town at the time the incident would have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">The rule set forth in <em>People v Stanaway </em>is that the impeachment should be disallowed when (1) the substance of the statement purportedly used to impeach the credibility of the witness is relevant to the central issue of the case, and (2) there is no other testimony from the witness for which his credibility was relevant to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">This is a very narrow rule and does not apply in the instant case. Although the substance of the statements used to impeach the credibility of the witness were indeed relevant to a central issue of the case, the second prong of the test was not met because there was other relevant testimony from the witness for which his credibility was relevant. Robert Kilbourn, Sr., testified about a number of events that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>took place before the shooting, and indeed was a key actor in some of these events.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The facts here are distinguishable from the situation in <em>People v Ince, </em>21 F3d 576 (CA 4, 1994).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>People v Ince, </em>the court held that the probative value of the contradicting witness\u2019 testimony for impeachment value was \u201cnil.\u201d The court noted in <em>Ince </em>that the witness\u2019 in-court testimony did not affirmatively damage the government's case, and the prosecution had no need to attack her credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Here, there was at least one direct conflict between Mr. Kilbourn\u2019s testimony at trial and that of another witness. Mr. Kilboum testified that when he phoned Mrs. McNamara he only asked the McNamaras to contact him before calling the police, and that he made no threats. Mrs. McNamara, on the other hand, testified that Mr. Kilboum had made a threatening phone call to her. We find that the officer\u2019s testimony was admissible, because it could properly be used to impeach the credibility of Mr. Kilboum.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">rv</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Defendant also alleges that the testimony of Officer Benden was inadmissible because the testimony was designed to impeach Robert Kilboum, Sr., on a collateral matter. The record shows that no objection was made at trial on the grounds now asserted on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>It is well established that objections to admissibility not properly raised at trial cannot be later asserted on appeal. <em>Marietta v Cliffs Ridge, Inc, </em>385 Mich 364, 374; 189 NW2d 208 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">We reverse the Court of Appeals opinion vacating defendant\u2019s conviction. We remand this case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of those issues that defendant had raised and the Court of Appeals did not address.</p>\n<judges id=\"b935-7\">Mallett, C.J., and Boyle and Riley, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-10\"> MCL 750.84; MSA 28.279.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b934-9\"> We note that the rule set forth in <em>Stanaway </em>is narrower than the similar rule in the federal courts. The federal courts have held that impeachment may not be used as a subterfuge to place otherwise inadmissible hearsay before the jury. <em>United States v Rogers, </em>549 F2d 490 (CA 8, 1976). However, <em>Stanaway </em>is limited to hearsay statements that are relevant to the central issue of the case, not merely \u201cotherwise . . . inadmissible hearsay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b934-10\"> At trial defendant objected to this testimony solely on the basis of hearsay.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b935-8\">Brickley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6ey\">(concurring). I concur in the result reached by the majority. However, I cannot fully agree with the majority\u2019s reasoning. I would find that <em>People v Stanaway, </em>446 Mich 643; 521 NW2d 557 (1994), is not as technical as the majority suggests. Rather, I would apply <em>Stanaway </em>with more flexibility. Further, I would find that this case is factually distinguishable from <em>Stanaway, </em>and, therefore, a reversal is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">The majority finds that <em>Stanaway </em>only applies when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-11\">(1) the substance of the statement purportedly used to impeach the credibility of the witness is relevant to the central issue of the case, and (2) there is no other testimony from the witness for which his credibility was relevant to the case. <em>[Ante </em>at 683.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>The majority then finds that Mr. Kilboum<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provided sufficient testimony so as to avoid a violation of <em>Stanaway. Ante </em>at 683-684.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">I feel that this is too formal a reading of <em>Stanaway. </em>That case was a response to an attempted manipulation of the hearsay mies. A witness, the defendant\u2019s nephew, denied informing a police officer that the defendant had admitted involvement in the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 688-690. The prosecution then called the officer to testify that the nephew had previously told him that the defendant had made an incriminating statement. <em>Id. </em>at 690. The defense raised a hearsay objection, which the prosecution resisted by arguing that the officer was only called to impeach the nephew\u2019s credibility with an inconsistent statement. <em>Id. </em>at 690-692.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">The Court first noted that, other than the statement regarding the alleged admission, the nephew had not provided any relevant testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 692. Thus, the witness had failed to provide any testimony that made his credibility relevant. <em>Id. </em>at 693. Rather, \u201cthe prosecutor used the elicited denial as a means of introducing a highly prejudicial \u2018admission\u2019 that otherwise would have been inadmissible hearsay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693. Thus, on the basis of the subject matter of the witness\u2019 testimony, the Court determined that the impeachment should not have been allowed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">The majority does not adequately identify the testimony that brought Mr. Kilboum\u2019s credibility into question. Mr. Kilboum was asked questions that were cumulative, concerned undisputed facts, or were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>directly relevant to the main issue in the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, Mr. Kilboum was unconscious for the majority of the night and had no firsthand knowledge about what occurred at the McNamara residence. Thus, the majority of his testimony did not bring his credibility into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">However, Mr. Kilboum did testify that Officer Benden told him that one of his other sons, Craig Kilboum, had confessed to the crime. This testimony presented the possibility of another confession, and was relevant to the heart of the case. Further, it placed Mr. Kilboum\u2019s credibility at issue, especially regarding the conversation he had with Officer Benden. Thus, the prosecution was allowed to respond to this testimony by recalling Officer Benden.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">The majority disregards this point, and bases its finding on Mr. Kilboum\u2019s testimony as a whole. However, as I state above, most of this testimony was cumulative. I would not allow the prosecution to avoid the rule in <em>Stanaway </em>by eliciting such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">Further, I feel that the Court should recognize that the impeachment testimony in this case did not have the effect of a confession as did the testimony in <em>Stanaway. </em>The <em>Stanaway </em>Court was concerned that the officer\u2019s testimony would be constmed as evidence of a confession. <em>Id. </em>at 695. This concern grew from the fact that the officer testified that the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>ant\u2019s nephew told him that the defendant had admitted having a sexual encounter with a young girl. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, Officer Benden merely testified that Mr. Kilboum had told him that the defendant had fired the shots. There was no mention of any admission by the defendant to Mr. Kilboum. Therefore, even if taken as substantive evidence, Officer Benden\u2019s testimony did not amount to evidence of a confession. Thus, this case does not involve the type of error found prejudicial in <em>Stanaway. </em>This fact further distinguishes this case from <em>Stanaway.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">I concur in the reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-8\"> I will refer to the defendant\u2019s father as Mr. Kilbourn.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b937-8\"> While it is true that Mr. Kilboum did testify regarding whether he called the McNamaras, the prosecution had already elicited testimony from Mrs. McNamara on that issue. Thus, the prosecution either asked Mr. Kilboum a cumulative question or wished to provide Mr. Kilboum the opportunity to contradict the testimony of the McNamaras. Because the McNamaras\u2019 testimony provided evidence of motive, it is unlikely that the prosecution wished to impeach that testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b938-5\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AULW\">(dissenting). The majority states that it will not consider defendant\u2019s assertion that the testimony of Officer Benden was inadmissible because it was designed to impeach the witness on a collateral matter because \u201c[t]he record shows that no objection was made at trial on the grounds now asserted on appeal.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 684. Because the majority\u2019s refusal to consider defendant\u2019s argument is contrary to prior Michigan Supreme Court cases as well as federal law, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">First, <em>People v Stanaway, </em>446 Mich 643, 693; 521 NW2d 557 (1994), stated that \u201ca prosecutor may not use an elicited denial as a springboard for introducing substantive evidence under the guise of rebutting the denial. <em>People v Bennett, </em>393 Mich 445; 224 NW2d 840 (1975).\u201d Therefore, <em>Stanaway </em>itself relied on the collateral-matter rule asserted in <em>Bennett. </em>As stated several times in <em>Stanaway, </em>the only objection to the impeachment testimony was on hearsay grounds. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>While the prosecutor could have presented defendant\u2019s alleged admission by way of the nephew\u2019s statement, he could not have delivered it by way of the officer\u2019s testimony because the statement would be <em>impermissible hearsay.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-4\"><em>[Id. </em>at 693 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Second, in <em>Bennett, supra, </em>the exact position relied on by the majority was specifically rejected by the <em>Bennett </em>majority. The dissent in <em>Bennett </em>tried to make the same assertion the majority now makes when it stated that \u201c[d]efense counsel objected to the rebuttal testimony in question, but only in general terms. He did not' raise the [collateral] rationale in objection. In the absence of specifically framed objection, the trial court permitted defendant rebuttal .. . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452. However, this did not stop the Court from holding that the prosecution cannot elicit a denial from a witness on a material matter so that it can later introduce evidence in rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Finally, even the federal court case cited by the majority, <em>People v Ince, </em>21 F3d 576 (CA 4, 1994), disallowed a collateral attack where the only .objection was on hearsay grounds. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-7\">[T]he trial judge should have recognized the Government\u2019s tactic for what it was \u2014 an attempt to circumvent the hearsay rule and to infect the jury with otherwise inadmissible evidence of [the defendant\u2019s] alleged confession. <em>[Id. </em>at 582.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">The entire reason that the matter in this case was collateral is because it involved a hearsay statement that otherwise would have been inadmissible. To hold that an objection on hearsay grounds was not specific enough flies in the face of Michigan Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>precedent as well as federal law. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b940-5\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
