They were previously convicted in Muskegon County of conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver cocaine. Because both prosecutions center on the same dates, witnesses, and evidence, we granted leave to appeal, limited to the double jeopardy implications of the defendants\u2019 prosecutions in Oakland County.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We hold that the subsequent prosecution in Oakland County is barred by the Constitution of the United States and the Michigan Constitution. Therefore, the later convictions are reversed and vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">On December 11, 1989, Ronald Gardner,. Cato Peterson, Amir Wilson, and Aaron Banks were traveling in a white Cougar automobile from Detroit to Muskegon. Muskegon County Sheriff Deputy A1 VanHemert received a tip from a confidential informant that Aaron Banks and several other persons would be transporting crack cocaine to a Muskegon Heights neighborhood that afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Deputy VanHemert and another deputy, Stanley Berdinski, executed a legal stop and search of the vehicle. The deputies seized approximately 222 grams of crack cocaine and arrested the occupants of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">Ronald Gardner, Cato Peterson, and Amir Wilson each made statements to the officers. Mr. Gardner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>stated that he was paid two hundred dollars by Ricky Franklin to drive Messrs. Peterson, Wilson, and Banks to the Muskegon Heights area and that he had previously transported sellers and drugs to that area. He also stated he had picked up money at the home of \u201cMiss Louise\u201d in Muskegon and transported the cash back to Detroit.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Further, Gardner stated that Mr. Franklin was the head of the organization. He stated that cocaine was sometimes transported in the spare tire in the trunk, that the cocaine would be placed into the spare tire at a gas station in Detroit, and the tire would be left behind a warehouse in Muskegon after the cocaine was removed. He knew where Ricky Franklin lived and was willing to show the officers where the warehouse was located. Additionally, Gardner stated he sold drugs for Aaron Banks, that Banks was the boss of the Muskegon operation, and that Franklin gave the drugs to Banks to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Mr. Peterson stated to the officers that he was traveling to Muskegon to sell crack cocaine, that this was his second trip to Muskegon, and that Mr. Franklin was the head of the organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Defendant Wilson also made a statement to the Muskegon authorities after his arrest. He stated that he sold crack cocaine for Ricky Franklin and that he had sold drugs on three previous trips to Muskegon. He stated that Mr. Banks would stay at Miss Louise\u2019s house and dispense the crack baggies to the sellers there. Further, he stated that the cocaine was transported in the spare tire in the trunk, that it was easy to recruit sellers from Detroit, and that Mr. Robert Johnson was also involved in the sale of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>The Muskegon County Prosecutor charged defendants Wilson and Banks with possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver between 225 and 650 grams.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The charges were reduced after the cocaine was weighed to possession with intent to deliver between 50 and 225 grams of cocaine and conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">On June 6, 1990, Amir Wilson was convicted by a Muskegon County jury of possession with intent to deliver and conspiracy to deliver between 50 and 225 grams of cocaine. On July 3, 1990, Mr. Wilson was sentenced to two concurrent prison terms of eight to twenty years. On June 11, 1990, Mr. Banks was convicted in Muskegon County of possession of less than 50 grams of cocaine<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and conspiracy to possess less than 25 grams<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> arising out of the December 11, 1989, arrest. He was sentenced to ten to twenty years in prison and two years eight months to four years in prison, respectively.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">On July 5, 1990, Southfield police arrested Gerald Hill for possession with intent to deliver between 225 and 649 grams of cocaine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Oakland County officials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>began an investigation into Mr. Franklin\u2019s drag activities. At this time, the Muskegon and Oakland Counties Sheriff Departments joined efforts to investigate the \u201cFranklin organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In December 1990, an Oakland County citizens grand jury indicted Messrs. Wilson, Banks, Hill, Johnson, and another individual, Terrence Moore,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on charges of conspiring from October 1988 to December 1990 to possess with intent to deliver over 650 grams of cocaine.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Defendants Wilson and Banks moved to set aside the indictment on the basis of a violation of double jeopardy. Their motion was denied. Messrs. Wilson, Banks, Hill, and Johnson were jointly tried in September of 1991. Messrs. Wilson and Banks renewed their motion to dismiss at trial, and, again, the motion was denied. After the second trial, defendant Wilson was found guilty of conspiracy to deliver between 50 and 250 grams of cocaine. Defendant Banks was found guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver more than 650 grams of cocaine. The defendants appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>granted leave, limited to the double jeopardy issue. 450 Mich 904 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person shall ... be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .\u201d The Fifth Amendment double jeopardy protections are applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Benton v Maryland, </em>395 US 784; 89 S Ct 2056; 23 L Ed 2d 707 (1969). \u201cThe language of the Michigan Constitution\u2019s double jeopardy provision is substantially similar to that of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>People v Mezy, </em>453 Mich 269, 279; 551 NW2d 389 (1996). Michigan\u2019s Constitution, art 1, \u00a7 15, declares that \u201c[n]o person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy.\u201d Further, Michigan had codified the guarantee against double jeopardy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The double jeopardy guarantee protects against successive prosecutions for the same offense and protects against multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>North Carolina v Pearce, </em>395 US 711, 717; 89 S Ct 2072; 23 L Ed 2d 656 (1969). The double jeopardy protections are inherent in our system of jurisprudence because we believe that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty. <em>[Green v United States, </em>355 US 184, 187-188; 78 S Ct 221; 2 L Ed 2d 199 (1957).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">We follow the federal rule that if a defendant can make a prima facie showing of a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause, a second prosecution is barred unless the government can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence why double jeopardy principles do not bar prosecution. <em>Mezy, supra </em>at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">In order to make a prima facie case of double jeopardy, the defendant must show that he was prosecuted twice for the same offense. The same offense includes prosecution for a greater crime after conviction of the lesser included offense. See <em>Brown v Ohio, </em>432 US 161, 169; 97 S Ct 2221; 53 L Ed 2d 187 (1977). Conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver 50 to 224 grams of cocaine is a lesser included offense of conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver over 650 grams. See <em>People v Marji, </em>180 Mich App 525, 531; 447 NW2d 835 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Initially, in its brief to this Court in <em>Wilson, </em>the prosecution\u2019s only argument that more than one conspiracy existed is as follows,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">In <em>People v </em>Mezy, 453 Mich 269; 551 NW2d 389 (1996), this Honorable Court recently discussed the problem of determining whether there were two separate drag conspiracies or only one. A further problem is presented in dealing what the Court of Appeals has previously referred to as a \u201cchain conspiracy.\u201d <em>People v Meredith (On Remand), </em>209 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Mich App 403; 531 NW2d 749 (1995), lv den 450 Mich 852 (1995).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-4\">As can be .seen from the People\u2019s counter-statement of facts, drug conspiracies involve many individuals, who may have no knowledge of other conspirators or even the extent of the conspiracy when they become involved in it. In addition, as is again demonstrated in this case, certain individuals may only be known to others by a nickname. Further complicating prosecution in drug offenses is the fear inspired by such organizations, resulting in uncooperative witnesses and, as evidenced by Gardner\u2019s and Cato Peterson\u2019s statements in this case, a failure to fully disclose their own or others\u2019 participation in the conspiracy.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Contrary to the position of the dissent, the people\u2019s argument is not that this Court should find that more than one conspiracy existed, it is that this Court should hold that the <em>Brown </em>exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Moreover, in the Oakland County case, the people did not charge the defendants with separate conspiracies for agreements that occurred after the December 11, 1989, arrest of these defendants. The defendants were bound over only on one count of conspiracy to deliver or manufacture a controlled substance, MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Even assuming that the prosecution makes the argument alleged by the dissent, I would still hold that there was only one conspiracy. \u201cThe gist of the crime of conspiracy is the agreement of the conspirators to commit one or more unlawful acts, where one or more of the coconspirators do \u2018any act to effect the object of the conspiracy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mezy </em>at 284, quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>Braverman v United States, </em>317 US 49, 53; 63 S Ct 99; 87 L Ed 23 (1942). We continued in <em>Mezy:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">In order to determine what the extent of the agreement is, so that we may determine whether there are two conspiracies or only one, we will use the same \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test used in constitutional double jeopardy analysis. This test includes the following factors: 1) time, 2) persons acting as coconspirators, 3) the statutory offenses charged in the indictments, 4) the overt acts charged by the government or any other description of the offenses charged that indicate the nature and scope of the activity that the government sought to punish in each case, and 5) places where the events alleged as part of the conspiracy took place. The essence of the determination is whether there is one agreement to commit two crimes, or more than one agreement each with a separate object. <em>[Mezy, supra </em>at 285, citing <em>United States v Thomas, </em>759 F2d 659 (CA 8, 1985).[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">First, we will explore the time factor. The time frames of the two alleged conspiracies overlap. The felony information for the Muskegon conspiracy does not list a specific time frame. However, at Wilson\u2019s trial in Muskegon, the prosecutor argued that the agreement took place between December 7 and December 11. Also, the jury in Banks\u2019 case was instructed that the prosecution alleged the agreement was made between December 7 and 11, 1989. The overlap in time does not prove that there was only one conspiracy because \u201cmany drug offenses occur at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the same time without being connected,\u201d <em>Mezy, supra </em>at 288 (Brickley, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). However, unlike <em>Mezy, </em>the facts of this case indicate that there was only one agreement when the other elements of the test are reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The Muskegon trial was based on an alleged conspiracy between Cato Peterson, Ronald Gardner, Rick Franklin, Amir Wilson, and Aaron Banks. It was alleged by the Muskegon authorities that Franklin was the leader of the conspirators, Aaron Banks acted as a distributor of the cocaine in Muskegon, and cocaine was brought to Muskegon from the Metro Detroit area. In the Oakland County prosecution, it was alleged that Ricky Franklin was the leader of the conspirators, that Aaron Banks acted as a distributor (as did Robert Johnson), and that the cocaine was transported to Muskegon from the City of Detroit and certain areas of Oakland County. The difference was that additional conspirators were indicted in the Oakland County case. All the conspirators in the Muskegon case were considered conspirators in the Oakland County case, whether indicted or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Additionally, the statutory offenses were essentially the same. In Muskegon County, the defendants were charged with possession with intent to deliver between 50 and 225 grams of cocaine and conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver. However, no amount was addressed with respect to the conspiracy count. In Oakland County, the defendants were charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver more than 650 grams of a controlled substance. Therefore, the defendants were charged with a greater crime after being convicted of the lesser included offense. <em>Marji, supra </em>at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>The overt acts and offenses described by the people for both cases were similar. In fact, in the Oakland County case, the people spent one and one-half days recounting to the jury the facts of the Muskegon case. The same police officers and detectives testified about the same events, in the same location, involving the same evidence. Further, the same witnesses testified about the same events, in the same location, involving the same evidence. Essentially, the Oakland County trial was the Muskegon trial, plus more evidence of events that occurred after the defendants\u2019 roles in the conspiracy ended.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Also, the locations of the conspiracies were the same. The dissent makes much of the fact that one witness, Jeremiah Perry, testified that he told the police that Ricky Franklin sold drugs in Muskegon, Grand Rapids, Benton Harbor, Kalamazoo, Minnesota, Pittsburgh, Ft. Wayne, Indiana, and Lima, Ohio. However, this information was brought out on cross-examination when counsel for codefendant Terrence Moore indicated that Perry could only link Mr. Moore to transactions in Muskegon, not to any other sales he may have mentioned to the police. Furthermore, the prosecution did not link any of these sales to the conspiracy that was charged, and Perry only testified to agreements to sell in Muskegon.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Finally, we note that Wilson\u2019s and Banks\u2019 parts in this conspiracy ended when they were arrested on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>December 11, 1989. In <em>United States v Goff, </em>847 F2d 149, 169 (CA 5, 1988), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit differentiated between the end of a conspiracy and the end of an individual\u2019s role in a conspiracy. \u201c \u2018It is well settled that a person\u2019s participation in a conspiracy ends when the person is arrested for his role in the conspiracy.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>United States v Dunn, </em>775 F2d 604, 607 [CA 5, 1985].) However, solely because a single individual\u2019s part may have ended, the conspiracy does not necessarily end. \u201cEven when several members of a conspiracy are arrested, the conspiracy itself is not thereby necessarily terminated.\u201d <em>Goff </em>at 170, citing <em>United States v Kalish, </em>690 F2d 1144, 1151 (CA 5, 1982). \u201cDrug conspiracies involving multiple importation episodes may continue for many months.\u201d <em>Goff </em>at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In <em>Goff, </em>the same four persons were involved in multiple shipments. The court found that even though other personnel continually changed, there was only one conspiracy. The same is true in the instant case. Ricky Franklin and Martese Weidaman were the constant leaders of this conspiracy. Wilson\u2019s and Banks\u2019 involvement in the conspiracy ended after their arrest on December 11, 1989. There was no evidence that Wilson or Banks continued to conspire with Franklin, nor was there evidence that they participated in any activity in furtherance of the conspiracy.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Wilson and Banks made only one agreement with the other members of their conspiracy. That agree-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>merit was to transport cocaine that was obtained by Ricky Franklin to Muskegon, and to sell the same cocaine in a neighborhood in Muskegon known as the \u201cdanger zone.\u201d Each trip to Muskegon was not a separate conspiracy. To say that each trip could be considered a separate conspiracy, or that each sale could be a separate conspiracy, would lead to the exact results sought to be prevented by the Double Jeopardy Clause \u2014 subjecting the defendant to the \u201chazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offense.\u201d <em>Green, supra </em>at 187. Therefore, we find that only one conspiracy existed under the facts of this case, and that the defendants have made a showing of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The burden now shifts to the people to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence why double jeopardy principles do not bar prosecution. <em>Mezy, supra </em>at 277. The people argue that the second prosecution was valid under the exception in <em>Brown, supra </em>at 169. The United States Supreme Court held in <em>Brown </em>that \u201c[w]hatever the sequence may be, the Fifth Amendment forbids successive prosecution and cumul\u00e1tive punishment for a greater and lesser included offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">An exception may exist where the State is unable to proceed on the more serious charge at the outset because the additional facts necessary to sustain that charge have not occurred or have not been discovered despite the exercise of due diligence. <em>[Id. </em>at 169, n 7, citing <em>Diaz v United States, </em>223 US 442, 448-449; 32 S Ct 250; 56 L Ed 500 (1912); <em>Ashe v Swenson, </em>397 US 436, 453, n 7; 90 S Ct 1189; 25 L Ed 2d 469 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring).[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The people rely on this exception for its authority to circumvent double jeopardy requirements. However, the people have failed to show this Court why they could not have discovered the greater conspiracy despite the exercise of due diligence. In fact, the testimony at the Muskegon trial indicates that the Muskegon authorities knew that these two defendants were part of a larger conspiracy when they were tried in Muskegon.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The people argue that this Court should rely on the decision in <em>United States v Tolliver, </em>61 F3d 1189 (CA 5, 1995). The <em>Tolliver </em>court held that \u201c[f]rom the record, it is apparent that while the government may have <em>suspected the existence </em>of [a] conspiracy during the prosecution of [the defendant], at that time the government did not have sufficient evidence to indict [the defendant] for his participation in the . . . conspiracy.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Unlike the facts of <em>Tolliver, </em>the Muskegon authorities knew of the existence of the Franklin organization. They knew that these defendants were directly involved in the conspiracy. The statements of Messrs. Gardner, Peterson, and Wilson indicated the manner in which the cocaine was transported (in spare tires), where the defendants stayed while in Muskegon (Miss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Louise\u2019s home), that the organization was headed by Ricky Franklin in Detroit, that others were involved, and that they had made previous trips to sell drugs in Muskegon.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">There is evidence that Muskegon authorities had actual knowledge of the greater criminal organization. The testimony of the officers indicate that they had Miss Louise\u2019s home and her neighborhood and Aaron Banks under surveillance for some time. Further, the Muskegon authorities had arrested another member of the organization only weeks before the December 11, 1989, arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The most telling reason for holding that the Muskegon authorities knew of the greater conspiracy, and with the exercise of due diligence could have produced additional evidence to support the greater charge, was the statement made by Mr- Wilson to Deputies VanHemert and Berdinski. Mr. Wilson stated that he had sold as much as $3,000 worth of crack cocaine in a single trip to Muskegon. Further, Mr. Wilson stated that Mr. Banks routinely transported money back to Detroit. When asked what was the most money he had seen transported back to Detroit, he responded, \u201cAround a hundred thousand,\u201d and that was in the summer of 1989. This could have formed the basis for additional investigation by the Muskegon authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Additionally, the convictions were based on the same arrest and seizure of cocaine. The initial convictions were for the December 11, 1989, incident and the second convictions were for a continuing conspiracy from October 1988 to December 1990. The people based the case against these defendants on the same cocaine that was seized on December 11, 1989. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Oakland prosecution was based on the testimony of the same witnesses who testified at the Muskegon trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Any additional witnesses provided by the prosecution in the Oakland County case only added weight to the prosecution\u2019s case and did not form the basis for an additional separate crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Even though the Muskegon authorities did have actual knowledge of the greater conspiracy, the people failed to provide any evidence that the Muskegon authorities exercised due diligence in investigating this organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The people argue that Messrs. Gardner and Peterson minimalized their involvement in the organization and that therefore the people could not have known of the greater organization at the time of the first trial. However, the actual statements and trial testimony given by the witnesses show that Messrs. Gardner and Peterson were willing to fully aid the investigation. Moreover, Oakland County had the necessary information to get a grand jury indictment within six months of the sentencing following the first trial of Messrs. Wilson and Banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Finally, the knowledge of the Muskegon authorities is imputed to the Oakland County authorities. Therefore, Oakland County is deemed to know all that the Muskegon County authorities knew. As stated in <em>Waller v Florida, </em>397 US 387, 392; 90 S Ct 1184; 25 L Ed 2d 435 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>\u201cPolitical subdivisions of States \u2014 counties, cities, or whatever \u2014 never were and never have been considered as sovereign entities. Rather, they have been traditionally regarded as subordinate governmental instrumentalities created by the State to assist in the carrying out of state governmental functions.\u201d [Quoting <em>Reynolds v Sims, </em>377 US 533, 575; 84 S Ct 1362; 12 L Ed 2d 506 (1964).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In <em>Waller, </em>the United States Supreme Court overturned the second conviction of the defendant in a state court because the defendant had been tried and convicted previously in a municipal court. The Court held that the second prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because the prosecutions were by the same sovereign. The counties of Muskegon and Oakland are not separate sovereigns; they are subdivisions of this state. Therefore, we impute the knowledge of the Muskegon authorities to the Oakland County authorities. Any information that the Muskegon authorities knew or could have known if they exercised due diligence in investigating this drug conspiracy will be imputed to the Oakland authorities. Therefore, the state is allowed only one prosecution and that occurred in Muskegon.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">On the basis of the statements of Messrs. Gardner, Peterson, and Wilson, and the evidence introduced at the first trial, the Muskegon prosecutor could have charged Messrs. Wilson and Banks with conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver over 650 grams of cocaine. The prosecutor chose not to do so and charged the defendants with the lesser offense. The second prosecution for the greater offense consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>tuted double jeopardy.

The prosecution of defendant Banks was not barred by the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court and lower federal courts or by the Michigan Constitution\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause, governed by this Court\u2019s interpretation of the \u201csame transaction\u201d test as modified in <em>Crampton v 54-A District </em>Judge, 397 Mich 489; 245 NW2d 28 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The agreement to purchase and process drugs in Oakland County was not part of the Muskegon conspiracy, but, rather, was a distinct and separate crime. Therefore, the Muskegon conspiracy was not a lesser-included offense of the Oakland County conspiracy under federal law. Nor was the Oakland conspiracy, which was discovered after the Muskegon prosecution, part of the same transaction under state law. <em>Ante </em>at 429. Finally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s contention that the state has failed to demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>that the due diligence exception does not apply to Aaron Banks\u2019 involvement in the Oakland conspiracy. The facts concerning the greater conspiracy became known only after prosecution for the smaller conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The majority\u2019s statement that appellee does not contest the defendant\u2019s assertion that the second prosecution was for the same offense, <em>ante </em>at 428, is incorrect. Insofar as the statement implies that appellee has not preserved this claim, the prosecution argued in the alternative at the trial court level, in the Court of Appeals, and in the briefs in this Court, that there was more than one conspiracy. The question has been preserved and is properly before us. Both defendants have addressed the issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, the due diligence claim as an exception to <em>People v White, </em>390 Mich 245, 258, n 6; 212 NW2d 222 (1973), argued by both the prosecution and the defendants, assumes that separate crimes have occurred as part of \u201cone transaction.\u201d The scope of the inquiry before us thus necessarily includes whether there is one crime or two.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Given that the scope of the inquiry is not limited to whether the due diligence exception applies, the majority\u2019s initial inquiry should be directed to the procedural question regarding the burdens of proof and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>persuasion on a double jeopardy claim. In <em>People v Mezy, </em>453 Mich 269; 551 NW2d 389 (1996), we recently adopted a procedural test from <em>United States v Thomas, </em>759 F2d 659 (CA 8, 1985) (en banc), applicable to interlocutory appeals. Although we directed application of <em>Thomas </em>to a posttrial double jeopardy challenge, the majority of cases applying such a test have done so in the context of pretrial interlocutory appeal. Because the \u201cgovernment is clearly in a better position to show that the crime charged in the present indictment is not the same as the one charged in a previous indictment,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendant\u2019s burden on interlocutory appeal is to make a prima facie showing of the same offense, at which point the burden shifts to the government to show it has not twice prosecuted for the same conspiracy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, where, as here, review is of a posttrial double jeopardy claim, it has also been held that the defendant bears the traditional burdens<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of both production and persuasion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the existence of a single conspiracy. <em>United States v Dortch, </em>5 F3d 1056, 1061 (CA 7, 1993).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Were we writing on a clean slate, we might be persuaded by the rationale that because it is no longer possible to protect the defendant against double jeopardy exposure when the second trial has concluded,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the prosecutor and defendant have equal access to the record, the defendant may carry the burden normally assigned to appellant without unreasonable strain. <em>United States v Stricklin, </em>591 F2d 1112, 1124 (CA 5, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">However, given that we have but recently applied <em>Thomas </em>in the posttrial setting, and applying that test to the <em>Blockburger</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>inquiiy, I conclude that defendant Wilson has made a prima facie showing that the prosecution has failed to overcome. However, double jeopardy does not bar Banks\u2019 second prosecution for the Oakland conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>H</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">On the merits, with regard to defendant Banks, there are three questions: (1) whether there was one conspiracy or two, which is the mirror image of the question whether the defendant was prosecuted twice for same offense under the federal test, (2) whether, if there was more than one offense, the same-transaction rule of <em>White, supra, </em>bars the second prosecution, and (3) if the answer to either of the previous questions would bar the Oakland prosecution, whether the due diligence exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">As the United States Supreme Court has recently reiterated, \u201cIn both the multiple punishment and multiple prosecution contexts . . . where the two offenses for which the defendant is punished or tried cannot survive the \u2018same-elements\u2019 test, the double jeopardy bar applies.\u201d <em>United States v Dixon, </em>509 US 688, 696; 113 S Ct 2849; 125 L Ed 2d 556 (1993). Rejecting as without constitutional roots the theory that double jeopardy has a different meaning in its successive prosecution and successive punishment strands, the Court overturned the \u201cnew, additional double jeopardy test,\u201d <em>Dixon, supra </em>at 703-704, announced in <em>Grady v Corbin, </em>495 US 509, 510; 110 S Ct 2084; 109 L Ed 2d 584 (1990), that barred a subsequent prosecution if, \u201cto establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, . . . the government will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted . . . .\u201d The Court rejected the same-conduct test, reaffirmed that it had \u201cconsistently rejected\u201d the same-transaction test, <em>Dixon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>supra </em>at 709, n 14, and announced a return to <em>Blockburger.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">AARON BANKS WAS CHARGED WITH TWO SEPARATE CONSPIRACIES</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The majority\u2019s approach avoids the alternative argument of defendant Banks that the test for successive double jeopardy claims differs under the federal and state constitutions, the issue addressed in part m. Assuming arguendo that the test is the <em>Blockburger </em>\u201csame evidence\u201d test under both state and federal constitutions, the question whether a single conspiracy has been impermissibly divided into multiple conspiracies is guided by all the facts, including, but not limited to, the charges themselves and any other relevant circumstance, such as (1) the time, (2) persons acting as coconspirators, (3) the statutory offenses contained in the charges, (4) the overt acts charged by the government or any other description of the offenses charged that indicate the nature and scope of the activity that the government sought to punish in each case, and (5) places where the events alleged as part of the conspiracy took place.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">The essence of the determination is whether there is one agreement to commit two crimes, or more than one agreement, each with a separate object. <em>[Thomas, supra </em>at 662.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>As this Court recognized in applying <em>Blockburger, People v Robideau, </em>419 Mich 458, 470; 355 NW2d 592 (1984), the test is solely one of statutory construction. <em>Blockburger </em>does not apply where the Legislature intends to impose separate punishments for criminal activity. Thus, the ultimate question is whether the Legislature intended that the conviction of defendant Banks of conspiracy to distribute drugs in Muskegon precludes conviction of a conspiracy to distribute over 650 grams of drugs in Oakland, Detroit, and <em>outside </em>the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The majority\u2019s response to this inquiry is the statement that conspiracy to deliver 50 to 224 grams of cocaine is a lesser-included offense of conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver over 650 grams. In addition to ignoring the fact that the crime of conspiracy is the agreement to commit the illegal act, the conclusion posits that the cocaine possessed by defendant Banks in Muskegon, like the theft of the car that was the unit of prosecution in <em>Brown v Ohio, </em>432 US 161; 97 S Ct 2221; 53 L Ed 2d 187 (1977), was the same cocaine possessed by conspirators Gerald Hill and Franklin in Southfield on July 5, 1990, and in Muskegon on July 6, 1990, by Anthony Johnson some seven months after the arrest of Banks and Wilson. Stated otherwise, if any conspiracy is an included offense of a charge of an over 650-gram conspiracy, there could never be prosecution of a separate conspiracy. It would follow that no person tried for conspiracy to possess cocaine could ever be prosecuted for a separate and larger conspiracy, a result that would frustrate, rather than effectuate, legislative intent. <em>People v Morris, </em>450 Mich 316, 338; 537 NW2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>842 (1995);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> MCL 333.7401(3); MSA 14.15(7401)(3).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>People v Marji, </em>180 Mich App 525, 531; 447 NW2d 835 (1989), cited by the majority for the proposition that \u201c [conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver 50 to 224 grams of cocaine is a lesser included offense of conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver over 650 grams,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 428, actually holds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">While delivery of lesser amounts of cocaine are crimes within the same category as delivery of over 225 grams of cocaine and share some elements with the greater offense, they also contain essential elements not present in the greater offense, namely proof of lesser quantities of controlled substances. . . . Thus these lesser offenses must be considered cognate offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The Supreme Court has not set forth a clear test for determining, for. double jeopardy purposes, whether there is one conspiracy or many.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court has agreed with lower federal courts that, where the conduct is multilayered, the <em>Blockburger </em>approach is an inadequate guide in jeopardy analysis. <em>United States v Felix, </em>503 US 378, 390; 112 S Ct 1377; 118 L Ed 2d 25 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Thus, while the United States Supreme Court has held that a substantive charge with a conspiracy charge is not barred by double jeopardy, <em>id. </em>at 389, and that conspiracy is a lesser included offense of a continuing criminal enterprise in a single indictment,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Rutledge v United States, </em>517 US 292; 116 S Ct 1241; 134 L Ed 2d 419 (1996), guidance on the issue of double jeopardy in multiple conspiracy situations must be drawn from decisions of the federal courts of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The federal courts have rejected a strict <em>Block-burger </em>double jeopardy analysis in dealing with subsequent prosecutions when more than one conspiracy is at issue. The same-evidence test of <em>Blockburger </em>is of \u201cquestionable value in conspiracy double jeopardy issues.\u201d <em>United States v Thomas, supra </em>at 662. The federal circuits have developed a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test that \u201cprovides a more accurate analysis in determining whether multiple conspiracies exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The following factors from <em>Thomas, </em>which we previously cited with approval in <em>Mezy, </em>are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">(1) time, (2) persons acting as coconspirators, (3) the statutory offenses charged in the indictments, (4) the overt acts charged by the government or any other description of the offenses charged that indicate the nature and scope of the activity that the government sought to punish in each case, and (5) places where the events alleged as part of the conspiracy took place. <em>[Id. </em>at 285.][<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The majority of the federal circuits employ a similar test to determine whether two charged conspiracies constitute the same offense for purposes of double jeopardy,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> although the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit adds as a factor the interdependence between the alleged conspiracies. <em>United States v Korfant, </em>771 F2d 660, 663 (CA 2, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The first factor is time. The time frame of the two conspiracies in this case demonstrates that the smaller Muskegon conspiracy ran from December 7, 1989, through December 11, 1989, whereas the larger Oakland conspiracy ran from approximately fall, 1988, through fall, 1990. Thus, the time frame of the smaller conspiracy is subsumed by the larger.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">In Thomas, <em>supra </em>at 667, the Eighth Circuit held that the fact that the conspiracies overlap in time does not prove that there was only one conspiracy, and the Seventh Circuit, in <em>United States v Chiattello, </em>804 F2d 415, 419 (CA 7, 1986), indicated that the fact that a three-week period for one conspiracy was totally subsumed within the duration of the other was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>far from sufficient to establish the existence of only one conspiracy. A situation identical to that presented in the instant case has been considered by the Second Circuit. <em>United States v Macchia, </em>35 F3d 662, 669 (CA 2, 1994). In <em>Macchia, </em>the court recognized that \u201cwhere the smaller conspiracy is charged first, there is not the same opportunity' for prosecutorial abuse, and the overlap of time is therefore a less important consideration.\u201d Consequently, the time factor in the present case is not dispositive in respect to whether there was one conspiracy or two.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The second factor is consideration of the persons acting as coconspirators. In the Muskegon conspiracy, the persons charged in the information with conspiracy were Wilson and Banks, plus Franklin, who had been named as an unindicted coconspirator. Also named were accomplices Cato Peterson, a street seller for Banks, and Ronald Gardner, the designated driver for the Muskegon trip, who had been arrested along with the defendants on December 11, 1989. Both Peterson and Gardner testified for the prosecution and pleaded guilty of lesser offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">By comparison, the Oakland conspiracy involved many more people and many more witnesses. There were two indictments naming ten persons in the Oakland conspiracy: defendants Wilson and Banks, Gerald Hill, Terrence Moore (T-Bone), Anthony Johnson (Mark or Robert Johnson, Tone), Ricky Franklin, Kevin Jackson (Fat Kevin), Demetris Shapel (38, 30/30, Dee), Dwayne Winn (Freddy Kruger), and Martese Weidaman (M &amp; M). The Oakland conspiracy trial included other unindicted coconspirators and numerous witnesses either unknown or not called in the Muskegon conspiracy trial. The only persons com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>mon to both conspiracies who were actually charged with both conspiracies were Wilson and Banks. Although Franklin was named in the information, he was never formally charged in Muskegon. Peterson and Gardner were not indicted in Oakland. The Muskegon information indicates that Ricky Franklin was a coconspirator; however, he was only indicted in the Oakland conspiracy where the evidence demonstrated that he was a major cocaine dealer and unquestionably a central figure in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The federal courts have on numerous occasions evaluated the importance of the overlap of participants and its importance for double jeopardy purposes. Where the extent of the overlap was found to be significant in terms of participants, the court weighed this fact with the other factors in determining if one or two conspiracies existed. For the most part, if the overlap was not considerable, the courts have found two conspiracies. For example, where there were two common defendants out of sixteen in one conspiracy, and seven in the other conspiracy, <em>United States v Reiter, </em>848 F2d 336, 341 (CA 2, 1988), or twenty-two persons named in two indictments in which only two were common to both indictments, <em>United States v Futch, </em>637 F2d 386, 390 (CA 5, 1981), the conspiracies were held to be different.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Dortch, </em>the Seventh Circuit held that when two out of twenty-three charged in one indictment were subsequently charged in another, a common conspiracy was not necessarily suggested, noting that a greater overlap of participants would be expected if there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>were really only one conspiracy. <em>Dortch, supra </em>at 1062. Conspiracies are not necessarily mutually exclusive in terms of participants, thus \u201c[o]ne individual can certainly join more than one conspiracy to distribute drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1063. In all these cases, the courts found two distinct conspiracies despite the overlap of participants. Therefore, the fact that in the instant case three conspirators are common to both conspiracies does not present a bar to finding two discrete conspiracies.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The third factor is an examination of the statutory offenses charged. Because often there is only one statute involved in multiple conspiracy cases, <em>United States v Hart, </em>933 F2d 80, 85 (CA 1, 1991), and because any drug conspiracy necessarily would come within the purview of the federal Controlled Substance Act, similarity in the charges for both conspiracies would not be surprising. <em>United States v Henry, </em>661 F2d 894, 897, n 4 (CA 5, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The <em>Dortch </em>court found reliance on the fact that the indictments charged a violation of only one statute to be the weakest evidence of a single conspiracy stating that \u201c \u2018the guarantee against double jeopardy does not insulate a criminal from punishment for subsequent offenses merely because he chooses to continue committing the same type of crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1063, quoting <em>United States v West, </em>670 F2d 675, 681 (CA 7, 1982). Because it is possible to have two different conspiracies violating the same statute to commit the very same crime, <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 666, the fact that defendants may have violated the same con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>spiracy statute to deliver drugs more than one time by engaging in more than one conspiracy does not preclude a second prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The fourth and probably most significant factor<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> in analyzing successive conspiracy charges is a comparison of overt acts or any other description of the offenses charged indicating the nature and scope of the activity that the government seeks to punish in each case. The Muskegon conspiracy as related in testimony at the first trial was an agreement to sell drugs in the Muskegon projects, a \u201chot\u201d market where drugs were \u201crolling,\u201d carried out by Banks on behalf of Franklin, which involved picking up and using Peterson and Wilson as street runners. The overt acts in that conspiracy were the trip to Muskegon from Detroit (which resulted in the arrest), the placing of cocaine in a hot plate, transporting it under the jack of the missing spare tire,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and some evidence that there had been previous trips, not all with these same defendants from Detroit, to the projects in Muskegon for the purpose of selling crack cocaine. There is no indication from any source of an Oakland County connection. Nor was there evidence of Banks\u2019 relationship to Terrence Moore, who had processed cocaine in Oakland County or of his connection to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Anthony Johnson, both codefendants in the Oakland conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The agreement in the Oakland conspiracy was also to sell drugs, but it included the purchase, processing, and sale of drugs in Oak Park and had a geographic scope extending to Ohio, Illinois, and Minnesota. Testimony in the Oakland case implicated moving amounts of cocaine well in excess of 650 grams both before and after the December, 1989, arrest of Banks. The Oakland conspiracy scheme involved purchasing large amounts of raw cocaine over time from different suppliers, \u201ccooking\u201d the cocaine into crack at various places in Southfield, Oak Park, and Detroit, and employing different persons other than those named in the Muskegon trial to transport and sell the cocaine. Unlike the limited Muskegon conspiracy, the extensive activities of the Franklin agreement are indicative of a far greater commercial enterprise in which Ricky Franklin was the central player and the hub of the wheel and Aaron Banks, his trusted lieutenant, was more than just one of his regional supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The federal courts consider the overlap<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> of acts as meaningful to the determination whether there are one or more conspiracies. However, not surprisingly, as the court noted in <em>United States v Hart, supra </em>at 86, while conspiracies may be \u201csimilar in nature to the extent that each involved cocaine deals, the evidence presented by six government witnesses revealed different transactions in different places <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>with different people.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, the fact that Banks was in an agreement with Wilson (and with many other runners) whose object was the Muskegon market, does not negate the fact that Banks was an integral part of the much larger and more ambitious Oakland enterprise. As the court observed in <em>United States v O\u2019Dell, </em>462 F2d 224, 227, n 2 (CA 6, 1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">In the absence of any evidence that the two distinct groups worked together toward a common goal, rather than merely following parallel plans built around the central figures . . . we do not find any reason to view the two plots as part of a single unified conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The Oakland County prosecutor presented both witness testimony and other evidence of the larger conspiracy by introducing evidence of different drug transactions, different casts of characters, different methods of operation, and use of diverse locations within the state to advance different purposes (drug purchases, processing, and sales) of the conspiracy.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Further, any contention by Banks that he was only involved in the Muskegon operation that was terminated with his arrest in Muskegon and for which he has already been punished is refuted by the prosecution\u2019s offer of proof and testimony at the preliminary examination in the Oakland trial that, after the December 11, 1989, Muskegon arrest, Banks contacted accomplice Ronald Gardner with a request that Gardner not say anything further to police, that he should fire his lawyer, hire the same attorney that Banks had retained, and that Ricky Franklin would pay for the lawyer\u2019s services.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Other indicia of Banks\u2019 continuing facilitation and involvement in the larger conspiracy is Peterson\u2019s testimony that Banks told him not to tell the Muskegon authorities that the drugs belonged to him, promising Peterson that if he did as he asked, he would put money in his account. While incarcerated, Banks continued to pay for phone calls incurred by the larger conspiracy. Miss Louise testified that after Tone went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>to jail following his arrest in July, 1990, Banks helped pay off Tone\u2019s long distance phone bills.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">\u201c[F]urther [participation in an] \u2018old\u2019 conspiracy after being charged with that crime becomes a new offense for purposes of a double jeopardy claim.\u201d <em>[United States v Dunn, </em>775 F2d 604, 607 (CA 5, 1985), quoting <em>Stricklin, supra </em>at 1121, n 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In contrast to Amir Wilson, who from all that appears was a runner, testimony in the Oakland case indicated that Banks was involved in numerous overt acts for which he was never in jeopardy in Muskegon.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The fifth factor in the totality-of-circumstances analysis is location. The Muskegon conspiracy started in Detroit and ended in Muskegon with an arrest for the attempted delivery of over fifty grams of cocaine. The location of the conspiracy in Oakland County was Southfield and Oak Park, Detroit in Wayne County, and Muskegon Heights in Muskegon County. There was also testimony that Franklin obtained his drugs from many sources and that overt acts during the Franklin agreement involved drug sales in Grand Rapids, Benton Harbor, Kalamazoo, and out of state in Minnesota, Pittsburgh, Indiana, and Lima, Ohio, and that Franklin had traveled to Chicago and other Ohio locations to sell drugs.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>The federal circuits have not found that agreements even within closely related geographical communities are compelling evidence of a single conspiracy. In <em>Futch, supra </em>at 390, the two conspiracies occurred in six counties in the Southern District of Georgia. The conspiracies named different counties as the place where the conspiracies occurred. The court found that this factor indicated the operations were dissimilar, lending credence to the conclusion that the conspiracies were separate. The Second Circuit noted that the New York metropolitan area was certainly large enough to harbor two simultaneous narcotics conspiracies. <em>United States v Mallah, </em>503 F2d 971, 983 (CA 2, 1974).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Similarly in metropolitan areas such as Pittsburgh, greater St. Louis, and Atlanta, the Third Circuit, <em>United States v Inmon, </em>594 F2d 352, 354 (CA 3, 1979), Seventh Circuit, <em>Dortch, supra </em>at 1063, and Fifth Circuit, <em>United States v Henry, supra </em>at 897, n 4, respectively, have also stated that it was possible for more than one scheme or conspiracy to exist to distribute drugs in one metropolitan area. Although the geographic locations of both conspiracies in the instant case have a Detroit-Muskegon overlap, the breadth of the Oakland conspiracy indicates two distinct conspiracies.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>In summary, a proper review under federal standards relevant to a double jeopardy claim regarding successive conspiracies supports the position that there were two separate and distinct conspiracies.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">The dissimilarity of persons, places and modes of operation does not show an unbroken or repetitive pattern . . . [and] [m]ost of the seeming similarities represent those factors which would be common to separate conspiracies carried out in a similar manner. <em>[Futch, supra </em>at 391.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Banks was a major player in the Oakland conspiracy who continued to pursue its criminal objectives even after his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Assuming that the defendant\u2019s conviction for the Oakland conspiracy was not the same offense as the agreement in Muskegon, under the federal test, the question is, as the parties recognize, whether <em>People v White, supra, </em>bars the second prosecution of Banks under the Michigan interpretation of double jeopardy protection in the context of successive prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">\n<em>PEOPLE v WHITE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">Before 1973, this Court defined the scope of protection of double jeopardy consistent with federal law. <em>People v Grimmett, </em>388 Mich 590; 202 NW2d 278 (1972). <em>Grimmett </em>was overruled and the \u201csame transaction\u201d test was adopted in <em>People v White, supra </em>at 258. That decision came, despite this Court\u2019s rejection of the test in Grimmett,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> which noted the difficulty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>of imposing a mandatory rule requiring the application of the \u201csame transaction\u201d test<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> in all double jeopardy cases. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The \u201csame transaction\u201d approach requires the government to join at one trial all the charges against a defendant that grow out of a continuous time sequence and display a single intent and goal. <em>People v Sturgis, </em>427 Mich 392, 401; 397 NW2d 783 (1986). The test is said to \u201c \u2018promote the best interests of justice and sound judicial administration\u2019. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402. In <em>White </em>itself, for example, the crimes committed, kidnapping, felonious assault, and rape, were all part of a single criminal episode committed in a continuous time sequence and displaying a single intent and goal. The Court limited its holding to similar factual situations and indicated its willingness to consider the adoption of limited exceptions to the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Within three years of the decision in <em>White, </em>the difficulty of applying the test observed in <em>Grimmett </em>had produced a practice of pleading guilty to the least serious of offenses growing out of a single transaction and seeking preclusion of the more serious charges. In a series of cases, <em>Crampton v 54-A District Judge, supra </em>at 500, the Court granted bypass to revisit <em>White.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The majority developed a two-part exception to the same-transaction test based on whether the crimes involved were intent or no-intent crimes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">(1) Where criminal intent is required in the offenses involved, the criterion set forth in <em>White </em>applies: \u201ccontinuous time sequence and display [of] a single intent and goal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">(2) Where one or more of the offenses does not involve criminal intent, the criterion is whether the offenses are part of the same criminal episode, and whether the offenses involve laws intended to prevent the same or similar harm or evil, not a substantially different, or a very different kind of, harm or evil. <em>[Id. </em>at 501-502.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Thus, applying the rationale of the <em>Cram/pton </em>majority to the instant case, the instant conspiracies do not involve both a continuous time sequence and display of a single intent and goal. <em>Id. </em>at 502. <em>White </em>is therefore inapplicable and the Oakland prosecution was not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Agreeing that <em>White </em>was inapplicable, Justice Levin concurred, but adopted a different rationale for the result, which also emphasized the limits of the same-transaction test and the potential for anomalous results. <em>Crampton, supra </em>at 511. While carefully preserving the myriad situations not covered by the groups of offenses he delineated, <em>id. </em>at 516, Justice Levin stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">Jones\u2019 arrest for being in a blind pig was but the occasion for discovering his possession of heroin and marijuana; it does not appear that Jones acquired the heroin or marijuana in the blind pig. There is no substantial connection in criminality between offenses where the only factor connecting one offense with the other is that one was discovered in consequence of apprehension for the other; each is a separate transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Thus, from the perspective of either the majority or concurrence in <em>Crampton, </em>that is, that the two crimes did not involve a continuous time sequence or common intent, or that the second conspiracy was discovered in consequence of the first, the Muskegon and Oakland conspiracies are not the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">DUE DILIGENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Assuming that the Muskegon conspiracy was a lesser included offense of the Oakland conspiracy, or that the same-transaction test of <em>White </em>applies, the due diligence exception permits the prosecution of Aaron Banks in Oakland County. \u201cThe Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude bringing in a second action any charge which <em>might </em>have been brought in the first action. Rather, it only precludes those which <em>must </em>have been brought in the first or be forever lost. The due diligence doctrine provides an exception in this latter situation. Thus, it follows, that if the government need not have brought all of its charges in the first action, there was nothing for it to be diligent about.\u201d <em>United States v Maza, </em>983 F2d 1004, 1008 (CA 11, 1993) (emphasis in the original). Because the Oakland conspiracy was not discovered until after the arrest of Wilson and Banks, due diligence permits prosecution of Banks for the Franklin conspiracy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">[W]here the state had made a diligent and good faith effort to protect the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights . . . \u201c[f]or example, where a crime is not completed or not discovered, despite diligence on the part of the police, until after the commencement of a prosecution for other crimes arising from the same transaction, an exception to the \u2018same transaction\u2019 rule should be made to permit a separate prosecution.\u201d <em>Ashe v Swenson, </em>397 US 436, 453, n 7; 90 S Ct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>1189; 25 L Ed 2d 469 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring). <em>[White, supra </em>at 258, n 6.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Due diligence is an exception to the prohibition against double jeopardy under both state and federal law. The exception is applicable to the federal multiple prosecution strand of double jeopardy, <em>Brown v Ohio, supra </em>at 168, to Justice Brennan\u2019s same-transaction test, <em>Ashe v Swenson, supra </em>at 453, and to Michigan\u2019s same-transaction test as formulated in <em>People v White, supra </em>at 258, n 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The federal courts have had occasion to discuss due diligence in several cases. \u201cDue diligence means ordinary, rather than extraordinary, diligence, and it is within the discretion of the trial judge to determine the diligence required under the circumstance.\u201d <em>United States v Walker, </em>546 F Supp 805, 811 (D Hawaii, 1982) (citations omitted). Diligence is a question of fact, and findings of fact by the trial court will be sustained unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v Stearns, </em>707 F2d 391, 392 (CA 9, 1983). In the instant case, the facts concerning the greater conspiracy became known only after the first trial had begun. For example, although in Muskegon Ronald Gardner identified Ricky Franklin as the source of the drugs, he did not involve Terrence Moore or admit to his presence when Moore \u201ccooked rocks\u201d in Oak Park. Gardner did not identify for the Muskegon authorities the other players and locations he later testified about in Oakland, nor did he make clear Banks\u2019 extensive involvement with Anthony Johnson. Most importantly, because both Peterson and Gardner minimized their involvement, there was no indication at any time that Oakland County had any relationship to the spot runs to Muskegon and no indication of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>prolonged cooperation of Banks with the higher echelons of the Oakland conspiracy. The Oakland County Grand Jury investigation was precipitated by the discovery of cocaine on July 5, 1990, behind the Hi-Lo Auto Parts store in Southfield and the subsequent arrest of codefendant Gerald Hill. The investigation occurred after the conviction of defendants Wilson and Banks and witness accomplices Peterson and Gardner, in early June, 1990. It was not until August, 1990, that Officer Quisenberry and an Oakland County prosecutor met with the Muskegon County prosecutor to exchange information about names that had surfaced in connection with the recent Oakland County investigation. It was not until after this date that Gardner and Peterson revealed their more extensive roles in the conspiracy and allegedly decided to cooperate fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Further, while the majority states that both prosecutions were conducted by the same sovereign it does not tell us what jurisdiction the Muskegon authorities, two hundred miles away, would have had to investigate suspected drug activities in Wayne County or that they were even aware of an Oakland County connection, given that all those arrested were from Detroit. It does not appear that the Muskegon authorities had a correct address for Franklin to enter into the LEIN system, nor did they have any evidence of any overt act linking Franklin to Oakland County.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Although the Muskegon authorities knew that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Muskegon Heights housing projects were being flooded with drugs they did not know the true scope of the larger conspiracy until after Oakland County started its investigation in July 1990, well past the Muskegon trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In short, the Muskegon authorities did not have sufficient information to charge and prove that, from 1988 to 1990, Franklin and others conspired in \u201cthe County of Oakland\u201d to possess with intent to deliver in excess of 650 grams. There is nothing to suggest that Muskegon had any reliable information about the scope of Franklin\u2019s activities beyond the mere statements of Wilson, Gardner, and Peterson. Thus, even if it were correct to assume that the knowledge of the Muskegon authorities could be imputed \u201cto the Oakland County authorities,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 438, the Oakland authorities would have had no knowledge of an Oakland connection.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>By the June 1990 trial date, the Muskegon authorities knew something about Miss Louise, knew about the use of rental cars, had some knowledge that spare tires were used to transport drugs, and thought they knew that Rick Franklin lived in Dearborn. In light of the charged defendants constitutional rights to a speedy trial<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and the statutory requirement, MCL 780.131; MSA 28.969(1),<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> to be brought to trial within 180 days of the issuance of a warrant, indictment, or information, the Muskegon authorities proceeded to. trial against Wilson and Banks on the basis of the admissible evidence available to them at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Other than the conclusory statement that Gardner and Peterson were willing to fully aid the investigation, an assertion belied by their trial testimony in Muskegon, the majority does not suggest how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>authorities should have proceeded to develop an Oakland case, or how Banks\u2019 and Wilson\u2019s rights could have been accommodated while the authorities investigated Franklin. The knowledge of the Muskegon authorities cannot be imputed to the Oakland authorities because they had no knowledge of activity in Oakland.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\"><em>United States v Tolliver, </em>61 F3d 1189, 1211 (CA 5, 1995), is applicable to the present case. In <em>Tolliver, </em>the court considered the fact that the government might have suspected that defendant Elwood was part of the larger conspiracy, but it was not until later that evidence demonstrating his considerable involvement came to light.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Therefore, \u201c[w]hat appeared on the surface to be a discrete drug transaction \u2014 based on the facts reasonably available to the government at the time \u2014 turned out to be part of a much larger conspiracy [and] Elwood, whose initial role appeared small, turned out to be a major character in the overall scheme.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The same situation is true here. Banks\u2019 role as a major player in the larger conspiracy, and the man responsible for keeping crack in his house before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>transport to the selling locations and for bringing \u201chome\u201d the money, was not discovered until the accomplice witnesses fully informed the government after the first trial the extent of their own and others\u2019 involvement in the larger conspiracy, the use of Oakland County locations, and the identity of other witnesses, who were subsequently located and testified. See <em>Tolliver, supra </em>at 1211. As in <em>United States v Lacey, </em>983 F2d 1070; 1993 WL 1292 (CA 6, 1993), unpublished opinion per curiam aff\u2019g <em>United States v Lacey, </em>782 F Supp 66 (ED Mich, 1992), the due diligence exception was appropriately employed because \u201ca brief review of the facts relating to the . . . conspiracy shows just how complicated the conspiracy was as well as the significant amount of effort required by the government in unraveling the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at **8.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals with regard to defendant Aaron Banks and reverse the conviction of Amir Wilson.</p>\n<judges id=\"b718-6\">Riley, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b718-7\">Weaver and Kelly, JJ., took no part in the decision of these cases.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-8\"> <em>United States v Williams, </em>504 US 36, 40; 112 S Ct 1735; 118 L Ed 2d 352 (1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-9\">Before proceeding to the merits of this matter, it is necessary to discuss the propriety of reaching them. . . .

The alleged conspiracies were separate in time, although there was an overlap of some two years. The persons involved in each conspiracy were different, although again there was some overlap. The charged offenses were the same, consisting of the conspiracy to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute it, although the amounts charged were different. The overt acts varied greatly between the indictments. The locales of the offenses also differed. Finally, the conspiracies differed in scope, with one aiming at large-scale national distribution and the other at local, street-level transactions. However, because this Court has not previously addressed the burden of proof, it is appropriate to remand to allow the trial court to apply the correct burden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>[D]ouble jeopardy is not Implicated by the facts before us. The lead opinion does conclude that, for double jeopardy purposes, the defendants established a prima facie claim that the prosecutions were for the same offense and that the government then failed to demonstrate that prosecution was not barred. I would conclude that the defendants did not make a prima facie showing and that a preponderance of the evidence demonstrated that the offenses were distinct. [Brickley, C.J.

In the jury instructions in Wilson\u2019s separate trial, the judge did not specify an amount of drugs in connection with the conspiracy charge, leaving that question to the jury. In Banks\u2019 trial, the judge included a lesser-offense charge of conspiracy to possess less than twenty-five grams. The Banks\u2019 jury convicted Banks of the lesser-included offense of conspiracy to possess less than twenty-five grams.

Muskegon police discovered the local Muskegon conspiracy while Oakland County ultimately uncovered the larger statewide conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b705-10\"> Among other evidence of overt acts indicating that the nature and scope of the Oakland conspiracy was much larger than that encompassed by the first case, <em>United States v Maza, </em>983 F2d 1004, 1014 (CA 11, 1993), was testimony by both Gardner and Jeremiah Perry that Banks kept money and cocaine for Franklin at his parents\u2019 house in Detroit on many occasions. Both testified that Banks had been present more than once when cocaine was processed at Terrence Moore\u2019s place in Oak Park, and Perry said Franklin had processed cocaine at Banks\u2019 home. Miss Louise testified that Banks stayed at her place all the time and spent hours on the phone to Detroit running up enormous phone bills that he paid for. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Although she testified that she did not see Banks with drugs, she did admit that Banks had introduced her to Franklin, handled the money, and was in contact with Franklin on a regular basis. Wilson, Peterson, and Perry all said they worked for Banks and testified to a cumulatively large number of trips to Muskegon with Banks to sell cocaine. They also testified to knowing there were other runners both in Detroit and Muskegon who sold drugs for Banks. Dwayne Winn, another coconspirator, testified that Banks had recruited him to sell drugs and that he, too, had made trips to Muskegon with Banks to sell cocaine. Parenthetically, testimony regarding incidents in October and November when bricks of cocaine were \u201crocked up\u201d at Terrence Moore\u2019s home in Oak Park circumstantially refutes the allegation that the Muskegon and Oakland conspiracies were one and the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\"> The trial court sustained an objection by defendant on the ground that the evidence related to the Gardner conspiracy, which had \u201cended\u201d with Banks\u2019 arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\"> An Oakland County witness, Andrew Bernard, who had been in jail with Banks in August 1990, also testified that Banks told him that he was in jail for selling drugs and that prosecutors were trying to trick him into getting his \u201cbrother,\u201d Ricky Franklin, to Muskegon, thus circumstantially indicating Banks\u2019 agreement with Franklin and continuing efforts to facilitate the Franklin operation and the larger conspiracy even while incarcerated in Muskegon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b707-9\"> Contrary to the assertion made by the lead opinion that only one witness testified about the marketing of drugs outside the state, <em>ante </em>at 432, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>witness Ronald Gardner also testified about the extensive geographical scope of the conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b708-6\"> See also <em>United States v Macchia, supra </em>at 671 (finding the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area large enough to harbor two conspiracies dealing in bootleg gasoline) and <em>United States v Papa, </em>533 F2d 815, 819-820 (CA 2, 1976) (finding that there is no geographic overlap where one narcotics conspiracy occurred in Long Island and several locations in the Bronx, and the other occurred in Astoria, Queens, and another location in the Bronx).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b709-11\"> The Court noted the defendant\u2019s contention that multiple prosecutions should be prohibited when arising out of the same factual situation. In some cases multiple prosecutions are prejudicial to a defendant and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>some cases may aid a defendant. The Court concluded that a mandatory rule would be an unwise solution to this problem and suggested that this type of rule is properly a decision for the Legislature and not this Court. <em>Grimmett, supra </em>at 607.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b710-8\"> This test was advocated by Justice William Brennan in his concurring opinion in <em>Ashe v Swenson, </em>397 US 436, 448; 90 S Ct 1189; 25 L Ed 2d 469 (1970). It has been consistently rejected on numerous occasions by the United States Supreme Court despite Justice Brennan\u2019s efforts to the contrary.

Franklin took pains to hide all his activities, buying drugs and processing them in Detroit, but not selling them in Detroit. He moved his processing operation to different locations in Oakland County and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>when his Muskegon base of operation at Miss Louise\u2019s house was threatened, moved quickly to another Muskegon location.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Franklin, as well as many of the coconspirators, had street names and other aliases. Franklin\u2019s street name was Tiger, and he had used the name of Kevin Moore on an occasion when he was stopped by Detroit police for a traffic violation. Franklin also tried to purchase Gardner\u2019s driver\u2019s license for $1500 to use this as another identity. Just before the Oakland County trial, investigators had learned that Franklin had a driver\u2019s license in the name of Tony Young and had used that name to rent warehouse space. Additionally, all the rental cars that were used to transport the drugs or scout new locations were not rented by Franklin, but by Jodel Moore, Eulia Mae Perry, and others, although the alias Tony Young was sometimes put on the contract as an additional driver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b715-9\"> This assertion, made without any precedential support, is the most remarkable statement by the majority and one which would completely obviate the inquiry regarding whether the Legislature intended cumulative punishment, <em>Albernaz v United States, </em>450 US 333; 101 S Ct 1137; 67 L Ed 2d 275 (1981), and the holding in <em>Crampton, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s position, <em>ante </em>at 438, <em>Waller v Florida, </em>397 US 387, 392; 90 S Ct 1184; 25 L Ed 2d 435 (1970), does not provide that the knowledge obtained in an investigation by authorities in one county is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>imputed to those in another county. <em>Waller </em>holds that a defendant may not be tried both by a municipality and the state government for the same offense. <em>Id. </em>at 395.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\"> US Const, Am VI, and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b716-9\"> MCL 780.131(1); MSA 28.969(1)(1) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">Whenever the department of corrections receives notice that there is pending in this state any untried warrant, indictment, information, or complaint setting forth against any inmate of a correctional facility of this state a criminal offense for which a prison sentence might be imposed upon conviction, the inmate shall be brought to trial within 180 days after the department of corrections causes to be delivered to the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the warrant, indictment, information, or complaint is pending written notice of the place of imprisonment of the inmate and a request for final disposition of the warrant, indictment, information, or complaint.

Supreme Court holdings readily support this instruction. See <em>Felioc, supra </em>at 391 (the substantive crime and conspiracy are not the same offense for purposes of double jeopardy); <em>Garrett v United States, </em>n 27 <em>supra </em>(separate punishments are allowed for a predicate offense and a continuing criminal enterprise offense).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b717-8\"> See also <em>Masa, supra </em>at 1014.
