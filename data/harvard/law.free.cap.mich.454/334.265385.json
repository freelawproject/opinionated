The only evidence presented regarding each count was the coconspirators\u2019 testimony, which established that defendant delivered various amounts of cocaine over defined periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\">This Court holds that in order to bind defendant over on the two counts of conspiracy there must be probable cause to believe that defendant and the coconspirators shared the specific intent to accomplish the substantive offenses charged. We conclude, with respect to count I, that the district court\u2019s finding that probable cause existed to believe defendant was guilty of conspiracy to possess with an intent to deliver more than 650 grams of cocaine did not constitute an abuse of discretion because the evidence was sufficient to allow a reasonable trier of fact to infer that defendant and the coconspirator had a specific intent to deliver the statutory amount as charged. Also, we conclude, with respect to count n, that it was reasonable to find probable cause existed to believe that defendant conspired with the coconspirator to possess with an intent to deliver over 225 grams but less than 650 grams of cocaine because there was testimony at the preliminary examination that enabled the district court to infer that defendant and his coconspirator specifically intended to combine to deliver over 225 but less than 650 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Therefore, we affirm both the Court of Appeals decision concluding that there was no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s bindover on count I and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>its decision reversing the circuit court\u2019s quashing of the indictment on count n.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">On June 26, 1991, pursuant to MCL 767.7b(l), (2); MSA 28.950(1), (2), defendant was indicted by a multicounty grand jury on two counts of conspiracy to possess with an intent to deliver cocaine. Count I alleges that defendant conspired with Cathy Boyer to possess with an intent to deliver more than 650 grams of cocaine between the fall of 1989 and the summer of 1990 in violation of MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(i). Count n alleges that defendant conspired with Suzanne Kausler to possess with an intent to deliver over 225 grams but less than 650 grams of cocaine between March 1990 and December 1990 in violation of MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(ii); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(ii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">A preliminary examination was held on May 13, 1992. At the hearing, it was established that defendant, who lived in Ann Arbor, Michigan, supplied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>cocaine to Cathy Boyer, who resided in Charlevoix, Michigan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Boyer obtained the cocaine for herself and for her husband. Boyer and her husband were introduced to Suzanne Kausler<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in February 1990 by a mutual friend, Anna Nawrocki.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Boyer eventually began purchasing cocaine on Kausler\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Boyer would give two-thirds of the cocaine she purchased to Kausler, and keep one-third for herself as payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">When Boyer wanted to purchase cocaine, she would telephone defendant. Sometimes she would drive to Ann Arbor to make the purchases, while at other times she and defendant would meet either in West Branch or Bay City, which was approximately halfway between their homes. Boyer\u2019s husband, and other individuals, occasionally accompanied her on her trips to Ann Arbor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When Boyer would arrive at defendant\u2019s residence, her passengers would usually wait for her while she met with defendant to .obtain the cocaine. These individuals were aware of the purpose of the drive and sometimes used some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>cocaine on the drive back. Boyer testified that she drove to Ann Arbor on an irregular basis, but there was testimony that she drove there approximately twice a week, from March through the beginning of May 1990. She drove to Ann Arbor six or seven times before making her first purchase for Kausler and traveled to Ann Arbor an additional six or seven times with Kausler.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Boyer also testified that she would receive between three and seven ounces on these trips (approximately between 84 and 196 grams of cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Boyer purchased approximately fifty-four ounces (1,530.90 grams) of cocaine from defendant between the fall of 1989 until she moved to Florida in May of 1990, because she feared the possibility of a grand jury indictment. Thereafter, Kausler began purchasing directly from defendant. Besides meeting defendant at various locations in Ann Arbor, she met him<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>two and five times in West Branch, purchasing anywhere from 56.70 grams to 113.40 grams of cocaine. At some point, defendant knew Kausler was distributing to others some of the cocaine she received.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Additionally, on at least one occasion, defendant drove to Kausler\u2019s residence to visit and bring her cocaine. At that same time, defendant and Kausler reached an agreement \u201cfor a very large purchase\u201d of 226.80 grams of cocaine. She paid him approximately $8,800. Kausler purchased approximately twenty ounces (567 grams) of cocaine from the time Boyer moved to Florida until December 1990.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">At the conclusion of the preliminary examination, defendant objected to being bound over, arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the people failed to present evidence that would permit a finding that probable cause existed to believe that defendant intended to deliver the statutory amounts as charged, i.e., he intended to combine with Boyer and Kausler, respectively, to deliver the statutory amounts as charged, and Boyer and Kausler intended to combine with defendant to deliver the statutory amounts as charged to a third party. The people argued that case law precedent permitted the aggregating of the various amounts exchanged when conspiracy is at issue. They contended that it was legally permissible to infer defendant\u2019s specific intentions to deliver the statutory amounts charged with respect to each count and that a reasonable inference could be made to believe that the cocaine was redistributed to third parties on the basis of volume alone.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Finding persuasive the people\u2019s contention, the district court concluded that probable cause existed to believe defendant committed the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">On November 3, 1992, the circuit court concluded that the district court abused its discretion, finding that there was insufficient evidence at the preliminary examination \u201cto establish probable cause that the defendant conspired to deliver the volume charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The Court of Appeals peremptorily reversed the circuit court\u2019s order and reinstated the charges. On February 28, 1994, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, this Court vacated the Court of Appeals peremptory order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>and remanded the matter for plenary consideration.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On December 28, 1995, the Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s order and reinstated the charges. We subsequently granted defendant\u2019s motion for immediate consideration.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In a preliminary examination, a district court\u2019s function is to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to cause an individual marked by discreetness and caution to have a reasonable belief that the defendant is guilty as charged. <em>People v King, </em>412 Mich 145, 152-153; 312 NW2d 629 (1981); <em>People v Asta, </em>337 Mich 590; 60 NW2d 472 (1953).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A bindover is not a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, \u201c \u2018[a] preliminary hearing,\u2019 \u201d the Supreme Court has said, \u201c \u2018is ordinarily a much less searching exploration into the merits of a case than a trial, simply because its function is the more limited one of determining whether probable cause exists to hold the accused for trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coleman v Burnett, </em>155 US App DC 302, 316; 477 F2d 1187 (1973), quoting <em>Bar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>ber v Page, </em>390 US 719, 725; 88 S Ct 1318; 20 L Ed 2d 255 (1968).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Coleman, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">It is the contrast of probable cause and proof beyond a reasonable doubt that inevitably makes for examinatorial differences between the preliminary hearing and the trial. Probable cause signifies evidence sufficient to cause a person of ordinary prudence and caution to conscientiously entertain a reasonable belief of the accused\u2019s guilt. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt, on the other hand, connotes evidence strong enough to create an abiding conviction of guilt to a moral certainty. The gap between these two concepts is broad. <em>A magistrate may become satisfied about probable cause on much less than he would need to be convinced. Since he does not sit to pass on guilt or innocence, he could legitimately find probable cause while personally entertaining some reservations. </em>By the same token, a showing of probable cause may stop considerably short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and evidence that leaves some doubt may yet demonstrate probable cause. <em>[Id. </em>at 316-317 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The decision to bind a defendant over is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>King, supra; People v Talley, </em>410 Mich 378; 301 NW2d 809 (1981). Thus, in this case, we review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s determination that the evidence was sufficient to warrant a bindover on each count of conspiracy, i.e., we decide whether the evidence was \u201csufficient to cause a person of ordinary prudence and caution to conscientiously entertain a reasonable belief of [defendant\u2019s] guilt\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> for (1) conspiring with Boyer to possess with an intent to deliver more than 650 grams of cocaine and (2) conspiring with Kausler to possess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>with an intent to deliver over 225 grams but less than 650 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Conspiracy is defined by common law as \u201c \u2018a partnership in criminal purposes ....\u2019\u201d <em>People v Atley, </em>392 Mich 298, 310; 220 NW2d 465 (1974), quoting <em>United States v Kissel, </em>218 US 601, 608; 31 S Ct 124; 54 L Ed 1168 (1910).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Under such a partnership, two or more individuals must have voluntarily agreed to effectuate the commission of a criminal offense.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Establishing that the individuals specifically intended to combine<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> to pursue the criminal objective of their agreement is critical because \u201c \u2018[t]he gist of the offense of conspiracy lies in the unlawful agreement\u2019 . . . [meaning] . . . [t]he crime is complete upon for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>mation of the agreement . . . <em>People v Carter, </em>415 Mich 558, 568; 330 NW2d 314 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The specific intent to combine, including knowledge of that intent, must be shared by two or more individuals<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> because \u201cthere can be no conspiracy without a combination of two or more.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>People v Blume, </em>443 Mich 476, 485; 505 NW2d 843 (1993); <em>Atley, supra </em>at 310. This combination of two or more is essential because \u201c[t]he rationale underlying . . . [the crime of] conspiracy ... is based on the increased [societal] dangers presented by the agreement between the plurality of actors.\u201d <em>People v Davis, </em>408 Mich 255, 273, n 5, 279; 290 NW2d 366 (1980).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Accordingly, there must be proof demonstrating that the parties specifically intended to further, promote, advance, or pursue an unlawful objective. <em>Alley, supra </em>at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Identifying the objectives and even the participants of an unlawful agreement is often difficult because of the clandestine nature of criminal conspiracies. Thus, direct proof of the conspiracy is not essential; instead, proof may be derived from the circumstances, acts, and conduct of the parties. See, e.g., <em>People v Brynski, </em>347 Mich 599; 81 NW2d 374 (1957).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Inferences may be made because such evidence sheds light on the coconspirators\u2019 intentions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">A criminal agreement is defined by the scope of the commitment of its co-conspirators. See generally Marcus, P, <em>Prosecution and Defense of Conspiracy Cases, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4:01-4:02 (1995). Thus, where a defendant is unaware of the overall objective of an alleged conspiracy or lacks any interest in, and therefore any commitment to, that objective, he is not a member of the conspiracy. <em>[United States v Smith, </em>82 F3d 1261, 1269 (CA 3, 1996).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u201c[C]ourts must look to circumstantial evidence to determine the conspiracy\u2019s scope\u201d;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> however, any inferences drawn must be reasonable. Such an approach is essential so that it may be accurately ascertained what particular substantive offense was intended by the coconspirators.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The predicate substantive offenses with which defendant was charged are embodied in MCL 333.7401; MSA 14.15(7401). It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">(1) Except as authorized by this article, a person shall not manufacture, create, deliver, or possess with intent to manufacture, create, or deliver a controlled substance, a prescription form, an official prescription form, or a counterfeit prescription form. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">(2) A person who violates this section as to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">(a) A controlled substance classified in schedule 1 or 2 that is a narcotic drug or a drug described in section 7214(a)(iv) and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>(i) Which is in an amount of 650 grams or more of any mixture containing that substance is guilty of a felony and shall be imprisoned for life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">(ii) Which is in an amount of 225 grams or more, but less than 650 grams, of any mixture containing that substance is guilty of a felony and shall be imprisoned for not less than 20 years nor more than 30 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">To be convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver a controlled substance, the people must prove that (1) the defendant possessed the specific intent to deliver the statutory minimum as charged, (2) his coconspirators possessed the specific intent to deliver the statutory minimum as charged, and (3) the defendant and his coconspirators possessed the specific intent to combine to deliver the statutory minimum as charged to a third person. See, e.g., <em>Blume, supra </em>at 485, 508, n 31.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The question that we are asked' to decide is not whether the evidence presented at the preliminary examination was sufficient to sustain a conviction of the offenses as alleged,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> but, rather, whether the evidence presented was sufficient to enable the district court to believe probable cause existed to bind defendant over on two counts of conspiracy, i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>whether the evidence was sufficient to enable a person marked by common sense to have entertained a reasonable belief of defendant\u2019s guilt for (1) conspiring with Boyer to possess with an intent to deliver over 650 grams of cocaine, and (2) conspiring with Kausler to possess with an intent to deliver over 225 grams but less than 650 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The Court of Appeals addressed a similar issue in <em>People v Porterfield, </em>128 Mich App 35, 38; 339 NW2d 683 (1983). In <em>Porterfield, </em>the defendant argued that the evidence presented at trial \u201cwas insufficient . . . to establish one conspiracy . . . .\u201d Specifically, the defendant contended \u201cthat it was error to charge him with an ongoing conspiracy to deliver over 50 grams of a mixture containing heroin rather than multiple separate conspiracies to deliver amounts under 50 grams.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41. He \u201cbase[d] his argument solely upon the fact that the alleged separate transactions could not be aggregated to show that there was an agreement to deliver over 50 grams of a mixture containing a controlled substance\u201d because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">the evidence merely showed day-to-day operations in which there were no outstanding agreements between the parties beyond the consignment sale of 10 to 20 coin envelopes which held a mixture containing heroin to the two runners whose testimony at trial provided the primary evidence .... <em>[Id. </em>at 38.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">However, before it addressed the defendant\u2019s argument, the <em>Porterfield </em>Court concluded that the people established that (1) the defendant possessed the \u201cintent to deliver over 50 grams of a mixture contain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ing heroin,\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> (2) defendant\u2019s coconspirators each \u201chad the intent to deliver over 50 grams of a mixture containing heroin,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and (3) the defendant and his coconspirators possessed \u201cthe intent to combine with others to deliver over 50 grams of a mixture containing heroin\u201d to the streets for profit.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Having con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>eluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the conspiracy conviction, the <em>Porterfield </em>Court then addressed the defendant\u2019s argument regarding \u201cthe accumulation of the alleged multiple transactions into one general conspiracy . . . <em>Id. </em>at 39. The Court stated that the alleged separate drug transactions were \u201csmaller conspiracies constituting parts of a \u2018single scheme or plan,\u2019 \u201d because the evidence established that the conduct of the defendant and his coconspirators was all in furtherance of a particular criminal objective, i.e., the defendant was part of an \u201congoing\u201d heroin delivery operation that occurred on almost a daily basis with the objective to deliver over 50 grams of a mixture containing heroin to the streets. See <em>id. </em>at 38-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">We are persuaded that the focus of the <em>Porterfield </em>Court was on the specific intent of the parties to the conspiracy regarding the conspiracy\u2019s goal, scope, and criminal objective. The Court determined the conspiracy had as its objective the goal of delivering over fifty grams of a mixture containing heroin to the streets for profit. There was testimony that the coconspirators\u2019 conduct, \u201cthe mixing, packaging, delivery and sale,\u201d occurred on almost a daily basis, all of which the Court concluded must have \u201ccontributed to the promotion of\u201d their objective to deliver to the streets for profit a mixture containing over fifty grams of heroin. <em>Id. </em>at 41. Moreover, the testimony evidenced that one of the coconspirators \u201cwas present when [the] defendant purchased three boxes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>envelopes,\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> each box of envelopes contained five hundred envelopes, and testimony established that two hundred envelopes \u201cwould total 50 grams of heroin.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Fifteen hundred envelopes would have totaled 375 grams of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Hence, there was strong evidence establishing that the defendant and his coconspirators conspired to deliver approximately 375 grams of a mixture containing heroin. The record clearly evidenced that they knew the scope of their operation. It was irrelevant whether they were actually able to transact this amount before they were arrested.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The fact that they did transact more than 50 grams is important only to shed light on the defendant\u2019s agreement, i.e., to deliver, with the help of his coconspirators, approximately 375 grams of a mixture containing heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In the instant case, with respect to count I, the district court, relying on <em>Porterfield, supra, </em>concluded that there was probable cause to believe defendant conspired with Boyer to possess with an intent to deliver over 650 grams of cocaine from the fall of 1989 to the spring of 1990. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>I heard the testimony of Miss Boyer. Miss Boyer, when she started dealing to Kausler, called, made an \u2014 called to the Defendant here, and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got somebody else\u2019s money. Will you furnish?\u201d He did. It came back. Miss Kausler testified she had a party and she used it up and gave it to her friends. That\u2019s conspiracy. [There is] [n]o question about it [i]n my mind. And the amounts she purchased over the period of time, through Cathy Boyer, who was skimming off the top, by the way, with or without knowledge of the Defendant. I don\u2019t know, she said it was without, but she was skimming. She was getting drugs, she was getting money. That\u2019s a conspiracy. And it was ongoing. So on Count I, involving Boyer, I\u2019m gonna bind over on that, just like it\u2019s charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The circuit court distinguished <em>Porterfield, supra, </em>concluding that the binding over of defendant on the charges as alleged constituted an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>A majority of the Court of Appeals, relying on <em>Porterfield </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-3\">[S]maller amounts could be aggregated to charge [the defendant] with conspiracy to deliver over 50 grams . . . [even though] the evidence [in this instance] ... is not as strong as it was in <em>Porterfield, </em>the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that probable cause existed to believe that defendant committed the charged offenses. [Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued December 28, 1995 (Docket No. 173326), slip op at l-2.[<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Considering all the evidence presented by the people, we agree with the result of the Court of Appeals and conclude that the question whether defendant conspired to commit the substantive offense may be guided by the general principles of conspiracy law articulated in <em>Porterfield.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In the instant case, the relationship between Boyer and defendant may be broken down into two phases. The first phase,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> lasted from fall 1989 until February 1990. During this phase, Boyer testified that she made one or two trips to Ann Arbor a month, even though not every trip was for the purpose of purchasing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>cocaine. Boyer also testified that she usually purchased an ounce (28.35 grams) of cocaine at a time. Thus, over the course of this time, it is reasonable to believe that four ounces (113.40 grams) of cocaine were purchased.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The second phase, as alleged by the people in the indictment,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> began in February 1990 and lasted until May 1990. In February, the quantities Boyer purchased increased because of Kausler\u2019s needs. Purchases occurred at a rate of one or two a week, and the parties began to use designated locations, approximately halfway between Ann Arbor and Petoskey, to make the purchases.

Also, we conclude with respect to count II that it was not an abuse of discretion to find probable cause existed to believe defendant conspired with Kausler to possess with an intent to deliver over 225 grams but less than 650 grams of cocaine because testimony permitted the district court to reasonably infer that defendant and Kausler combined to accomplish the criminal objective as charged.

I agree with the majority\u2019s holding that to bind Mr. Justice over on the two counts of conspiracy there must be probable cause to believe that he and his coconspirators shared the specific intent to accomplish the substantive offenses charged. However, notably absent from the majority\u2019s holding and analysis is the requirement that both conspirators must possess the specific intent to deliver the <em>charged amounts' </em>from the time of the <em>formation </em>of the conspiratorial agreement that is the basis of the conspiracy charge. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusions on both counts because I do not find sufficient evidence in the record to establish that Mr. Justice and his respective coconspirator specifically intended to deliver the charged amounts at the time that the conspiratorial agreement was formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Regarding count I, I would hold that the district court abused its discretion in binding Mr. Justice over on conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver over 650 grams of cocaine. I believe the evidence was insufficient to allow a reasonable trier of fact to infer that he and his coconspirators had a specific intent to <em>deliver </em>over 650 grams of cocaine at the time that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>they <em>formed </em>their drug sale-purchase agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Also, I do not believe that there is sufficient evidence that Mr. Justice and Ms. Boyer possessed the intent to <em>combine </em>to deliver to third persons over 650 grams of cocaine. Further, I believe that the district court abused its discretion in binding Mr. Justice over on the conspiracy charge of possession with intent to deliver between 225 and 650 grams of cocaine. Similar to count i, I do not believe there was sufficient evidence to establish Mr. Justice\u2019s or Ms. Kausler\u2019s intent to deliver the charged amounts or their intent to combine to deliver the charged amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">I. THE BINDOVER</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">To bind a defendant over for trial, the district court must find that a specific crime has been committed and probable cause to believe the defendant committed the crime charged. <em>People v King, </em>412 Mich 145, 152-153; 312 NW2d 629 (1981). In determining whether bindover is proper, the court should consider the credibility of the witnesses in addition to their competency, and the weight to be accorded their testimony. It is also true that the district court should not dismiss the charge when there is conflicting evidence or reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s guilt because those are issues for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">However, <em>King </em>also instructs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">The inquiry is not limited to whether the prosecution has presented evidence on each element of the offense. The [district court] is required to make [its] determination \u201cafter an examination of the whole matter.\u201d Although the prosecution has presented some evidence on each element, <em>if upon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>an examination of the whole matter the evidence is insufficient to satisfy the [district court] that the offense charged has been committed and that there is probable cause to believe that the defendant committed it, then [it] should not bind the defendant over on the offense charged </em>but may bind him over on a lesser offense as to which [it] is so satisfied. <em>[Id. </em>at 154 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-3\">The majority should have kept these concepts in mind when it reviewed for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s determination that the evidence was sufficient to warrant a bindover on each conspiracy count. I would hold that the district court abused its discretion in binding the defendant over on either count because there was insufficient evidence to establish that either offense was committed and probable cause to believe that Mr. Justice committed either offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">H. CONSPIRACY</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The majority acknowledges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">To be convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver a controlled substance, the people must prove that (1) the defendant possessed the specific intent to deliver the statutory minimum as charged, (2) his coconspirators possessed the specific intent to deliver the statutory minimum as charged, and (3) the defendant and his coconspirators possessed the specific intent to combine to deliver the statutory minimum as charged to a third person. See, e.g. <em>[People v Blume, </em>443 Mich 476, 485, 508, n 31; 505 NW2d 843 (1993)]. <em>[Ante </em>at 349.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Further, the majority also acknowledges that \u201c \u2018[t]he gist of the offense of conspiracy lies in the unlawful agreement\u2019 . . . [meaning] . . .' [t]he crime is com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>p\u00edete upon formation of the agreement . . . <em>People v Carter, </em>415 Mich 558, 568; 330 NW2d 314 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Putting these concepts together, it follows that for the defendant to be guilty of the charged conspiracy counts, Mr. Justice and his coconspirators would have had to have intended to deliver the charged amounts from the time that they formed an agreement to deliver the cocaine to third persons. If Mr. Justice and his coconspirators did not specifically intend to deliver the charged amounts, then they could not have had an agreement to deliver the charged amounts. If there was no agreement to deliver the charged amounts, then there was no conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">ra. COUNT i</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Count I involves an alleged conspiracy between Mr. Justice and Cathy Boyer to deliver over 650 grams of cocaine to third persons. Although the charge alleges a conspiracy between the Fall of 1989 through the Summer of 1990, the record evidence only establishes Boyer\u2019s possible intent to deliver when Suzanne Kausler entered the picture in February 1990. Before February 1990, there is no evidence in the record that Boyer intended to deliver cocaine to third persons. Even if she intended to do so, there is no evidence that Mr. Justice knew she intended to do so or that he intended to combine with her to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">What the majority focuses on in Count I are the transactions occurring between February and May 1990 in which Boyer purchased cocaine on behalf of Kausler. For Mr. Justice to be properly bound over on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>this count, he and Boyer would have to have agreed to deliver over 650 grains of cocaine to third persons at the time they formed their unlawful agreement. The record in this case is void of any evidence that there was any kind of agreement that there would be deliveries of the quantities necessary to reach the level charged in this count. Rather than being considered as part of an ongoing conspiracy to deliver cocaine, the testimony indicates that the drug transactions are properly labeled as separate transactions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The lack of evidence to establish that Mr. Justice and his coconspirators possessed the requisite intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>is shown by the majority\u2019s conclusion that defendant <em>could </em>have conspired with Boyer to deliver over 650 grams, Boyer <em>could </em>have conspired with Mr. Justice to deliver that amount, and that Mr. Justice and Boyer <em>could </em>have possessed the intent to combine to deliver over 650 grams to third persons. I agree that anything is possible, but this Court should require sufficient evidence before it allows a bindover, especially when this count involves an offense mandating a sentence of life without parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">iv. count n</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Count n alleges that Mr. Justice conspired with Suzanne Kausler to deliver or possess with intent to deliver between 225 and 650 grams of cocaine between March 1990 and December 1990. This count concerns only the drug transactions occurring between Kausler and Mr. Justice after the Boyers were preparing to move to Florida. It was only after this time that Kausler began to deal directly with Mr. Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">To bind Mr. Justice over on this count, the prosecutor must establish that Mr. Justice specifically intended to deliver between 225 and 650 grams of cocaine, Kausler specifically intended to <em>deliver </em>between 225 and 650 grams of cocaine, and Mr. Justice and Kausler specifically intended to combine to deliver that amount to third persons. At this point, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>know that Kausler is a cocaine addict. Obviously, cocaine addicts use a significant amount of cocaine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> So, even though Kausler made one purchase over 225 grams, I do not believe that that alone is sufficient probable cause to' believe that she intended to deliver that entire amount. I also question whether there is probable cause to believe that Mr. Justice intended to combine with Kausler to deliver that entire amount. Rather, because of her cocaine addiction, I believe it more probable that Kausler intended to use most of it herself. In fact, she testified that she sold only a few grams here and there.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">As this Court instructed in <em>Blume, supra </em>at 485-486:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">Clearly, the prosecutor must present more evidence than the seller\u2019s knowledge of the buyer\u2019s proposed illegal purpose. For intent to exist, the defendant must know of the conspiracy, must know of the objective of the conspiracy, and must intend to participate cooperatively to further that objective. \u201c \u2018[T]o establish the intent, the evidence of knowledge must be clear, not equivocal . . . because charges of conspiracy are not to be made out by piling inference upon inference ....\u2019\u201d <em>[People v Atley, </em>392 Mich 298, 310; 220 NW2d 465 (1974)], quoting <em>Direct Sales Co </em>[v <em>United States, </em>319 US 703; 63 S Ct 1265; 87 L Ed 1674 (1943)].<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">To bind Mr. Justice over in this case, the prosecutor would need to pile inference upon inference. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>there is no evidence in the record to indicate that Mr. Justice knew Kausler intended to redistribute some of the cocaine, the prosecution has to infer that intent from the quantities delivered to Kausler. Then, the prosecution must infer that she intended to redistribute the charged amount of between 225 and 650 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Similar to the majority\u2019s conclusion regarding count i, I believe it was an abuse of discretion for the court to bind Mr. Justice over on this count because there was not sufficient evidence presented at the preliminary examination to support a finding of probable cause on this conspiracy count.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">I believe that the transactions involved in both counts were not part of a defined conspiracy, but rather were separate transactions. Thus, I believe it was an abuse of discretion for the court to have bound Mr. Justice over on either count. \u201c[T]he fact that there was some redistribution of the cocaine does not establish that there was an agreement that the coconspirators would redistribute it and return for more when the supply was exhausted. There simply was no evidence that defendant and Kausler or Boyer were involved in an ongoing conspiracy to deliver the aggregate quantities charged.\u201d <em>People v Justice, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued December 28, 1995 (Docket No. 173326) (White, J., dissenting), slip op at 4.
