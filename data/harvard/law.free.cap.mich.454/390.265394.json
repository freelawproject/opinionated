The instructions in the instant case violated <em>Aaron </em>by allowing the jury to convict defendant of murder from his intent to commit the underlying crime alone. The jury did not need to determine that defendant had a malicious intent before determining that he was guilty of murder. Therefore, we would reverse the Court of Appeals decision to affirm defendant\u2019s conviction and would remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">On June 21, 1991, defendant Rodney Dumas and codefendant Patrick Smith entered the garage of Porter Thomas, a self-employed mechanic, to commit an armed robbery. A customer, Eddie Fultz, was present at the garage at the time. When the two men entered the shop, defendant approached Fultz. Smith pushed Thomas into the garage. Fultz explained that he did not work there, but defendant told him to go into the office and said \u201cnothing [will] happen to you.\u201d Defendant gestured to his hip, suggesting that he might have a gun. When defendant looked back toward the garage, Fultz fled by climbing over a seven-foot fence. As he climbed the fence, he heard Thomas repeatedly say in a frightened voice, \u201cI don\u2019t have any money.\u201d Before hitting the ground, Fultz heard a single gunshot. Fultz returned to the garage to see defendant and Smith running toward their vehicle. After Thomas, wounded in the chest, emerged from the garage carrying a rifle, he collapsed. He died from the wound, which was made by a .357 or .38 hollow point bullet.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Defendant and Smith were charged with felony murder. MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548. Smith was also charged with possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. MCL 750.227b; MSA 28.424(2). In January 1992, defendant and Smith were tried jointly, although separate juries were impaneled. Evidence of similar acts was presented at trial against defendant, indicating that he and Smith had been involved previously in three other armed robberies together. This evidence was introduced for the' purpose of demonstrating defendant\u2019s knowledge that Smith was carrying a gun during the robbery of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Thomas. Defendant did not testify and did not call any witnesses. In closing argument, defense'counsel conceded that defendant intended to commit the robbery, but rested his defense on the theory that defendant did not know that Smith had an intent to shoot the victim. Counsel asked that the jury convict defendant of the lesser offense of attempted armed robbery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The only issue in this appeal is the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury. Defendant claims that the trial court erred in giving the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">If you find that the defendant consciously intended to commit, attempted to commit or assist others in the commission of the crime of robbery or larceny, you may infer that he knowingly created a high risk of death or serious bodily injury with knowledge that it probably would cause death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Defendant objected to this instruction, but the trial court gave the instruction over his objection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">On January 27, 1992, the jury found defendant guilty of first-degree felony murder,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and he was sentenced to life in prison without an opportunity for parole, as required under MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Court of Appeals, which affirmed in an unpublished per curiam opinion, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">A review of the instructions as a whole reveals that the court properly instructed the jurors on the issue of intent. The court read the requisite elements of felony murder. The court included an instruction which addressed the act of murder. The court next instructed the jurors on the fifth element outlined in the CJI2d, which explained that in order to convict a defendant of first-degree felony murder, the killing must occur \u201cas a result of the crime of larceny or robbery.\u201d Finally, the court gave its instruction on transferred intent. Although in isolation, the alleged erroneous instruction may have somewhat blurred the concept of intent to commit the underlying felony and intent to cause great bodily injury, the given instructions, when read as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>whole does not amount to reversible error. [Issued January 11, 1995 (Docket No. 153325), slip op at 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Defendant sought leave to appeal, and this Court granted leave, \u201climited to whether the trial court improperly instructed that the intent required for a felony-murder conviction can be inferred from the intent to commit the underlying felony.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">H. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A74\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s jury instructions, this Court examines the instructions as a whole, and, even if there are some imperfections, there is no basis for reversal if the instructions adequately protected the defendant\u2019s rights by fairly presenting to the jury the issues to be tried. <em>People v Kalder, </em>284 Mich 235, 241-242; 279 NW 493 (1938). This Court will not reverse a conviction for an instruction that is not \u201c \u2018strictly correct\u2019 \u201d where we \u201c \u2018can clearly see that the jury could not have been misled by it\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>People v Dupie, </em>395 Mich 483, 488-489; 236 NW2d 494 (1975), quoting the syllabus from <em>People v Scott, </em>6 Mich 287 (1859).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">To prove murder, the people must demonstrate that the defendant acted with malice in causing the death of another. <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 728. Malice is defined as (1) the intent to kill, (2) the intent to do great bodily harm, or (3) a wanton and wilful disregard of the likelihood that the natural tendency of the defendant\u2019s act is to cause death or great bodily harm, i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>depraved-heart murder. <em>Id. </em>In 1980, in <em>Aaron, </em>this Court abolished the common-law felony-murder rule, which had previously established that a defendant was guilty of murder for a homicide that occurred during the course of a felony if he had the intent to commit the underlying felony, insofar as this rule equated malice with the intent to commit the underlying felony. See <em>id. </em>at 727-728. Rather, the people must prove one of the three intents that define malice in every murder case. <em>Id. </em>at 728. After this decision, the felony-murder rule continued to exist in part by statute, operating only to elevate a second-degree murder conviction to first-degree murder if the murder occurred during the commission of one of the statutorily enumerated crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 734. At the time of defendant\u2019s trial, the first-degree murder statute provided in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">Murder which is perpetrated by means of poison, lying in wait, or other wilful, deliberate, and premeditated killing, or which is committed in the perpetration, or attempt to perpetrate arson, criminal sexual conduct in the first or third degree, robbery, breaking and entering of a. dwelling, larceny of any kind, extortion, or kidnapping, is murder of the first degree, and shall be punished by imprisonment for life. [MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>In abolishing the felony-murder rule from the common law, this Court explained that the malice necessary for a felony-murder conviction cannot be inferred from the intent to commit the underlying felony alone. See <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 727-728.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See also <em>People v Kelly, </em>423 Mich 261, 273; 378 NW2d 365 (1985).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, we noted that the jury may infer a malicious intent from the facts and circumstances of the underlying felony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">The facts and circumstances involved in the perpetration of a felony may evidence an intent to kill, an intent to cause great bodily harm, or a wanton and willful disregard of the likelihood that the natural tendency of defendant\u2019s behavior is to cause death or great bodily harm; however, the conclusion must be left to the jury to infer from all the evidence. <em>[Aaron, supra </em>at 728-729. See also <em>Kelly, supra </em>at 273.][<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Five years after <em>Aaron </em>was decided, this Court, in <em>Kelly, </em>addressed a similar issue as the one raised in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>this appeal. Notwithstanding the ruling of <em>Aaron, </em>the trial court in <em>Kelly </em>provided an instruction regarding malice that was virtually the same as the one contested in the instant case,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in a felony-murder trial in which the underlying felony was robbery.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As in this case, the defendant objected to the instruction, but the trial court overruled the objection. <em>Kelly, supra </em>at 269-270, n 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">In reviewing the particular instruction, we concluded that the instruction, read in isolation, \u201cmay be inaccurate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264. Nevertheless, in reviewing the instructions in their entirety, we determined that the instructions merely identified the underlying crime as a factor for the jury to consider in determining whether the defendant was guilty of malice. <em>Id. </em>at 273. We noted that the contested instruction only created a \u201cpermissive inference\u201d and not a mandatory one. <em>Id. </em>at 273, n 4. We also noted that the trial court had (1) properly instructed the jury that malice is an essential element of murder, (2) given a proper instruction on the definition of malice, and (3) instructed the jury that it must consider all the facts and circumstances in determining the defendant\u2019s state of mind. We reasoned that the instruction that the jury must consider all the facts and circumstances \u201cclarified any ambiguity in the instruction objected to by explicitly noting in the proxdmately following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>paragraphs the factors the jury had to consider to find malice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274-275. Consequently, we concluded that the instructions as a whole \u201ccorrectly informed the jury of the <em>Aaron </em>standard\u201d and that the instructions did not <em>require </em>the jury to find malice only on the basis of the intent to commit the underlying felony. <em>Id. </em>at 275. In concluding that the given instructions \u201cwere accurate,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 276, we contrasted <em>Aaron, </em>and its companion case, <em>People v Thompson, </em>in which the instructions regarding the inference to draw was <em>automatic </em>rather than merely permissive. <em>Kelly, supra </em>at 276-277.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">In the instant case, defendant was tried for felony murder where the people claimed that the underlying crime was larceny or armed robbery.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As in <em>Kelly, </em>the trial court provided the proper instruction that the people must prove one of three intents to prove the requisite intent for murder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">Murder is the killing of one person by another with a certain mental element. For murder, the defendant must have intended to kill, or having intended to do great bodily harm, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>or the defendant must have intended to create a very high risk of death or great bodily harm with knowledge that death or great bodily harm was the probable result of his acts ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In fact, the trial court repeated this definition of malice in its instructions on first- and second-degree murder four times.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The trial court then gave the elements for larceny before it gave the instruction that defendant objected to at trial and challenges on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">If you find that the defendant consciously intended to commit, attempted to commit or assist others in the commission of the crime of robbery or larceny, you <em>may infer </em>that he knowingly created a high risk of death or serious bodily injury with knowledge that it probably would cause death. [Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>This particular instruction, examined in isolation, is erroneous because the jury could conclude that it <em>may </em>infer defendant\u2019s intent to create a high risk of death or great bodily harm with the knowledge that death was the likely result from the intent to commit the underlying crime <em>alone, </em>even if the facts and circumstances of the crime did not support that finding.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The word \u201cmay\u201d generally denotes discretion, see <em>AFSCME v Highland Park Bd of Ed, </em>214 Mich App 182, 186; 542 NW2d 333 (1995), and the instruction provides no qualification of when this discretion may be exercised. Hence, the instruction violates <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 727-728, by allowing the jury to convict defendant for murder without finding that he had a malicious state of mind when he committed the crime.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This particular instruction should not be given by trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>In <em>Kelly, </em>the trial court gave the erroneous instruction, but then immediately followed it with further instructions on intent, that the jury may infer an intent to kill from the manner of use of a dangerous weapon, and that the jury must consider all facts and circumstances to determine the defendant\u2019s state of mind:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">\u201cNow, you must consider all of the facts and circumstances in determining the state of mind of the defendant at the time of the act. This may be inferred from the kind of weapon used, the nature of the wounds inflicted, the circumstances surrounding the killing, the acts, conduct and language of the accused or any other circumstance in evidence.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 268.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">We approved the instructions in their entirety because, in context, the general tenor of the instructions was to convey to the jury that it could infer the defendant\u2019s malice from the commission of the underlying crime if the circumstances and facts warranted the inference. <em>Kelly, supra </em>at 275.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">However, in the instant case, unlike <em>Kelly, </em>the trial court did not immediately follow the erroneous instruction with a proper one regarding the fact that the jury <em>must </em>consider all the facts and circumstances in determining the defendant\u2019s state of mind. Instead, the trial court provided instructions on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>elements of assault with intent to commit armed robbery, attempted armed robbery, and accessory after the fact. After these instructions, the trial court gave an instruction similar to the one that had clarified the erroneous instruction in <em>Kelly, </em>but this one did not refer to the felony-murder charge and only informed the jury that it <em>may </em>consider the facts and circumstances in determining defendant\u2019s intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">Now the crimes of aimed robbery, larceny, assault with intent to rob and the common law offense of accessory after the fact requires proof of a specific intent. This means that the prosecution must prove not only that the defendant did certain acts, but that he did the acts with the intent to bring about a particular result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">For the crime of larceny, armed robbery, assault with intent to rob[,] this means that the prosecution must prove that the defendant intended to permanently deprive the owner, that is Mr. Porter Thomas[,] of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">\n<em>The defendant\u2019s intent may be proved by what he said, what he did, how he did it or any other facts and circumstances in evidence.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">For the crime of common law accessory after the fact the People must prove that at the time of the offense the defendant specifically intended to hinder the other person\u2019s arrest or the other person\u2019s trial or the person\u2019s punishment. And for the crime of attempted armed robbery, this means that the prosecution must prove that the defendant intended to commit the crime of armed robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\"><em>Once again the defendant\u2019s intent may be proved by what he said, what he did, how he did it or any other facts and circumstances in evidence. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">The two italicized instructions, examined in context, appear to refer only to the specific intent crimes identified by the trial court immediately before, and not to the felony-murder charge the trial court described ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>pages earlier in the transcript. Moreover, the fact that the instruction did not require the jury to consider the facts and circumstances, but merely allowed the jury to consider them, further limits the likelihood that this instruction could have clarified the erroneous instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Furthermore, the jury instructions given later by the trial court only compounded the error of the inaccurate instruction given earlier by stating in the people\u2019s theory of the case that the people claimed that defendant was guilty of wanton and wilful disregard for others by his \u201cintentional participation in an armed robbery\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">It is the People\u2019s position that on June 21, 1991 in the late afternoon the defendants, Rodney Dumas and Patrick Smith, acting together with a common purpose, went to the Porter Thomas garage in Detroit with the specific intent then of robbing or stealing money from Mr. Thomas. Defendant Dumas knew that Mr. Smith had a gun because when they recently committed three prior armed robberies Mr. Smith always possessed a firearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">It is the People\u2019s theory that during the attempt to rob or steal Mr. Thomas\u2019 money, he offered som[e] form of resistance, and Patrick Smith shot and killed him with either a .38 caliber or a .357 caliber handgun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">[It] is the People\u2019s theory that when Mr. Smith shot Mr. Thomas in the upper left chest, it was his intent to overcome whatever resistance Mr. Thomas offered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">Prior to and at the time of the attempted robbery of Mr. Thomas it was a common understanding of the Defendant Dumas and Mr. Smith that if there was any resistance from Mr. Thomas, Mr. Smith would use his handgun to meet or overcome it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">It is the People\u2019s theory that it made little difference if any to the defendant Dumas whether Mr. Thomas was killed or suffered great bodily harm. The objective was to end any resistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>At the time Porter Thomas was fatally shot by Mr. Smith, Defendant Dumas concurred in the killing or in the infliction of the great bodily harm as part of their common purpose, i.e., to rob and avoid apprehension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\"><em>In any event[,] Defendant Dumas by his intentional participation in an armed robbery acted in a wilful and wanton manner that had the natural tendency to cause Mr. Thomas\u2019 death. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The trial court\u2019s instructions on the people\u2019s theory initially indicated that the people claimed that defendant had agreed by \u201ccommon understanding\u201d before the robbery to kill someone or to inflict great bodily harm on someone if during their robbery they encountered any resistance. This is perfectly consistent with <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 728-729. However, the trial court added another argument, separated by the phrase \u201c[i]n any event,\u201d that defendant, because he intentionally participated in the underlying felony, acted in a wanton and wilful manner. This argument indicated that the jury may conclude that defendant acted with malice by the fact alone that he participated in the' robbery. <em>Aaron </em>requires more. <em>Aaron </em>requires that the people prove that the facts and circumstances of the crime evidenced a wanton and wilful disregard for others. <em>Id. </em>at 728-729.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, the instruction on the people\u2019s theory confirmed the previous erroneous instruction by asking the jury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>infer a malicious intent irrespective of whether the facts and circumstances warranted the inference.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">These statements were part of the instructions to the jury. See MCR 2.516(A)(2)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and MCR 2.516(B)(3).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> They were the last instructions the trial court gave before giving the jury instructions regarding its duty to pick a foreperson.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">For these reasons, in the instant case, we conclude that the instructions, even read in their entirety, failed to fairly present the issues the jury was to try. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>cannot say that the jury would not have been misled by the particular errors of the trial court. See <em>Dupie, supra </em>at 488-489. We would order all trial courts to refrain from using the erroneous instruction that the jury may infer malice from the commission of the underlying offense without qualifying when the jury may make this inference. Where the trial court decides to give an instruction that the jury may infer malice from the commission of an underlying crime, it should further explain at the same time that the jury may only infer this malice if the facts and circumstances of the intent to commit the underlying crime warrant the inference. A trial court should take its instructions from this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 728-729, if it decides to elaborate on its instructions on the nature of malice.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We, of course, would leave to the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine whether there is a need for additional instructions on the question of malice beyond the definition of malice supplied in <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The instructional error in this case was preserved but did not involve a constitutional claim. Thus, it is preserved, nonconstitutional error. Under Michigan law, we shall not set aside a verdict unless such an error resulted in a miscarriage of justice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>No judgment or verdict shall be set aside or reversed or a new trial be granted by any court of this state in any criminal case, <em>on the ground of misdirection of the jury, </em>or the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or for error as to any matter of pleading or procedure, unless in the opinion of the court, after an examination of the entire case, it shall affirmatively appear that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. [MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">We explained in <em>People v Mateo, </em>453 Mich 203, 206; 551 NW2d 891 (1996), that this statute does not require \u201ca literal definition\u201d of miscarriage of justice. Where there is overwhelming evidence of a defendant\u2019s guilt, there is no affirmative evidence of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In the instant case, the key point was whether defendant harbored a malicious intent when he committed the armed robbery. The evidence on this point was not overwhelming. For this reason, we cannot conclude that the error on the law governing malice in the jury instructions was harmless. The people and defendant focused their closing arguments on the question whether defendant had a malicious intent when he intended to participate in the armed robbery. The people argued in closing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">If by chance it is suggested well, maybe [defendant] was willing to go along with the robbery, and he knew that Smith had a gun. Maybe he didn\u2019t believe that Smith would shoot to kill or to seriously injure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">Members of the jury, if that be his state of mind, he is still guilty of felony murder. <em>Because he would know what Smith would do in the event resistance arose, and he was willing to be a party to it. He put in force along with Smith the chain of events that led to the death of Porter Thomas. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>In other words, the people claimed that defendant was guilty of depraved-heart murder because he knew that Smith would use force and defendant nevertheless agreed to assist him. This argument is consistent with <em>Kelly, supra </em>at 278-279,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and concentrates on defendant\u2019s state of mind in agreeing to commit the armed robbery. Similarly, defendant contested the same point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">We are not denying that he intended an attempted] robbery on that day. What we are saying is that, ladies and gentlemen, his actions, that is accompanying Mr. Smith does not amount to proof that he\u2019s responsible, that he had the malice, that he had the intent that would lead you to be able to find him guilty of felony murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">You are to deal with my client\u2019s conduct, and I ask you to consider only what he did and only what he is responsible for. These are unfor[e]seen results on his part. <em>He had no reason to believe that Mr. Smith was going to do what he did. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Thus, the parties directed the jury\u2019s attention to whether defendant knew that Smith would use the weapon to overcome any opposition by Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Yet, the trial court\u2019s instructional errors allowed the jury to infer defendant\u2019s malicious intent alone from his intent to participate in the underlying robbery regardless of the facts and circumstances of the rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>bery. The jury was instructed to follow the law as the trial court gave it to the jury. Consequently, the jury may have followed the law as given by the trial court and not reached a conclusion about whether defendant agreed with Smith to overcome resistance with force. Instead, it may have decided, with the endorsement of the instructions, that he was guilty because he intended to commit the robbery. Regardless of whether we believe that defendant was guilty of this crime, this factual question was one for the jury. The entire case turned on whether he was malicious, and on this same point the jury was wrongly instructed.

The trial judge did not charge the jury that the defendant could be convicted of felony murder if it found that defendant committed a statutory felony and death resulted. Nor did the judge charge the jury that it could find malice from the intent to commit the underlying felony <em>alone. </em>The instruction given correctly defined second-degree murder five separate times and the instruction the lead opinion finds was error actually advised the jury twice that the defendant\u2019s intent may be proved by what he said or did, how he did it, \u201cor any other facts and circumstances in evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The lead opinion\u2019s contention that the factfinder might have understood this instruction to require it to find malice from intent alone because it \u201cdid not require the jury to consider the facts and circumstances, but merely allowed the jury to consider them\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is illogical. Since the jury was allowed to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>sider all the facts and circumstances in evidence in determining whether defendant created a high risk of death or serious bodily injury, ipso facto it was not <em>required </em>to find malice from the intent to commit the felony alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Given the evidence, the arguments, and the instructions as a whole, there is no reasonable possibility the jury thought that defendant could be convicted without a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Dumas himself acted with malice in respect to the killing of the decedent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The instruction adequately protected the defendant\u2019s rights by fairly presenting the issue to be determined, <em>People v Dupie, </em>395 Mich 483; 236 NW2d 494 (1975). Assuming the instruction was error on the key point, whether there was evidence of defendant\u2019s malice with regard to the homicide of the deceased, there was overwhelming evidence that defendant Dumas acted with wanton and wilful disregard of the principal\u2019s intent to kill or cause great bodily harm or himself acted with wanton and wilful disregard of the substantial likelihood that his behavior could cause death or great bodily harm. I would affirm the conviction, MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">I agree with the lead opinion to the extent that it reads <em>Aaron </em>to stand for the principle that the jury may find malice from the intent to commit an underlying felony where that intent evidences a malicious state of mind regarding a killing that occurs in the course of a felony, ante, p 398, n 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>In <em>Aaron, </em>this Court abolished the common-law felony-murder rule that the mens rea necessary for murder was satisfied by proof of an enumerated or other abstractly dangerous felony and a resulting death. <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 715-716, n 103.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Aaron </em>held that the people must prove the mens rea of second-degree murder, that is, malice,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> plus the felony, for statutory first-degree murder, MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548. The teaching of <em>Aaron </em>is that malice, with regard to a homicide, may not be imputed from the underlying felony. <em>Aaron </em>does not hold that the intent to commit the underlying felony does not have probative significance regarding whether defendant had a \u201cman-endangering state of mind\u201d with regard to the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Thus, a jury may not be instructed that it may find first-degree felony murder from the intent to commit the enumerated felony alone and a resulting death, because an intent to commit the felony is not the equivalent of the malicious state of mind necessary for second-degree murder. After <em>Aaron, </em>the mens rea necessary for the felony is in every instance different than the mens rea required for murder, and no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>will the law allow the latter to be conclusively proven from the former. Stated otherwise, the intent to commit the felony is necessary, but not sufficient, to show malice regarding the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">It does not follow, however, that if the underlying felony requires an intent that exhibits a man-endangering state of mind, that intent might not be evidence of malice in regard to a resulting killing. Thus, while I agree with the lead opinion that <em>Aaron </em>requires that the people prove that each co-felon has malice because \u201c[i]t is fundamentally unfair and in violation of basic principles of individual criminal culpability to hold one felon liable for the unforeseen and unagreed-to results of another felon,\u201d <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 731, the jury was not instructed that it could find malice from this intent alone. Further, the court did not err in advising the jury regarding the people\u2019s theory that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">in any event Defendant Dumas by his intentional participation in an armed robbery acted in a wilful and wanton manner that had the natural tendency to cause Mr. Thomas\u2019 death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">There was no dispute that defendant knew the principal was armed, nor was there any factual dispute that defendant had participated in three prior armed robberies with codefendant. As observed in <em>Aaron,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">In cases where the felons are acting intentionally or recklessly in pursuit of a common plan, the felony-murder rule is unnecessary because liability may be established on agency principles. <em>[Id. </em>at 731.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Professors Perkins and Boyce describe the malice necessary for second-degree murder as a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">[man-endangering state] of mind which includes (1) an intent to kill, or (2) an intent to inflict great bodily injury, or (3) an intent to do an act in wanton and wilful disregard of an unreasonable human risk, (i.e. the. wilful doing of a wanton act under such circumstances that there is obviously a plain and strong likelihood that death or great bodily injury may result), or (4) an intent to perpetrate a dangerous felony. [Criminal Law (3d ed), p 73.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">With the abrogation of the commission of the enumerated felonies as a proxy for malice with regard to a killing, the enumerated felonies now stand on the same ground as other second-degree murders, as to which no special qualifications regarding the finding of malice need be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Aid or encouragement to another who is actually perpetrating a felony makes the aider guilty of the crime if he knows, or has reason to know of the criminal intention of the other, Perkins at 743, or if he himself acted despite the absence of a showing of knowledge of the other\u2019s intent, with the state of mind necessary for conviction. An aider and abettor may be found guilty on proof of the intent necessary to be convicted as a principal, and if the aider and abettor participates in a crime with knowledge of the principal\u2019s intent to kill or cause great bodily harm, he is acting with at least \u201cwanton and wilful disregard\u201d sufficient to support a finding of malice. <em>People v Kelly, </em>423 Mich 261, 278; 378 NW2d 365 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The instructions on the people\u2019s theory correctly encompassed these two versions of accessory liability in a common-law murder. The juiy was advised that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>the codefendant accessory may be found hable if he aided and abetted the principal and there is evidence that he shared the principal\u2019s intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm, or if he aided and abetted the principal and there is evidence that he himself acted with wanton or wilful disregard of the natural tendency of his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Footnote 17 of the lead opinion\u2019s analysis seems to be grounded on the Court\u2019s explanation in <em>Aaron </em>of the rationale for abolishing the rule. The Court stated that those enumerated felonies that \u201cmay be seen as inherently dangerous to human life when viewed in the abstract may not be so dangerous when viewed in light of the circumstances of a particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 727. The lead opinion concludes from this statement that a defendant\u2019s intent to commit the armed robbery does not, by itself, denote malice with regard to a killing. If this statement means that the intent to commit the felony is not as a matter of law the equivalent of the malice necessary for murder, I agree. However, I read this statement as a rejection of the view of some courts that apply the felony-murder rule by classifying the felony in the abstract to determine whether it is inherently dangerous,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and as the further declaration that in Michigan malice is a question of fact in all circumstances. This conclusion is fortified by juxtaposing the former statement with the Court\u2019s later observations that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">[a] defendant who only intends to commit the felony does not intend to commit the harm that results and may or may not be guilty of perpetrating an act done in wanton or will<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>ful disregard of the plain and strong likelihood that such harm will result <em>[id. </em>at 728,]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">[a] jury can properly infer malice from evidence that a defendant intentionally set in motion a force likely to cause death or great bodily harm. <em>[Id. </em>at 729 (emphasis deleted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">In my view, the proper interpretation of the sentence is that intent to commit a felony is not the legal equivalent of malice with regard to the killing, that malice with regard to the killing is an essential element of all murder, which is a question of fact with respect to each defendant for the trier of fact, \u201cand, as all questions of fact, may be established by direct evidence, circumstantial evidence, or both.\u201d <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 745-746 (Ryan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Thus, because death may be accidental or wholly unanticipated, a jury may not be told, no less with the enumerated felonies than with any other murder, <em>People v Maher, </em>10 Mich 212, 218; 81 AD 781 (1862), that it must convict if it finds the mens rea of the felony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, malice may be inferred from all the facts and circumstances, including the intent to commit the underlying felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">It is no more error to advise the jury that a defendant\u2019s knowing participation in an armed robbery may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>be evidence of malice, than would it be to charge a jury that the defendant\u2019s knowing participation in a felonious assault, or knowing participation in an assault with intent to do great bodily harm, or knowing participation in a plan to kill A where B was killed, is error. The factual finding of the actus reus of the felony has probative force for the ultimate issue the jury must determine: whether the defendant acted with malice with regard to the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">I therefore disagree both with the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion that the jury was told it could find malice from the intent to commit the felony alone and that the jury must always be told that it is to do something (that is, consider the facts and circumstances) that it has no reason to think it could not do.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Since intent to kill, intent to do serious bodily injury or depraved heart murder must be proven in every murder prosecution, an intent to commit the underlying felony that has an evidentiary bearing on the existence of the ultimate issue of malice is a proper consideration for the factfinder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To be sure, in a given case, such as where a codefendant claims no prior knowledge of facts that indicate the principal\u2019s malice with respect to the killing, and there is a contested issue regarding whether the defendant himself acted with wanton and wilful disregard of the consequences, it may be both appropriate and necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>charge that the defendant may not be found guilty merely because he participated in the felony. Where, as here, it was undisputed that defendant intended to commit a robbery and knew the principal was armed, and the jury is correctly advised that it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had malice with regard to the killing, there is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\"><em>Aaron </em>does not direct that the jury consider <em>only </em>circumstantial evidence of mens rea, i.e., all the facts and circumstances (intent to do great bodily harm or reckless disregard of the plain and strong likelihood of such a result). Indeed, the lead opinion agrees that direct evidence, in the form of defendant\u2019s intent, of a man-endangering state of mind may be considered. <em>Aaron </em>does not require \u201cmore\u201d in the jury instruction the court today mandates. The \u201cmore\u201d that <em>Aaron </em>requires is a jury instruction that treats the malice element of a murder occurring in the course of an enumerated felony like any other second-degree murder and a special instruction where the proofs so require. The jury was correctly advised five separate times in the instant case regarding the malice element and was not told it could find malice from the intent to commit the underlying felony. I would affirm the conviction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b670-6\">Weaver, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b670-7\">Kelly, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 405.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\"> Defense counsel specifically argued that it was not foreseeable that someone would be harmed because \u201con all three of those (prior) occasions, Mr. Smith, although armed, and Mr. Dumas, who accompanied him according to that testimony, they did not hurt anyone.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\"> The lead opinion describes this rule as equating malice with the intent to commit the underlying felony. I agree, if what is meant is that malice was presumed and that defendant was responsible for an unintended or unexpected death if the felony was intended and death resulted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b664-9\"> As Justice Levin observed in <em>People v Morrin, </em>31 Mich App 301, 323; 187 NW2d 434 (1971), malice is a jury question and in explaining the concept:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-10\">A judge could, for example, charge that the defendant is guilty of the crime of murder if the jurors find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he lolled the victim and that he actually intended to kill the victim or (where relevant), although he did not actually intend to kill, he actually intended to inflict great bodily harm or engaged in behavior the natural tendency of which is to cause death or great bodily harm.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\"> <em>State v Thompson, </em>280 NC 202; 185 SE2d 666 (1972), Perkins <em>&amp; </em>Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed), p 66.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b668-10\"> Where the facts so warrant, the jury should be advised that merely because a defendant intended to commit a felony, does not require a conclusion that the defendant acted with malice in respect to the killing. The archetypal example is the getaway driver in a robbery where there is no evidence the driver knew the peiqjetrators were armed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b669-6\"> It is at this point that the strained construction of the instruction given becomes most obvious. The entire thrust of the jury instructions was that in resolving any question, the jury must examine all the facts and circumstances in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\"> Parenthetically, where the only evidence of malice is the commission of a felony that does not evidence a man-endangering state of mind, the prosecution has not made out a case of minder to submit to the. jury. <em>People v Pavlic, </em>227 Mich 562; 199 NW 373 (1924).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b670-8\"> While I do not agree the instruction was error, <em>People v Kelly, supra, </em>I agree with the lead opinion that it should not be given without clarification. Because the instruction is unnecessary, it invites claims of error on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
