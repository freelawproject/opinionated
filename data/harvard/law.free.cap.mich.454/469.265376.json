Approximately fifteen minutes later, they returned and again left without doing anything. After another fifteen-minute interval, the two men entered the store yet again, but this time defendant approached the front of the counter and Hudson positioned himself at the side of the counter. Lusk testified that Hudson had his left hand in the \u201cslash pocket\u201d of his jacket and said to her, \u201cYou are going to be robbed.\u201d When asked what Hudson did with his hand while it was in his pocket, Lusk said that he \u201cJust kind of moved it around a little bit.\u201d Lusk never saw a weapon or any other article being fashioned as a weapon, but she followed Hudson\u2019s orders that she dump the contents of the cash register onto the counter. Defendant scooped up the money off the counter while Hudson went behind the counter and, with the same hand he had had in his pocket, took some lottery tickets, but Lusk still saw no weapon or any other article. Both men then left the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">After trial, the jury found defendant guilty of aiding and abetting an armed robbery. In a split decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction. We granted leave, 451 Mich 917 (1996), and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In <em>People v Saenz, </em>411 Mich 454, 458; 307 NW2d 675 (1981), this Court unanimously reversed a conviction for armed robbeiy, summarizing the relevant evidence as follows: \u201c[T]he victim\u2019s testimony . . . was that he thought the defendant had a weapon of some kind; he saw no article which resembled a weapon; he saw no bulge under defendant\u2019s coat nor his hand shaped to look like a weapon.\u201d This Court noted the prosecutor\u2019s argument \u201cthat the victim believed the defendant had a weapon and that this was a reasonable belief under the circumstances,\u201d but dismissed this argument, noting that it \u201caddresses only one consideration and ignores the requirement that the belief must be induced by the use or fashion of \u2018any article\u2019 with which the assailant is armed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457-458. This Court then noted that there was no testimony that the defendant \u201cused his hand and a covering so as to resemble a gun\u201d and, accordingly, concluded that the victim\u2019s testimony \u201ccannot be the basis for an armed robbery conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458. The underlying principle is that a subjective belief that a weapon exists is insufficient to satisfy the armed robbery statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In <em>People v Parker, </em>417 Mich 556, 565; 339 NW2d 455 (1983), this Court further explicated the requirements for an armed robbery conviction:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">It is not enough that the person assaulted is put in fear; a person who is subjected to an unarmed robbery may be put in fear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>To constitute armed robbery the robber must be armed with an article which is in fact a dangerous weapon \u2014 a gun, knife, bludgeon, etc., or some article harmless in itself, but used or fashioned in a manner to induce the reasonable belief that the article is a dangerous weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">Words or threats alone can never be dangerous weapons because the statute is concerned with weapons, not words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">To convict, the factfinder must make the determination that at the time of the robbery the assailant was in fact armed with something and not just that the victim thought he was armed. The determination must be based on the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">Words or threats may be evidence of the fact of being armed and under some circumstances they alone might support a verdict of guilty. When no other evidence of the presence of the weapon is adduced, however, it is imperative that the instructions stress the focus of the jury on the presence of the weapon or article and not the fear or belief of the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">In <em>People v Jolly, </em>442 Mich 458; 502 NW2d 177 (1993), the victim was working in a restaurant around midnight when \u201ca man [defendant Jolly] and a woman entered the restaurant. After ordering some food from [the victim], the woman handed him a paper bag and told him her companion had a gun and would shoot him unless he filled the bag with money. [The victim] never saw a gun, and the male robber\u2019s hands were in view at all times; however, he did as the woman asked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">At trial, the prosecutor asked the victim what, other than the woman\u2019s assertion, made him think that the male robber had a gun. The following exchange then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-10\"><em>[The </em>Victim]: [S]he said, \u201cHe has a gun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-11\"><em>[Prosecutor]: </em>Okay. Was there anything else that made you believe or think about a gun, in your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number><em>A. </em>Not really. Normally when, you know, somebody says they have a gun, I just, you know, I just thought that he had a gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\"><em>Q. </em>Okay. Was there anything that made you think that, though, any more?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-8\"><em>A. </em>Well, there was like when he came in he was standing right in front of me. I saw a bulge in his mid, mid area of his \u2014 he had a vest on, I saw a bulge. I didn\u2019t know if it was a gun or not. She said that he had a gun and I assumed because there was a bulge it could have been a buckle or anything, and I didn\u2019t know. So I just went by what she said and just did what she asked. <em>[Id. </em>at 462-463.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">In <em>Jolly, </em>the precise legal question presented was whether there was sufficient evidence to submit the issue of armed robbery to the jury. The <em>Jolly </em>majority quoted the excerpt from <em>Parker, </em>and drew the following conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">A fair reading of <em>Parker </em>does not require submission of a dangerous weapon or other article into evidence, nor does it require that a witness see the malee or model number of a gun or knife before the issue can be submitted to the jury. <em>What cannot reach the jury is proof that only focuses on the subjective belief of the victim. </em>In other words, there must be some objective evidence of the existence of a weapon or article before a jury will be permitted to assess the merits of an armed robbery charge. For example, an object pointing out from under a coat, together with statements threatening a victim with being shot, clearly satisfies the statutory definition of armed robbery. In such a case, there is evidence of actual possession of a weapon or article and the testimony regarding statements that, if believed, make clear an intent to convince the victim of the existence of such a weapon or article. The facts in <em>Parker </em>indicate that the victim never saw anything that could have been the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>knife with which she was being threatened. [442 Mich 468-469 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">It must be kept in mind that the last sentence applies with equal force to the case at bar. And it must be further emphasized in the instant case that there was no verbal threat relating to a weapon of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In <em>Jolly, </em>the majority held that the woman robber\u2019s threat that the male robber would shoot the victim if he did not comply and the victim\u2019s observation of a bulge under the male robber\u2019s vest \u201clocated in a place where a handgun could conceivably be concealed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 470, was sufficient circumstantial evidence to submit the armed robbery charge to the jury. We believe that this interpretation of the \u201cevidence\u201d constitutes the absolute minimum level of evidence sufficient to support an armed robbery conviction, and we hold that the evidence in the case at bar is well below this minimum level.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">In terms of evidentiary sufficiency, this case is virtually identical to <em>Saenz. </em>The victim testified that she thought defendant\u2019s accomplice had a weapon of some kind, but that she never saw any article that resembled the weapon, or a bulge under the accomplice\u2019s coat that conceivably could have been a weapon, or his hand shaped to look like a weapon. Furthermore, the victim did not testify that either defendant or his accomplice threatened that the victim would be shot or stabbed with any alleged weapon. The victim\u2019s testimony cannot be the basis for an armed robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">On direct examination, the prosecutor elicited the following responses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number><em>Q. </em>What happens this time? What occurs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\"><em>A. </em>The heavier-set one walks to the front of the counter, and the skinnier one comes to the side of the counter, and he had his hand in his \u2014 his left hand in his pocket, and he said, \u201cYou are going to be robbed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\"><em>Q. </em>And so the skinnier one walks in and said \u2014 he had his hand in his pocket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\"><em>A. </em>He had his hand in his pocket like that, like straight in like that, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\"><em>Q. </em>Like this (indicating)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-11\"><em>A. </em>But not up so high.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-12\"><em>Q. </em>Like that (indicating)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-13\"><em>A. </em>Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-14\"><em>Q. </em>Did you ever see a weapon at any time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-15\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-16\"><em>Q. </em>What significance did that hand in the pocket have to you when he said you were going to be robbed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-17\"><em>A. </em>Because he never took his hand out of that pocket the whole time I was getting the cash out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-18\"><em>Q. </em>You didn\u2019t see a weapon, though?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-19\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-20\"><em>Q. </em>But he said you were going to be robbed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-21\"><em>A. </em>(Nodding head.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-22\"><em>Q. </em>What happened then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-23\"><em>A. </em>He told me to open the drawer, and it took me a few minutes to get the sequence to get the drawer to come out. And the drawer opened, and it came out, and he told me to grab \u2014 to get the drawer and set it up on the counter, the skinnier one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-24\"><em>Q. </em>Who told you you were going to be robbed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-25\"><em>A. </em>The skinny one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-26\"><em>Q. </em>Who told you to open the drawer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-27\"><em>A. </em>The skinny one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-28\"><em>Q. </em>And who told you to take the drawer out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-29\"><em>A. </em>The skinny one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>Q. </em>What happened then?

In other words, were they pockets or were they more like a coat-type pocket that I have on my suit coat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-15\"><em>A. </em>They were slashed pockets like you get on a flannel jacket, like a quilted flannel jacket with the pockets that go inside that farmers wear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-16\"><em>Q. </em>So kind of hand-warmer pockets?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-17\"><em>A. </em>Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-18\"><em>Q. </em>Now, when did you first become aware of this person having his hand in his pocket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-19\"><em>A. </em>When he walked up beside me. He was right \u2014 he was right next to me. I couldn\u2019t miss his hand in his pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-20\"><em>Q. </em>All right. And the prior two occasions when he came in the store, did he ever have his hand in his pocket that you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-21\"><em>A. </em>No. He didn\u2019t have his hands in his pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-22\"><em>Q. </em>So he came up beside you, which would have been where, alongside where the door is here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>A. </em>Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\"><em>Q. </em>Okay. And Mr. Banks would have been over here in front of the counter, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\"><em>A. </em>Mr. Banks was in front of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">He H: Hi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\"><em>Q. </em>And it was \u2014 we later determined that it was \u2014 Mr. Hudson is the tall, skinny person we are talking about, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-10\"><em>A. </em>Okay. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-11\"><em>Q. </em>And it was Mr. Hudson who was standing on the side with his hand in his pocket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-12\"><em>A. </em>Side, left hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-13\"><em>Q. </em>What did he do with his hand in his pocket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-14\"><em>A. </em>He said, \u201cYou are going to be robbed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-15\"><em>Q. </em>All right. But did he do anything with his hand or with his jacket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-16\"><em>A. </em>Just kind of moved it around a little bit. That\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-17\"><em>Q. </em>Well, maybe we can make this clear for the jury. When Mr. Bloemers was asking questions, he was going like this (indicating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-18\"><em>A. </em>And I told him lower, not so high. Anybody who walks in with a gun is not going to raise it at you. It\u2019s lower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-19\"><em>Q. </em>Do you recall, was this a jacket where it buttoned or zipped or somehow fastened across the front?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-20\">A \u25a0 No.' With the slashed pocket, all you have got to do is put your hand in it. If there is a weapon in it, you can\u2019t see it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-21\"><em>Q. </em>Other than that, did he do anything, any motion or activity with his hand in his pocket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-22\"><em>A. </em>Just kept moving whatever he had in his pocket around. I didn\u2019t ask. I wasn\u2019t about to ask.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-23\"><em>Q. </em>I understand that. But, for all you know, there was nothing in there but his hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-24\"><em>A. </em>Okay, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-25\"><em>Q. </em>Did Mr. Banks say anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-26\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-27\"><em>Q. </em>Did he threaten you in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\"><em>Q. </em>Did he demand anything of you in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARF\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\"><em>Q. </em>I just have one more thing to take up with you, Ms. Lusk. Again, I am referring back to the transcript on the preliminary examination that was held in this matter, and I am on page 6. Mr. Bloemers was asking you some questions at that time, and I believe he was talking about Mr. Hudson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">And in the middle of the page, Mr. Bloemers, he asks, \u201cWhere were his hands, if you recall?\u201d Your answer, \u201cHe had his hand \u2014 he had his left hand in his pocket.\u201d Is that accurate? Do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">Do you remember that testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\"><em>A. </em>Yeah, the down here part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-10\"><em>Q. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-11\"><em>A. </em>The skinnier one kept his left hand in his pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-12\"><em>Q. </em>Right. Now, let me go over it in just a little more detail so we get it right. You answered, \u201cHe had his left hand in his pocket.\u201d And Mr. Bloemers said, \u201cOkay. And what was he doing with that left hand in his pocket? Was he just ...\u201d trailed off, and then you answered, \u201cJust \u2014 just kept it there.\u201d \u201cOkay. Could you see whether there was anything inside of that pocket?\u201d Your answer was, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cOkay. Did he do any type of motions with that or non-motions with that, or did it \u2014 was it still, or just like this, or how?\u201d I assume he was making some kind of gesture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-13\"><em>A. </em>He just left his hand down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-14\"><em>Q. </em>And then your answer was, \u201cJust kept it in there\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-15\"><em>A. </em>He just kept it in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-16\"><em>Q. </em>So basically Mr. Hudson, throughout this episode, at least up until the time that he grabbed the lottery tickets, merely kept his left hand in his pocket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-17\">A In his pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-18\"><em>Q. </em>And he didn\u2019t really do anything else with it other than just placing it there, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>A. </em>Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\"><em>Q. </em>When you were aware of his hand in his pocket, that drew your attention to Mr. Hudson, didn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\"><em>Q. </em>And so you observed Mr. Hudson and continued to watch him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">On redirect examination, the victim testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\"><em>Q. </em>You also went further in that preliminary examination and answered some questions to the Court.

In other words, I dissent because I believe that the victim testified about \u201csome objective evidence\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> regarding the existence of a weapon or an article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>used or fashioned \u201c \u2018in a manner to lead [her] to reasonably believe it to be a dangerous weapon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shipp, Jury, supra. </em>I also disagree that our decision in <em>People v Jolly, </em>442 Mich 458, 468; 502 NW2d 177 (1993), \u201cconstitutes the absolute minimum level of evidence sufficient to support an armed robbery conviction . . . .\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Defendant contends that the announcing of a robbery does not constitute an illegal act which places another in reasonable fear of an immediate battery, i.e., the announcement itself does not equate to an assault. However, there was more than a mere announcement. Defendant and his accomplice were flanked on either side of the victim \u2014 with defendant in front of the victim and his accomplice at her side. For all practical purposes, the victim was cornered behind the counter. Codefendant proceeded to announce that she was being robbed. At the same time, codefendant had his hand in his pocket, moving it around in a circular motion. He then demanded that she open the cash register and set its drawer on the counter top. Codefendant had not removed his hand from his pocket. Rather, he moved it around and did not take it out while the victim followed his instructions in collecting the money. Codefendant removed his hand from his pocket only after the victim handed over the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Consequently, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the people, I conclude that any reasonable person in the victim\u2019s position could have concluded that failure to comply could have resulted in personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Notwithstanding, defendant asserts that the people failed to establish that defendant and his accomplice were armed as intended by the Legislature under MCL 750.529; MSA 28.797.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Saenz, </em>411 Mich 454; 307 NW2d 675 (1981), is directly on point. In <em>Saenz, </em>this Court noted that the armed robbery statute requires that the robber be \u201carmed with a dangerous weapon, or any article used or fashioned in a manner to lead the victim to reasonably believe it to be a dangerous weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455-456. The <em>Saenz </em>Court recognized that \u201ctestimony that defendant used his hand and a covering so as to resemble a gun raises a factual question for the jury\u2019s consideration . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Id. </em>at 458. However, where the victim testifies \u201cthat he neither saw a bulge <em>or hand underneath the defendant\u2019s coat </em>nor was he told by the defendant that he had a weapon,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> this Court concluded that the victim\u2019s belief that the defendant was armed was completely subjective and, thus, unacceptable for consideration by the jury. The <em>Saenz </em>Court stated that pursuant to the plain language of the statute, it was not enough for the victim merely to believe that his assailant was armed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>belief had to have been induced by the use or fashion of \u201cany article\u201d with which the assailant was armed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In <em>Jolly, supra, </em>this Court revisited the issue what satisfies the armed element of armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">When questioned by the people regarding his conclusion that his assailant was armed, the victim in <em>Jolly </em>testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">Well, there was like when he came in he was standing right in front of me. I saw a bulge in his mid, mid area of his \u2014 he had a vest on, I saw a bulge. I didn\u2019t know if it was a gun or not. She said that he had a gun and I assumed because there was a bulge it could have been a buckle or anything, and I didn\u2019t know. <em>[Id. </em>at 463.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">On the basis of this testimony, we affirmed the defendant\u2019s armed robbery conviction because the existence of a bulge in the perpetrator\u2019s jacket \u201cobjectively supported submission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471. However, we also expressly recognized the precedent set in <em>People v Parker, </em>417 Mich 556; 339 NW2d 455 (1983), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-10\">A fair reading of <em>Parker </em>does not require submission of a dangerous weapon or other article into evidence, nor does it require that a witness see the make or model number of a gun or knife before the issue can be submitted to the jury. What cannot reach the jury is proof that only focuses on the subjective belief of the victim. In other words, <em>there must be some objective evidence of the existence of a weapon or article before a jury will be permitted to assess </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>the merits of an armed robbery charge. </em>For example, an object pointing out from under a coat, together with statements threatening a victim with being shot, <em>clearly satisfies </em>the statutory definition of armed robbery. In such a case, there is evidence of actual possession of a weapon or article and the testimony regarding statements that, if believed, make clear an intent to convince the victim of the existence of such a weapon or article. The facts in <em>Parker </em>indicate that the victim never saw anything that could have been the knife with which she was being threatened! <em>[Jolly, supra </em>at 468-469 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">I agree with the majority that the armed element of armed robbery is not satisfied by proffering, without more, that the victim believed that the defendant was armed. However, I disagree that the assailant\u2019s verbal threats that he \u201cwould shoot the victim if he did not comply and the victim\u2019s observation of a bulge under the male robber\u2019s vest . . . constitutes the absolute minimum level of evidence sufficient to support an armed robbery conviction . . . .\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 475. To the contrary, in <em>Jolly, supra </em>at 469-470, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\"><em>The typical armed robbery case prosecuted under the feigned weapon method involves either </em>the use of a toy gun or a finger or other object hidden in a bag or under a coat to simulate the appearance of a weapon together with threatening behavior and statements indicating the existence of a weapon. The existence of some object, <em>whether actually seen or obscured by clothing </em>or something such as a paper bag, <em>is objective evidence that a defendant possesses a dangerous weapon or an article used or fashioned to look like one. Related threats, whether verbal or gesticulatory, further support the existence of a weapon or article. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">On this basis, in the instant case, the people must demonstrate that codefendant did more than merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>keep his hands concealed. However, this Court has never held that. the victim must have observed a \u201cbulge\u201d or that the assailant must have threatened to injure the victim if he did not comply. Instead, the people merely need to present \u201cobjective evidence that a defendant possesses a dangerous weapon or article used or fashioned to look like one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Stated otherwise, the people must present proof of \u201c[t]he existence of some object, whether actually seen or obscured by clothing . . . [that] simulate [s] the appearance of a weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cRelated threats, whether verbal or gesticulatory, <em>further </em>support the existence of a weapon or article.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). But, we have never ruled that threats are essential to sustain a conviction for armed robbery. The majority mischaracterizes the extent of the rule of law set forth in <em>Jolly, supra. </em>The majority takes our application of the law in <em>Jolly </em>and holds that this \u201cconstitutes the absolute minimum level of evidence sufficient to support an armed robbery conviction . . . .\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 475. <em>Jolly </em>does not stand for that proposition. In <em>Jolly, </em>we explicitly held that \u201c[wjords <em>or </em>threats <em>may </em>be evidence of the fact of being armed <em>and </em>under some circumstances <em>they alone might support a verdict of guilty.\u201d Id. </em>at 468 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Therefore, with this in mind, the dispositive question in this case is whether the victim testified regarding \u201csome objective evidence of the existence of a weapon or article before [the] jury [could] be permitted to assess the merits of [the] armed robbery charge.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">On the basis of the record presented, I am persuaded that the victim testified about \u201csome objective evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On cross-examination, when asked whether codefendant did \u201canything with his hand or with his jacket,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the victim answered that he \u201cLj]ust kind of moved it around a little bit.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 478. Later, when defense counsel attempted to clarify his point regarding whether defendant did anything else, the victim responded that he \u201c[j]ust kept moving whatever he had in his pocket around.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The victim added that she did not ask what was in codefendant\u2019s pocket. <em>Id. </em>I note that she need not make such an inquiry. Under the armed robbery statute, the victim was not required to ask, or test for that matter, whether defendant was bluffing. The victim need only have been \u201clead\u201d by defendant with respect to whatever may be in defendant\u2019s pocket so that she could have \u201creasonably believe [d] it to be a dangerous weapon.\u201d See MCL 750.529; MSA 28.797. Furthermore, the victim answered a resounding \u201cNo!\u201d when asked about \u201cthe prior two occasions when [defendant] came in the store [and whether] he ever ha[d] his hand in his pocket,\u201d making it even easier to conclude, viewing the \u201cevidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the victim reasonably believed that codefendant did not have good intentions when he came into the store a third time, \u201cnever [taking] his hand out of [his] pocket the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>time [the victim] was getting the cash out\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the register.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Because of \u201cwhat [the victim] saw that day <em>and the actions that he made,\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>I find that the record evidences that the victim\u2019s testimony was sufficient to meet the minimum threshold requirement espoused by this Court in <em>Jolly, supra </em>at 468, i.e., that \u201cthere must be some objective evidence of the existence of a weapon or article before a jury will be permitted to assess the merits of an armed robbery charge.\u201d As such, the matter was properly presented to the jury.</p>\n<judges id=\"b738-6\">Boyle and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\"> See <em>People v Hampton, </em>407 Mich 354; 285 NW2d 284 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b731-9\"> <em>People v Jolly, </em>442 Mich 458, 468; 502 NW2d 177 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b733-6\"> <em>Jolly, supra </em>at 469 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\"> In <em>Jolly, supra </em>at 468, quoting <em>People v Parker, </em>417 Mich 556, 565; 339 NW2d 455 (1983), this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">\u201cWords or threats alone can never be dangerous weapons because the statute is concerned with weapons, not words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">\u201cTo convict, the factfinder must make the determination that at the time of the robbery the assailant was in fact armed with something and not just that the victim thought he was armed.
