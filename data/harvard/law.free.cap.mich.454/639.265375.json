We hold that Michigan does not recognize a caus\u00e9 of action for the loss of an opportunity to avoid physical harm less than death. We also hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that plaintiffs complaint was inadequately specific and in refusing to allow plaintiff to amend her complaint. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">In early October 1990, plaintiff Kimberly Weymers, who was twenty years old, became ill with coughing, fever, nausea, aching, and chest congestion. After her condition did not improve for more than a week, she went to defendant Walled Lake Medical Center where she was initially examined by a physician\u2019s assistant. The physician\u2019s assistant concluded from plaintiff\u2019s symptoms that she suffered from a respiratory infection and gave her antibiotics. After another week, plaintiff returned to the medical center because her symptoms intensified. The physician\u2019s assistant diag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>nosed plaintiff with pneumonia and sent her home with a stronger prescription of antibiotics. On October 23, 1990, plaintiff visited the medical center a third time because her condition had not improved. A blood sample indicated that plaintiff suffered from severe anemia. Defendant Dr. Frank Fenton, the owner of the medical center, arranged for plaintiff to be admitted to defendant St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Pontiac.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">On the evening of October 23, 1990, plaintiff was admitted to St. Joseph\u2019s intensive care unit and was given blood transfusions to combat the anemia. On October 24, 1990, defendant Dr. Rheka Khera examined plaintiff and suspected the possibility of a kidney problem and asked defendant Dr. Gregorio Ferrer, a nephrologist,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to examine her. Dr. Ferrer examined her that day and concluded that she could have a rare disease, Goodpasture\u2019s syndrome.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He began an immunosuppressive therapy<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> immediately, and scheduled a kidney biopsy for October 25, 1990. Plaintiff initially responded to the treatment, but soon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>after her condition began to deteriorate. Plaintiffs biopsy was postponed until October 26, 1990, and she was placed on a respirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">On October 26, 1990, plaintiff was transferred to William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak and placed under the care of Dr. Isam Salah. At the time, plaintiff had only ten to fifteen percent of her kidney functions. The biopsy was delayed for another three days. The hospital performed a plasma exchange, but it failed to save plaintiffs kidney functioning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff was placed on dialysis after her kidneys totally failed and eventually underwent a kidney transplant.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">On August 16, 1991, plaintiff filed this medical malpractice suit against defendants Drs. Khera, Ferrer, and Fenton, and against Walled Lake Medical Center and St. Joseph Mercy Hospital. During discovery, plaintiff presented an affidavit by expert witness Dr. Eric Neilson, Chief of the Renal Division of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital, who testified that if defendants had given plaintiff proper care she would have had a thirty to forty percent chance of retaining the functioning of her kidneys. Dr. Neilson noted that plaintiffs life expectancy had been \u201csignificantly shortened\u201d as a consequence of the loss of her kidneys, and that she would ultimately suffer a premature death.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After discovery was closed, St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital moved for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10), arguing that plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that the alleged negligence caused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>loss of her kidneys.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The other defendants joined the motion. In response to defendants\u2019 motion, plaintiff asserted that she could recover for her kidney damage even though there was less than a fifty percent chance that defendants\u2019 negligence caused the damage on the basis of the lost opportunity doctrine recognized in <em>Falcon v Memorial Hosp, </em>436 Mich 443; 462 NW2d 44 (1990). Plaintiff also argued that her damages were not limited to the loss of her kidneys, but also included pain and suffering from her pulmonary injury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defendants responded that plaintiff had failed to allege damages from her pulmonary injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The trial court agreed with defendants and granted their motion for summary disposition. The trial court noted that plaintiff had failed to show that it was more probable than not that her kidney failure was caused by defendants\u2019 alleged negligence, and refused to extend the lost opportunity doctrine recognized in <em>Falcon, </em>a wrongful death case, to situations in which the injury did not result in death. The trial court further held that plaintiff\u2019s claim of pulmonary injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>was not sufficiently pleaded in her complaint. Plaintiff subsequently asked the trial court to allow her to amend her complaint to specifically allege pain and suffering from her pulmonary condition. The trial court denied this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Plaintiff appealed in the Court of Appeals, which reversed the decision of the trial court, holding that the lost opportunity doctrine applied to physical injury less than death. 210 Mich App 231, 236-237; 533 NW2d 334 (1995). The Court of Appeals also held that the trial court abused its discretion in not allowing plaintiff to amend her complaint because defendants were on notice of plaintiffs claim of pulmonary injury and therefore would not have been \u201cunduly prejudiced\u201d by the amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Defendant Drs. Khera and Ferrer appealed, and this Court granted leave to appeal on May 22, 1996.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">I. LOST OPPORTUNITY DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"ACAS\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Defendants brought their summary disposition motion pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10). Under that subsection, summary disposition is proper when \u201c[e]xcfept as to the amount of damages, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment or partial judgment as a matter of law.\u201d In other words, the \u201ccourt must be satisfied . . . that \u2018it is impossible for the claim or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>defense to be supported at trial because of some deficiency which cannot be overcome.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stevens v McLouth Steel Products Corp, </em>433 Mich 365, 370; 446 NW2d 95 (1989), quoting <em>Rizzo v Kretschmer, </em>389 Mich 363, 372; 207 NW2d 316 (1973). In making that determination, the court considers affidavits, pleadings, depositions, admissions, and documentary evidence filed by the parties in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Quinto v Cross &amp; Peters Co, </em>451 Mich 358, 362; 547 NW2d 314 (1996). We review summary disposition decisions de novo. <em>Groncki v Detroit Edison Co, </em>453 Mich 644, 649; 557 NW2d 289 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">We address whether the Court of Appeals erred in recognizing a cause of action for the loss of an opportunity to avoid physical harm less than death.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Under Michigan medical malpractice law, as part of its prima facie case, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant\u2019s negligence proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. MCL 600.2912a; MSA 27A.2912(1); <em>Locke v Pachtman, </em>446 Mich 216, 222; 521 NW2d 786 (1994). To establish proximate cause, the plaintiff must prove the existence of both cause in fact and legal cause. <em>Skinner v Square D Co, </em>445 Mich 153, 162-163; 516 NW2d 475 (1994). To establish cause in fact,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-8\">the plaintiff must present substantial evidence from which a jury may conclude that more likely than not)[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] but for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>defendant\u2019s conduct, the plaintiff\u2019s injuries would not have occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff must introduce evidence which affords a reasonable basis for the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a cause in fact of the result. A mere possibility of such causation is not enough; and when the matter remains one of pure speculation or conjecture, or the probabilities are at best evenly balanced, it becomes the duty of the court to direct a verdict for the defendant.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 164-165, quoting Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 41, p 269.][<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">To establish legal cause, the plaintiff must show that it was foreseeable that the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cmay create a risk of harm to the victim, and . . . [that] the result of that conduct and intervening causes were foreseeable.\u201d <em>Moning v Alfono, </em>400 Mich 425, 439; 254 NW2d 759 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The antithesis of proximate cause is the doctrine of lost opportunity. The lost opportunity doctrine allows a plaintiff to recover when the defendant\u2019s negligence possibly, i.e., a probability of fifty percent or less, caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See Reisig, <em>The loss of a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number><em>chance theory in medical malpractice cases: An overview, </em>13 Am J Trial Advocacy 1163 (1990). In <em>Falcon, supra </em>at 469-470 (Levin, J., lead opinion), 472-473 (Boyle, J., concurring), this Court adopted the lost opportunity doctrine in wrongful death cases. Our Legislature immediately rejected <em>Falcon </em>and the lost opportunity doctrine. MCL 600.2912a(2); MSA 27A.2912(1)(2).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, <em>Falcon </em>only applies to causes of action that arose before October 1, 1993. See 1993 PA 78, subsection 4(1) (providing the effective date of the amendment). We do not address the issue raised in <em>Falcon </em>because it is not now before this Court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, for the reasons that follow, we refuse to extend <em>Falcon. </em>Specifically, we hold that no cause of action exists for the loss of an opportunity to avoid physical harm less than death.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">There are three alternative approaches to the lost opportunity doctrine: (1) the pure lost chance approach, (2) the proportional approach, and (3) the substantial possibility approach. Each approach lowers the standard of causation, with the effect that a plaintiff is allowed to recover without establishing cause in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The pure lost chance approach allows a plaintiff to recover for his injury even 'though it was more likely than not that he would have suffered the injury if the defendant had not been negligent. See <em>Thompson v Sun City Community Hosp, </em>141 Ariz 597; 688 P2d 605 (1984). The plaintiff only has to show that the defendant\u2019s negligence decreased the plaintiff\u2019s chance, no matter how slight, of avoiding the injury. <em>Id. </em>If the plaintiff makes such a showing, he receives full damages.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">The proportional approach is identical to the pure lost chance approach; however, the plaintiff\u2019s recovery is limited to the percent of chance lost multiplied by the total amount of damages that would ordinarily be recovered in that action. <em>McKellips v St Francis Hosp, Inc, </em>741 P2d 467, 476 (Okla, 1987). For example,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>if a patient had forty percent chance of recovering from breast cancer and a negligent physician\u2019s misdiagnosis results in her chances dropping to ten percent, then the plaintiff can recover thirty percent of her total death-related injuries. Thus, if her damages totaled $100,000, the plaintiff could recover $30,000. [Moore, <em>South Carolina rejects the lost-chance doctrine, </em>48 SC L R 201, 202 (1996).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">The last approach, the substantial possibility-approach, was adopted by this Court in <em>Falcon </em>for wrongful death cases. It also is a variation of the pure lost chance approach. Under this approach, the plaintiff must show that there is a substantial possibility that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused his injury. See <em>Falcon, supra </em>at 469. It is unclear what constitutes a \u201csubstantial possibility.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 470 (holding that a 37.5 percent chance of survival was substantial, but refusing to state what constitutes a threshold showing of substantial). It is clear, however, that it does not have to be more than fifty percent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Thus, the substantial possibility approach is identical to the other approaches to the extent that each approach allows a plaintiff to recover for his injury even though it was more likely than not that he would have suffered the injury if the defendant had not been negligent.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Turning to the case now before this Court, the Court of Appeals, relying on the substantial possibility approach, extended the lost opportunity doctrine to the loss of a substantial opportunity to avoid any physical harm. The Court justified its decision on the often proffered reason of deterrence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-5\">If the lost opportunity doctrine is limited to cases only involving death, potentially flagrant examples of malpractice could go uncompensated in cases in which the same negligent failure to diagnose or treat results in a lost opportunity to avoid egregious harm, i.e., paralysis or coma. Thus, the deterrent and loss-allocation functions of tort law would be undermined if defendants could escape liability for the effects of negligent conduct that cause demonstrable losses. [210 Mich App 237.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">We acknowledge that the deterrent and loss-allocation functions of tort law are important.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>ever, we reject scrapping causation (the bedrock of our tort law) in negligence cases where the injury alleged by the plaintiff is something less than death, for the lost opportunity doctrine\u2019s deterrent effect. As the Texas Supreme Court succinctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-5\">[W]e reject the notion that the enhanced deterrence of the loss of chance approach might be so valuable as to justify scrapping our traditional concepts of causation. If deterrence were the sole value to be served by tort law, we could dispense with the notion of causation altogether and award damages on the basis of negligence alone. <em>[Kramer v Lewisville Memorial Hosp, </em>858 SW2d 397, 406 (Tex, 1993).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Furthermore, the South Carolina Supreme Court reflects our sentiments in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-7\">We are persuaded that \u201cthe loss of chance doctrine is fundamentally at odds with the requisite degree of medical certitude necessary to establish a causal link between the injury of a patient and the tortious conduct of a physician.\u201d Legal responsibility in this approach is in reality assigned based on the mere <em>possibility </em>that a tortfeasor\u2019s negligence was a cause of the ultimate harm. This formula is contrary to the most basic standards of proof which undergird the tort system. <em>[Jones v Owings, </em>318 SC 72, 77; 456 SE2d 371 (1995) (emphasis in original, citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Accordingly, because we refuse to discard causation in negligence actions of this kind, we do not recognize a cause of action for the loss of an opportunity to avoid physical harm less than death. Therefore, the Court of Appeals recognition of such a cause of action was in error and is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>H. SPECIFICITY AND AMENDMENT OF PLEADING</p>\n<p id=\"AGaM\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Decisions concerning the meaning and scope of pleading, and decisions granting or denying motions to amend pleadings, are within the sound discretion of the trial court and reversal is only appropriate when the trial court abuses that discretion. <em>Dacon v Transue, </em>441 Mich 315, 328; 490 NW2d 369 (1992); <em>Ben P Fyke &amp; Sons v Gunter Co, </em>390 Mich 649, 658; 213 NW2d 134 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">We first address whether the trial court abused its discretion in holding that plaintiffs complaint did not sufficiently plead a claim for pain and suffering from her pulmonary injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">MCR 2.111(B)(1) requires that a complaint be specific enough to reasonably inform the adverse party of the nature of the claims against him. This Court, in <em>Dacon, supra </em>at 329, explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-8\">[t]Ms rule is designed to avoid two opposite, but equivalent, evils. At one extreme lies the straightjacket of ancient forms of action. Courts would summarily dismiss suits when plaintiffs could not fit the facts into these abstract conceptual packages. At the other extreme lies ambiguous and uninformative pleading. Leaving a defendant to guess upon what grounds plaintiff believes recovery is justified violates basic notions of fair play and substantial justice. Extreme formalism and extreme ambiguity interfere equivalently with the ability of the judicial system to resolve a dispute on the merits. The former leads to dismissal of potentially meritorious claims while the latter undermines a defendant\u2019s opportunity to present a defense. . . . Neither is acceptable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>In medical malpractice actions, a plaintiff must allege, with reasonable definiteness and certainty, every fact necessary to constitute a cause of action. <em>Dacon, supra </em>at 332-333; <em>Simonelli v Cassidy, </em>336 Mich 635, 644; 59 NW2d 28 (1953). To establish medical malpractice, a plaintiff must establish the following elements: (1) the applicable standard of care, (2) breach of that standard, (3) injury, and (4) proximate causation between the alleged breach and the injury. <em>Locke, supra </em>at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Turning to the case before this Court, plaintiff argues that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that her complaint did not sufficiently plead a claim for pain and suffering from her pulmonary injury. We disagree and hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Plaintiffs first amended complaint was not specific enough to reasonably inform defendants of a claim for pulmonary injury. Paragraph 29, the section of plaintiffs complaint addressing the proximate cause and injury elements of plaintiff\u2019s malpractice claim, did not mention pulmonary injury. Rather, it only addressed the injury of plaintiff\u2019s kidneys:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-8\">As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts of negligence and malpractice as described in paragraphs 26 and 28, Plaintiff, Kimberly Weymers, has suffered and continues to suffer severe and grievous injuries and damages, including, but not limited to, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-9\">A. Significant medical expenses, past, present and future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-10\">B. Loss of earnings and earning capacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-11\">C. Severe physical and mental pain and suffering, anxiety, emotional anguish, embarrassment, humiliation and loss of natural enjoyments of life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>D. <em>Permanent loss of all renalp[</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em>] function requiring periodic and frequent </em>dialysis.[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">We are not persuaded by plaintiffs argument that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to recognize that plaintiffs general allegation of pain and suffering encompassed her claim for pulmonary injury. A plaintiff in a malpractice action cannot make a general allegation of pain and suffering and expect the defendant to determine without any guidance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>from the plaintiff which injury formed the basis of the pain and suffering. See <em>Dacon, supra </em>at 330 (concluding that pleadings that \u201calleg[e] everything . . . allege [] nothing [and] . . . are not proper under MCR 2.111\u201d). Moreover, unlike plaintiffs claim for pulmonary injury, defendants were on notice of plaintiffs claim for pain and suffering resulting from her kidney failure because plaintiff specifically alleged in paragraph 29 of her complaint that she suffered injury to her kidneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The only arguable mention of pulmonary injury in plaintiffs complaint was in the sections addressing defendants Dr. Khera\u2019s and Walled Lake Medical Center\u2019s alleged breach of the standard of care:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-6\">Failure [of Dr. Khera] to obtain appropriate consultations in a timely manner, including a nephrology consult and a pulmonary consult. [\u00b6 32.][<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-7\">Failure [of Walled Lake Medical Center] to refer Kimberly Weymers for appropriate consultation in light of her presenting [sic] history, signs and symptoms, including a consultation with an internist, pulmonologist or nephrologist. [\u00b6 28.][<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that this hint of pulmonary injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>was insufficient to put defendants on notice.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, the trial court\u2019s determination that plaintiff\u2019s claim for pulmonary injury was not sufficiently pleaded' was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">We next address whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow plaintiff to amend her complaint to include a claim for pain and suffering from her pulmonary injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">If a court grants summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(8), (9), or (10), the court must give the parties an opportunity to amend their pleadings pursuant to MCR 2.118, unless the amendment would be futile. MCR 2.116(I)(5). MCR 2.118(A)(2) provides that leave to amend a pleading \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Under subrule A(3), the court can order the amending party to compensate the opposing party for the additional expense caused by the late amendment, including reasonable attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">A motion to amend ordinarily should be granted, and should be denied only for the following particularized reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-9\">\u201c[1] undue delay, [2] bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, [3] repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, [4] undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, [and 5] futility . . . .\u201d <em>[Fyke, supra </em>at 656.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>If a trial court denies a motion to amend, it should specifically state on the record the reasons for its decision. <em>Id. </em>at 656-657.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Delay, alone, does not warrant denial of a motion to amend. <em>Fyke, supra </em>at 663-664. However, a court may deny a motion to amend if the delay was in bad faith or if the opposing party suffered actual prejudice as a result. <em>Id. </em>\u201cPrejudice\u201d in this context does not mean that the allowance of the proffered amendment may cause the opposing party to ultimately lose on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 657. Rather, \u201cprejudice\u201d exists if the amendment would prevent the opposing party from receiving a fair trial, if for example, the opposing party would not be able to properly contest the matter raised in the amendment because important witnesses have died or necessary evidence has been destroyed or lost. <em>Id. </em>at 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">In <em>Fyke, </em>we suggested that there may be some cases in which the delay is so long and the amendment so substantial that the opposing party would be denied a fair trial by the delay, and therefore be prejudiced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-7\">The litigation may proceed to a point where the opposing party cannot reasonably be expected to defend against the amendment; this is an especially pertinent factor on the eve of, during, or after trial. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">We reaffirm this principle, but clarify its application. We hold that a trial court may find prejudice when the moving party seeks to add a new claim or a new theory of recovery on the basis of the same set of facts, after discovery is closed, just before trial, and the opposing party shows that he did not have reasonable notice, from any source, that the moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>party would rely on the new claim or theory at trial.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We recognize that parties ought to be afforded great latitude in amending their pleading before trial, however, that interest must be weighed against the parties\u2019 and the public\u2019s interest in the speedy resolution of disputes. As Judge John L. Coffey of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-4\">While Fed R Civ P 15[<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>) favors amendments when required by justice, it is not a license for carelessness or gamesmanship. Parties to litigation have an interest in speedy resolution of their disputes without undue expense. Substantive amendments to the complaint just before trial are not to be countenanced and only serve to defeat these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>interests. The district court must consider the harm when deciding whether to grant leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-5\">Defense of a new claim obviously will require additional rounds of discovery, in all probability interview of new witnesses, gathering of further evidence, and the identification of appropriate legal arguments. All this necessarily takes time. The parties must have an opportunity for preparation if trial is to be meaningful and clear. Some delay of trial therefore is inevitable \u2014 a natural consequence of allowing claims to be brought at all. In this sense, delay alone is not a sufficient basis for refusing an amendment. On the other hand, amendments near the time set for trial may require postponement when the same allegations made earlier would have afforded ample time to prepare without delay. Plaintiff is not entitled to impede justice by imposing even reasonable preparation intervals <em>seriatim. </em>Cf. <em>Ins v Abudu, </em>[485 US 94, 95] 108 S Ct 904, 913; 99 L Ed 2d 90 (1988) (\u201cstrong public interest in bringing litigation to a close as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving the adversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present their respective cases\u201d).

The trial court denied plaintiffs motion, focusing on the length of the delay and on defendants\u2019 lack of notice of plaintiff\u2019s new claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-10\">The Court is satisfied that this is a 1991 case. The Defendants did not have notice that the general damage element of pain and suffering was specific to the damages arising out of pulmonary pathology. Defendants prepared for trial and the Defendants prepared for mediation, the Court is satisfied, due to the loss of renal function. And despite the Plaintiffs contentions, the Court\u2019s [sic] satisfied that the Motion for Amendment of the Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, should be denied, and I do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court, holding that it abused its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>denying plaintiffs motion to amend because the evidence established that defendants \u201chad notice of potential pulmonary complications and thus would not have been unduly prejudiced . . . 210 Mich App 241. In doing so, the Court of Appeals rejected defendants\u2019 argument that plaintiff\u2019s amendment sought to add a new theory to the case. <em>Id. </em>at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Contrary to the Court of Appeals assertion, we hold that plaintiff\u2019s amendment did seek to introduce a new theory or claim into the case and that defendants did not have reasonable notice that plaintiff would rely on that new theory at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Plaintiff argues that her amendment sought to change the type of damages sought, not add a different claim or theory to the case, and that, therefore, on the basis of <em>Sherrard v Stevens, </em>176 Mich App 650, 654; 440 NW2d 2 (1988), she was entitled to the amendment. In <em>Sherrard, supra </em>at 655, the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-7\">While we note that the amendment came shortly before trial, we also note that the amendment did not raise new factual allegations, but merely claimed new types of damages arising from the same set of factual allegations. Accordingly, we do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the motion to amend the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument is unpersuasive because her case is distinguishable from <em>Sherrard. </em>In <em>Sherrard, </em>the plaintiffs sought to amend their legal malpractice complaint to add a prayer for exemplary damages. Plaintiff Weymers, on the other hand, sought to amend her complaint to change the type of injury she claimed was proximately caused by defendants\u2019 negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>gence.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Therefore, plaintiffs amendment is more appropriately characterized as raising a new claim or theory, not a new type of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Plaintiffs argument that defendants had reasonable notice of her pulmonary claim is also unpersuasive. Although deposition testimony,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> medical records,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>and the mediation summary<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> suggested that defendants had knowledge that Goodpasture\u2019s syndrome causes pulmonary injury and that plaintiff suffered such injury, defendants had no notice that plaintiff was intending to assert a claim for pulmonary injury at trial.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This distinction is significant. If defendants had no notice that plaintiff was intending to assert an independent claim for pulmonary injury, the brief mention of pulmonary injury during the discovery process cannot reasonably be said to automatically make its later appearance as a claim nonprejudicial against defendants. Given the wide latitude of the discovery rules, see MCR 2.302(B), as far as defendants were concerned, the sporadic mention of pulmonary injury during discovery could have been simply fortuitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Plaintiff also relies on <em>Terhaar v Hoekwater, </em>182 Mich App 747, 752; 452 NW2d 905 (1990), in support of her contention that defendants had reasonable notice of her claim for pulmonary injury. Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Terhaar </em>is misguided because in <em>Terhaar, </em>unlike the case now before us, the plaintiff not only investigated and pursued her new theory during dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>covery, she also notified the defendant during discovery that she would pursue that theory at trial.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs motion to amend because the amendment sought to introduce a new claim just before trial, after discovery had closed, and defendants demonstrated that they did not have knowledge that plaintiff was intending to rely on the new claim at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">We conclude that Michigan does not recognize a cause of action for the loss of an opportunity to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>physical harm less than death. Thus, the trial court properly granted defendants\u2019 summary disposition motion. We further conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that plaintiff did not sufficiently plead a claim for pain and suffering from her pulmonary injury. The trial court also did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend her complaint to add a new claim for pulmonary injury.

Over the universe of such cases, losses of chances of avoiding both the adverse effects of a preexisting condition and the occurrence of future consequences of an injury represent actual losses. We can be statistically certain, for example, that a number of patients with probably (but not necessarily) fatal preexisting conditions would have achieved the hoped-for cure in the absence of the tortious conduct, even if none individually had a better-than-even chance of doing so.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint inadequately notified defendants that plaintiffs sought damages for pulmonary injuries. Moreover, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend because of its late date. However, I respectfully dissent with respect to part I of the majority opinion. I would recognize a cause of action for the loss of an opportunity to avoid physical harm less than death.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Generally, in an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden of proving four elements: (1) the applicable standard of care, (2) the defendant\u2019s breach of that standard, (3) an injury, and (4) proximate causation between the breach and the injury. MCL 600.2912a; MSA 27A.2912(1); <em>Locke v Pachtman, </em>446 Mich 216, 222; 521 NW2d 786 (1994). Proximate cause requires proof of two separate ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>ments: (1) cause in fact and (2) legal cause. <em>Skinner v Square D Co, </em>445 Mich 153, 162-163; 516 NW2d 475 (1994); <em>Moning v Alfono, </em>400 Mich 425, 437; 254 NW2d 759 (1977). Generally, to establish the cause-in-fact element, a plaintiff must show that, but for the defendant\u2019s action, the injury would not have occurred. <em>Skinner, supra </em>at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">The lost opportunity doctrine, adopted by this Court for wrongful death cases in <em>Falcon v Memorial </em>Hosp,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides an exception to the general rule of proving causation in medical malpractice actions. According to the doctrine, damages are recoverable for the lost opportunity to survive, even though the opportunity was less than fifty percent. <em>Id. </em>at 461 (Levin, J.). A plaintiff must show only that there is a substantial possibility that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused the injury. <em>Id. </em>at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Several reasons have been advanced for adoption of the doctrine. First, because medicine is an inexact science, questions regarding causation are not easily answered, especially where a physician\u2019s failure to act is alleged to be responsible for the harm. <em>Falcon, supra </em>at 455 (Levin, J.). Fundamental fairness dictates that the uncertainty be imposed on the tortfeasor, not on the patient. As one commentator has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-7\">But for the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct, it would not have been necessary to grapple with the imponderables of chance. Fate would have run its course. A defendant\u2019s tort not only destroys a \u201craffle ticket,\u201d in so doing it destroys any chance of ever knowing how that ticket would have fared in the drawing. [King, <em>Causation, valuation, and chance in personal injury torts involving preexisting con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>ditions and future consequences, </em>90 Yale L J 1353, 1378 (1981).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">Second, the doctor-patient relationship should be taken into account. Patients retain physicians not only to cure disease or heal injury, but also to maximize their chance of recovery and to assuage their pain and suffering. <em>Falcon, supra </em>at 459 (Levin, J.). The lost opportunity doctrine helps ensure that physicians are liable for negligence or gross negligence that deprives their patients of less than an even chance of obtaining a better result.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Third, as the Court of Appeals stated, where the chance of recovery is fifty percent or less, the traditional rule undermines the loss allocations and deterrent functions of tort law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-6\">If the lost opportunity doctrine is limited to cases only involving death, potentially flagrant examples of malpractice could go uncompensated in cases in which the same negligent failure to diagnose or treat results in a lost opportunity to avoid egregious harm, i.e., paralysis or coma. Thus, the deterrent and loss-allocation functions of tort law would be undermined if defendants could escape liability for the effects of negligent conduct that cause demonstrable losses. [210 Mich App 231, 237; 533 NW2d 334 (1995).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">It is of real concern that the application of traditional concepts of proximate cause may unjustly deny legal recourse to patients injured by a physician\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">The majority acknowledges the importance of the deterrent and loss-allocation functions of tort law. However, it refuses to jettison the element of causation in order to gain the lost opportunity\u2019s deterrent effect. In <em>Falcon, </em>Justice Levin remarked that causa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>tion principles are not discarded where the injury is viewed as the lost chance rather than the ultimate harm. A plaintiff must still establish more-probable-than-npt causation. It must be proven that, more probably than not, the defendant reduced the opportunity of avoiding harm. <em>Falcon, supra </em>at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The Ohio Supreme Court recently discarded what it proclaimed \u201cthe traditionally harsh view\u201d and adopted the loss-of-chance theory. <em>Roberts v Ohio Permanente Medical Group, Inc, </em>76 Ohio St 3d 483, 488; 668 NE2d 480 (1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-7\">A patient who seeks medical assistance from a professional caregiver has the right to expect proper care and should be compensated for any injury caused by the caregiver\u2019s negligence which has reduced his or her chance of survival. Over the years, medical technology has improved and advances have been made in the treatment of many areas of medicine, including cancer. However, these medical strides are meaningless unless early detection is practiced diligently by those in the health care field. Thus, a health care provider should not be insulated from liability where there is expert medical testimony showing that he or she reduced the patient\u2019s chances of survival. Unfortunately, under the traditional view, this is precisely the outcome. The innocent patient is the loser while the health care provider escapes liability despite his or her negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">The policy reasons behind the lost opportunity doctrine apply equally to fatal and nonfatal cases. Patients seek treatment from doctors for maladies other than potentially fatal diseases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In both fatal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>nonfatal cases, the patient seeks to improve the opportunity of \u201cavoiding, ameliorating, or reducing physical harm and pain and suffering.\u201d <em>Falcon, supra </em>at 461 (Levin, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">The majority fails to explain why the doctrine is proper if death occurs, but not if a lesser injury is involved. It cites Texas and South Carolina Supreme Court cases in support of the argument that traditional notions of causation should not be discarded. <em>Kramer v Lewisville Memorial Hosp, </em>858 SW2d 397 (Tex, 1993); <em>Jones v Owings, </em>318 SC 72; 456 SE2d 371 (1995). However, both cases focused on whether the lost opportunity doctrine should apply where death is the ultimate result. They did not discuss whether, once the lost opportunity doctrine applies, it should be limited to death cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Other jurisdictions have adopted a cause of action for the loss of an opportunity to avoid physical harm less than death. In <em>Aasheim v Humberger,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the plaintiff consulted medically with the defendant physician regarding problems in her left knee. The defendant failed to order x-rays. The plaintiff was diagnosed with chondromalacia. After the condition of her knee did not improve, she was referred to another physician for arthroscopic surgery. Preoperative x-ray films revealed a giant cell tumor in the left knee. Physicians had to remove the infection along with all the bone and soft tissue in the knee area. She was given a prosthetic knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>The plaintiff filed suit for failure to order diagnostic films. She alleged that the error caused her to lose the chance to have less radical surgery and preserve her natural knee. The Montana Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-6\">We feel that including \u201closs of chance\u201d within causality recognizes the realities inherent in medical negligence litigation. People who seek medical treatment are diseased or injured. Failure to diagnose or properly treat denies the opportunity to recover. Including this lost opportunity within the causality embrace gives recognition to a real loss consequence of medical failure. <em>[Aasheim, supra </em>at 133.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">In <em>Ehlinger v Sipes,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>parents brought an action against a physician for injuries arising from the premature birth of their twins. They alleged that failure to diagnose multiple pregnancies was a substantial factor causing the injuries. The physician argued that, to satisfy their burden on the causation issue, the plaintiffs had to show that, with proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment, more probably than not (1) the twins would not have suffered their injuries, or (2) the injuries would have been less severe. The Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected the argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-8\">We disagree that to establish causation the Ehlingers must show that proper diagnosis and treatment <em>would </em>have been successful. We conclude that in a case of this nature, where the causal relationship between the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence and the plaintiff\u2019s harm can only be inferred by surmising as to what the plaintiff\u2019s condition would have been had the defendant exercised ordinary care, to satisfy his or her burden of production on causa- \u2022 tion, the plaintiff need only show that the omitted treatment was intended to prevent the very type of harm which resulted, that the plaintiff would have submitted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>treatment, and that it is more probable than not the treatment <em>could </em>have lessened or avoided the plaintiff\u2019s injury had it been rendered. It then is for the trier of fact to determine whether the defendant\u2019s negligence was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff\u2019s harm. <em>[Id. </em>at 13-14 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">In <em>Delaney v Cade</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Kansas Supreme Court considered recognizing a cause of action for the loss of a chance of a better recovery as contrasted with the lost chance to survive. After reviewing the policy arguments relating to the lost chance doctrine, the court found that the lost chance of a better recovery stated a legitimate cause of action. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-7\">We have found no authority or rational argument which would apply the loss of chance theory solely to survival actions or to loss of a better recovery actions and not to both. As noted by plaintiff in her brief: \u201cThere is certainly nothing in that <em>[Roberson] </em>rationale to justify leaving the season open on persons who suffer paralysis, organ loss, or other serious injury short of death while protecting only those who do not survive the negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-8\">We acknowledge that the vast majority of cases we have reviewed involved death of the patient and a loss of chance of survival. We also recognize that the apportionment of damages may be more difficult in a loss of a better recovery case than in the cases resulting in death. However, the fact that most cases have involved death of the patient and that damages may be difficult to resolve in a loss of a better recovery case should not be grounds to refuse to recognize the doctrine when medical malpractice has substantially reduced a person\u2019s chance of a better recovery. <em>[Id. </em>at 210.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">The court acknowledged that several jurisdictions have refused to recognize the loss of chance doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>in either type of case. However, it found no jurisdiction which applied the theory in one type of case and denied it in the other. The court found that most jurisdictions, like Kansas, had simply not had occasion to address the doctrine in both situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">I agree with the reasoning of the Kansas Supreme Court. Considering the policy arguments underlying the lost opportunity doctrine, there is no rational basis for distinguishing between death cases and cases in which physician negligence has limited recovery. Consequently, I would extend the reasoning of our decision in <em>Falcon </em>to nonfatal cases.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-8\"><em> </em>436 Mich 443; 462 NW2d 44 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b920-9\"> In doing so, the Ohio court overruled its previous contrary position taken in <em>Cooper v Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, Inc, </em>27 Ohio St 2d 242; 272 NE2d 97 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b920-10\"> In <em>Aasheim v Humberger, </em>215 Mont 127; 695 P2d 824 (1985), the plaintiff alleged that the defendant\u2019s negligence resulted in the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>losing a chance at less radical surgery and a chance to preserve her natural knee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b921-9\"> <em>Aasheim, </em>n 3 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b922-9\"> 155 Wis 2d 1; 454 NW2d 754 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b923-10\"> 255 Kan 199; 873 P2d 175 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b924-5\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahf\">(dissenting). I agree with the analysis of the dissent that would recognize a cause of action for the loss of an opportunity to avoid physical harm less than death. However, I also dissent from part n of the majority opinion, which holds that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs motion to amend the complaint. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court on this issue, holding that it abused its discretion in denying the plaintiffs motion to amend her complaint to add an allegation of physical and mental pain and suffering from the aggravation of the pulmonary pathology.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">As the Court of Appeals so aptly stated in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-7\">Where a motion for summary disposition is grounded on MCR 2.116(C)(10), the trial court is required to give the parties an opportunity to amend their pleadings as provided by MCR 2.118, unless the amendment would be futile. MCR 2.118(A)(2) provides that leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires. The rules pertaining to the amendment of pleadings are designed to facilitate amendment except when prejudice to the opposing party would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>result Amendment is generally a matter of right rather than grace. A motion to amend ordinarily should be granted; denial should only be for particularized reasons, such as undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiency by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party, or futility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-4\">In this case, the trial court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-5\">\u201cThe Court is satisfied that this is a 1991 case. The Defendant did not have notice that the general damage element of pain and suffering was specific to the damages arising out of pulmonary pathology. Defendants prepared for trial and the Defendants prepared for mediation, the Court is satisfied, due to the loss of renal function. And despite the Plaintiffs contentions, the Court\u2019s satisfied that the . Motion for Amendment of the Complaint, Second Amended Complaint, should be denied, and I do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-6\">However, plaintiff stated in her mediation summary that her damages included the \u201cprobability that pulmonary damages would have been minimized such that mechanical ventilation and extensive respiratory therapy would not have been necessary.\u201d Plaintiff also alleged in both her original and first amended complaint that on October 23, 1990, she went to defendant Walled Lake Medical Center with a symptom, among others, of \u201cbloody sputum with cough,\u201d that she subsequently was admitted to defendant hospital and examined by defendant Khera, and that defendant Khera failed to obtain a timely pulmonary consultation. Defendants Khera and Ferrer both testified in their depositions that Goodpasture\u2019s Syndrome affects the lungs and that they observed plaintiff having pulmonary problems. Plaintiff was subsequently placed on a respirator. These facts indicate that defendants had notice of potential pulmonary complications and thus would not have been unduly prejudiced by allowing plaintiff to amend her complaint to allege that her damages included pain and suffering from pulmonary aggravation. Because the amendment would not have prejudiced defendants, the mere fact that this case originated in 1991 is an insufficient reason to deny leave to amend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Defendants argue that <em>Dacon v Transue, </em>441 Mich 315; 490 NW2d 369 (1992), is on point. In <em>Dacon, </em>our Supreme Court upheld the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend her complaint. However, in that case the plaintiff sought to add a new theory of medical malpractice. The plaintiff had alleged and developed the case on the theory that the defendants prescribed the wrong medicine, and not until trial did she seek to add a theory alleging that the defendants had negligently delayed treating and medicating her. However, <em>Dacon </em>is distinguishable. In this case, plaintiff sought the amendment before trial. Moreover, plaintiff\u2019s claim of pulmonary damage arises from her original theory that defendants negligently failed to timely diagnose or treat her Goodpasture\u2019s Syndrome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-4\">Thus, although allowing the amendment might have affected the result of the trial, it would not have denied defendants a fair trial. Accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion in denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend. We reverse the trial court\u2019s denial of plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend her complaint. On remand, the plaintiff is to be allowed to amend her complaint to add an allegation of pain and suffering relating to pulmonary damage.
