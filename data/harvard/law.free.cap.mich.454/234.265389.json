FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">The defendants each were convicted of three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>against their children.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They each were charged with four counts, but, just before trial, the prosecutor dismissed counts vn and vm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ms. Lemons was convicted of three counts of receiving cunnilingus, one count involving her son (Mr. Lemons\u2019 stepson), and the other two involving her stepdaughter (Mr. Lemons\u2019 younger daughter). Mr. Lemons was convicted of one count of fellatio with each victim and, on an aiding and abetting theory, of one count of cunnilingus performed by his daughter on his wife. The aggravating factor making the crime esc I was that both children were under the age of thirteen at the time of the events.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The testimony in this case came from the victims, as well as Mr. Lemons\u2019 older daughter. Mr. Lemons\u2019 younger daughter, who was eighteen at the time of trial, testified that the sexual abuse began in 1980 when she was five or six, before Ms. Lemons and her son moved in with Mr. Lemons and his daughters.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The witness testified that her father showed her a pic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ture of a woman \u201cperforming oral sex on a man\u201d in a magazine and convinced her to perform the act in the picture by telling her he was \u201clow on [his magic] power\u201d and would die if she did not.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mr. Lemons ordered her to continue, pushing her \u201chead down on him,\u201d even after she vomited.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The older sister, who was ten at the time of the incident, testified that her father had called her into the bedroom first and had shown her a picture of people having oral sex, which he said he needed for energy. When she refused, her father told her to go back to the living room and to send in her younger sister, which she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The evidence indicated that there were multiple acts of physical and sexual abuse of Mr. Lemons\u2019 younger daughter over a period of years from 1980 to 1988 when, at age thirteen, she ran away. She testified, without objection, that she performed \u201coral sex\u201d on both defendants and that she observed Ms. Lemons\u2019 son performing \u201coral sex\u201d on his mother and on Mr. Lemons.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She further testified about the cunnilingus, that Mr. Lemons ordered her to \u201cdo it to Mary,\u201d and that she put her face \u201cdown there [on Mary\u2019s] vagina.\u201d She also said it happened \u201c[n]ot very many\u201d other times. She testified with regard to Ms. Lemons\u2019 involvement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\"><em>Q. </em>... Do you think that [your step mother] did it because she wanted to, or was she forced?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>A. </em>When all this started it was all new to her. She never done anything like . . . that before. And then <em>at the beginning </em>he forced her, and it wasn\u2019t me. I wasn\u2019t the first one. [My stepbrother] was, for her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\"><em>Q. </em>All right. To perform oral sex on Mary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\"><em>A. </em>Exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\"><em>Q. </em>Okay Go ahead. Then what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\"><em>A. </em>Then, you know, I mean the first time, all she said was \u201cLue.\u201d <em>She didn\u2019t, she didn\u2019t object, she didn\u2019t try to stop it. And she slapped me. She was like provoking the situation. She was not trying to help me at all. She wasn\u2019t trying to stop it. She was making me do it. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">The only other incident involving Mr. Lemons\u2019 older daughter occurred some time after Ms. Lemons moved in. Ms. Lemons was sitting naked in the living room and Mr. Lemons attempted to coax his older daughter to \u201ctouch it.\u201d She refused and was never involved in subsequent acts of abuse. She ran away when she was sixteen because Mr. Lemons was beating her and the other children, making her fight Ms. Lemons with sticks, and ordering Ms. Lemons to beat her. There was evidence that Mr. Lemons beat Ms. Lemons on a number of occasions, once pushing her through a glass window, and that Ms. Lemons generally feared Mr. Lemons.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">Ms. Lemons\u2019 son, who was thirteen at the time of trial, testified that when he was five and thereafter, Mr. Lemons forced him to \u201csuck his penis\u201d more than once while Ms. Lemons was in the room and did not protest. Mr. Lemons also ordered him to \u201click [his] mother\u2019s vagina.\u201d Ms. Lemons\u2019 son also testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>his mother forced him to perform this act once when Mr. Lemons was not present. Ms. Lemons\u2019 son also performed oral sex on Mr. Lemons\u2019 younger daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Both children were sometimes involved with sex with the parents at the same time in the living room, which was used as the parents\u2019 bedroom. Both children observed the other performing sexual acts on their parents. Abuse of Ms. Lemons\u2019 son continued until 1991 when Protective Services intervened at the request of one of the older children; however, Ms. Lemons did not participate for two years in the abuse of her son because he would bite or pull away or \u201cwouldn\u2019t do it right.\u201d The evidence adduced at trial revealed no, repercussions against Ms. Lemons for her refusal to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Ms. Lemons and the children also testified that Mr. Lemons was an alcoholic who beat them all regularly. The parents forced the children to kneel on uncooked rice as a punishment, sometimes for hours. Mr. Lemons and Ms. Lemons disciplined the children by beating them over different parts of their bodies with \u201cMr. Butt Stick,\u201d a stick approximately eighteen inches long and 1.5 inches thick with a drawing of a face and the words \u201cButt Stick\u201d on it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The parents also admitted disciplining Ms. Lemons\u2019 son by locking him in the basement overnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The record indicates Ms. Lemons left the household with the children at least twice. She testified that she returned each time because she feared becoming a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>welfare mother. The record does not reveal that she suffered any repercussions for leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Mr. Lemons\u2019 older daughter testified that Mr. Lemons told them that he was a god, and that they were demons. He forbade them to attend church because they would only hear lies there. At trial, Mr. Lemons\u2019 younger daughter testified that Ms. Lemons\u2019 son wished Mr. Lemons and Ms. Lemons would die, but that she wanted them to live so they would suffer like they made her suffer because \u201cdeath is too good for them.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The defendants both testified and denied that any sexual abuse took place in their household. They accused the victims of fabricating the charges to get back at Mr. Lemons for being a strict disciplinarian. At the end of the trial, counsel for Ms. Lemons requested an instruction on duress. The trial judge refused to give the instruction because Ms. Lemons\u2019 testimony, consistent with her theory of the case, denied the acts ever occurred. Counsel also requested an instruction on CSC n<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> for the counts regarding cunnilingus by Mr. Lemons\u2019 daughter, arguing that the jury could construe the girl\u2019s testimony to establish either oral contact or facial contact.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>rejected the instruction as inconsistent with the evidence. Mr. Lemons expressly informed the court that he did not want any instructions on offenses other than esc I.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The jury convicted both defendants on all counts. Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court Judge A. George Best sentenced Ms. Lemons to one life term and two terms of 50 to 80 years\u2019 imprisonment. The judge sentenced Mr. Lemons to one life term and two terms of 60 to 90 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The Court of Appeals, in an unpublished per curiam opinion, reversed Ms. Lemons\u2019 convictions on the basis that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on duress and esc n. The Court affirmed Mr. Lemons\u2019 convictions, but reversed his two sentences of 60 to 90 years as excessive under <em>People v Moore, </em>432 Mich 311; 439 NW2d 684 (1989), in light of the defendant\u2019s age, despite its having concluded the sentences were proportionate. The prosecutor appealed, and we granted leave to appeal. 450 Mich 993 (1996). We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate Ms. Lemons\u2019 convictions and Mr. Lemons\u2019 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">n. <em>PEOPLE v MARY CARRY LEMONS</em></p>\n<p id=\"A73\">A. DURESS INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Ms. Lemons testified at trial and denied that any acts of sexual abuse took place in her household. On direct examination, the focus of her testimony was her relationship with her husband and its attendant physical abuse. She testified that throughout their relationship, which began in 1981 and resulted in a marriage in 1982, Mr. Lemons\u2019 behavior and alcohol abuse gradually worsened.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Ms. Lemons testified that the physical abuse began with grabbing and progressed to open-handed slapping and later full-fledged beating with fists.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> She also testified that she was forced or intimidated by Mr. Lemons to do things she did not want to do, including \u201cdisciplining] the kids right or . . . clean[ing] the house the way he wanted it, or it just didn\u2019t matter what.\u201d Mr. Lemons\u2019 \u201ctotal control\u201d resulted in physical bruises as well as fear of Mr. Lemons and low self-esteem. Ms. Lemons tried to leave at least twice, but she returned both times out of fear that she, as \u201ca worn out old lady with a bunch of' kids[,] . . . would end up being a welfare mom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">On cross-examination she testified specifically regarding the alleged sexual abuse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\"><em>Q. </em>Ma\u2019am, did you see Mr. Lemons involved in any type of sexual abuse with either [child]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\"><em>A. </em>No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\"><em>Q. </em>Never?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\"><em>A. </em>Never.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\"><em>Q. </em>You\u2019re going to tell this jury, ma\u2019am, that [your stepdaughter] sat up on that stand and lied?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">4. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\"><em>Q. </em>You\u2019re going to tell this jury, ma\u2019am, that you never forced [your stepdaughter] or sat there for [her] to put her face into your vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-14\"><em>A. </em>Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-15\"><em>Q. </em>She lied about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-16\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-17\"><em>Q. </em>You never forced [your son] to lick your vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>A. </em>I never did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\"><em>Q. </em>[He] never licked your vagina, ma\u2019am?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\"><em>A. </em>Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\"><em>Q. </em>There was no sexual abuse going on in that home at all; is that correct, ma\u2019am?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">The defendant requested a jury instruction on duress on the theory that the jury was free to disbelieve Ms. Lemons\u2019 testimony, credit the testimony of the prosecutor\u2019s witnesses, and find that Mr. Lemons forced Ms. Lemons to sexually abuse the children. The trial judge denied the request, ruling that Ms. Lemons\u2019 testimony was \u201cin direct conflict with what seems to be predicated in the CJI for using a duress defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">The Court of Appeals reversed, explaining its decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">[T]he trial court erred by refusing to give a requested jury instruction on duress where there was evidence to support the defense, and the trial court\u2019s refusal did not sufficiently protect her rights or present the issues to be tried. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-13\">Jury instructions must not exclude material issues, defenses, and theories if there is evidence to support them. . . . [Ms. Lemons] offered some evidence from which a jury could conclude that [Mr. Lemons\u2019] threatening conduct would cause in the mind of a reasonable person, and did cause in the mind of [Ms. Lemons], a fear of death or serious bodily harm; the fear or duress was operating on the mind of [Ms. Lemons] at the time of the alleged acts; and she committed the acts to avoid the threatened harm. [Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued May 26, 1995 (Docket Nos. 159598, 159599), slip op at 2-3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-15\">Judge Saad, dissenting, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>For the trial court to have instructed the jury that [Ms. Lemons] could be found not guilty of her participation in these disgusting crimes because she may have been \u201ccoerced\u201d or under \u201cduress,\u201d in light of the overwhelming evidence of her complicity and a total absence of testimony of duress, does violence to common sense. <em>[Id., </em>slip op at 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We agree. The right of defendants to raise inconsistent defenses, MCR 2.111(A)(2), is not unlimited. <em>People v Kirk, </em>151 Mich 253; 114 NW 1023 (1908). In <em>Kirk, </em>the trial court refused to instruct on intoxication as a defense to the specific-intent requirement of the crime charged where the defendant also argued self-defense. This Court stated that \u201cthe jury should have been instructed . . . [on intoxication] if there was testimony which would warrant a jury in saying that the intoxication of respondent was of a degree which rendered [the respondent] incapable of entertaining the intent charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258. However, the case was not reversed on these grounds because, as the defendant explains in her brief, the intoxication defense \u201cwas not sufficiently supported in the record of the <em>Kirk </em>case.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Duress is a common-law affirmative defense. MCR 2.111(F)(3)(a); <em>United States v Bailey, </em>444 US 394, 415; 100 S Ct 624; 62 L Ed 2d 575 (1980); 21 Am Jur 2d, Criminal Law, \u00a7 148, p 288; 22 CJS, Criminal Law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>\u00a7 52, p 64.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is applicable in situations where the crime committed avoids a greater harm. The reasons underlying its existence are easy to discern:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">The rationale of the defense of duress is that, for reasons of social policy, it is better that the defendant, faced with a choice of evils, choose to do the lesser evil (violate the criminal law) in order to avoid the greater evil threatened by the other person. [1 LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law, \u00a7 5.3, pp 614-615.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">In order to properly raise the defense, the defendant has the burden of producing \u201csome evidence from which the jury can conclude that the essential elements of duress are present.\u201d CJI2d 7.6, <em>commentary. </em>In <em>People v Luther, </em>394 Mich 619, 623; 232 NW2d 184 (1975),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we held that a defendant successfully carries the burden of production where the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>introduces some evidence from which the jury could conclude the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">A) The threatening conduct was sufficient to create in the mind of a reasonable person the fear of death or serious bodily harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">B) The conduct in fact caused such fear of death or serious bodily harm in the mind of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">C) The fear or duress was operating upon the mind of the defendant at the time of the alleged act; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">D) The defendant committed the act to avoid the threatened harm.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Additionally, in <em>People v Merhige, </em>212 Mich 601, 610-611; 180 NW 418 (1920), we acknowledged that the threatening conduct or act of compulsion must be \u201cpresent, imminent, and impending[, that] [a] threat of future Injury is not enough,\u201d and that the threat \u201cmust have arisen without the negligence or fault of the person who insists upon it as a defense.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aodi\">While this Court has had only a few occasions in which to address the defense, federal precedent is instructive.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In <em>Bailey, </em>the United States Supreme Court observed that the defense requires \u201cthat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>testimony given or proffered meet a minimum standard as to each element of the defense so that, if a jury finds it to be true, it would support an affirmative defense . . . <em>Id. </em>at 415. In other words, \u201c[b]efore a defendant is entitled to an instruction on the defense of duress, he must establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of the . . . elements of that defense . . . .\u201d <em>United States v Beltran-Rios, </em>878 F2d 1208, 1213 (CA 9, 1989).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The defendant is required to produce some \u201cevidence on all of the elements of the defense of duress.\u201d <em>United States v Patrick, </em>542 F2d 381, 388 (CA 7, 1976). \u201cUnless a defendant submits sufficient evidence to warrant a finding of duress, the trial court is not required to instruct the jury on that defense.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>United States v Mitchell, </em>725 F2d 832, 837 (CA 2, 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The right to assert inconsistent defenses notwithstanding, Ms. Lemons\u2019 defense at trial did not meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the burden of producing a prima facie defense of duress. As discussed above, Ms. Lemons\u2019 defense focused on her husband\u2019s physically abusive nature.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Her testimony on direct examination established that she had been beaten by Mr. Lemons, that she feared him, and that he was in control of the household. It also established that she left and returned to Mr. Lemons at least twice. On cross-examination, she unequivocally denied that any sexual abuse took place at any time in the household. We conclude that, as in <em>Kirk, </em>these facts are legally insufficient to require the requested instruction. They do not, standing alone, meet the burden on the defense to come forward with some evidence that the defendant did the act and chose to do so out of a reasonable and actual belief that it was the lesser of two evils.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The testimony offered in support of the defense foreclosed the trial judge from finding that the burden of production had been met, i.e., that the prohibited act was committed by the defendant and was done by her to avoid harm, and that the fear of harm was operating on her mind at the time of the act.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Her testimony offered nothing with regard to the immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>acy of any specific threat as it related to any specific act of sexual abuse. Thus, the evidence failed to satisfy the burden of production of a prima facie claim that fear was operating on Ms. Lemons\u2019 mind at the time of the alleged acts or that she reasonably felt she would suffer some harmful repercussions for failing to sexually abuse the children.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> At most the evidence offered by the defendant supported a contention that the relationship between the defendants was physically and emotionally abusive and that Ms. Lemons was \u201cbrain washed\u201d through lack of self worth. The defense did not link Ms. Lemons\u2019 fear of Mr. Lemons, either generally or specifically, to the alleged acts of sexual abuse.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, while it is true that \u201cwhen a jury instruction is requested on any theories or defenses and is supported by evidence, it must be given to the jury by the trial judge,\u201d <em>People v Mills, </em>450 Mich 61, 81; 537 NW2d 909 (1995), the defendant here failed to successfully raise the prima facie defense of duress in accordance with <em>Luther, supra. </em>Because a jury question was not presented, the instruction was not required. <em>Mills </em>at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Consistent with trial counsel\u2019s arguments in support of the duress instruction, Ms. Lemons\u2019 counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>argues on appeal that a duress instruction should have been given because the jury could have disbelieved Ms. Lemons\u2019 testimony and credited the testimony regarding abuse and intimidation of Ms. Lemons by Mr. Lemons. This would be true, however, only to the extent that the defense could make a showing sufficient to allow the jury to conclude not only that a reasonable person would have feared death or serious bodily harm, but also that Ms. Lemons violated the law because she was in fact actually coerced to do so. The defendant, without offering other evidence to support a critical element of the affirmative defense, explicitly denied that the act ever occurred,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> thus negating any claim that acts were justified by her actual fear. Since she failed to provide a basis for the jury to find that the acts were committed by her to avoid a greater harm,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> tendering the duress instruction would have permitted the jury to engage in speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Finally, in light of all the evidence offered in Ms. Lemons\u2019 case, we agree with Judge Saad that tendering the instruction on duress would defy common sense. There was testimony by both victims that she ordered them to perform acts of oral sex. She slapped her stepdaughter for doing it \u201cwrong,\u201d and she engaged her son in the activity when Mr. Lemons was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>not immediately present. She offered no evidence that she suffered repercussions when she refused to abuse her son for a period of two years or when she left the household and returned. She failed to assert that some greater harm was avoided by the sexual abuse, and the evidence indicates she voluntarily reentered the household and continued to engage in the sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Because Ms. Lemons failed to cany the burden of production by offering some evidence on each element, we reverse the Court of Appeals determination that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on this defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">B. CSC H INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Mr. Lemons\u2019 younger daughter testified that she performed oral sex on her stepmother. She also said it happened \u201c[n]ot very many\u201d other times.

[It] [d]oes not require any specific use of a mouth or the tongue as long as there is contact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court, stating, \u201cThe trial court erred in refusing to give an instruction for the CSC [II]. Upon retrial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>trial court will instruct the jury on [CSC n] if requested. . . . [Ms. Lemons\u2019] two convictions with respect to the charges involving [her stepdaughter] are reversed, and we remand for entry of judgment of conviction of two counts of [csc n] and resentencing, with the option to the prosecutor to retry [Ms. Lemons] on the original charges of [CSC I].\u201d Slip op at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Just last term, we addressed the governing rule regarding when a court is required to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses. In <em>People v Bailey, </em>451 Mich 657, 667-668; 549 NW2d 325 (1996), we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">When reviewing the propriety of a requested lesser included offense instruction, we first determine if the lesser offense is necessarily included in the greater charge, or if it is a cognate lesser included offense. Necessarily included lesser offenses \u201cmust be such that it is impossible to commit the greater without first having committed the lesser.\u201d . . . Cognate lesser included offenses \u201care related and hence \u2018cognate\u2019 in the sense that they share several elements, and are of the same class or category, but may contain some elements not found in the higher offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Csc I requires the prosecutor to prove \u201csexual penetration.\u201d MCL 750.520b(l); MSA 28.788(2)(1). Csc II requires the prosecutor to prove \u201csexual contact.\u201d MCL 750.520c(l); MSA 28.788(3)(1). Sexual penetration can be for any purpose. MCL 750.520a(l); MSA 28.788(1)(1). The statute defines sexual contact, however, as touching that \u201ccan reasonably be construed as being for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.\u201d MCL 750.520a(k); MSA 28.788(l)(k). Thus, because CSC II requires proof of an intent not required by CSC i \u2014 that defendant intended to seek sexual arousal or gratification \u2014 csc n is a cognate lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>offense of CSC I. In short, it is possible to commit esc I without first having committed CSC n.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Regardless of the evidence in a given case, the court must instruct the jury on necessarily included lesser offenses. <em>People v Heflin, </em>434 Mich 482, 495; 456 NW2d 10 (1990). With regard to cognate offenses, however, the evidence must be \u201creviewed to determine if it would support a conviction of the cognate offense.\u201d <em>Bailey </em>at 668. The requested instruction on the cognate offense must be consistent \u201cwith the evidence and defendant\u2019s theory of the case.\u201d <em>Heflin </em>at 499. The instruction on a cognate offense will be required if there is a dispute in evidence that would support a conviction of that charge. <em>Bailey, supra </em>at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The trial judge did not err in determining that the CSC n conviction would not be consistent with the evidence and the defendant\u2019s theory of the case. The evidence offered by the prosecution established that Ms. Lemons engaged in multiple acts of cunnilingus with her son and stepdaughter. Although we have found that penetration for the purpose of establishing fellatio requires actual penetration rather than mere kissing or contact where the defendant is engaging in contact with a child\u2019s penis, <em>People v Johnson, </em>432 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Mich 931 (1989), the distinction is illogical where the victim testifies without objection that she performed oral sex and placed her face on the defendant\u2019s vagina. The only reasonable interpretation of this testimony, which was not brought into question by any cross-examination creating a dispute of fact, is that it was intended to be cunnilingus, which, by definition, does not require penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The distinction advocated by the defendant would be contrary to the policy of the act and would discourage child victims from testifying by requiring them to describe explicitly the method by which they performed cunnilingus. Testimony that a child victim performed oral sex and placed her face into the vaginal area of an adult does not raise a dispute on an element distinguishing the cognate offense from the principal charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">We reverse the Court of Appeals determination that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on CSC II.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">in. defendant llewellyn lemons</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Mr. Lemons was sentenced to one life term and two terms of 60 to 90 years.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In deciding to depart from the sentencing guidelines recommendation of 180 months or 360 months to life, Judge Best offered the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">I believe that this is the most heinous crime a parent can commit against a child.

For [Mr. Lemons\u2019 younger daughter] to indicate that death is too good a punishment I think is understandable. And I think any court reviewing this trial or this sentence ought to understand that looking at a transcript is not sufficient to understand the emotion and the truth of what was conveyed by those children when they testified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s sentence, and remanded Mr. Lemons\u2019 case for resentencing. It reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>[W]e find the sentences proportionate and the departures from the guidelines justified. The heinousness of the crimes was not reflected in the guidelines .... The departures . . . were also justified by the existence of other serious, uncharged offenses which were established at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">However, although [Mr. Lemons\u2019] sentences of 60 to 90 years may be proportionate to the offense, they are excessive with respect to the offender in light of his age of 45 years at the time of sentencing. . . . [He] would be more than 96 years old at the completion of his sentences. . . . Thus, we find it necessary to remand for resentencing ... in accord with . . . <em>People v Moore </em>.... [Slip op at 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that the sentences were proportionate, but we reverse its finding that they were excessive under <em>Moore </em>because of the defendant\u2019s age at sentencing. <em>Moore </em>was decided before <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630; 461 NW2d 1 (1990), and <em>People v Merriweather, </em>447 Mich 799; 527 NW2d 460 (1994), which provide the standards for reviewing a sentence on appeal. These sentences are clearly governed by <em>Milbourn </em>and <em>Merriweather.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">In <em>Merriweather, </em>the defendant committed unspeakably atrocious acts of torture and sexual abuse against an eighty-four-year-old woman in her home. <em>Id. </em>at 802-804. He was convicted of two counts of esc I and sentenced to 60 to 120 years\u2019 imprisonment for those convictions. On appeal, the defendant argued that the indeterminate sentencing act requires that where the authorized maximum sentence is \u201clife or for any term of years,\u201d as is the case for CSC I, \u201cthe judge must either impose a low sentence or else give \u2018life,\u2019 which would make the defendant eligible for parole after\u201d a statutorily determined number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>years.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 808-809. We rejected that argument and found \u201cno basis ... to conclude that the Legislature intended that all defendants . . . must be eligible for parole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Our decision in <em>Merriweather </em>makes clear that where a sentence \u201cfalls within the permissible range of sentences for defendants convicted of [CSC i],\u201d which is \u201cfor life or for any term of years,\u201d MCL 750.520b(2); MSA 28.788(2)(2), and is indeterminate, because the judge fixes both the minimum and the maximum, the sentence is lawful as long as it meets the requirements of proportionality under <em>Milboum. </em>With regard to parole eligibility we ob-served:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">The fact that it is paradoxical that the defendant might be better off with a sentence of life, which would make him eligible for parole, has nothing to do with a legislative intention that every prisoner should be eligible for parole. The Legislature has not seen fit to interfere with the voters\u2019 directive that a defendant should not be parole eligible until the completion of the minimum term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">Assuming arguendo, \u201cthe only possible rationale for sentencing the defendant . . . was to effectively prevent the parole board from assuming jurisdiction,\u201d . . . , that is the precise result the electorate sought and obtained in the passage of Proposal B. <em>[Merriweather, supra </em>at 809-811.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">In short, we find no basis in <em>Milbourn </em>for a requirement that the trial judge tailor every defendant\u2019s sentence in relationship to the defendant\u2019s age. Persons who are sixty years old are just as capable of committing grievous crimes as persons who are twenty years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>old. We find no principled reason to <em>require </em>that a judge treat similar offenses that are committed by similarly depraved persons differently solely on the basis of the age of the defendant at sentencing where the Legislature has authorized the judge to impose life or <em>any </em>term of years. A judge may, however, consider a defendant\u2019s age at sentencing in deciding whether the sentence about to be imposed is proper, just as the judge considers the recommended range under the guidelines and any other factors not expressly prohibited by law.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Because there is some ambiguity in the Court of Appeals opinion regarding whether it found the sentence proportionate to the offender, we briefly address that issue. Our review of the record reveals that both defendants laughed at trial when one of the victims testified that she, unlike her stepbrother who wished his parents were dead, wanted them to live and suffer like she suffered. The record further reveals that the defendants rejected plea bargains that would have spared their children the horror of reliving multiple acts of sexual abuse before strangers and the public, and that the defendants expressed no remorse whatsoever for the obvious pain and suffering they inflicted on their children. Contributing to our review of Mr. Lemons as an offender, the record also reveals that he committed multiple criminal acts that went uncharged. In the presentence investigation report, \u201c[t]he only positive factor the Court represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>tative could find in Mr. Lemons background [was] that he has no prior adult felony convictions, remains married . . . , and is in good physical health, denying . . . [use of] illegal substances.\u201d All other factors operated in favor of lengthy incarceration and against the possibility of rehabilitation. Finally, the record reveals that the trial judge determined both defendants to be liars. \u201cUnder <em>Milboum, </em>the \u2018key test\u2019 of proportionality is not whether the sentence departs from or adheres to the recommended range, but whether it reflects the seriousness of the matter.\u201d <em>People v Houston, </em>448 Mich 312, 320; 532 NW2d 508 (1995). The sentences imposed were proportionate to the perversity of the acts and of the offender despite his age at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s sentences were not excessive under <em>Moore </em>in light of his age at sentencing where the indeterminate sentences were authorized by the Legislature and were proportionate to the offense and the offender under <em>Milbourn. </em>We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals with regard to Mr. Lemons\u2019 sentences, and we reinstate the sentences imposed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">In <em>People v Mary Cadry Lemons, </em>we reverse the Court of Appeals decision with regard to the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on duress and CSC II, and we reinstate her convictions. In <em>People v Llewellyn Lemons, </em>we reverse the determination of the Court of Appeals that the sentences of 60 to 90 years were excessive in light of the defendant\u2019s age at sentencing, and we reinstate those sentences.</p>\n<judges id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Mallett, C.J., and Riley and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-12\"> MCL 769.9; MSA 28.1081.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-13\"> MCL 750.520b; MSA 28.788(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\"> The defendants sexually abused Ms. Lemons\u2019 son from a previous relationship, who was five years old at the time of the first incident, and Mr. Lemons\u2019 daughter from a previous relationship, who was also five years old at the time of the first incident of abuse.

However, in part m, which addresses defendant Llewellyn Lemons\u2019 appeal of his sentencing to two terms of sixty to ninety years,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the majority ignores the fundamental and most important operative distinction \u2014 that is, between parolable and nonparolable offenses \u2014 and blithely condones the sentencing court\u2019s abuse of discretion in fashioning these challenged sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In my opinion, given that Llewellyn Lemons received a valid life sentence on a separate but related count, the only conceivable rationale for sentencing him to two terms of sixty to ninety years was to effectively prevent the parole board from assuming jurisdiction over him pursuant to MCL 791.234(4); MSA 28.2304(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A sentence fashioned for the sole purpose of depriving the parole board of its legislatively provided jurisdiction constitutes an abuse of a sentencing court\u2019s discretion. It is well established that a sentencing court must exercise its discretion within the parameters established by the Legislature. See <em>In re Campbell, </em>138 Mich 597; 101 NW 826 (1904); <em>People v Moore, </em>432 Mich 311; 439 NW2d 684 (1989); <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630; 461 NW2d 1 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Pursuant to MCL 791.233b(w); MSA 28.2303(3)(w), criminal sexual conduct in the first degree is a parolable offense. This explicit legislative pronouncement, under which a prisoner is subject to the jurisdiction of the parole board after serving the minimum term less available disciplinary credits, compels us to invalidate any sentence fashioned solely for the purpose of precluding parole board jurisdiction over a prisoner. And it bears repeating that \u201cbeing subject to the jurisdiction .of the parole board and actually being paroled are two distinctly different prospects. Few prisoners serving parolable life sentences are ever paroled.\u201d <em>People v Merriweather, </em>447 Mich 799, 813-814; 527 NW2d 460 (1994) (Cavanagh, C.J., dissenting). \u201cSentencing a defendant with the sole intent of effectively preventing the jurisdiction of the parole board is contrary to the legislative scheme and, accordingly, is an abuse of a sentencing court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals with respect to Llewellyn Lemons\u2019 two sentences of sixty to ninety years, and would remand for imposition of a life sentence on these two counts in accordance with <em>Moore, supra. </em>On this basis, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b512-6\">Brickley, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b512-7\">Kelly, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-6\"> Defendant Llewellyn Lemons also was sentenced to one life term, but that sentence was not vacated by the Court of Appeals and is not at issue in this appeal.
