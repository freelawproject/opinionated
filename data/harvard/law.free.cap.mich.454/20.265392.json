We hold that plaintiffs claims are preempted by the actions of the National Boating Safety Advisory Council and the concomitant acceptance by the United States Coast Guard of the recommendation that it \u201cshould take no regulatory action to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>require propeller guards\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that were made under the authority of the Federal Boat Safety Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Plaintiff-appellant\u2019s husband, Stephen J.

To this end, the act provides a coordinated national boating safety program that unites the federal government and states in an effort to compel manufacturers to provide safer boats and boating equipment to the public. Achievement of this objective is encouraged by requiring that manufacturers comply with safety standards promulgated by the Secretary of Transportation. S Rep No 92-248, 1971 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News (85 Stat 213) 1333. Incentives to state participation are provided through federal grant-in-aid payments to states that have, or that develop, an accepted boat safety program.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Congress grants the Secretary of Transportation exclusive authority to establish national safety standards for recreational vessels and associated equipment. 46 USC 4302(a)(1). To facilitate this duty, the secretary has the option to delegate regulatory functions to a designated agency that then operates under its supervision. 46 USC 4303(a). The United States Coast Guard has been designated as that agency. <em>Carstensen v Brunswick Corp, </em>49 F3d 430, 431 (CA 8, 1995), cert den 516 US 866; 116 S Ct 182; 133 L Ed 2d 120 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Pursuant to the act, the secretary must consult with the National Boating Safety Advisory Council (nbsac) concerning the need for regulation in a given area and the extent to which proposed regulations will contribute to recreational boating safety. 46 USC 4302(c)(4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>In accordance with the act, nbsac was consulted, and, in 1988, at the request of the Coast Guard, a subcommittee was appointed for the purpose of reviewing and analyzing data involving recreational boating accidents where persons in the water were struck by boat propellers. The subcommittee was commissioned to consider the feasibility of mechanical guards in preventing boat propeller injuries.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>After a year-long study and public hearings, the subcommittee reached the unanimous conclusion that the \u201cU.S. Coast Guard should take no regulatory action to require propeller guards.\u201d <em>Report of the Propeller Guard Subcommittee </em>at 24 (November 7, 1989). The subcommittee resolved that \u201c[t]he development and use of devices such as \u2018propeller guards\u2019 can ... be counter-productive and can create new hazards of equal or greater consequence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. Of the possible negative effects, propeller guards were found to have the potential to \u201cdecrease an operator\u2019s ability to maintain control over the boat at \u2018normal\u2019 speeds, <em>increase </em>the probability of striking a body in the water, and create a possibility of causing greater injury to those struck.\u201d <em>Mowery v Mercury Marine, Div of Brunswick Corp, </em>773 F Supp 1012, 1016 (ND Ohio, 1991) (emphasis in the original). The subcommittee\u2019s recommendation that regulatory action to require propeller guards not be taken was accepted by both the NBSAC and the United States Coast Guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In this case we are faced with the issue of determining whether plaintiff\u2019s common-law products lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>bility claims<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> axe preempted under the Federal Boat Safety Act. We hold that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">The doctrine of federal preemption has its origin in the Supremacy Clause of article VI, cl 2, of the United States Constitution, which declares that the laws of the United States \u201cshall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . .\u201d Where the principles of federal preemption apply, state courts are deprived of subject matter jurisdiction. Congressional intent is the cornerstone of preemption analysis. <em>People v Hegedus, </em>432 Mich 598, 607; 443 NW2d 127 (1989).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Federal provisions that invalidate state law must be narrowly tailored to support a presumption against preemption of state law. <em>Medtronic, Inc v Lohr, </em>518 US 470, _; 116 S Ct 2240, 2250; 135 L Ed 2d 700 (1996).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> State police powers are not to be superseded unless that is the clear and unequivocal intent of Congress. <em>Cipollone v Liggett Group, Inc, </em>505 US 504, 516; 112 S Ct 2608; 120 L Ed 2d 407 (1992). This is especially true where state regulation of matters relating to health and safety are involved. <em>Hillsborough Co v Automated Medical Labs Inc, </em>471 US 707, 715; 105 S Ct 2371; 85 L Ed 2d 714 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Of fundamental importance to the resolution of this issue is the premise that the plain meaning of a statute must be given effect unless there is reason to believe that Congress intended a more restrictive reading. <em>CSX Transportation Inc v Easterwood, </em>507 US 658; 113 S Ct 1732; 123 L Ed 2d 387 (1993). The viewing court seeks the intent of Congress from text and the \u201c \u2018structure and purpose of the statute as a whole\u2019 . . . [including] the way in which Congress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme to affect business, consumers, and the law.\u201d <em>Medtronic, </em>116 S Ct 2251.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Federal preemption is either express or implied. If express, the intent of Congress to preempt state law must be clearly stated in the statute\u2019s language or impliedly contained in the statute\u2019s structure and purpose. <em>Cipollone, supra </em>at 516. In the absence of express preemption, implied preemption may exist in the form of conflict or field preemption. Conflict preemption acts to preempt state law to the extent that it is in direct conflict with federal law or with the purposes and objectives of Congress. Field preemption acts to preempt state law where federal law so thoroughly occupies a legislative field that it is reasonable to infer that Congress did not intend for states to supplement it. <em>Cipollone, supra </em>at 516. However, as seven members of the <em>Cipollone </em>Court agreed, when \u201cCongress has considered the issue of pre-emption and has included in the enacted legislation a provision explicitly addressing that issue, and when that provision provides a \u2018reliable indicium of congressional intent with respect to state authority\u2019 . . . \u2018there is no need to infer congressional intent to pre-empt state laws from the substantive provisions\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>of the legislation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 517, quoting <em>California Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v Guerra, </em>479 US 272, 282; 107 S Ct 683; 93 L Ed 2d 613 (1987).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">To resolve the issue of federal preemption before us we examine two provisions of the Federal Boat Safety Act, the federal preemption provision of \u00a7 4306, and the saving clause provision of subsection 4311(g). The federal preemption provision reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">[A] State . . . may not establish, continue in effect, or enforce a law or regulation establishing a recreational vessel or associated equipment performance or other safety standard or imposing a requirement for associated equipment . . . that is not identical to a regulation prescribed under section 4302 of this title. [46 USC 4306.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The saving clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">Compliance with this chapter or standards, regulations, or orders prescribed under this chapter does not relieve a person from liability at common law or under State law. [46 USC 4311(g).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Plaintiff submits that the use of the term \u201claw or regulation\u201d in \u00a7 4306 of the statute is ambiguous and therefore incapable of preempting state common-law causes of action. We disagree, noting that \u201c \u2018[t]he obligation to pay compensation can be, indeed is designed to be, a potent method of governing conduct and controlling policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cipollone, supra </em>at 521, citing <em>San Diego Bldg Trades Council v Garmon, </em>359 US 236, 247; 79 S Ct 773; 3 L Ed 2d 775 (1959). \u201c \u2018[State] regulation can be as effectively exerted through an award of damages as through some form of preventive relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">While common-law damages actions may constitute a form of state regulation, the issue before us is not whether the act preempts common-law remedies for claims supplementary to, but not inconsistent with, federal regulations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The threshold question is, rather, whether Congress intended that common-law causes of action such as those before this Court be considered a \u201claw or regulation\u201d under the act. We find that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court was faced with the issue whether preemptive provisions of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act displaced the plaintiff\u2019s common-law tort claims. At issue were two statutory provisions of the act, the first enacted in 1965 and the second in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>1969. The 1965 provision was narrowly drafted and was found only to preempt cautionary statements.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The 1969 version, however, was held to have expanded the act\u2019s scope of preemption by mandating that \u201c[n]o requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law . . . .\u201d <em>Cipollone, supra </em>at 515. Interpreting the 1969 act to preempt common-law regulations, the Court wrote that \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018[n]o requirement or prohibition\u2019 sweeps broadly and suggests no distinction between positive enactments and common law; to the contrary, those words easily encompass obligations that take the form of common-law rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Comparing the language in the 1969 preemption clause in <em>Cipollone </em>to the language used by Congress in the preemptive clause of the fbsa, we conclude that Congress intended the preemptive clause of the FBSA to reach claims that the product is defective for failure to have a propeller guard or to warn of the dangers of not having such a guard. In <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>the statute read \u201c[n]o requirement or prohibition . . . shall be imposed under state law . . . .\u201d The fbsa, on the other hand, declares that a state may not \u201cenforce a law or regulation . . . imposing a requirement for associated equipment . . . .\u201d46 USC 4306. Noting that <em>Cipollone </em>has defined state regulation as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>encompassing common-law damages actions,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we find the difference in the language of the preemption provisions for the purposes of federal preemption to be insignificant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In so finding, we are cognizant, however, of the Texas Supreme Court decision in <em>Moore v Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards Corp, </em>889 SW2d 246 (Tex, 1994), in which the court found, in an identical context, that the plaintiff\u2019s products liability claims were not preempted by the FBSA. The learned panel of the Texas Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">We recognize that the term \u201claw\u201d can include both common law and statutory law. However, in <em>Cipollone, </em>the Supreme Court stated generally that \u201cthe presumption against pre-emption might give good reason to construe the phrase \u2018state law\u2019 in a pre-emption provision more narrowly than an identical phrase in another context.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 249, quoting <em>Cipollone, supra </em>at 522. ][<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>However, the <em>Moore </em>court, while perceiving \u201cno basis in the language of the statute or legislative history\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to find preemption, failed to address the \u201clong history of preemption in maritime safety matters\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that is premised on the need for uniformity and that \u201cassures that manufacture for the domestic trade will not involve compliance with widely varying local regulations.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nor did <em>Moore </em>acknowledge that a majority of the <em>Cipollone </em>Court, on which <em>Moore </em>relied, declined to adopt a narrow interpretation of the term \u201cstate law,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> or that, because of the inherent conflict between state and federal law,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the <em>Cipollone </em>Court preempted the plaintiffs claims that relied on a \u201cstate law \u2018requirement or prohibition . . . with respect to . . . advertising or promotion.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">While we agree that a preemption clause must be narrowly construed, having concluded that state law includes common-law actions, we cannot conclude other than that a state claim based on the absence of propeller guards is preempted by the federal decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>that propeller guards should not be required.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In so holding, we join numerous other courts that have held that \u201c[cjommon law causes of action may constitute state regulation and \u2018impose a requirement\u2019 on manufacturers to have propeller guards through an award of damages.\u201d <em>Lewis v Brunswick Corp, </em>922 F Supp 613, 615 (SD Ga, 1996).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Plaintiff also contends that the action taken by the Coast Guard was an informal decision rather than a formal regulation as required by the act.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>4306 of the FBSA mandates that a state law or regulation shall be preempted if it is not identical to a regulation promulgated under the act. There is no dispute that the action taken by the Coast Guard was a determination not to regulate; propeller guard installation and use were not expressly prohibited by the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard did decide, however, that propeller guards should not be required on recreational watercraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">A decision not to regulate does not automatically invoke preemption,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> but may carry the force of a positive enactment. <em>Arkansas Electric Cooperative v Arkansas Public Service </em>Comm, 461 US 375, 384; 103 S Ct 1905; 76 L Ed 2d 1 (1983).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Nevertheless, when a federal agency has actively analyzed the proposed area of regulation and has deliberately concluded that regulation is not appropriate in a given area, federal inaction will preempt state law not identical to it. This is not to say that inaction indicated preemption, but rather that \u201c \u2018[w]here a comprehensive federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>scheme intentionally leaves a portion of the regulated field without controls, <em>then </em>the preemptive inference can be drawn \u2014 not from federal inaction alone, but from inaction joined with action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Toy Mfrs of America, Inc v Blumenthal, </em>986 F2d 615, 622 (CA 2, 1992), quoting <em>Puerto Rico Dep\u2019t of Consumer Affairs v Isla Petroleum Corp, </em>485 US 495, 503; 108 S Ct 1350; 99 L Ed 2d 582 (1988).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The Coast Guard\u2019s decision not to require propeller guards on recreational vessels granted manufacturers the opportunity to choose whether or not they felt it wise to install propeller guards on recreational boats. <em>Moss v Outboard Marine Corp, </em>915 F Supp 183, 186 (ED Cal, 1996); <em>Mowery, supra </em>at 1016. Holding defendants liable under state tort laws for failing to install a propeller guard would effectively eliminate that choice. <em>Davis v Brunswick, </em>854 F Supp 1574, 1582 (ND Ga, 1993).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> More precisely, \u201cit would allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>juries to do what state legislatures cannot.\u201d <em>Id,.</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accordingly, we find that the Coast Guard\u2019s decision not to require propeller guards was an intentional and reasoned determination not to regulate in a given area and \u201c[a]ny state law or regulation requiring manufacturers to install propeller guards would not be identical to the Coast Guard regulatory position.\u201d <em>Carstensen, </em>49 F3d 431.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">vn</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Plaintiff contends that the saving clause provision of subsection 4311(g), read in conjunction with the federal preemption provision of \u00a7 4306, provides a clear indication of the legislative intent not to preempt state common-law causes of action such as those involved here. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">As evidenced above, the plain meaning of the statute expresses the intent of Congress to preempt state law causes of action such as those brought by plaintiff. The legislative history surrounding the enactment of the fbsa also bears witness to that intent. <em>Davis, supra </em>at 1580.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>In enacting the fbsa, Congress wrote that \u201cthe annual loss of life is of [a] sufficiently alarming proportion that the <em>Federal Government </em>should require products involved to be built to standards of safety commensurate with the risks associated with their use.\u201d S Rep No 92-248, 1971 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News (85 Stat 213) 1334 (emphasis added). States were encouraged to participate in this plan by implementing state boating safety programs. <em>Id. </em>at 1333. State participation was also to be encouraged in the enforcement of established regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 1334.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Delineating governmental responsibility in this manner was wholly consistent with the underlying goal of the act \u2014 to provide uniformity to the recreational boating industry. According to Congress, the \u201cneed for uniformity in standards if interstate commerce is not to be unduly impeded supports the establishment of uniform construction and equipment standards at the <em>Federal </em>level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1335 (emphasis added). At the same time, states are left free, and are encouraged, to regulate the operation and use of recreational vessels.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>What was taken away by the federal preemption provision was in part restored by the saving clause provision of subsection 4311(g). The legislative history surrounding the enactment of the saving clause provision provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\">This section ... is intended to clarify that compliance with the Act or standards, regulations, or orders promulgated thereunder, does not relieve any person from liability at common law or under State law. <em>The purpose of the section is to assure that in a product liability suit mere compliance by a manufacturer with the minimum standards promulgated under the Act will not be a complete defense to liability. [Id. </em>at 1352 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">We find that it would be inconsistent with the language of the statute and with the legislative intent to hold that the saving clause provision preserves plaintiffs claims from the reach of federal preemption. Thus, we join a long line of cases that have similarly held that common-law products liability actions alleging liability for failing to incorporate a propeller guard on a recreational vessel are expressly preempted under the fbsa. We find the analysis in these cases more persuasive than that of the sole case holding to the contrary.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Plaintiff contends that the defendant had a duty to design and manufacture a motor with a propeller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>guard. Because state regulations requiring propeller guards are preempted by the FBSA, and because the federal government currently does not require that motors be manufactured with propeller guards, we conclude that the grant of summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(4) and (C)(8) was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">vm</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Plaintiffs common-law tort claims are preempted by the Federal Boat Safety Act. For these reasons, we affirm the Court of Appeals decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b290-6\">Mallett, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, Riley, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b290-7\">Kelly, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\"> <em>Report of the Propeller Guard Subcommittee </em>at 24 (November 7, 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\"> The complaint alleged that Mercury Marine was negligent in the design and manufacture of its inboard motor, propeller assembly, and replacement propeller system, and in failing to equip the propeller with a guard or protective device to prevent invasive cutting iiquries.

Because this Court finds that federal law does preempt state law in this area, the Court necessarily lacks jurisdiction to hear this matter and, accordingly, partial summary disposition is appropriate under (C)(4) for the lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and also as I think correctly argued by the defendant, it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the failure to equip its product with a propeller guard or to warn of its absence is something that the manufacturer of an outboard or inboard outdrive boat propulsion unit cannot be held liable for. Since that is the case, I grant the defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary disposition under both (C)(4) and (C)(8) for those reasons I\u2019ve indicated.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\"> This order was entered on March 26, 1993.
