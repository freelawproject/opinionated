For the reasons that follow, we hold that plaintiff has failed to state a claim of wrongful discharge from employment under public policy and breach of contract principles, but has stated a valid claim under the WPA. Accordingly, we affirm the grant of summary disposition as it relates to the public policy and breach of contract claims, and reverse and remand for further proceedings on the wpa claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">Plaintiff worked as a ticketing agent for defendant airlines<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at the Capitol City Airport in Lansing, Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>gan. In early 1991, as a means of tightening airport security during the Persian Gulf War, plaintiff and her colleagues were asked to stay alert to individuals purchasing tickets or otherwise contacting the airline who fit a designated profile description relating to drug trafficking or terrorist activities. Plaintiff did just that and, in January or February, 1991, she and a coworker informed airport security of individuals who fit the profile description. On the basis of plaintiffs tip, the Federal Drug Enforcement Agency intervened and made an arrest. Shortly thereafter, plaintiff again contacted the authorities to report yet another individual whom she believed fit the designated profile. The dea assured plaintiff that she would be rewarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">On February 10, 1991, the general manager of Continental Express posted a written notice directing employees to seek management approval before contacting authorities to report individuals believed to fit the profile description.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One month later, plaintiff was approached by the general manager and asked if she had contacted the DEA after February 10, 1991. Plaintiff claimed that she had not, but was sent home pending an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>According to plaintiff, Continental\u2019s investigation unearthed two individuals who agreed to provide written statements indicating that plaintiff had reported two passenger names to the dea after February 10, 1991. When confronted, plaintiff admitted that she contacted the dea after the February date, but insisted that she did so only because she wanted information on the status of her reward. Plaintiff contends that she did not report passenger names after the February 10 posting.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In March, 1991, the general manager of Continental Express contacted the plaintiff and told her that her relationship with Continental was over. The next day, plaintiff was shown one of two written statements that alleged that she had contacted the dea without Continental Express\u2019 approval after February 10, 1991.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff was told that corporate headquarters would make the final determination on her employment status. Subsequently, plaintiff\u2019s employment was terminated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s original complaint alleged wrongful discharge from employment under the Michigan Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act and breach of contract principles. The circuit court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition on the wpa claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Shortly thereafter, plaintiff filed an amended complaint, adding a new charge of wrongful discharge from employment in violation of public policy. Defendant again sought dismissal of plaintiffs claims under MCR 2.116(C)(8). At the same time, plaintiff filed a motion for relief from the October 10, 1991, order granting defendant summary disposition on the wpa claim. After consolidating the matters, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s first amended complaint with prejudice and denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for relief from the October 10, 1991, order. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We granted leave to appeal. 452 Mich 867 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Plaintiff alleges that the court dismissed the wpa claim on the basis of a faulty interpretation of the law. According to plaintiff, the December 16, 1991, decision in <em>Dudewicz v Norris Schmid, Inc, </em>192 Mich App 247, 254; 480 NW2d 612, aff\u2019d in part and rev\u2019d in part 443 Mich 68; 503 NW2d 645 (1993), extended the application of the act and required that the court grant relief from its earlier order dismissing the whistleblowers\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">In considering plaintiff\u2019s motion for relief from that order, the circuit court reviewed the whistleblowers\u2019 claim in light of the Court of Appeals opinion in <em>Dudewicz </em>and determined that the grant of summary disposition had been appropriate. On appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Court of Appeals, having the benefit of this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Dudewicz, </em>reduced the instant issue to whether the wpa was intended to protect \u201cthird parties whose violations, if any, have no connection to the business.\u201d 208 Mich App 316, 318-319; 526 NW2d 922 (1995). The Court of Appeals found that the act did not apply, stating that \u201cin order for the wpa to apply, the violation or suspected violation must be committed in the course of doing business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Michigan\u2019s Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act was first enacted in 1981, largely in response to the accidental PBB-contamination of livestock feed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The act \u201cencourage[s] employees to assist in law enforcement and . . . protects] those employees who engage in whistleblowing activities.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It does so with an eye toward promoting public health and safety. The underlying purpose of the act is protection of the public.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The act meets this objective by protecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>whistleblowing employee<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and by removing barriers that may interdict employee efforts to report violations or suspected violations of the law. Without employees who axe willing to risk adverse employment consequences as a result of whistleblowing activities, the public would remain unaware of large-scale and potentially dangerous abuses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">To establish a prima facie case under the wpa, plaintiff must prove that she \u201creported] or [was] about to report ... a violation or a suspected violation of a law ... to a public body.\u201d MCL 15.362; MSA 17.428(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plaintiff asserts that she was termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>nated \u201cbecause [she] reported and/or was perceived to report a violation or a suspected violation of a law . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because plaintiff appeals from a motion granting summary disposition, all factual allegations supporting her claims must be accepted as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">A motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8), tests the legal basis of the claim and is granted if the claim is so manifestly unenforceable as a matter of law that no factual progression could possibly support recovery. <em>Simko v Blake, </em>448 Mich 648, 654; 532 NW2d 842 (1995). Motions for summary disposition are examined on the pleadings alone, absent consideration of supporting affidavits, depositions, admissions, or other documentary evidence, and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>factual allegations contained in the complaint must be accepted as trae. <em>Id. </em>at 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The pivotal question in this case is whether the plaintiff stated a valid claim of wrongful discharge from employment under the wpa where she alleged that she reported or was perceived to report a violation or suspected violation of the law. We find that she did.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">A plain reading of the wpa reveals that employees who report violations or suspected violations of the law to a public body are entitled to protection under the act. As interpreted, the act provides protection to employees who report violations of law by either their employers or fellow employees. <em>Dudewicz, </em>443 Mich 68. The act was intended to protect employees who alert the public to \u201ccorruption or criminally irresponsible behavior in the conduct of government or large businesses.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 75. Frequently, a close connection exists between the reported violation and the employment setting, although no such limitation is found in the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">In <em>Dudewicz, </em>the plaintiff worked as a parts manager for the defendant automobile dealership. In an effort to gain better service for a customer, the plaintiff, along with the dealership\u2019s owner, convinced the service manager to perform work for the customer under warranty. After the owner left the area, the ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>vice manager allegedly assaulted the plaintiff. The plaintiff was fired when he refused to drop criminal charges against the service manager. A majority of this Court afforded the plaintiff protection under the WPA. While acknowledging that the connection between the violation and the employment setting was slightly more attenuated than \u201ctraditional notions of whistleblowing,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the majority found that the violation was \u201cvery much within the employer-employee setting.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In light of the approach taken in <em>Dudewicz, </em>we decline to limit application of the wpa to reported violations of the employer alone. In accordance with the plain language of the act, plaintiff has alleged that she was fired because she reported or was believed to have reported a violation of the law. This allegation is sufficient to state a claim of wrongful discharge from employment under the wpa. In addition, we find that the reported violation in the present case was sufficiently related to the employment setting to be protected under the wpa. This is not to say that only those violations that are connected to the employment setting are contemplated under the wpa, only that the reported violation in the present case was sufficiently connected to the employment setting to be contemplated under the majority opinion in Dudewicz.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Accordingly, we find that the trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition on the wpa claim. Because the wpa is the exclusive remedy against discharge in retaliation for the conduct at issue, the grant of the motion for summary disposition on the public policy claim is affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">vn</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Lastly, plaintiff alleges that the defendant maintained written policies that gave rise to an express or implied contract of continued employment and a legitimate expectation that the plaintiff would not be terminated in a manner contrary to those policies. Both the circuit court and the Court of Appeals held that, as a matter of law, on the basis of defendant\u2019s written disciplinary policies alone, plaintiff had no legitimate expectation of continued employment, nor could an inference be drawn that the relationship between the parties was a contract for termination for good cause only. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">It is a settled tenet of Michigan law that employment contracts for an indefinite term produce a presumption of employment at will absent distinguishing features to the contrary. <em>Toussaint v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>408 Mich 579; 292 NW2d 880 (1980). To overcome this presumption, evidence may be produced that proves the existence of an express contract for a definite term or an express provision in a contract that forbids termination absent just cause. Proof of a promise of job security implied in fact, such as employment for a particular term or a prom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>ise to terminate only for just cause, may also overcome the presumption. <em>Rowe v Montgomery Ward &amp; Co, Inc, </em>437 Mich 627; 473 NW2d 268 (1991). Furthermore, company policies and procedures may become an enforceable part of an employment relationship if such policies and procedures instill legitimate expectations of job security in employees. <em>Rood v General Dynamics Corp, </em>444 Mich 107, 117-118; 507 NW2d 591 (1993). This presumption does not prevent proof of actual intent, nor should it sanction unjustified evasions of promissory liability.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Plaintiff does not allege that the defendant orally promised that her employment would continue indefinitely absent just cause for termination. Instead, she alleges that the defendant\u2019s Human Resources Policy Manual incorporated written policies that established a progressive disciplinary system whereby plaintiff could be terminated only for cause. It is by virtue of these policies that plaintiff contends that an express or implied contract of employment arose and that a legitimate expectation was created that plaintiff would not be disciplined or terminated in a manner contrary to those stated policies.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In <em>Toussaint, supra </em>at 610, this Court acknowledged that written statements in a company policy and procedure manual could give rise to enforceable rights in contract or to a legitimate expectation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>just-cause employ-ment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In <em>Renny v Port Huron Hosp, </em>427 Mich 415; 398 NW2d 327 (1986), that same idea found expression when the Court held that an employee handbook could provide the basis of a just-cause employment contract. Later, in <em>Rood, </em>this Court once again considered whether written policy statements provided the basis for an employment agreement terminable only for cause. The Court opined that where policy manuals are distributed throughout the company</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">our inquiry is not limited to the question whether the employer sufficiently manifested an intention to enter a single contractual just-cause employment relationship with the party before the Court, but, rather whether the employer has sufficiently manifested an intention to enter such a relationship with all employees subject to the relevant policies and practices. <em>[Id. </em>at 136.][<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>According to the Court in <em>Rood, </em>the mere dissemination of an employee handbook that implied a discharge-for-cause policy was insufficient <em>as a matter of law </em>to state a cause of action for breach of contract. Policies such as these \u201cmay become part of an employment contract only when the circumstances (e.g., the language in the handbook itself, or an employer\u2019s oral statements or conduct) clearly and unambiguously indicate that the parties so intended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Plaintiff alleges that she was wrongfully terminated from her employment contrary to defendant\u2019s written policy statements that expressly or impliedly formed the basis of her employment agreement with the defendant. Plaintiff acknowledges that defendant\u2019s policies were not unique to her, but were applicable to all the defendant\u2019s employees. Absent allegations in the pleadings that clearly and unambiguously indicate the defendant\u2019s intent to create a just-cause employment relationship with all its employees, or in particular with this plaintiff, we hold that plaintiff has not, as a matter of law, stated a claim on which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Plaintiff next contends that she had a legitimate expectation that she would not be terminated, or otherwise disciplined, in a manner contrary to the policies set forth in the defendant\u2019s policy and procedure manual. In other words, plaintiff contends that she had a legitimate expectation of just-cause employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The legitimate-expectations prong of <em>Toussaint </em>was founded on this Court\u2019s common-law authority to rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>ognize enforceable obligations that arise outside the scope of normal contract principles.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The theory operates as a viable, independent basis for enforcing promises of job security contained in policy statements that are circulated \u201ceither \u2018to the work force in general or to specific classifications of the work force, rather than to an individual employee.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Having announced its policy, and presumably having been benefited by that policy, the employer may not then treat it as illusory.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Employer policy statements that are \u201creasonably capable of being interpreted\u201d as promises to discharge for just cause only, or that are capable of two reasonable interpretations, create an issue of fact for the jury.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Defendant\u2019s policy manual states that its progressive disciplinary action plan \u201callows an employee the opportunity to make necessary corrections in their performance.\u201d It also establishes that discipline \u201cshould be used only when other efforts have failed or if the violation in question precludes other alternatives.\u201d Additionally, the manual states that \u201c[t]he supervisor must investigate early and thoroughly to be fair as well as to prepare for possible testimony that just cause existed for disciplinary action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Defendant\u2019s disciplinary policies also expressly indicate, however, that certain situations may require more severe action than that detailed in the policy manual. In situations where the appropriate disciplinary action is not designated in the manual, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>supervisor is not precluded from taking the necessary action, but is required to contact the Human Resource Department to \u201cdiscuss the proper approach.\u201d Particularly relevant are defendant\u2019s policies on involuntary terminations. Although the policies indicate that \u201c[e]very effort will be made to improve employee performance and correct deficiencies to avoid termination of employment,\u201d they also state that \u201c[w]ith the exception of serious infractions, an employee will be given the opportunity to correct deficiencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Infractions serious enough to require automatic termination are listed in the policy manual. Also listed are those infractions that may warrant dismissal on the first offense. Infractions resulting in possible first offense termination include \u201c[r]efusing to follow directions from supervisors or showing gross insubordination.\u201d The policy and procedure manual expressly states that the listed offenses are only \u201cexamples of common offenses for which employees may be terminated for cause\u201d and is not an all-inclusive list.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As this Court held in <em>Rood, supra, </em>\u201c[a] nonexclusive list of common-sense rules of behavior that can lead to disciplinary action or discharge, clearly reserves the right of an employer to discharge an employee at will.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Accordingly, the grant of summary disposition on plaintiff\u2019s breach of contract claim is affirmed.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>vm</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the grant of summary disposition on plaintiffs public policy and breach of contract claims, and reverse the grant of summary disposition on plaintiffs wpa claim.
