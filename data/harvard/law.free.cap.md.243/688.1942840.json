Naughton in his opinion in the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">The applicant, Randolph Brewster, claimed in one of his contentions that his confession was illegally elicited and could not be used against him at his trial, because he was \u201cdenied the assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution.\u201d The applicant was convicted on October 17, 1949, fourteen years before the decision in <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478, 84 S. Ct. 1758, 12 L. Ed. 2d 977 (1963). We have held that the exclusionary rule in <em>Escobedo </em>should not be applied retroactively. <em>Hyde v. State, </em>240 Md. 661, 215 A. 2d 145 (1965). We are happy to note that very recently the Supreme Court reached the same conclusion as we did in <em>Hyde </em>and denied <em>Escobedo </em>retroactive effect. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>34 U.S.L.
