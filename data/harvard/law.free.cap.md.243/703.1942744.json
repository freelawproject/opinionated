Supp. 1965) and Maryland Rule BK 46 a, he has filed a motion that he be released because the state has failed to answer his application within 15 days. Maryland Rule BK 43, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>which gives the State 15 days to respond to a petition for post conviction relief, has no bearing on the appeal procedure. The motion must, therefore, be denied and the application dismissed. <em>Lucas v.
