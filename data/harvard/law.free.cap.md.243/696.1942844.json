State, </em>235 Md. 497, 201 A. 2d 824 (1964). Petitioner contends that he was denied due process in his original trial by a combination of the inexperience of assigned counsel and the prosecuting attitude of the trial judge. Judge Menchine made an express finding that petitioner\u2019s counsel had \u201ccarried out his duties in the defense of the Petitioner with competence and vigor.\u201d He also found that the trial judge\u2019s participation in the trial \u201cdid not in any sense constitute judicial impropriety.\u201d We find in the record ample support for these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
