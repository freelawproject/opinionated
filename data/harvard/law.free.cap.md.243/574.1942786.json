We reversed the order of the trial judge (Byrnes, J.) disapproving the licensing of a film entitled \u201cThis Picture Is Censored.\u201d We remanded the case for a new hearing, which took place on 8 March 1966. This appeal is from the order of the trial judge (Harris, J.) disapproving, again, the licensing of the film, pursuant to the provisions of Code, Art. 66A, \u00a7 19 (1957 Cum. Supp. 1965)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since there is a description of the film in <em>Hewitt, </em>we shall not repeat it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">Can such an order of the trial judge, in proceedings brought pursuant to \u00a7 19 of Art. 66A, be supported without <em>expert </em>testimony is the single, narrow issue we are called upon, for the first time, to decide. Necessarily excluded, however, would be those \u201crare case[s] where there could be no doubt that the film <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>is obscene * * * [and where the film] not only speaks for itself but screams for all to hear that it is obscene.\u201d <em>Dunn v. Md. Bd. of Censors, </em>240 Md. 249, 255, 257, 213 A. 2d 751 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">It will be recalled that <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U. S. 476 (1957) (as expanded in <em>Fanny Hill</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>) </em>requires the trial judge to find, before the film can be proscribed, that \u201cthree elements must coalesce: it must be established that (a) [whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards] the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value.\u201d Mr. Justice Brennan, who announced the judgment of the Court in <em>Fanny Hill and in </em>whose opinion the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Fortas joined, went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">\u201cA book [film] can not be proscribed unless it is found to be <em>utterly </em>without redeeming social value. This is so even though the book is found to possess the requisite prurient appeal and to be patently offensive. Each of the three constitutional criteria is to be applied independently; the social value of the book [film] can neither be weighed against nor cancelled by its prurient appeal or patent offensiveness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">See also <em>Dunn, supra, </em>at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">In <em>Yudkin v. State, 229 </em>Md. 223, 182 A. 2d 798 (1962) Yudkin, who displayed and sold copies of Henry Miller\u2019s <em>Tropic of Cancer, </em>was charged with violating Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 418 (1957 Cum. Supp. 1965). Yudkin \u201cwas not permitted to offer the testimony of certain witnesses, such as professors of English literature, literary critics, authors of books, and other persons, <em>who may have been able to qualify as experts?\u2019, id. </em>at 226 (emphasis supplied), who would testify that the book was not obscene; that it would not arouse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>prurient interest of the average person; that it had literary merit; and that it had-received critical acceptance as literature, In reversing Yudkin\u2019s.conviction we held it was.error to exclude the proffered expert testimony. Judge Horney, who wrote the Court\u2019s bpinion,. quoted Mr. Justice.Frankfurter as saying that the \u201cpsychological or physiological consequences of questioned literature can as a matter of fact hardly be established except through experts.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQz\">In <em>Levine v. Moreland, </em>229 Md. 231, 237, 182 A. 2d 484 (1962), d\u00e9cided the same day as <em>Yudkin, </em>the question whether <em>Tropic of Cancer </em>was lawfully removed from the Montgomery County Public'Library was considered. In' remanding the case for further proceedings, Judge Horney,' who again spoke for the Court, said;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">\u201cFor if and when a trial of the issue of obscenity takes place, both sides will, of course, have full opportunity to summon such <em>expert </em>'and other witnesess as each may desire to testify regarding literary merit, contemporary community standards and-prurient interest. We point out, however, that the. testimony of such witnesses. (if it is otherwise' competent) is admissible and should then be received. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">\u201cWhile it is true that an exhibit of allegedly obscene material\u2014such as <em>Tropic of </em>Cancer\u2014speaks for itself and must in every case be perused and examined with care by the trier of facts that has. the. responsibility of determining the issue of obscenity, that does not.mean, as we pointed out in <em>Yudkin v. State, </em>229 Md. 223, 182 A. 2d 798 (1962), decided contemporaneously herewith, that \u25a0 other, competent evidence tending to show obscenity' or the lack of it should be excluded as irrelevant or immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"A-p\">. \u201cOf course, the <em>qualifications of expert or skilled witnesses </em>to testify is \u00e1 matter for the trial court to pass upon in the first, instance.

It only offered in evidence the film itself, contending that the two1 scenes complained of in the film met the burden of proof imposed upon it by the Act of 1965.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In <em>Dunn, supra, </em>the Board offered only the film, \u201cLorna.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>-Judge Hammond, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">\u201cIn our view, neither the judge who may sit in the circuit court to review the action of the Board nor the judges of this Court ordinarily would be qualified to determine whether a film exceeded these constitutional standards or tests <em>zvithout enlightening testimony </em>on these points. In \u2018A Stranger Knocks/ while the Board did not offer such testimony, the producer and would-be exhibitor of that picture did. For example, it was shown that the United States Bureau of Customs had admitted the film as not obscene, and that it had been exhibited in twenty-three states to not less than 250,000 people without apparent harmful effects. The philosophical background of the picture was described by its producer in an affidavit. Favorable criticisms by experienced critics all over the country were presented. <em>Other experts </em>in the field testified that the pic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ture was not obscene.\u201d 240-Md. at 255-56. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">\u201cTestimony of the type given as to <em>\u2018A </em>Stranger Knocks\u2019 and offered in <em>Yudkin </em>and <em>Levme </em>as to \u2018Tropic of Cancer\u2019 should be available to the Board as to almost every film it thinks is obscene. * * * [W]e do not feel qualified to say by virtue of a viewing of the picture only\u2014anymore than was Judge Prendergast, in our opinion\u2014that to the average person applying either local or national contemporary community standards the dominant theme of \u2018Eorna\u2019 was an appeal to prurient interest, or that the picture exceeded customary limits of candor in its representations of sex or the sexual mores of the community pictured or that it was utterly without redeeming social importance or literary or artistic value.\u201d 240 Md. at 257.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In <em>Hewitt, supra, </em>the trial judge arranged for a jury panel to view the film and thereafter based his order, in part, on the answers to questionnaires submitted to them. In reversing his order and remanding the case, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Ul\">\u201cIt will also be observed that there was no showing that any of the jurors had the <em>expertise, skill or experience </em>necessary to be able to give <em>expert </em>or <em>meaningful </em>testimony on the nature and limits of contemporary community (whether local, regional or national) standards of tolerance in the area of obscenity, or the customary limits of candor .in the description or representation of sex, or the factors to be considered in determining whether a film has redeeming social importance. We do- not, at this time, hold that such a showing would have been <em>essential </em>to the admissibility \u25a0of their testimony, assuming they were, in all other respects, competent wtinesses; we simply say we find it difficult to perceive how such testimony can, in these \u25a0circumstances, be helpful to the trial judge.\u201d 241 Md. at 292. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>In his concurring opinion in <em>Barmy Hill, </em>Mr. Justice Douglas was moved to observe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201cWe are judges, not literary <em>experts </em>or historians or philosophers. We are not competent to render an independent judgment as to the worth of this or any other book, except as in our capacity as private citizens. * * * If there is to be censorship, the <em>wisdom of experts </em>on such matters as literary merit and historical significance must be evaluated.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The author of a note entitled <em>The Use of Expert Testimony in Obscenity Litigation, </em>1965 Wisc. L. Rev. 113, 131-32,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> after discussing a number of recent decisions, including <em>Yudkin, supra, </em>concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">\u201cObscenity litigation appears to1 be on the increase, and it is, therefore, important that the lower courts be equipped with evidentiary rules which will enable them to effectively <em>utilize expert testimony </em>in these lawsuits. In the meantime, the lower courts should take it upon themselves to become aware of the problems involved in the use of <em>expert testimony </em>in obscenity actions, and exercise that judicial supervision which is most likely to make such testimony reliable and effective. It is extremely important that trial courts develop this ability in any event, for the evidentiary rules that appellate courts eventually evolve for future guidance are certain to vest a significant amount of discretion in the trial judge. Appellate courts can formulate the rules, but trial judges must apply them. And, as pointed out throughout this Note, the complex problems involved in determining <em>the proper role of expert witnesses in obscenity litigation </em>create a formidable challenge to both the formulation and the application of these rules.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>But see Lockhart &amp; McClure, <em>Censorship of Obscenity: The Developing Constitutional </em>Standards, 45 Minn. L. Rev. 5 (1960), wherein is espoused the notion that appellate judges are as cap\u00e1ble as any expert to determine whether material is obscene.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">We think it is obvious that this Court has welcomed expert testimony in cases arising under \u00a7 19 of Art. 66A. And, while it may not be quite as obvious, it is nevertheless true that we have, at times, suggested, if not actually encouraged, the use of expert witnesses in these cases. We must now decide whether expert testimony is necessary to support orders of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">We have said many times that whether a witness is qualified to express an opinion on the subject as -to which he is called to testify,' is a matter for the trial court to pass upon in the first instance and that the court\u2019s ruling will not be reversed unless it is shown to have been based upon an error of law or to have been the result of an abuse of judicial discretion. <em>Yudkin, supra; Turner v. State Roads Comm., </em>213 Md. 428, 132 A. 2d 455 (1957) and the cases therein cited. In obscenity litigation, however, this Court will be required to scrutinize more closely the rulings of the trial judge in respect of the qualifications and competency of witnesses offered as experts. In <em>Jacobellis v. Ohio, </em>378 U. S. 184, 190 (1964), Mr. Justice Brennan explicitly declared that \u201cthis Court [the Supreme Court]- cannot avoid making an independent constitutional judgment on the facts of the case as to whether the material involved is constitutionally protected.\u201d In <em>United States v. Klaw, </em>350 F. 2d 155 (1965), Judge Moore, speaking for the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, in an obscenity appeal, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\u201cThe most cursory perusal of the cases makes it obvious that the various agencies, officers, judges and juries that initially find material \u2018obscene\u2019 do not have the last word to say on the matter. Rather, the Supreme Court has left no doubt that any abnegation of judicial supervision in the \u2018obscenity\u2019 field would be inconsistent with its duty to uphold constitutional guarantees. * * * Thus, the Court has definitely accepted the responsibility of being the final arbiter and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>has refused to accept the judgments of officials, judges or juries to the contrary. The \u2018sufficient evidence\u2019 test on review advocated by the Chief Justice has not been adopted. See Jacobellis v. State of Ohio, supra, 378 U. S. at 190, n. 6, 84 S. Ct. 1676 (dissenting opinion). The burden on this court at this appellate stage should be no less. And the enlarged judicial function in this area requires that we consider the proof or lack thereof and the manner in which the case was placed before the jury, not just whether the material could possibly be brought within the range of the so-called \u2018obscenity\u2019 statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The trial judge must be mindful, therefore, of our obligation to assess his rulings in this regard in light of their objective correctness instead, merely, of determining whether he has, or has not, abused his discretion or- that he is in error as to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Our most recent discussion of the status of the expert witness in our courts will be found in <em>State Health Dep\u2019t v. </em>Walker, 238 Md. 512, 520-22, 209 A. 2d 555 (1965). The trial judge, in that case, refused to allow Robert Brown, Chief of the Bureau of Environmental Hygiene of the Maryland Department of Health to express an opinion, in respect of a proposed sewage disposal system on Assateague Island, holding that, in the circumstances, he failed to qualify as an expert witness. We quote, at some length, from Judge Marbury\u2019s opinion because of the relevance of his language to the issue under consideration.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">\u201cThis case presents a basic question of evidence, i.e., upon what conditions and under what circumstances may a witness deemed to be an expert, express an opinion in the field of his expertise. This Court has dealt many times with expert and opinion testimony. An expert opinion derives its probative force from the facts on which it is predicated, and these must be legally sufficient to sustain the opinion of the expert. <em>Doyle v. Rody, </em>180 Md. 471, 25 A. 2d 457. The premises of fact must disclose that the expert is sufficiently familiar with the subject matter under investigation to elevate his opinion above the realm of conjecture and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>speculation, for no matter how highly qualified the expert may be in his field, his opinion has no probative force unless a sufficient factual basis to support a rational conclusion is shown. <em>State, Use of Stickley v. Critzer, </em>230 Md. 286, 186 A. 2d 586, and cases cited therein; <em>Hammaker v. Schleigh, </em>157 Md. 562, 147 Atl. 790. The opinion of an expert, therefore, must be based on facts, proved or assumed, sufficient to form a basis for an opinion, and cannot be invoked fi&gt; supply the substantial facts necessary to support such conclusion. The facts upon which an expert bases his opinion must permit reasonably accurate conclusions as distinguished from mere conjecture or guess. <em>Marshall v. Sellers, </em>188 Md. 508, 53 A. 2d 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">\u201cDespite all of his education and sanitation experience, Brown was not sufficiently familiar with the whole of Assateague Island or the particular properties belonging to the appellee, to be able to express any honest and meaningful opinion as to the effect the soil and geological conditions there present would have upon the functioning of a sewage disposal system. The record indicates that he had made only two trips to Assateague and that the first of these was to inspect an area at the northern end of the island, far removed from the locations involved here. On his second trip he inspected the Ocean Beach development, a section of which includes the parcels belonging to appellee.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201cEducational and field experience are important in determining whether a witness is an expert qualified to pass judgment in a given case, but they alone are not sufficient to supply the basis upon which to rest an opinion. The opinion of an expert must be based on knowledge gained from observation or experience, standard books, maps of recognized authority, or any other reliable sources. <em>Casualty Ins. Co. v. Messenger, </em>181 Md. 295, 29 A. 2d 653. Here, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>cannot be said to have abused its discretion, for the judge was exceedingly careful to determine that neither Brown nor anyone in his Department other than Miss Schoolfield and Dr. Waesche, who reached conclusions contrary to Brown, had made an investigation to determine the conditions prevailing on the island. With such a limited opportunity for personal observation and no reliable information available from other sources, it is manifest that any opinion on this subject expressed by Brown would have amounted to mere conjecture. Such opinions, even by experts, are not admissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">It must not be supposed that we are suggesting quite so strict a rule in obscenity cases (i.e., cases arising under \u00a7 19 of Art. 66 A). The average person, however, is certainly not qualified to give expert testimony in this area. The fact that he might have a degree in education, sociology or theology does not, per se, make him qualified; nor does the mere fact that he is a social worker, a probation officer, a teacher, a priest, minister or rabbi. Something more is required. He need not, of course, be an authority but there must be an affirmative showing (and an opportunity to cross-examine thereon) that he is possessed of some special and sufficient knowledge and information, however acquired, which would elevate his opinion above the realm of conjecture, speculation or personal reaction, in respect of any one of the three elements of the test promulgated in <em>Roth </em>and expanded most recently in <em>Fanny Hill. </em>His knowledge and information may have been acquired in his business or in his profession or it might be the by-product of an avocation, sport or hobby. He may have sought it assiduously or he may have absorbed it casually. Mr. Crawford H. Greenewalt, for instance, is a chemist by profession. His occupation is chairman (formerly president) of E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. He is not an ornithologist. Yet there is probably not a court in the world which would not declare him qualified to testify as an expert on the coloring, configuration, classification and flight characteristics of hummingbirds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The term \u201cexpert\u201d has many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>lights and shadows. It can denote a man who is a recognized authority and, perhaps as accurately, a fellow who once went to the-city. At what point between those two extremes he will be allowed to express an opinion on the witness stand will be for the trial judge to decide in the first instance. But whatever his status in life may be, his qualifications can not be assumed; they, must be established by evidence. The quality or quantity of that evidence occasionally may require some adjustment, depending upon the exigencies of the moment, and in such circumstances the trial judge will need to exercise the full measure of his judgment, skill and discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">While we stand by our holding in <em>Hewitt </em>in respect of admissibility, we now advance one step- further and hold that such testimony, standing alone, cannot, support an order disapprov- ' ing a film for. licensing because it is said to be obscene.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">We must- now consider the qualifications of the witnesses .who- appeared .before the trial-judge and appraise their testimony. We shall discuss, first the witnesses who do not qualify as experts by any standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">, John-E.

He was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">\u201cQ. Is it any part of your interest to acquaint yourself with the community standards of acceptability in the portrayal of sexual matters? A.

His basic objection, to the film was that it \u201cdoes not present a true portrayal of an American woman.\u201d On cross-examination he was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">\u201cQ. Mr. Burkhardt, my question was that in connection with motion pictures and considering in these pictures the live, nude, moving, naked woman, that you don\u2019t agree with the Court\u2019s decision that that type of projection is not necessarily obscenity? A. No, I don\u2019t agree with it that it is necessarily not obscenity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">He stated further he \u201cdid not think the American woman\u201d would \u201cdisplay * * * [herself] like this.\u201d He thought the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>\u201caverage normal American woman,\u201d if nude, would \u201cturn her back in the room\u201d where only her husband was present. Still on cross-examination, he was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">\u201cQ. Don\u2019t you believe that discussion of obscenity, of what does or does not constitute obscenity are in fact of some importance and interest in the United States today? A. Well, it is negative.

I believe they feel it is of great importance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">It is certainly clear that Mr. Burkhardt\u2019s testimony does not rise above the level of personal reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Rabbi Jack A.

In our judgment no further comment is required.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">\u201cQ. You have testified that insofar as residence and your duties are concerned, these are confined to a local area.

He is a graduate of the University of Maryland. He has been employed for the past six years as a consultant in the Division of Juvenile Causes of the Baltimore courts. There is nothing in his testimony to suggest that he is anything more than the average man. Indeed, he so characterizes himself. He testified he lived \u201cin an enlightened community;\u201d he reads \u201cbooks about movies and watches TV; the things that the average human being does.\u201d Asked whether the dominant theme of the film appeals to prurient interest, he replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">\u201cA.

It will not be necessary for us to decide whether they, or any of them, are so qualified because, for one reason or another, as will be shown, their testimony in this case does not support the Board\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Aldine R. Bird has been in Baltimore more than forty years. He is employed by the Baltimore News-American to comment in his daily column on television, veterans\u2019 affairs and \u201ca few other things.\u201d He has been engaged in newspaper work for about fifty years, ten of which were spent with the Associated Press. He visits Hollywood every summer to study television \u201cproduction modes\u201d and to \u201cinterview the stars in person.\u201d' In the past (before television he said) he has written critical reviews of motion pictures. <em>He thought he would be </em>familiar with \u201ccommunity standards\u201d of morality but there was no showing that he was. Pie claimed a knowledge of community standards on a national basis for the reason that one \u201ccanno.t live in a community without getting <em>some feeling </em>and * * * [he didn\u2019t] <em>feel </em>that Baltimore is any different than any of the rest of the country * * He could \u201conly answer that in the light of the Baltimore area, where * * * [he] lives, and the people with whom * * * [he] come[s] in contact.\u201d He was \u201conly vaguely\u201d familiar with the Supreme Court\u2019s obscenity decisions which he knew about only from \u201cnews stories.\u201d He testified the film was \u201cpurely propoganda to work up and undermine the feelings of the audience in regard to motion picture censor [sic].\u201d He was asked if the film employed propaganda to produce an idea. His answer was, \u201cYes, that\u2019s correct. It has to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The late George B. Browning, for a while, was a moving picture critic for the World Telegram of New York. He was, at the time of trial, similarly employed by the Baltimore News-American and he was also a correspondent for two trade journals, \u201cBox Office Motion Picture Daily\u201d and \u201cFilm Daily.\u201d He also had some connection with a theatre owners\u2019 association. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Their meetings, he said, were \u201clargely of a social nature.\u201d Counsel for Hewitt agreed he was an expert only on the literary merits of motion pictures.

H. Gardner, <em>47 </em>years old, has been employed as a drama and motion picture critic by the Baltimore Sun for about fifteen years. Counsel for Hewitt stipulated he was \u201can expert and qualified to testify in regard to motion pictures.\u201d Asked if the film had \u201cany social value\u201d he said \u201cit was- an argument against censorship.\u201d The following quotations from his testimony are enlightening:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">\u201c(The Court) What was the dominant theme of the film, in your opinion, Mr. Gardiner [sic] ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">\u201cA. Well, the dominant theme, taking the film entirely at its face value, the dominant theme is simply censorship. What is censorship? The question of what is censorable. I would have to say that was the theme because that\u2019s the only thing that connects all of the episodes together; the framework of the movie, the question of what can be shown and what cannot be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">\u201cQ. Well, as a professional critic of motion picture films, is it your judgment that it has in fact a theme or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">\u201cA. You see, we are dealing here with certain technical problems and the technical problems is the word \u2018theme.\u2019 The Judge asked what the theme of the movie was. By my definition, that is the theme and it is a valid theme because that\u2019s the thread that runs throughout the story. * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>* =K *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\u201cQ. Would there be any other type of appeal, in your judgment, that this picture has any other appeal besides the erotic appeal? A. Well, of course, I could not entirely exclude education. It is quite possible that someone might go to see this movie because he hears it is censorable and he is interested in knowing what is censorable. I mean you can\u2019t exclude that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Dr. Nick A. Ford has been head of the English Department at Morgan State College for the past nineteen years. He agreed that he did not \u201chave expert knowledge in the field of morals and morality in this country.\u201d Responding to a question whether he claimed \u201cto have expert knowledge of things that may or may not be of social importance in this country\u201d he said, \u201cI would say to a degree, yes.\u201d We set forth in full the balance of his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t it a fact that in this country today the issues of censorship are very much in discussion? A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">\u201cQ. It is not also true that this is the subject very much for controversy ? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">\u201cQ. In your opinion, varying and rather vigorously argued on both sides ? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t it further true that the motion picture \u2018This Picture Is Censored\u2019 presents an argument in regard to obscenity?<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A. It presents what I would call a fake argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-12\">\u201cQ. Despite the way you regard it, it is in fact an argument representing a point of view, isn\u2019t it? A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-13\">Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-14\">\u201cQ. The expression of ideas in literature and motion pictures has some social importance, doesn\u2019t it? A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">There is no need for us to essay an exposure of the inadequacies or deficiencies in the testimony of Bird, Browning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Gardner and Ford in respect of their knowledge of community (whether \u201cworld-wide, nation-wide,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> section-wide, statewide, country-wide, precinct- or township-wide\u201d)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>'standards of tolerance in the description or representation of sexual matters, except to observe that the existence of sufficient knowledge in this area should not be established merely by asking the witness if he has it and having him answer yes. It .seems to us that the very least he ought to show is how, when and where he acquired such knowledge and some reasonable statement of the extent of it. Bird and Browning agreed that the film was propaganda against censorship. Gardner said it was an argument against censorship, that that was its dominant theme, and that it was quite a valid theme. Ford insisted it was a \u201cfake argument\u201d but he agreed that it presented a point of .view and that the expression of an idea .or point of view has social importance in any area where there is controversial discussion. Judge Harris concluded, despite the testimony of 'Bird, Browning, Gardner and Ford, that the film is utterly without any redeeming social value. In his opinion,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Judge Harris infers that he might have reached a different result on \u201credeeming social importance\u201d had the . scenes in the film been actual excisions from censored pictures instead; of \u201ccopies\u201d or reenactments 'of the 'excisions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Our comment in <em>Hewitt, supra </em>(de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>cided 3 February 1966) may very well have suggested such a conclusion to him. Nevertheless, we think <em>Fanny Hill </em>(decided 21 March 1966) compels a somewhat different view. The Massachusetts court had no difficulty deciding that <em>Fanny </em>was obscene under the prurient appeal and the patent offensiveness criteria but, said the Supreme Court, it \u201cmisinterpreted the social value criterion.\u201d The following passage demonstrates how the Massachusetts court applied the social value criterion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">\u201cIt remains to consider whether the book can be said to be \u2018utterly without social importance.\u2019 We are mindful that there was \u2022 <em>expert testimony, much of which was strained, </em>to the effect that Memoirs is a structural novel with literary merit; that the book displays a skill in characterization and a gift for comedy ; that it plays a part in the history of the development of the English novel; and that it contains a moral, namely, that sex with love is superior to sex in a brothel. But the fact that the testimony may indicate this book has some minimal literary value does not mean it is of any social importance. We do not interpret the \u2018social importance\u2019 test as requiring that a book which appeals to prurient interest and is patently offensive must be unqualifiedly worthless before it can be deemed obscene.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Fanny Hill, </em>206 N. E. 2d 403, 406 (Mass. 1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Mr. Justice Brennan delivered the Supreme Court\u2019s last word in the matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">\u201cHence, even on the view of the court below that <em>Memoirs </em>[Fanny Hill] possessed only a modicum of social value, its judgment must be reversed * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Some members of this Court will not deny having read Mr. Cleland\u2019s erotic fantasy. All of us, however, have read the description of the book in Mr. Justice Clark\u2019s dissenting opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>(in <em>Fanny </em>Hill) which, some say, is spicier, albeit shorter, than the book itself and, therefore, we have no difficulty whatever concluding that, if <em>Memoirs </em>has \u201credeeming social value,\u201d then, <em>a minori, </em>so does the film in this case, however cheap, dull and tawdry it may be. Nor does the fact that the scenes are reenacted, rather than real, diminish by much the feeble thrust of its argument or propaganda against censorship. The testimony of the \u201cexperts\u201d produced by the Board support, not the finding of the trial judge, but a finding that the film is \u201cnot <em>utterly </em>without redeeming social value.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">\n<em>Order reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-14\">.
