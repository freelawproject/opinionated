No findings of fact or conclusions of law are in the judge\u2019s order relative to this contention, probably due to the fact that it was abandoned at the hearing below. We shall therefore adopt the trial judge\u2019s order as to all of the contentions answered therein and answer the last one ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">There are several reasons why the claim, is of no avail to the petitioner. His application for leave to appeal contains no statement of reasons as to why the lower court\u2019s order should be reversed or modified as required by Maryland Rule BK 46 b. In addition, applicant took the stand at his original trial and substantiated his statement. Moreover this Court affirmed petitioner\u2019s convictions on October 22, 1963, some 8 months before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478. Both the Supreme Court and this Court have held that <em>Escobedo </em>is not to be applied retrospectively to convictions which became final before its date. <em>White v. Warden, </em>240 Md. 736; <em>Hyde v. Warden, </em>240 Md. 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">For the above reasons, the application must and will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
