Morris Wood previously had been convicted in the Circuit Court for Frederick County of assault and battery, and on September 24, 1962, he was sentenced to the Maryland Institute for Men for not more than three years. Subsequently, on January 28, 1965, Judge Patrick M. Schnauffer, sitting without a jury, found him to be a defective delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The applicant raises the following contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">1. That there was an unconstitutional delay of nearly twenty-eight months from the time of applicant\u2019s commitment to Patuxent Institution to the time of his adjudication as a defective delinquent. The delay has postponed the running of the two years which must lapse before applicant can seek a redetermination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">2. That Art. 31B violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">3. That Art. 3IB violates the double jeopardy provisions of the federal Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">4. That Art. 3IB is an <em>ex post facto </em>law, in violation of Art. I, \u00a7 10, of the Constitution of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-12\">5. That Art. 31B violates the self-incrimination provision of the Fifth. Amendment of the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-13\">6. That in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applicant was denied the right to have an attorney present at the time of his mental examination at Patuxent Institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-14\">7. That sentence for an indeterminate period of time is a denial of equal protection to the applicant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-15\">8. That the finding of defective delinquency was against the weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-16\">With regard to the applicant\u2019s first contention, we pointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>out in <em>McCloskey v. Director, </em>230 Md. 635 (1963), that since defective delinquency proceedings are civil in nature, the constitutional rights to a speedy trial are not applicable. Applicant\u2019s contentions two, three, four, five and seven have all been disposed of in <em>Director v. Daniels, </em>243 Md. 16 (1966). The sixth contention also fails because the civil nature of defective delinquency proceedings makes the \u201cright to counsel\u201d inapplicable during examination. <em>Blann v. Director, </em>235 Md. 661 (1964). With regard to applicant\u2019s eighth contention, this Court has repeatedly held that questions of the weight of the evidence are not available on application for leave to appeal if, in a non-jury case, the finding of the lower court was not clearly erroneous. <em>Alt v. Director, </em>240 Md. 262 (1965); <em>Blakney v. Director, </em>239 Md. 704 (1965); <em>Colbert v. Director, </em>234 Md. 639 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
