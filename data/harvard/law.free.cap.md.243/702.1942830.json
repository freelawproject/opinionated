While Judge Byrnes reasonably concluded that petitioner did in fact knowingly waive the right to be represented at his trial by court-appointed counsel, it appears that petitioner also contends that it is constitutionally impossible to waive this right. This point was settled in <em>Ware v. State, </em>235 Md. 131, which held that <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>372 U. S. 335, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799, did not change the long-standing rule that an accused has a right to' proceed without counsel following a knowing and intelligent waiver. The principle remains unaffected by the more recent Supreme Court cases dealing with right to&gt; counsel and self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
