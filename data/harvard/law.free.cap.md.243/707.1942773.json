J., sitting without a jury), dated 16 November 1964, holding that the applicant is still a defective delinquent and recommitting him to Patuxent Institution under the provisions of Code, Art. 31 B (1957, Cum. Supp. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>The following contentions are raised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">1. That Judge Manley stated it was not within his power to release the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">2. That the psychiatrist, engaged at the defendant\u2019s expense, \u201cmade incongruous statements indicative of his indecisiveness in making a diagnosis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">3. That the associate trial counsel in attendance at the court proceedings was in the \u201cestimate of the defendant non-committal in that he did neither refute or support statements of the principal trial attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-8\">4. That Dr. Boslow did, throughout the trial, compare notes with the doctor in the employ of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-9\">5. That the defendant\u2019s privately engaged attorney was not qualified to represent the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">6. That the defendant\u2019s attorney introduced into evidence a medical report deemed not altogether favorable to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">None of these contentions were raised below and they are, therefore, not properly before us. <em>Herrman v. Director, 229 </em>Md. 613, 182 A. 2d 351 (1962). Furthermore there is no merit to these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
