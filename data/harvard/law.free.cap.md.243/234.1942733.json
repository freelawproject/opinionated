At the trial below it was stipulated that the verdict of the jury should be in favor of Friedel, \u201cthe only matter at issue * * * [being] the amount of damages to be awarded.\u201d A verdict of $8,000 in his favor was the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">After the accident Friedel was taken to Union Memorial Hospital where he was examined and treated by Dr. Robert E. Martin for multiple lacerations of the head, abdomen and left leg. In the admission note there is an entry reading \u201cBack\u2014 Neg.\u201d He went home the following day. Dr. Martin saw him at intervals during the following three weeks. In a letter to Friedel\u2019s attorney, some nine months later, he stated that Friedel\u2019s wounds \u201call [had] healed satisfactorily\u201d and that he had discharged him \u201cfrom further followup care\u201d on 28 March 1962. There was no mention of an injury to^ or complaint about his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Friedel was examined, on 10 July 1962-, by Dr. George H. Yeager who reported his impression as follows: \u201cMultiple subjective complaints for which an objective explanation cannot be found, when considered from the viewpoint of injuries incurred March -8, 1962.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">Ten days after the accident Friedel filed with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission a claim for compensation in which no mention is made of an injury to his back. In mid-April he resumed his job as a route salesman for a dairy. After five weeks he quit because, he said, he couldn\u2019t do the work. After that he drove a taxicab, worked for the State Roads Commission, caught stray animals for the Humane Society, and, since 1963, he has worked at his trade. He is a plumber. Dr. H. Al-van Jones examined him on 8 October 1963. He testified that \u201cexcept for * * * [noting] minor developmental or structural abnormalities * * * namely, * * * [a] tilted fifth vertebra and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>mild scoliosis * * * [his] examination * * * [was] entirely normal and negative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Dr. Packard, an orthopedist, testified that Friedel had been sent to him by counsel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cfor orthopedic evaluation only, and not for treatment.\u201d He first examined Friedel on 16 July 1962. When he began to read Friedel\u2019s history from his. notes, counsel for appellant objected. The trial judge (Turnbull, J.) did not rule on the objection but he told the doctor not to give \u201cthe history which he [Friedel] gave * * * [him],\u201d and to give only his \u201cevaluation as a result of * * * [his] examination.\u201d Dr. Packard thereupon described, at length, what he found in the-course of his examination, virtually none of which has any relevance here. He said Friedel complained of some pain, beginning \u201cabout three weeks prior\u201d (about 15 weeks after the accident) to his first visit, in the area of his left sacroiliac joint and he concluded he had a \u201csymptomatic left sacro-iliac [\u2022sfc]' joint.\u201d He felt the basic symptoms could \u201cbe aggravated by a trauma\u201d but that the cause of his condition was \u201cnot traumatic.\u201d Since some months had gone by, between the injury [8 March to about 25 June] \u201cand the [onset of] symptoms in this region * * * [he] couldn\u2019t see any definite causal connection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">He saw Friedel again on 17 December 1962. On this occasion he found that his chest expansion had increased lj4 inches, which, he said, was \u201cthe most important physical finding\u201d made on that date. His \u201csymptoms\u201d were still centered about \u201cthe left sacro-iliac [\u00bf\u00bfc] joint.\u201d He said that he could not discuss \u201cphysical impairment\u201d because \u201cthe range of motion he <em>* * * </em>[was] able to demonstrate for his back would be considered within normal limits.\u201d Over objection he was then permitted to say, \u201chis symptoms are <em>all subjective in nature </em>yet [they] appear to be real. This would therefore be considered as a <em>five per cent loss oj use of patient\u2019s lower hack.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Appellant\u2019s motion to strike was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Because of its importance we quote verbatim the following portion of the transcript:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\u201c(The Court) As a result of your examinations, Doctor, the two examinations which you made, were you able to come to a conclusion as to the cause of the disability which you estimated ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">\u201c(Mr. Smalkin) I would have to object, if your Honor please, with due deference to that question, because the Doctor was not permitted to give a history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">\u201c(The Court) Well, excluding the history which you received were you able to come to a conclusion as to the cause of the disability which you estimated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">\u201c(Mr. Smalkin) Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">\u201c(The Court) Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">\u201c(The Witness) No. Without the history I couldn\u2019t come to a conclusion as to the causal connection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-10\">\u201c(Mr. Smalkin) I renew my motion to strike the opinion of the Doctor as to disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-11\">\u201c(The Court) Considering the history which was given you, taking that into consideration, could you come to an opinion, with reasonable medical probability, as to the cause of the disability which you estimated. Objection; overruled. You can answer, Doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-12\">\u201c(The Witness) My conclusion would be based on the history that the patient gave me, namely, he had been injured in an accident, that subsequent thereto he developed these back complaints and thereafter had had no trauma, nor had he previously had any trauma to this same area. Because I felt he localized his symptoms well, I felt this lent great credence to the fact his symptoms were real, were not simply something that he told me, and because of this I felt that I should assign some acknowledgment to this medically as to permanency, and that is the reason I arrived at this five per cent figure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-13\">\u201c(The Court) Motion to strike; motion overruled. Do you have an opinion, with reasonable medical probability, as to whether or not the condition which you found was brought about as a result of an accident of some kind ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-15\">\u201c(Mr. Smalkin) Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>\u201c(The Court) Overruled. Answer the question yes or no, please, Doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">\u201c(The Witness) To the opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201c(The Court) Yes. Do you have an opinion as to whether or not it was brought about as a result of an accident ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">\u201c(The Witness) There is no definite medical proof, to my mind, this can be attributed to a trauma irrefutably with reasonable medical certainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">\u201c(The Court) Motion to strike; motion overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Produced next was Dr. Hilbert M. Levine, another orthopedist, to whom Friedel was sent also by counsel. He examined him first on <em>7 </em>September 1962 \u201cto see if he needed any further treatment.\u201d He added that he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel that he needed any further treatment at that time\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t give him any treatment.\u201d Friedel visited Dr. Levine again on 20 February 1963, \u201cfor evaluation only\u201d he (Dr. Levine) believed. The third visit was 14 October 1963, again \u201cfor evaluation purposes.\u201d The fourth and last visit, \u201cfor evaluation\u201d was 22 May 1964. He (Dr. Levine) had been told the trial of the case was imminent. Actually it was not reached, as earlier noted, until 22 March 1965. Over objection he told of Friedel\u2019s complaints and of his being sent to Dr. Packard by <em>\u201cthe insurance company.\u201d </em>Judge Turnbull would not let him tell what Friedel said his injuries were at the time of the accident although a moment later he said it was his \u201cimpression * * * that * * * [Friedel] had sustained multiple injuries in a truck accident on March 8, 1962.\u201d Most of his lengthy testimony consisted of a recitation of irrelevant details seldom rising above the level of pointing out that the patient had hands, feet and a head. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected to his stating any impression which was based in part upon another physician\u2019s interpretation of X-ray pictures. We quote again, verbatim, from the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">\u201c(The Court) Strike that out, and strike out the other answer which he started to give.

You may give that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">\u201c(The Witness) Based on my examination \u2014 examinations, my impression was that the patient had sustained a chronic lumbosacral strain and a left sacroiliac [sic] strain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">\u201c(Mr. Smalkin) I move the answer be stricken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">\u201c(The Court) Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">\u201cQ.

Judge Turnbull, probably anticipating a verdict favorable to appellant (defendant) said, \u201cI am going to do you a favor and overrule your motion.\u201d Responding to further argument the court said, \u201cYour logic is irrefutable, but the motion is overruled.\u201d A similar motion in respect of the testimony of Dr. Levine was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-21\">No attempt was made to elicit the opinions of Dr. Packard and Dr. Levine by the use of hypothetical questions nor is there any showing why this was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-22\">The exclusion of medical testimony based on statements by \u201cpatients\u201d who are not patients is supported by the weight of authority, included in which are the decisions of this Court. We think it unnecessary to do little more than quote from our most recent consideration of the rule. In <em>Wilhelm v. State Traffic </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>Comm., </em>230 Md. 91, <em>97, </em>185 A. 2d 715 (1962), Judge Prescott (now Chief Judge), for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">\u201cDoctor Rothstein, a psychiatrist, was called to the witness stand by the appellants. The appellee, Paul Edward Burke, objected to his reciting the history he had obtained from the wife when he examined her. The doctor testified that he did not treat her, and there was no attempt made to show that he was employed to recommend treatment of her by her other physicians. Cf. <em>Yellow Cab Co. v. Hicks, </em>224 Md. 563, 168 A. 2d 501. This Court has consistently and repeatedly recognized the principle that a non-treating physician may not relate the history given to him by a litigant. <em>Parker v. State, </em>189 Md. 244, 55 A. 2d 784; <em>Francies v. De Baugh, </em>194 Md. 448, 71 A. 2d 455; <em>Wolfinger v. Frey, </em>223 Md. 184, 162 A. 2d 745. And in <em>Connor v. State, </em>225 Md. 543, 171 A. 2d 699, this Court, in an opinion by Judge Horney, flatly held that this rule applied to psychiatrists. In addition, appellants admit that Dr. Rothstein would have repeated \u2018the same history which was given by Dr. Filtzer and Dr. Jones [appellants\u2019 witnesses who had already testified]\u2019; hence, if the doctor\u2019s opinion were desired, there is no apparent reason for not having asked him a hypothetical question. There was no error here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Judge Horney also said in <em>Connor v. State, </em>225 Md. 543, 557, 171 A. 2d 699 (1961) (cited in the above quotation) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">\u201cIt was likewise proper to exclude testimony as to the \u2018subjective\u2019 conclusions of the psychiatrist based on the complaints of the defendant. <em>What we have said with regard to the \u2018history\u2019 of the defendant applies with equal force to the non-objective symptoms. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Friedel contends it was not error to allow the testimony of Dr. Packard and Dr. Levine because they were, in fact, treating physicians. We are unable to find any merit in this conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>tion. Dr. Packard said Friedel \u201cwas referred to * * * [him] for orthopedic evaluation only, <em>and not for treatment!\u2019 </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Dr. Levine said he examined Friedel \u201cto see if he needed any further treatment.\u201d He concluded he didn\u2019t need \u201cany further treatment\u201d and he \u201cdidn\u2019t give him any treatment\u201d then or \u201cat any time thereafter.\u201d Later, when asked by the Court, \u201cdid you give him any treatment at all by way of medication or manipulation or anything of that kind\u201d he replied, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">After the jury had been impaneled and sworn the court, as earlier indicated, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">\u201c(The Court) For the record, gentlemen, it is stipulated by counsel in open court that the Plaintiff is entitled to a verdict in his favor, and that the only matter at issue is the amount of damages to be awarded, is that correct, gentlemen ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">\u201c(Mr. Ritchey) Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">\u201c(Mr. Smalkin) Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Friedel contends the stipulation, ipso facto, establishes a causal connection between the accident and all injuries recited in the declaration. It is there stated that the \u201cplaintiff sustained * * * injuries to his head, <em>back, </em>body and limbs.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) We do not find in the record anything to suggest that the trial judge considered this contention or that any argument was advanced urging him to do so. Maryland Rule 885. Nevertheless, we find it devoid of merit. The language in the declaration is obviously nothing but the customary catchall. It seems clear to us that the main issue, from the very beginning, has been the extent of the appellee\u2019s injuries and whether they were the result of the accident. It has been said that the language of a stipulation will not be so construed as to give it the effect of an admission of a fact obviously intended to be controverted. 83 C.J.S., <em>Stipulations, </em>\u00a7 11 (1953). The argument reflects ingenuity and imagination on the part of counsel which very well may be turned to account in different circumstances but which, in this instance, must be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Since the judgment will be reversed and the case remanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>it will not be necessary for us to consider the other contentions made by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\n<em>Case remanded for a new trial on the issue of damwges.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\n<em>Appellee to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\">.
