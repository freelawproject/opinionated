Warden, </em>241 Md. 728, 217 A. 2d 338; <em>Taylor v. Warden, </em>238 Md. 645, 210 A. 2d 514. However, because the petitioner was convicted of the crime of murder, we have reviewed the contentions he put to the trial judge. We find no merit in any of them and for the reasons stated by Judge Byrnes in his opinion the application will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-15\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
