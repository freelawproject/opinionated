Director, </em>240 Md. 262 <em>(1965); Murel v. Director, </em>240 Md. 258 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">Applicant\u2019s second contention is likewise without merit since he was convicted of a misdemeanor punishable by commitment in the penitentiary (automobile larceny) and therefore fits the statutory definition of a defective delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">For these reasons, his application for leave to appeal must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
