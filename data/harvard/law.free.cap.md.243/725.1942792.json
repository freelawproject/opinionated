Subsequently, on January 18, 1965, the applicant was found to be a defective delinquent by Judge Cardin, sitting without a jury, and committed to Patuxent Institution pursuant to Code (1957, 1965 Cum. Supp.), Article 31B, Section 5. An application for leave to appeal and a memorandum in support thereof have been filed on behalf of the applicant by his court appointed attorney in which he sets forth the following contentions :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\">1. That Article 3IB is unconstitutional because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\">(a) it violates the guarantee of due process,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-11\">(b) it violates the guarantee of equal protection of law,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-12\">(c) it violates the guarantee against double jeopardy,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-13\">(d) it imposes confinement without maximum limitation,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-14\">(e) it imposes confinement after applicant\u2019s sentence has expired, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-16\">(f) it is an ex post facto law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-17\">2. That the verdict was erroneous and against the weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-19\">3. That there was no evidence sufficient to support a finding of defective delinquency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-21\">The contentions raised in 1 (a) through (f) have been completely answered by this Court in the case of <em>Director v. Daniels, </em>243 Md. 16, 221 A. 2d 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-22\">With regard to the applicant\u2019s second contention, we have consistently held that questions as to the weight of the evidence are not available on application for leave to appeal if, in a non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>jury case, the finding is not clearly erroneous. <em>Alt v. Director, </em>240 Md. 262, 213 A. 2d 746; <em>Blakney v. Director, </em>239 Md. 704, 211 A. 2d 734; <em>Colbert v. Director, </em>234 Md. 639, 199 A. 2d 801. Since the report of the Patuxent Institution resulted in a finding that the applicant was a deefctive delinquent, the applicant\u2019s third contention goes to the weight of the evidence, not to the sufficiency thereof, and is not available to him. <em>Mumford v. Director, </em>243 Md. 723, 223 A. 2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
