Trinity contested the magistrate\u2019s determination that the warrant application established probable cause, and the district court affirmed the magistrate\u2019s ruling. Trinity appealed to this court. While that appeal was pending, OSHA filed a separate action to adjudicate Trinity in civil contempt for failure to hon- or the warrant. The district court held Trinity in contempt and ordered that the inspection take place; the district court retained jurisdiction to award OSHA costs and attorney\u2019s fees. Trinity appealed both orders. Trinity\u2019s three appeals are here consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-16\">Our review of the district court\u2019s determination of the correctness of the magistrate\u2019s decision that the affidavit adequately established probable cause is made without deference to the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>727 F.2d 392, 394-95 (5th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Freeman, </em>685 F.2d 942, 948 (5th Cir.1982). However, in determining whether the magistrate correctly decided this issue, we refrain from any sort of <em>de novo </em>review and instead accord great deference to the magistrate\u2019s decision. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>818 F.2d 345, 348 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Phillips, </em>727 F.2d at 395; <em>Freeman, </em>685 F.2d at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>OSHA\u2019s entitlement to conduct an administrative inspection does not depend on a demonstration of probable cause to believe that conditions in violation of the Occupational Safety and Health Act exist on the premises. <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., </em>436 U.S. 307, 320, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 1824, 56 L.Ed.2d 305 (1978). Indeed, probable cause in the criminal law sense is not required. <em>Id. Barlow\u2019s </em>held that for purposes <em>of </em>an administrative search warrant, \u201cprobable cause justifying the issuance of a warrant may be based not only on specific evidence of an existing violation but also on a showing that \u2018reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an ... inspection are satisfied with respect to a particular [establishment].\u2019 \u201d 436 U.S. at 320, 98 S.Ct. at 1824 <em>(quoting Camera v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 538, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1736, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967)). Thus an employer\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights are protected where the warrant shows \u201cthat a specific business has been chosen for an OSHA search on the basis of a general administrative plan for the enforcement of the Act derived from neutral sources.\u201d <em>Barlow\u2019s, </em>436 U.S. at 321, 98 S.Ct. at 1824-25. The requirement that OSHA secure a warrant before conducting an inspection is intended as a safeguard against the exercise of \u201cunbridled discretion [by] executive and administrative officers, particularly those in the field, as to when to search and whom to search.\u201d 436 U.S. at 323, 98 S.Ct. at 1826.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\"><em>Brock v. Gretna Machine &amp; Ironworks, </em>769 F.2d 1110, 1112 (5th Cir.1985), held that <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>is satisfied if: 1) the warrant is sought pursuant to a plan based on sufficient specific neutral criteria; and 2) the warrant application adequately explains why an inspection of the particular establishment is within the program. The second inquiry entails consideration of the plan\u2019s industry rank list for the state in question and consideration of the methodology used in the selection of the particular establishment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">The warrant application in the instant case included a detailed explanation of CPL 2.45A, the general inspection plan OSHA utilizes. This circuit has acknowledged that this plan satisfies <em>Gretna\u2019s </em>first prong: as a whole it is susceptible of neutral, nonarbitrary application. <em>Industrial Steel Products Co., Inc. v. OSHA, </em>845 F.2d 1330, 1334 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 556,102 L.Ed.2d 582 (1988).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the appellants in <em>Industrial Steel </em>were wholly owned subsidiaries of Trinity Industries, Trinity\u2019s attack on the general inspection plan is barred by collateral es-toppal. <em>Nations v. Sun Oil Co., </em>695 F.2d 933, 938 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 893, 104 S.Ct. 239, 78 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-10\">Trinity further argues, however, that the warrant application fails the second <em>Gret-na </em>prong. <em>Industrial Steel </em>clarified <em>Gret-na\u2019s </em>requirement that the issuing court consider the methodology used in the selection of the particular business: the court has sufficient information before it if the warrant application contains an encoded establishment list for the state in question, the inspection register, or a description of how OSHA compiled the list and register. 845 F.2d at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-11\">OSHA\u2019s application for an inspection warrant here did not include copies of the relevant establishment list, inspection register, or statewide industry ranking report. However, the application included the affidavit of the Safety Supervisor of OSHA\u2019s Dallas office which gave a detailed description of how the plan was executed. The national OSHA office provided the Dallas area office with a statewide industry ranking report ranking 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Codes according to lost workday injury (LWDI) rates. Only industries in a state which have a lost workday injury rate of 3.4 or greater per 100 full-time employees are included on this report. The industries are ranked on this report beginning with the industry with the highest LWDI rate first and continuing down to the industries with a LWDI rate of 3.4. The national office also provides each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>area office with a list of establishments for each SIC Code on the statewide industry ranking report located within the area office's jurisdiction. The SIC code for Trinity is 3441, which appears on Texas\u2019 industry ranking report and has a LWDI rate of 8.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">The affiant further stated that the national OSHA office provided the Dallas area office with three statewide safety establishment SIC lists: 1) a list of industries in Texas with a LWDI rate of 3.4 or greater (the high rate establishment list); 2) a list of manufacturing establishments within industries whose SIC Code has a LWDI rate below 3.4 (the low rate establishment list); 3) and a list of establishments within certain nonmanufacturing industries that are required by OSHA to keep records (the nonmanufacturing establishment list). The industries on each establishment list are ranked according to their LWDI rates from highest to lowest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although CPL 2.45A empowers each area director to make appropriate additions to the high rate establishment list prior to use of the list for scheduling inspections, Trinity was not added by the Dallas office but was on the establishment list provided by the national office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">The inspection register was compiled as follows. Pursuant to the general inspection plan, the Dallas area OSHA director calculated the total number of establishments to be inspected in 1988. Of the total number of projected programmed high rate safety inspections, five percent were randomly selected from the low rate establishment list and five percent were selected in consecutive order from the nonmanufactur-ing establishment list. The remaining number of programmed safety inspections were selected in rank order from the high rate establishment list. This formed the inspection register, which was divided into two cycles, with those establishments listed in the first half of the list placed in cycle one and the remaining placed in cycle two. Trinity was placed in the first inspection cycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-9\"><em>Industrial Steel </em>recognized that a description of how the establishment list and inspection register were compiled gives the magistrate sufficient information upon which he can base his analysis of the methodology used in the selection of the particular establishment at issue. 845 F.2d at 1337. The descriptions of the compilation of the establishment list and inspection register provided by OSHA in its warrant application echo those found sufficient in <em>Industrial Steel. </em>845 F.2d at 1335 n. 3. We therefore reject Trinity\u2019s argument that the descriptions of the establishment list and inspection register were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-10\">Trinity argues that the warrant application was fatally flawed because OSHA failed to include a copy of the statewide industry ranking report. OSHA\u2019s failure to append the report is not fatal. <em>Gretna </em>requires only a consideration of the statewide industry ranking report. 769 F.2d at 1112. A description of how the report was compiled will suffice<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> absent a factual showing by the target company that it was arbitrarily placed on the list or that its competitors were arbitrarily removed from the list.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Industrial Steel, </em>845 F.2d at 1337. Trinity made no such showing. The statewide industry ranking report ranks industry sectors in descending order according to their LWDI rates and gives each sector a SIC Code. Individual businesses are not listed on the report. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>court expressly found that there was no evidence that Trinity had been incorrectly classified under the SIC system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-4\">We conclude that the magistrate had before him sufficient information to determine that Trinity was placed on the inspection register by an application of the plan\u2019s neutral criteria. To meet the standards set by <em>Barlow\u2019s, </em>the magistrate need only conclude that an application of the neutral plan resulted in the selection of the individual establishment contesting the warrant. <em>Industrial Steel, </em>845 F.2d at 1337.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The purpose of <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>warrant requirement is to prevent the exercise of unbridled discretion, particularly at the local level, as to which businesses are inspected and when they are inspected. There was no evidence that Trinity\u2019s placement on OSHA\u2019s inspection register was the result of anything but the application of OSHA\u2019s neutral inspection plan. The district court correctly upheld the magistrate's ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">Because the district court correctly determined that the inspection warrant was properly issued, he did not abuse his discretion in holding Trinity in civil contempt for its failure to honor the warrant and in awarding costs and attorney\u2019s fees to OSHA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Whitfield v. Pennington, 832 </em>F.2d 909, 915 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>487 U.S. 1205, 108 S.Ct. 2846, 101 L.Ed.2d 883 (1987); <em>Petroleos Mexicanos v.
