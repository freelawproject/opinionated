Matter remanded to the respondent, without costs or disbursements, for a determination by the Secretary of State of the charges against the petitioners. The determination sought to be reviewed was not made or executed by the Secretary of State or his designee. It therefore did not comply with the requirements of subdivision 2 of section 441-c of the Real Property Law. Hopkins, J. P., Rabin, Shapiro and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
