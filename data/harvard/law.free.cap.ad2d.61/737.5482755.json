In assessing this real property for the five-year period under discussion, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors affecting value. In this particular proceeding, it should be emphasized that the petitioner bought this property for $229,103 in 1965. Adjusting for inflation, the declining socio-economic condition in the South Bronx, the age of the buildings involved, their amenities and all other relevant indicia, we find that this record does not sustain an assessed valuation over $270,000 for any of the five years in question.
