Motion granted, without costs, to the extent that the appeal from the decision dated March 24, 1977, shall be heard on the brief and appendix filed and served on or about December 2, 1977, and upon the board\u2019s original files in the cases listed in the full record list dated April 30, 1976. Respondent board\u2019s time to file a brief is extended to 20 days from the date of this decision. In his brief the Attorney-General is requested to furnish the basis for the board\u2019s action which conditioned approval of appellants\u2019 application to the board for a shortened record on appellants\u2019 consenting to limit the issues on the appeal from the decision dated March 7,1973, to a question of substantial evidence. Cross motion by respondent board to dismiss notice of appeal dated April 21, 1977, denied, without costs. Mahoney, P. J., Sweeney, Kane, Staley, Jr., and Larkin, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
