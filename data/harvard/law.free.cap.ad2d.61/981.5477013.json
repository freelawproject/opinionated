Judgment and order reversed, with $50 costs and disbursements, motion denied and complaint reinstated. As a subsequent judgment creditor of her former husband, the plaintiff has standing to maintain this action to vacate and set aside on equitable grounds the prior confession of judgment obtained by the defendant from the plaintiff\u2019s former husband (see <em>Johnston v Erlanger Realty Corp., </em>162 Misc 881, 886; 9 Carmody-Wait 2d, NY Civ Prac, \u00a7\u00a7 63:163, 63:180).
