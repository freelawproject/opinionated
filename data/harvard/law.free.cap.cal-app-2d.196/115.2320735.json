We shall point out why we have concluded that the trial court correctly ruled that the mortuary fell within the scope of \u201ccemetery purposes\u201d and properly condemned as invalid the county\u2019s subsequent attempt to defeat the ruling by the adoption of an emergency ordinance prohibiting the establishment of mortuaries in cemeteries.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Respondent, \u201ca non-profit cemetery association organized and existing under the laws of the State of California . . . long prior to 1947 . . . has operated, and is presently in the business of operating a cemetery for the burial of the dead. ...\u201d On October 20, 1960, respondent applied to appellant, the building inspector of the County of Contra Costa \u201cfor a building permit to construct an Administration Building, Crematory and Mortuary\u201d on its-property, but appellant informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>respondent that \u201che would not issue said permit\u201d because under the existing ordinances of the county \u201ccemetery property could only be used for cemetery purposes\u201d and \u201ca mortuary is not a cemetery purpose.\u201d Thereupon respondent sought and obtained a writ of mandate directing appellant \u201cto accept . . . [respondent\u2019s] application for a building permit and to desist from denying . . . [respondent\u2019s] application on the grounds of either Section 8142 or 8317 of the Ordinance Code of the County of Contra Costa. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Pursuant to the order of the court, rendered on October 31, 1960, appellant on that very day accepted for filing respondent\u2019s application for a building permit. On the following day, November 1, 1960, \u201cthe Board of Supervisors of Contra Costa County passed and adopted Ordinance No. 1488,\u201d an \u201cemergency measure\u201d which specifically prohibited \u201c [a] 11 commercial uses and purposes including but not limited to mortuary, sale or manufacture of monuments or markers, sale of flowers or decorations and sale or manufacture of caskets in a cemetery\u201d except on approval of an application for a land permit. Belying upon the ordinance, appellant refused to process respondent\u2019s application; as a consequence respondent sought a second writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Passing upon the application for the second writ, the trial court held the ordinance invalid because \u201cno factual showing of any immediate threat to the preservation of the public peace, health or safety,\u201d supported any \u201cemergency.\u201d The court found that \u201c \u2018the emergency seems to have been . . . [respondent\u2019s] pending application,\u2019 \u201d and, further, that \u201cthe passing of such an emergency ordinance in the circumstances shown at bar affords strong evidence in \u2018support of the trial court\u2019s finding of arbitrary action.\u2019 \u201d The court ordered \u201cthat a writ of mandate be issued to . . . [appellant] commanding him to issue a building permit to . . . [respondent] pursuant to the application of . . . [respondent]. . . . \u201d Appellant has appealed both this and the prior case.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">We turn to an examination of the conflicting positions on the first issue: appellant\u2019s claim that the \u201cCemetery Ordinance of Contra Costa County (Ordinance Code \u00a7\u00a7 8316 and 8317) does not permit a mortuary use of property dedicated for cemetery purposes,\u201d and respondent\u2019s contrary assertion that a \u201cmortuary is a \u2018cemetery purpose\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of the ordinance code.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">- The ordinance provides as follows: \u201cIt is hereby declared by the Board of Supervisors that the disposal -of human-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>remains is affected by the public interest. ... A regulation of cemeteries, as contained in the general state laws, does not meet the public need for regulation of location and layout of cemeteries with respect to other uses of land in the vicinity. The public interest and the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare, the conservation of property values, and the encouragement of the orderly development of the county require that this occupation be regulated.\u201d (Ordinance Code, \u00a7 8316.) \u201cCemetery means any one or a combination of more than one of the following in a place used or intended to be used fqr cemetery purposes: (1) A burial park for earth interments. (2) A mausoleum for crypt or vault interments. (3) A crematory or crematory and columbarium for cinerary interments.\u201d (Ordinance Code, \u00a7 8317(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\">The county enacted the preceding ordinances in 1955 at a time when sections 7003 and 7004 of the Health and Safety Code were already in force. Section 8317 (a) of the ordinance is indeed identical to 7003 of the code. And section 7004 of the code defines \u201c \u2018burial park\u2019 \u201d as \u201ca tract of land for the burial of human remains in the ground, used or intended to be used, and dedicated, for cemetery purposes.\u201d Section 7020 defines \u201c \u2018cemetery business,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018cemetery businesses, \u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018cemetery purposes\u2019 \u201d to mean \u201cany and all business and purposes requisite to, necessary for, or incident to, establishing, maintaining, operating, improving, or conducting a cemetery, interring human remains, and the care, preservation, and embellishment of cemetery property, in-' eluding, but not limited to, any activity or business designed for the benefit, service, convenience, education, or spiritual uplift of property owners or persons visiting the cemetery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"> In concluding that a mortuary is a \u201ccemetery purpose\u201d within the meaning of section 8317 (a) of the ordinance code of Contra Costa County we have been guided by four considerations: the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of parallel language, the presumption that the county intended to adopt the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of that language, the failure of the argument that the alleged enumeration of the uses in the ordinance code precludes the mortuary, and the impact of extant conditions upon the legislative meaning. We discuss these points <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Although three cases have touched this problem, only the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wing </em>v. <em>Forest Lawn Cemetery Assn. </em>(1940), 15 Cal.2d 472 [101 P.2d 1099, 130 A.L.R. 120], easts any clarifying light upon it, The courts in <em>Forest Lawn </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>State Board of E. &amp; F. Directors </em>(1933), 134 Cal.App. 73 [24 P.2d 887], and <em>Vesper </em>v. <em>Forest Lawn Cemetery Assn. </em>(1937), 20 Cal.App.2d 157 [67 P.2d 368], confronted the issue but did not decide it. In the first named of these two eases petitioner sought a mandate to compel the State Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors to grant him a license to conduct the business of a funeral director as provided in Statutes of 1929, chapter 140, despite the fact that the mortuary was located on cemetery grounds. Although the court posed the question whether \u201cthe establishment of a mortuary in a cemetery\u201d was \u201cconsistent with the purposes for which the land was dedicated\u201d or was \u201cexpressly authorized by the Cemetery Act itself\u201d (p. 78), the court specifically refused to pass upon the issue, saying as to this contention, \u201ca judicial question of importance is raised, and were it necessary for the determination of the issues here presented that question would receive serious consideration.\u201d (P. 79.) The court concluded that the location of the mortuary in the cemetery did not prevent compliance with the act and issued the mandate. The same court once more formulated, but did not resolve, the issue in the later case of <em>Vesper </em>v. <em>Forest Lawn Cemetery Assn., supra, </em>20 Cal.App.2d 157, 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">While <em>Wing </em>may not be binding upon us as a decision of stare decisis, the Supreme Court\u2019s language is highly persuasive. Claiming the violation of a restrictive negative easement in her deed, the owner of burial space in the cemetery sought, in that case, to enjoin the operation of a funeral director\u2019s existing embalming business on the premises. The court, however, found that the deed did not designate the dominant tenement and therefore concluded that \u201cSince . . . there is no designation of a dominant tenement and no expression of any general plan of which plaintiff\u2019s conveyance is a part, there is no basis for holding that her deed contained a valid equitable easement in the lands retained by or subsequently to have been conveyed by her grantor.\u201d (P. 483.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The court likewise probed the question whether \u201cthe operation of a mortuary is inconsistent with the holding and occupying of land <em>\u2018exclusively as a cemetery </em>for the burial of the dead\u2019 \u201d and concluded that it was not. (P. 476.) The lot holder contended that the deed incorporated section 608 of the Civil Code, which provided that lands acquired by a cemetery were to be held and occupied \u201cexclusively as a cemetery for the burial of the dead. ...\u201d The court assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"?\">*?</page-number>\u201cfor the purposes of this opinion only, that the terms of said section were in effect incorporated into plaintiff's deed. . . .\u201d (P.476.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\">Citing other eases which embraced within the term \u201ccemetery\u201d many ancillary purposes, the Supreme Court states: \u201cCemeteries have always been and are now used primarily for the burial of the dead, but portions of cemetery properties have likewise been used for numerous other incidental purposes, such as greenhouses, nurseries, chapels, administration buildings and tool houses. . . . Manifestly the operation of a mortuary where bodies are prepared for interment or cremation is a much closer and more intimate incident of burial than the activities above referred to. We therefore, conclude that cemetery lands may be used for such purposes as are incident to the burial of the dead, so long as the rights of the lot owners in their own lots and their rights of egress and ingress are not invaded.\u201d (Pp. 477, 478.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The <em>Wing </em>decision plays a second role in the interpretation of the ordinance. When the county adopted its ordinance in 1955, the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the definition in' the Health and Safety Code had been in the books for some 15 years. The county in its ordinance used terminology which corresponded to that in the Health and Safety Code. When one legislative body adopts another such body\u2019s identical language, which the Supreme Court has previously interpreted, we cannot assume that the enacting body has disregarded such a clarified definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Indeed, we may presume the county intended \u201c \u2018to adopt the construction as well as the language of the prior enactment. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Holmes </em>v. <em>McColgan </em>(1941), 17 Cal.2d 426, 430 [110 P.2d 428]; <em>Erlich </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1961), 55 Cal.2d 553, 558-559 [11 Cal.Rptr. 758, 360 P.2d 334].) If the definition of \u201ccemetery\u201d in the Health and Safety Code, according to <em>Wing, </em>includes a mortuary, Contra Costa County, in using the term, may be presumed to have intended a parallel inclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">We cannot believe that the above interpretation fails because, as appellant argues, the ordinance\u2019s specification of \u201cseveral automatic uses\u201d does not include mortuaries and thereby impliedly excludes them. The special listing of \u201cmausoleums\u201d and \u201ccrematories\u201d does not mean that \u201cburial parks\u201d could not embrace mortuaries. The term \u201cburial park\u201d must cover all activities falling within \u201ccemetery purposes.\u201d Allied to earthen interment or cremation is that which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>is preparatory to it: embalming. The embalming and ancillary procedures to interment or cremation are as much \u201ccemetery purposes\u201d in the mortuary as they are in the burial park.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">We concur with Judge Taylor\u2019s observation in his memorandum of decision. \u201cThe fact that the state law and the county ordinance specifically provide for mausoleums and crematories in addition to burial parks in the definition of a cemetery does not detract from the definition of 1 burial parks, \u2019 which includes all uses for cemetery purposes. It merely emphasizes the inclusion of these more recent and, in the case of cremation, more highly regulated cemetery uses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Finally, in view of the current development of the multi-purpose uses of many commercial enterprises, we would hesitate, in the absence of clear legislative expression, to insist that the definition compels but one such use. We cannot construe the ordinance on the assumption that the governing board acted in a dismal disregard of contemporary economic conditions. While yesterday\u2019s business unit may have centered on a single function, today\u2019s enterprise proliferates into many. The cemetery is no exception to this trend, and in interpreting ordinances enacted in 1955 we read the words \u201ccemetery purposes\u201d in the light of the current economic realities.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Having upheld respondent\u2019s position that a mortuary falls within the scope of cemetery purposes as provided in the ordinance code of Contra Costa County, we need not proceed further to its argument that \u201c [t]he State of California has fully occupied the field with respect to the activities of cemetery associations, and Contra Costa County may not contravene nor can it assert definitions and controls contrary to the State.\u201d Respondent apparently admits that the county \u201chas the power to determine the <em>location </em>of the cemetery, but the County cannot enact an ordinance . . . contrary to the statutes of California . . . or . . . prohibit a cemetery association from carrying on a mortuary business on lands zoned for cemetery purposes. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The argument rests upon the premise that the state statute, in using the words \u201ccemetery purposes,\u201d necessarily encompasses the mortuary; thus, respondent\u2019s pre-emption point must depend upon the reading of the state enactment in the same manner that we have construed the ordinance. Our interpretation of the ordinance in concurrence with respondent\u2019s position renders unnecessary discussion of respondent\u2019s further contention as to pre-emption.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Appellant\u2019s second major contention, as we have set forth above, is that the county effectively defeated the court\u2019s order that the permit be issued by the enactment of an emergency ordinance prohibiting the operation of mortuaries in cemeteries. Appellant posits \u201cthe emergency creating the need for interim emergency action\u201d upon \u201cthe decision of the Superior Court. . . .\u201d We believe, however, that the pertinent eases, which we discuss below, sustain the trial judge\u2019s holding that his own prior ruling could not be the occasion for any such \u201cemergency\u201d legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><em>Munns </em>v. <em>Stenman </em>(1957), 152 Cal.App.2d 543 [314 P.2d 67], involved mandamus proceedings by Munns and Lloyd, and their respective wives, to compel the issuance of building permits for the construction of single-family residences on their properties. Petitioners Munns demonstrated that on November 3, 1953, when the currently effective building ordinance imposed no requirements or conditions for a permit, they had applied for one. Nevertheless the city rejected the request, and on December 1, 1953, enacted an ordinance specifying new requirements and conditions for the issuance of permits. The appellate court stated: \u201cWhile it is generally true that such an application must conform to an ordinance passed while action upon the same is pending [citation], that rule seems not applicable to a situation in which the permit clearly should have been issued before amendment to the law. . . . An annotation of this subject in 169 American Law Reports says, at page 585: \u2018The rule that interim changes in the law affect the determination of pending applications for permits and licenses is not applied where the permit or license should have been issued prior to the change. \u2019.. . The least that can be said in this connection is that the passing of such an emergency ordinance in the circumstances shown at bar affords strong evidence in support of the trial court\u2019s finding of arbitrary action.\u201d (Pp. 551-552.) The court pointed out that \u2018 \u2018 our decision need not rest upon that ground. \u201d (P. 552.) It invalidated the ordinance upon the basis of its discriminatory effect. This fact does not reduce the persuasiveness of the quoted language.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">In <em>County of San Diego </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1954), 126 Cal.App. 2d 804 [272 P.2d 519], defendant purchased nonzoned land for the construction of a trailer park; Ms application for a permit was denied because of the current circulation of a petition for zoning. When defendant obtained an alternative writ of mandate to secure Ms permit, the county adopted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>interim ordinance zoning the land exclusively for residential and agricultural use. The court found the ordinance invalid as to defendant; the county thereupon sought an injunction to prohibit the building of the park. In affirming the denial of the injunction the appellate court rested its finding of discrimination against defendant in part upon the nature of the circumstances prompting the passage of the zoning ordinance and the speed of its adoption. Both these concomitants appear here. (See also <em>Bernstein </em>v. <em>Smutz </em>(1947), 83 Cal.App.2d 108,124 [188 P.2d 48].)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Appellant relies on two eases for a contrary position but neither sustain the argument. Thus in <em>Price </em>v. <em>Schwafel </em>(1949), 92 Cal.App.2d 77 [206 P.2d 683], plaintiffs applied on January 12, 1948, for a building permit to construct a shopping center. On January 15, 1948, the city rezoned the property as residential only. Upholding the zoning ordinance, the appellate court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument of estoppel against the city\u2019s assertion of the ordinance, noting that plaintiffs \u201chad ample notice that the city council was not satisfied with the zoning and that plans for the repeal of the May ordinance [allowing construction of a shopping center] were being continually discussed.\u201d (P. 84.) The court, however, warned that if \u201can application for a building permit accompanied by the proper plans and other data had been made during that interim there is no question but that appellants would have been entitled to the permit under the existing \u2018interim\u2019 ordinance.\u201d (P. 84.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Nor does <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Board of Public Works </em>(1925), 195 Cal. 477 [234 P. 381, 36 A.L.R 1479], compel a different result. There the city issued a building permit to plaintiffs, then revoked it \u201cfor the reason that the city counsel . . . was contemplating a comprehensive zoning plan. . . .\u201d (P. 482.) Plaintiffs filed a complaint to compel issuance of the permit; five days later the city passed an \u201cemergency ordinance\u201d prohibiting the type of construction in the area which plaintiffs had proposed. (P. 482.) The court upheld the ordinance as \u201can initial unit\u201d of a comprehensive zoning plan and therefore a \u201cvalid exercise of the police power.\u201d (Pp. 496-497.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Nothing in the record in the instant case indicates that the ordinance formed any part of a zoning plan or that appellant had even contemplated the ordinance before the trial court\u2019s first decision; the enactment of the ordinance stemmed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the county\u2019s attempt to frustrate respondent\u2019s plans. The generality of the language of the ordinance does not conceal its single, realistic purpose: the prohibition of respondent\u2019s mortuary. As amicus curiae in behalf of respondent states, \u201cSuch an isolation of one party as the object of the Board\u2019s legislative action is a plain discrimination,- one that cannot survive testing under accepted principles of constitutional law. [See e.g., <em>Yick Wo </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>118 U.S. 356, 373-374 (6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220).]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Neither the attempted frustration of the order of the court nor the narrow interpretation of \u201ccemetery purposes\u201d to exclude a mortuary use can sustain appellant\u2019s attempt to upset the trial court\u2019s well-considered judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Bray, P. J., and Duniway, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
