That leaves open the entire question of her right to a separation and to support. What she may have received under the separation agreement is a matter to be considered when the court comes to make its decree awarding alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\">The order appealed from should therefore be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AltL\">Whatever effect the separation agreement may have upon the question of alimony, it does not oust the court of jurisdiction to entertain a separation action. I therefore concur in the affirmance of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">LAUGHLIN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b269-7\">DOWLING, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXn\">I dissent, upon the ground that there was a valid outstanding agreement of separation between the parties, under which the plaintiff had received and still retains property belonging to the defendant; that said agreement was never canceled or repudiated by the defendant, but he simply failed to make payments thereunder for a period of time; and that plaintiff is in no position to claim that the agreement can be repudiated by her until she has tendered back the property received by her thereunder. With such a valid outstanding separation agreement between the parties, there can be no action brought for a separation. Randolph v. Field, 165 App. Div. 282, 150 N. Y. Supp. 822.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
