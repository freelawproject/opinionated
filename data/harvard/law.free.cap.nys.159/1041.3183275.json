Supp. 1107.</seealso>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b1080-6\">The following is the opinion of Borst, J., at Trial Term:</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1080-7\">The evidence sustains plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the work and materials, the value of which he seeks to recover in this action, were furnished by-authority from defendant owner\u2019s duly authorized agent and were of the value claimed. She has had the benefit of this work and these materials and should pay therefor. Her counsel urges, however, that under the pleadings and proof in this action, plaintiff cannot have a recovery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1080-8\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The complaint is insufficient for a foreclosure of the liens, in that it does not state whether any other action has been brought to recover any part of the lien debt. Lien Law, \u00a7 43; Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 1629; Schwartz v. Klar, 144 App. Div. 37, 128 N. Y. Supp. 830. It is not necessary, therefore, to consider the other objections raised against plaintiff\u2019s right to have a foreclosure of his mechanic liens in this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1080-9\">The right to foreclose the liens failing, plaintiff, nevertheless, is entitled to personal judgment. The allegations of the complaint in each cause of action are sufficient for such judgment (Abbott v. Easton, 195 N. Y. 372, 88 N. E. 572; Bradley and Currier Co. v. Pacheteau, 175 N. Y. 492, 67 N. E. 1080; McDonald v. Mayor of New York, 113 App. Div. 625, 630, 99 N. Y. Supp. 122), the suggestion made by defendant\u2019s counsel that, no demand being made for a personal judgment, none could be granted, is without force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1080-10\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> Under our system of pleading, the plaintiff is entitled to any relief, irrespective of the prayer for judgment. Parker v. Pullman &amp; Co., 36 App. Div. 208, 218, 56 N. Y. Supp. 734. Further the Lien Law, by section 54, provides that, if the lienor shall fail for any reason to establish a valid lien in an action under the provisions of that law, he may recover judgment therein for such sums as are due him, or which he might recover in an action on contract against any party to the action. Clearly this section is authority for a personal judgment, where sufficient facts are alleged in the complaint for that purpose, as in this case, and the proof establishes the necessary facts for such judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1080-11\">A proposed decision may be prepared in accordance with these suggestions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1080-12\">Argued before KELLOGG, P.
