Upon defendant\u2019s failure to appear, proceedings were had which resulted in a judgment against him for a large sum of money. He now presents proofs showing very conclusively that he was not absent from the state on the day the order was made, and had not been absent therefrom, at least since April 8, 1915. So the essential fact stated in the affidavit upon which the order for substituted service was made was erroneously stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">It follows that the order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the order for substituted service, and the service made thereunder, and the judgment entered thereon, must be granted. Order filed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
