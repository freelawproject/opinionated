Thereafter the defendant received dividends, on the 102 shares, and after holding this stock for 17 months sold the same for a substantial price, thereby asserting ownership and receiving the profits. The action is by a trustee in bankruptcy to recover the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>$10,000 for the stock. Defendant demurs for insufficiency, relying, first, on the fact that, 10 per cent, not having been paid on the subscription, the subscription was void, and he did not become a stockholder. In my opinion he is estopped from asserting this claim, having accepted dividends on and sold the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The defendant relies, secondly, on the fact that it does not affirmatively appear that the money is necessary to pay the creditors. The United States District Court has made an order authorizing the plaintiff to issue a call or demand upon defendant for the amount due from him and authorizing the plaintiff to bring this action. The said court had jurisdiction of the subject-matter and the necessity of the call arid the amount thereof was for it to determine. If the.order was improvidently made, recourse must be had to that court; it cannot be collaterally attacked in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
