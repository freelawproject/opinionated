It was pointed out on the argument that the verdict was palpably inadequate, and the suggestion made that, if the parties could agree on increasing the recovery to $100 without costs, the judgment might, as so modified, be affirmed. Since plaintiff, however, is unwilling to acquiesce in this suggestion, the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
