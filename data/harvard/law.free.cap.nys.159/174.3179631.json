He submitted, on his motion to open his default, a verified answer in which he positively denied owing the plaintiff the entire amount claimed, but admits an indebtedness of $38. We think the order should be reversed, and the default opened, upon condition that he give an undertaking in the sum of $200, conditioned that he will pay any judgment and costs that may be rendered against him; otherwise, order affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
