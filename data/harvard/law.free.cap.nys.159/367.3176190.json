Merrell v. Merrell, 168 App. Div. 896, 152 N. Y. Supp. 970. There is nothing except the allegation in the complaint that defendant did commit the act. It is true that this is alleged as of plaintiff\u2019s own knowledge; but, even if she has personal knowledge of the fact, which is improbable, she could not testify to it on the trial. If, therefore, she has no other evidence than that which she presents on this motion, she must inevitably fail in her action.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Order reversed, and motion denied, without prejudice to a renewal of the motion upon proper papers.
