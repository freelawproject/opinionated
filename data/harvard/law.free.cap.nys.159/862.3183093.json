Plaintiff produced no witness to corroborate his story, and his own testimony shows that his version of the occurrence is not at all reliable; and on his cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>he said that the wagon from which he backed away was \u201cright near to the track and I don\u2019t know which way it was going, because I forgot myself altogether, and I didn\u2019t know where I was\u201d; that he did not know whether he turned around or backed up just before he was struck by the car; and in answer to the question, \u201cNow, then, you hacked across this uptown track, didn\u2019t you ?\u201d said, \u201cI didn\u2019t cross the track; 1 don\u2019t know where I was at that time; I didn\u2019t remember nothing at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Defendant\u2019s evidence was that plaintiff was struck by one of defendant\u2019s downtown cars, not by an uptown car; that plaintiff had crossed the south-bound track between the cross-walks, and that when he was about to cross the north-bound track he jumped backwards from an automobile, which was proceeding uptown, against the side of the downtown car, near the door, and was thrown forward on the street. Two apparently disinterested witnesses, a passenger on the south-bound car and the driver of the automobile, testified to these facts, in addition to the motorman and the conductor of the downtown car, and the motorman stated that the car was going at a rate of about 2 miles an hour and that there was no uptown car at the scene of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">A verdict for the plaintiff, based on his own uncorroborated story of the occurrence, qualified by his admissions that he did not know which way he was going or where he was, and did not remember anything at the time, and opposed to the positive testimony of two disinterested witnesses showing a state of facts for which the defendant was blameless, cannot support the judgment and requires a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
