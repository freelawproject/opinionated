Subsequently, by an order entered on the 7th day of February, 1916, the justice who tried the case vacated and set aside the judgment and dismissed the complaint upon the merits. The power to do this is attacked upon this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-22\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Section 6, subdivision 7, of the Municipal Court Cod.e, declares that the court has power \u201c * * * to vacate, amend, correct or modify any process, mandate, judgment, order or final order, in furtherance of justice, for any error in form or substance; to grant a new trial upon any of the grounds for which a new trial may be granted by the Supreme Court in an action pending therein, including the grounds of fraud and newly discovered evidence.\u201d The Appellate Term in the Second Department, in the case of Petsche v. MacDonald, 158 N. Y. Supp. 494, by a divided court, has held that the section above referred to confers power upon the Municipal Court, in a case tried without a jury, to vacate a judgment and order a new trial, although thus confer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ring upon that court more power than is possessed by the Bupreme \u25a0Court Without expressing an opinion upon that question, we are reluctantly constrained to follow that dr vision, in order to preserve uniformity in the two departments so f'ar as possible; but it is_ nowhere \u25a0\u2022suggested, nor can authority be four id for the right of a justice of the Municipal Court, not only to vacatr \u00bf a judgment rendered by him after -a trial without a jury, but, in adt1 iition thereto, dismiss the complaint upon the merits, thus not only <em>r </em>eversing himself, but precluding the plaintiff from beginning another action for the same cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Notwithstanding the Mit nicipal Court has been declared a court of record, it still remains^ a sto .tutory court, with such powers only as \u2022are given by statute within the limits of the Constitution of the state.
