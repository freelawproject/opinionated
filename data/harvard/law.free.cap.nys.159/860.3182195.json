The action is plainly one in conversion. Viewed as an action in bailment, it-lacks the essential element of an allegation that defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>failed to take due care of the bailment. Claflin v. Meyer, 75 N. Y. 260, 263, 264, 31 Am. Rep. 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The learned judge below, over defendant\u2019s objection, submitted the case to the jury on both theories, and permitted the jury to determine, if it found for the plaintiff, whether it was upon the theory of bailment or conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground \u201cthat it is uncontradicted that plaintiff * * * did not have the pin in his possession at the time that it was demanded\u201d was denied, although apparently there was no evidence from which the jury could infer otherwise. If, under the circumstances here disclosed, defendant did not have possession of the pin when the demand for its return was made, he could not be held in conversion. Salt Springs Nat. Bank v. Wheeler, 48 N. Y. 492, 8 Am. Rep: 564; Sternberg v. Schein, 63 App. Div. 417, 71 N. Y.
