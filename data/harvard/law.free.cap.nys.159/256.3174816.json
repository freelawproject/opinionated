See Lane &amp; Co. v. United Oil Cloth Co., 103 App. Div. 378, 92 N. Y. Supp. 1061.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-17\">We also think it should be held that, if there was not a technical novation, then that the contract which plaintiff performed, and under which the indebtedness for which this suit was brought was incurred, is one made by the new proprietors of the business by virtue of said correspondence, and not the original contract made between plaintiff and defendant Robbins and his copartner. The fifth, twentieth, and twenty-third findings of fact of the referee\u2019s report are disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-18\">The judgment as against the defendant Robbins is reversed, with costs, and the complaint as to said Robbins dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
