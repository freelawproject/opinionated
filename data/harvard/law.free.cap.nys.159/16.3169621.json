For a separate defense the marshal alleged that as marshal he attempted to levy an execution on the property of the judgment debtor, whereupon plaintiff interfered with Mm, that he called a police officer, and in the presence of the police officer plaintiff committed a breach of the peace, whereupon the officer caused plaintiff\u2019s arrest and brought Mm before a magistrate, and that the magistrate did discharge plaintiff from arrest. The separate defense did not deny the averments of the complaint, although they were elsewhere generally denied. <em>Held, </em>that as, under Code Or. Proc. \u00a7 177, a peace officer may without a warrant arrest only for misdemeanors committed in Ms presence, or for a felony not committed within Ms presence, or where a felony has been committed and ho has reasonable cause to believe that the person arrested has committed it, the defense was insufficient to justify the false imprisonment, for there was no denial that defendant caused plaintiff\u2019s arrest, and the fact defendant had cause to believe plaintiff had committed a breach of the peace was no defense, though it might be urged in mitigation of damages.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b55-14\">[Ed.

Plaintiff\u2019s grievance is set out in the complaint in the form of a single count; and he insists that the cause of action alleged is one simply for false imprisonment, and that, whatever the cause or causes of action, the failure of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>to incorporate in the separate defense denials of the material allegations of the complaint justifies the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Under the rules laid down in this department respecting the vexed question of the proper manner of pleading defenses, it has been decided that a defense consisting of new matter, within the purview of section 500 of the Code, must be based on the theory of confession and avoidance, and be such as cannot be proved under the denials; that a denial has no place in an affirmative defense, except when it becomes necessary to deny the existence of some fact alleged in the complaint, in order to perfect the answer as a complete affirmative defense; that an affirmative defense, as distinguished from a mere denial, is a separate plea, and in determining its sufficiency all the allegations of the complaint not denied in the separate defense, even though elsewhere denied by the answer, are deemed admitted. Mendelson v. Margulies, 157 App. Div. 666, 142 N. Y. Supp. 825; Einstein v. Einstein, 158 App. Div. 498, 143 N. Y. Supp. 706; Pullen v. Seaboard Trading Co., 165 App. Div. 117, 150 N. Y. Supp. 719. The application of these rules condemns the defense in this case, for in the absence of denials in the separate defense, although contained elsewhere in the answer, all of the averments of the complaint are deemed to be admitted in so far as the defense is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\"><bracketnum>[2-4]</bracketnum> While it has been held by the Court of Appeals, however (Staten Island M. R. R. Co. v. Hinchliffe, 170 N. Y. 473, 63 N. E. 545), that as the demurrer assumes the truth of the facts alleged in defendant\u2019s plea, if such facts, even though provable under the prior denials not incorporated in the defense, would defeat the cause of action, the defense is not demurrable, though it may be stricken out upon motion as redundant, and the doctrine of the case cited was applied in this department in Kraus v. Agnew, 80 App. Div. 1, 80 N. Y. Supp. 518, even under the test there laid down the defense in this action is insufficient. The pleader has stated a cause of action for false imprisonment, for not only does the complaint allege that plaintiff was imprisoned and restrained by defendant of his liberty, but it also contains the allegation that the imprisonment was without right or authority, and such allegation amounts to an averment that the arrest was unlawful. Ring v. Mitchell, 45 Misc. Rep. 493, 92 N. Y. Supp. 749, affirmed 100 App. Div. 515, 91 N. Y. Supp. 1110. And see Gearity v. Strasbourger, 133 App. Div. 701, 118 N. Y. Supp. 257. Assuming, but not deciding, that a cause of action for malicious prosecution is also stated, the defendant, by neglect to make timely motion for the separate statement of the causes of action, has waived the right given by the Code of Civil Procedure. Gearity v. Strasbourger, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Although it is alleged in the defense that the plaintiff committed a breach of the peace in the presence of the police officer, \u201cwhereupon the said police officer did cause his arrest and convey him before a magistrate,\u201d it does not follow that the defendant also did not cause the plaintiff\u2019s arrest, nor is that allegation of the complaint denied in the separate defense, and indeed it is subsequently averred that the defendant had reasonable and probable cause to cause the plaintiff\u2019s arrest; and it at least presumptively appears, from defendant\u2019s ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>mission that the magistrate, upon inquiring into the cause, discharged the plaintiff from arrest, that the plaintiff did not commit a breach of the peace. In so far as a cause of action for malicious prosecution is concerned, the discharge of the plaintiff would not necessarily be inconsistent with the existence of probable cause for the prosecution. Reiss v. Levy, 165 App. Div. 1, 150 N. Y. Supp. 440. But, the charge made against the plaintiff not being a felony, reasonable cause for belief on the part of the defendant, a peace officer, that plaintiff committed a breach of the peace, if in fact he did not commit such a breach, although it might affect the damages, would not justify the imprisonment complained of, for reasonable cause is mentioned only in the third subdivision of section 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which covers the case of arrest without a warrant where a felony has been in fact committed by the person arrested. Gold v. Armer, 140 App. Div. 73, 124 N. Y. Supp. 1069; Smith v. Botens, 13 N. Y. Supp. 222.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">So that, even under the more liberal rule of construction applied in the Hinchliffe and Kraus Cases, defendant\u2019s affirmative plea was not a complete defense to the whole complaint (Butler v. General Acc. Ass\u2019n. 103 App. Div. 273, 92 N. Y. Supp. 1025), and the demurrer should not have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">.Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs.
