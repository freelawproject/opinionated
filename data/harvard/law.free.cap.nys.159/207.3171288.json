Plaintiff has recovered the full amount of his claim, namely, the value of the shipment, $726.50, together with interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is unfortunate that after a prolonged trial this judgment must be reversed for material error in respect of proof of the value of the goods. When plaintiff\u2019s shipping clerk showed his inability to state the amount or character of the goods included in the shipment, there was introduced in evidence a paper alleged to be a copy made by the bookkeeper of an entry in the books, which was alleged to have been made in turn from a shipping slip made out by the witness. It needs no citation of authority to demonstrate that no proper foundation, even under the most liberal construction, was laid for the introduction into evidence of this paper. See Mayor v. Second Ave. Co., 102 N. Y. 572, 7 N. E. 905, 55 Am. Rep. 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Respondent claims that the error was not material, or at all events that appellant\u2019s counsel laid no stress on it, citing a remark made by appellant\u2019s counsel within a.minute or so after the&gt;examination brought out this paper. Appellant\u2019s counsel said: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to take up a lot of time over an immaterial issue.\u201d It is not' clear to, what counsel referred, but it is perfectly clear that he did not refer to adequate proof of this paper, for the next 12 pages of the record are replete with appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s objections, both to the introduction of the paper in evidence and to the use thereof by the witness for the alleged purpose of refreshing his recollection, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>witness frankly conceded that his recollection was not refreshed, but that he would actually have to read the items from the paper. Moreover, to make appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s position still clearer, at the close of the case his motion to dismiss was based \u201calso upon the ground that the plaintiff has not properly established the items of damage; that the testimony introduced does not show the value of the merchandise that was lost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">It follows, therefore, that the judgment must be. reversed, and a new trial granted, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
