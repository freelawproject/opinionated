L. Chester, for board and lodging, and that such credit was given in pursuance of the agreement and in payment of the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>The facts are undisputed. The evidence does not establish any privity of contract between plaintiff and defendant, but, on the contrary, that defendant merely undertook, at the request of plaintiff\u2019s president, to \u201cget them the order from the Biltmore to the Byron Company for 30,000 postal cards,\u201d to be paid for in board, and that defendant did get such order on the terms proposed by defendant\u2019s president. It is clear that it was not the intent of the parties that defendant should assume any liability individually for the val\u00fae of the goods, but merely that it should obtain for plaintiff an order from defendant\u2019s principal, on the terms proposed by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">It is not for this court to consider what cause of action, if any, plaintiff may have against the Biltmore corporation, or what defenses, such as ratification or estoppel, might be interposed in such an action. Plaintiff failed to make out a cause of action against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, with $30 costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
