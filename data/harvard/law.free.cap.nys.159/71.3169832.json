Here the municipality invited obstructions. The rubbish was not kept within the limits of the premises of the property owners, but was deposited in the streets by invitation of the village officers, who seem to have assumed the responsibility of removing undesirable objects for the benefit of the residents, instead of requiring or at least allowing the residents to do that work for themselves. It may have been public-spirited, and for that reason commendable; but the village was not for that reason relieved from its responsibility. A nuisance was created with the consent and on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>invitation of the village authorities. Two hours before the accident the president of the village drove through the streets and saw the particular obstruction which caused the accident in question. He did not direct its removal by the owner or take any steps in anticipation of the accident. The facts presented required the submission of the case to the jury, and the dismissal of the complaint was error. If the trial justice deemed the evidence weak or unsatisfactory, he might properly have set aside the special verdict, as against the weight of evidence, and granted a new trial. Under the circumstances, instead of reinstating the verdict, a new trial is ordered on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">KELLOGG, P.
