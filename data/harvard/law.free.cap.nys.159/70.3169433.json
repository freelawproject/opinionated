It appears, also, that the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>imposed, namely, $10 motion costs, were quite inadequate to compensate defendant for its counsel\u2019s attendance at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The order is therefore reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, but with leave to plaintiff to apply upon sufficient papers for permission to amend its complaint within 6 days after notice of service of entry of this order. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
