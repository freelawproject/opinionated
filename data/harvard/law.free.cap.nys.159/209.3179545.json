Prior to the commencement of this action, the plaintiff, for the avowed purpose of obtaining evidence for use upon the trial of this action, procured supplementary proceedings to be instituted upon a judgment theretofore entered against him. Plaintiff admits in his affidavit used in opposition to this motion that he procured one John H. Redmond of New York City to obtain an assignment of the judgment in question, and that plaintiff\u2019s wife furnished the funds with which to obtain such judgment. A referee was appointed in supplementary proceedings, a number of witnesses have been examined, and a large volume of testimony taken in such proceedings. In his affidavit opposing this motion plaintiff admits that he is responsible for and controls this proceeding, averring:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u201cI shall and do control the proceeding by being ready to p\u00e1y the judgment whenever it pleases me to do so, and I shall not pay it until it has served its full purpose, which is this: * * * To force Ramsdell [defendant] from time to time to give his testimony on point after point herein as same arise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">And further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">\u201cI quite agree with Mr. Sears [of counsel for the- moving parties] that this proceeding \u2018is being used\u2019 to examine before trial parties.and witnesses, to use their testimony or admissions upon this trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Plaintiff thus freely admits that the primary object of these supplementary proceedings is not to discover property with which to satisfy the judgment upon which the proceedings were based, but rather to obtain evidence for use upon the trial of this action. Such is not the office of proceedings supplementary to execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">These views are not in conflict with the authorities cited by appellant. Inasmuch as the plaintiff confesses that the proceedings are being continued to obtain evidence for use on the trial of this action, we think the defendants can properly move in this action to restrain further examination therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
