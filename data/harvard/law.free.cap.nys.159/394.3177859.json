There is no question that the salary for that period was $1,292.20, and that $350.10 has been paid, so that there remains unpaid of that salary $942.10. In the defendants\u2019 third amended defense in the amended answer it is stated that in December, 1913, a certain fire loss of a corporation to which the defendant was related had caused the withdrawal of funds from the defendant, and that the defendant informed the plaintiff\u2019s assignor at that time that the salary could not be paid as theretofore, that the plaintiff\u2019s assignor was at liberty to leave, and that if he remained it must be with the understanding that his salary would not be paid in full until such time as such fire loss was satisfied, and that in the meantime defendant would pay such part of such salary as from time to time defendant was able to pay. It is further alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s assignor agreed to remain upon these conditions, and that the fire loss had not been settled at the time of the commencement of this action, and the defendant had paid such part of plaintiff\u2019s salary as it was able to pay. This defense was stricken out upon plaintiff\u2019s motion over defendant\u2019s exception. The striking out of this defense, in our opinion, constituted error, as if pleaded a valid, enforceable modification of the previously existing terms of employment, and effectually barred the plaintiff\u2019s assignor from recovering any more of his accruing salary than the defendant was from time to time able to pay until the fire loss referred to was settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">For this error the judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. Order filed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
