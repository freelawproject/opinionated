The defendants set up a general release made by the decedent after the accident and before his death. The plaintiff served no reply, and the defendant made no application to the court to compel the service of a reply. As the case stood, when the trial was reached, the plaintiff might meet the defense of a general release \u201cby traverse or avoidance, as the case requires.\u201d Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 522. In other words, she could offer evidence to avoid the release on equitable grounds. Davis Confectionery Co., Inc., v. Rochester G. Ins. Co., 141 App. Div. 909, 126 N. Y. Supp. 723 ; Mandeville v. Reynolds, 68 N. Y. 528; Arthur v. Homestead Fire Ins. Co., 78 N. Y. 462, 34 Am. Rep. 550; Keeler v. Keeler, 102 N. Y. 30, 6 N. E. 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The defendant moved for a separate trial of the issue as to the general release. The motion was denied, and the defendant appeals. This court has repeatedly declared the policy that under such circumstances, where the plaintiff seeks to avoid a general release pleaded by the defendant, the court at Special Term should direct a separate trial of the issues as to the general release. Warner v. Star Co., 162 App. Div. 458, 147 N. Y. Supp. 803; Arbutina v. Pittsburg Contracting Co., 168 App. Div. 280, 153 N. Y. Supp. 1027; Piuntkosky v. Harrington\u2019s Sons Co., 167 App. Div. 117, 152 N. Y. Supp. 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">The order of the Special Term should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion of the defendants should be granted, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
