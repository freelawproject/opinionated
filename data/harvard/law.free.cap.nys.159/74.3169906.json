Morse, Jr., and the Mor\u00e9e Dry Dock &amp; Repair Company. From so much of an order as denied its motion for bill of particulars, in a case involving a collision between plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s motor vehicles, as to the location of the accident and the direction in which plaintiff\u2019s vehicle was proceeding, and as to a statement of the negligent acts which plaintiff claims caused the accident, the defendant corporation appeals. Order reversed, and motion granted.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b112-11\">Argued May term, 1916,</otherdate>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AtW\">before GUY, BIJUR, and COHALAN, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-12\">Armstrong, Brown &amp; Purdy, of New York City (William F.

Moos, of New York City, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b112-14\">BIJUR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag5\">The learned court below denied the motion as to these particulars on the ground that they were \u201capparently, at least, if not more, within the knowledge of the defendant than the plaintiff.\u201d It is well settled in this department that, as the particulars authorized to be required are of the party\u2019s <em>claim, </em>knowledge on the part of the other party of alleged <em>facts </em>is quite immaterial. Dwyer v. Slattery, 118 App. Div. 345, 103 N. Y. Supp. 433; Waller v. Degnon Contr. Co., 120 App. Div. 389, 105 N. Y. Supp. 203; Bjork v. Post &amp; McCord, 125 App. Div. 813, 110 N. Y. Supp. 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-15\">The two cases cited as sustaining the contrary rule, namely, Griffin v. Cunard S. S. Co., Ltd., 159 App. Div. 454, 144 N. Y. Supp. 517, and Fernet v. Stewart Co., 163 App. Div. 112, 117, 148 N. Y. Supp. 646, relate to demands for a bill of particulars by a defendant as to plaintiff\u2019s alleged contributory negligence, which manifestly stands on an entirely different footing, and is governed, as the opinions show, by entirely different considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-16\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted as to said particulars. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
