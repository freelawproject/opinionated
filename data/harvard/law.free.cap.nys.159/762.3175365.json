Co., A. Hillman, Sec\u2019y.\u201d The answer denies the making of the contract alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The two questions involved on this appeal are: First, whether said 'Hillman, who signed the contract for the defendant, and who was also a director of the company, was duly authorized to make said contract, or, if not so authorized, whether the contract was subsequently ratified by defendant; second, whether, by reason of noncompliance with section 92 of the Municipal Court Code defendant can question I he authenticity of the signature attached to said contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Defendant introduced in evidence a by-law of the defendant company which provides that no debts shall be contracted or liability incurred or contracts made and entered into by any officer of the company unless authorized and directed by a resolution of the board of directors entered in the minutes of said board, and that all contracts involving a payment or a liability greater than $25 shall be reduced to writing and signed by the president and secretary, and be under the seal of the company; and evidence was introduced showing no such resolution was ever adopted authorizing the making of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">There is evidence which might be deemed sufficient to establish general authority in Hillman, the secretary and director, to fix the terms of all contracts for the distribution of defendant\u2019s publications, so as to bring the making of the contract with plaintiff within the apparent scope of his authority, notwithstanding the provisions of defendant\u2019s by-laws; but there is no proof of knowledge by plaintiff of such general authority in Hillman and plaintiff\u2019s reliance thereon. Nor is there sufficient proof of ratification, except as shown by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">It is also contended by plaintiff appellant, and we think properly, that the question of the authenticity of defendant\u2019s signature to the contract could not be raised by defendant on the trial herein because of defendant\u2019s failure to comply with section 92 of the Municipal Court Code, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-11\">\u201cA signature to a written instrument which is pleaded shall be taken as admitted unless the party sought to be charged thereby files with the clerk, within eight days after joinder o\u00ed issue, a specific denial of the genuineness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>of the signature and a demand that it be proved. Such denial and demand by a defendant may be included in his answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-3\">While the answer herein denies the making of the contract alleged in the complaint, it does not demand that the signature to the contract, which is pleaded and annexed to the complaint herein, be proved, as required by section 92. The party sought to be charged with said contract is the defendant herein, not Hillman, and the contract alleged purports to bear the signature of the defendant. Defendant having failed to comply with the provisions of section 92, its signature to said alleged contract must, for the purpose of the trial of this action, be deemed the genuine and authentic signature of the defendant. Plaintiff proved the making of a valid contract, binding upon the defendant, and a subsequent breach thereof, with damage to plaintiff. This established a good cause of action, and the dismissal of the complaint was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">BIJUR, J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
