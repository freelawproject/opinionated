Order reversed, and new trial by referee granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-13\">The motion /for a new trial was upon the ground of newly discovered evidence. The 4ction was to recover for personal services claimed to have been rendered in superintending the remodeling of a building, known as the Richmond, jffito a modern apartment house. The defense was a denial of the special employment claimed. It was also asserted that the services were volunteered in order to induce defendant to give to plaintiff a contract for gas fixtures, also the agency for lotting these apartments. The issues were referred t&lt;; a referee, who reported in favor of defendant, which this court affirmed,-: 163 App. Div. 973, 148 N. Y. Supp. 1109. The motion for a new trial wyis based upon several affidavits of persons who deposed to plaintiff\u2019s service\u00ae, also to what were claimed as admissions by defendant, and upon an anthefdcated copy of a joint affidavit on file in the Richmond county clerk\u2019s office) made by John C. Martin and Edwin K. Martin, consenting to a mortgage! by the Penn Realty Company, to the effect that each affiant had 50 shares and together held all the capital stock of defendant corporation.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b311-15\">Argued before JFNKS, P.

Martin, since deceased, did not take place. In his decision he questioned the authority of John C. Martin, who was the corporate treasurer, to make such a contract. When the plaintiff rested, and a motion to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>was made on this ground, the referee denied it. But in his report he \u25a0stated as the first and crucial question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-3\">\u201cWhether there was ever any agreement on the part of the corporation, or any authority to the defendant to employ him to do the acts which he claims to have done. There is no evidence that the treasurer was authorized to make such contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Again he required preponderance of proof that this contract, \u201cnot only was made by the treasurer, but was with the authority of the corporation.\u201d But this joint affidavit, now produced, shows the two brothers Martin to be the sole corporate owners of this corporation. As to each other, they occupied substantially the relation of partners. Goss &amp; Co. v. Goss, No. 2, 147 App. Div. 698, 702, 132 N. Y. Supp. 76. Of course, such corporate cu uers and officers are not limited in \u25a0control by a board of directors, v, hwh must necessarily be dummies. First Nat. Bank v. G. V. B. Min. Co. (C.

I therefore advise that the order be reversed, and the motion for a new trial grant &lt; i; costs to abide the event. But, as the issues have been referred by stipulation, such new trial must be by referee, rather than with a j'.\"?/\u25a0 Butterly v. Deering, 158 App. Div. 181, 142 N. Y. Supp. 1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The retrial of the issues will be referred to Hon. Vulk'n;/, D. Dickey, as official referee. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
