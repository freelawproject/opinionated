Evidence was introduced by plaintiff fully establishing the above facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-16\">At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case defendant moved for a direction of a verdict on the ground that plaintiff had failed to make out a cause of action, the alleged contract with defendant being void for lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>consideration, and the court subsequently granted the motion on the ground of lack of consideration. In this the learned trial court erred. If the promise of the defendant to advance the money and redeem the ring from pawn had been based solely on. plaintiff\u2019s promise to repay the amount so advanced, the contract would have been without consideration; but the delivery of the pawn ticket by plaintiff to defendant at the time of the making of the contract was a good and valid consideration for the contract entered into by defendant. In delivering the pawn ticket to defendant, plaintiff parted with a thing of value, her right of redemption of the ring, which right she thus transferred to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">General Business Law, art. 5, \u00a7 44, relating to pawnbrokers, provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">\u201cThe holder of such memorandum or note shall be presumed to be the person entitled to redeem the pledge, and the pawnbroker shall deliver such article to the person so presenting such memorandum or note on payment of principal and Interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">It is elementary that a change of position on the part of one party to a contract on the faith of the promises made by the other party to the contract, and in carrying out the purpose for which the contract is made, constitutes a valid consideration. Any detriment suffered, or any legal right given up or forborne by the promisee, is a sufficient consideration for an agreement. See Grossman v. Schenker, 206 N. Y. 466, 100 N. E. 39; 9 Cyc. 311, 312; Hamer v. Sidway, 124 N. Y. 538, 27 N. E. 256, 12 L. R. A. 463, 21 Am. St. Rep. 693; Parsons on Contracts, 444; Melville v. Kruse, 174 N. Y. 306, 66 N. E. 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The authority relied upon by respondent, Thorne v. Deas, 4 Johns. 84, 96, is not in point, in that the plaintiff therein did not forego or surrender any right. The defendant promised, without consideration, to perform gratuitously for plaintiff the act of insuring a vessel in which plaintiff had an interest, but plaintiff did not forego his own right to effect such insurance. In the case at bar plaintiff surrendered to defendant a pawn ticket which carried with it an absolute right to possession of the ring upon tender to the pawnbroker of the amount of the pledge with interest, and divested herself of such right; the ticket not having been lost or mislaid, so as to entitle plaintiff to the issuing of a new ticket on application to the pawnbroker, and having been voluntarily transferred by plaintiff for a valid consideration to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
