A police officer saw the defendant walking on Rockaway Road, and, approaching, asked him \u201cwhere he was going,\u201d and, as testified, \u201che put his hand in his pocket and dropped a small package in the street.\u201d A chemist opened the package, and \u201cfound a small package there of white powder, * * * analyzed the white powder, and found it</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">contained heroin hydrochloride.\u201d The brief for the respondents refers the case to section 1746 of the Penal Law, which regulates the sale o'f \u201calkaloid cocaine or its salts, or alpha or beta eucaine or their salts, or any admixture, compound, solution or product of which cocaine or eucaine or their salts may be an ingredient.\u201d The evidence does not indicate that heroin or heroin hydrochloride is an element of any of the substances enumerated. Hence the section, so far as appears, is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">So the judgment of conviction of the Court of Special Sessions should be reversed, and, as the information is laid under that section, it should be dismissed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
