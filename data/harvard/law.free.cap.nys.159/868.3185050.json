After the first trial of this case, the judgment was reversed by this court (157 N. Y. Supp. 753), for the reason that the trial court submitted to the jury the question whether the injuries were caused by the overcrowded condition of the platform, of which there was no proof; this court saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-12\">\u201cThe case should have been submitted to the jury upon the question as to whether the defendant made provision for moderating undue crowding and whether there was any negligent failure on the part of the platform men to discharge their duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">On this trial plaintiff amended its complaint to meet this opinion, so that it stated defendant\u2019s negligence as follow-s:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-14\">\u201cThat the crowds upon the said platform at such times were very large, and the platform was taxed to its capacity; that the pushing and crowding of passengers by other passengers and persons on said platform at such hours was a matter of common occurrence, and said defendant, notwithstanding the said condition at the time mentioned in this complaint and prior thereto, failed to provide an adequate force of persons, and failed to take effective measures, to protect passengers from being pushed and crowded by other passengers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-15\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Respondent still clings to the contention that it is necessary for plaintiff to show that the platform itself was overcrowded, basing this upon the language of the pleading: \u201cThe said platform was taxed beyond its capacity.\u201d That phrase, however, does not detract from the other negligence amply pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Plaintiff\u2019s testimony discloses that the crowds on the platform at the 6 o\u2019clock hour were very large, and that they congregated in large groups at the gates of defendant\u2019s trains. There is ample testimony on her part from which the jury might find that there were no guards at or near the crowd of which she was one, and that there was nobody there regulating the crowd, or giving them instructions how to move. We therefore have a case where there was evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>continued undue pushing and crowding at certain points, and of lack of provision for moderating or controlling it, and it was error on the part of the court not to submit it to the jury. Bacon v. Hudson &amp; Man. R. R. Co., 154 App. Div. 742, 139 N. Y. Supp. 740; Reschke v. S., L. S. &amp; N. R. Co., 155 App. Div. 48, 139 N. Y. Supp. 555, affirmed 211 N. Y. 602, 105 N. E. 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The judgment must be reversed, and new trial ordered, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
