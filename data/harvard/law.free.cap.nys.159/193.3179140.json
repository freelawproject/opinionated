She has recovered a judgment for the sum of $250. The judgment is attacked upon two grounds: First, that it is excessive; and, second, that the plaintiff failed to establish her case by a preponderance of evidence. As to the last claim there is no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-18\">The question as to whether or not there was a hole in the oilcloth, which concededly it was the duty of the defendant to keep in repair was purely one of fact, and the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to its defective condition was corroborated by her husband and his mother, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>three of the four witnesses called by the defendant merely stated that they had not \u201cnoticed\u201d the oilcloth in passing over it. We think, however, that the judgment was excessive. The plaintiff testified that she was visiting her mother when she fell in passing through the hall on her way to the mother\u2019s rooms. She says she was hurt \u201con my head, my two knees, and my foreheadand again she said, \u201cMy head, my two knees, my chest, my breast, and my side was hurt.\u201d The nature or extent of these injuries was not stated in any instance, either by her husband or her mother, at whose house she says she remained for two weeks after' the accident. She testified she was treated every day by a physician, who \u201cgave me medicine and he gave me stuff to rub <em>in\u201d; </em>but what other treatment she received, if any, does not appear. The physician was not called, nor any reason given for not producing him, nor was it shown how much, if anything, was paid for his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with $30 costs to the appellant to abide the event, unless the plaintiff will stipulate, within five days after entry of the judgment hereon in the Municipal Court and notice of entry, to reduce the judgment to the sum of $150 and appropriate costs in the court below, in which event the judgment, as so modified, is affirmed, without costs of this appeal. In the event of a new trial, the only issue to be tried is the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s in\u00ab juries and the damages incident thereto. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
