The action was brought to trial, and it seems the only material question was one of law. The case was submitted, and the trial justice reserved his decision. Before a decision was rendered the plaintiff asked leave to discontinue the action, and the trial justice made and signed an order, the material portion of which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">\u201cUpon the foregoing papers this motion is granted and the plaintiff is allowed to discontinue upon payment of taxable costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The summons was also indorsed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">\u201cDiscontinued on payment of taxable costs. March 11, 1916.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">This order was entered on the day it bore date, and the clerk thereupon entered in the docket book kept by him the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">\u201c1916. Mch. 11. Discontinued on motion of plaintiff. $20 costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">Trial fee paid. See memo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\"><em>\u201c \" </em>15. Disbursements taxed and allowed, $8.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">By motion made by the plaintiff and returnable on April 11, 1916, the court below made an order \u201cstriking out the taxation of $8 disbursements and retaxing bill accordingly.\u201d The clerk thereupon made this entry in the docket:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-13\">\u201c1916. Apr. 11. Disbursements retaxed disallowing the $8 disbursements as taxed by clerk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">This is all that appears in the record before us. Characterizing these entries as a \u201cjudgment,\u201d the defendant appeals therefrom, and seeks a review of the last-mentioned order, which strikes out the clerk\u2019s allowance of disbursements from the bill of costs. The plaintiff moves to dismiss the appeal, upon the ground that no judgment as yet has ever been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">In this position we think the plaintiff is correct. The order granting leave to discontinue was upon condition that plaintiff pay the taxable costs. Upon such an order no judgment can be entered. Hyde v. Anderson, 112 App. Div. 76, 98 N. Y. Supp. 62.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-16\">\u201cMotion to discontinue is properly for leave to discontinue, and the proper order thereon is one allowing a discontinuance on payment of costs, if such terms are imposed. If plaintiff fails thereafter to take the proper stops or proceed in the action, defendant\u2019s remedy is by motion to dismiss the complaint for want of prosecution. There is no authority for entering a judgment.\u201d Hyde v. Anderson, supra; Anderson v. Norton (Sup.) 158 N. Y. Supp. 152.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-17\">Under the terms of the order in the present case, the defendant undoubtedly had a right to tax his costs, leaving the plaintiff to pay such costs or refuse to proceed, when a proper judgment of dismissal could be entered, the costs taxed thereunder, and a review had by the court below, or upon appeal by the aggrieved party. The entries in the docket book do not constitute a judgment. The clerk is a mere ministerial officer, and can only act upon the direction of the court. He was given no authority to enter a judgment, and his entries were merely in the routine of his duty to keep a record of the proceedings. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>cannot enter a- judgment of his own motion. He must have either oral or written directions from the justice who tried the case. Collins v. Davis (Sup.) 114 N. Y. Supp. <em>792. </em>Indorsement of the decision of the trial justice on the papers in the case is not rendering judgment. Dalton v. Loughlin, 4 Abb. N. C. 187 ; Collins v. Davis, supra. See, also, section 1236 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Appeal dismissed, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
