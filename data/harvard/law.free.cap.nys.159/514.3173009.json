After the passengers were in the car and she was seated, she ascertained that she was upon the wrong train, and started out with her children. In stepping off the platform of the car, her foot passed down between the step of the car and the station platform, injuring her leg and thereafter causing a miscarriage, as she alleges. She swears that the distance between the edge of the step and the station platform is 8% inches. Her son, who was with her, swears to a distance of 7% inches. The proof by the defendant\u2019s witnesses is that it could not have, exceeded 5% inches. The weight of the evidence is to the ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>feet that the distance was from 5% to 7% inches. Upon this fact alone negligence seems to be charged. There was no crowd passing off the car which would require any warning to passengers generally. This space may be deemed within the evidence to be fairly necessary, so that the oscillations of a car as it passes the platform will not throw it into the platform. It may be assumed generally that where passengers are alighting they will watch their steps, unless the crowd is so intense that they cannot. It has therefore been held in Woolsey v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 123 App. Div. 631, 108 N. Y. Supp. 16, that a space o\u00ed 10 inches between a step and the platform was not negligence of itself, but that circumstances might arise to impose upon a company the burden of giving warning of that space. In Lafflin v. Buffalo &amp; Southwestern Ry. Co., 106 N. Y. 136, 12 N. E. 599, 60 Am. Rep. 433, it was held that a space of 11 inches between a step and the platform was not sufficient of itself to charge the defendant with negligence. To hold in the case at bar a maximum space of 7% inches between the car step and the platform would be of itself proof of the defendant\u2019s negligence, which would authorize the plaintiff\u2019s recovery for injury therefrom, would in our judgment be wholly unwarranted, and the judgment must, therefore, be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs. Order filed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
