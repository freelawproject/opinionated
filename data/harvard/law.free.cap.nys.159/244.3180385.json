The specific instruction, there appearing, was made at the defendant\u2019s request. There was no controversy in the proofs that the train which was being switched by the decedent at the time of the accident was composed of freight cars, none of which was to go beyond Buffalo; that is, beyond this state. If it was intended by-the trial court to charge the jury that no liability could attach to the defendant on,the ground that it was engaged in interstate commerce, unless some car in the train was \u201cgoing beyond Buffalo,\u201d such an instruction would have been equivalent, as the proofs stood, to a direction of a verdict. It is evident that the trial court had no such intention, for it would have been most obvious error to have instructed the jury to that effect under the proofs in the case. The plaintiff had set out to prove that the train then being switched had a car that was filled with freight, taken on at the Fleischmann yard, which was consigned to various points outside this state. This car was referred to generally in the testimony as the \u201cSoo car,\u201d or the \u201cFerry car,\u201d or car \u201cNo. 17,212.\u201d That car, because of the destination of its contents, was being used at that time in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The counsel for the defendant introduced into the case whatever confusion may have been caused, if any existed in the minds of the jurors, for he specifically requested the trial court, at folio 379, to charge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">\u201cI ask yonr honor t.o charge that at the time o\u00ed the happening of the accident the car known as the Soo car, No. 17,212, was being transferred by this locomotive and by Whalen to this east side switch.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">And on this request the court so charged. If this was a proper charge, and the defendant, having requested it, is now estopped from questioning its propriety, the defendant cannot now complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
