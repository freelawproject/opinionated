The court below granted defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, and the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In granting judgment for the defendant the learned justice at Special Term stated that he was of opinion \u201cthat the plaintiff has no action under the contract against the defendant, but may, under the Mulhall decision\u201d (50 App. Div. 179, 63 N. Y. Supp. 782) \u201chave an action for services rendered upon a quantum meruit.\u201d In the Mulhall Case two causes of action were alleged by the plaintiff\u2014the first for the reasonable value of services rendered by the broker in procuring an agreement for the exchange of real estate, which exchange the defendant refused to carry out; the second cause of action for the recovery of the commissions which the broker would have obtained from the other party to the exchange if it had been consummated. As respects this second cause of action the court held that, as the plaintiff had failed to allege any contract made by the defendant with the broker to exchange its property, there could be no breach of such contract, and a demurrer to the second cause of action was properly sustained ; the only obligation of the defendant being to pay the broker the reasonable value of his services under the first cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In this case, however, plaintiff expressly alleged a hiring by the defendant for the purchase of the property described in the complaint and the breach of such contract, and the question before the court below was not whether the damage alleged was the true measure of plaintiff\u2019s recovery, but whether the facts stated constituted a cause of action. A cause of action being clearly set out in favor of the plaintiff for at least the reasonable value of his services, it was error to grant defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
