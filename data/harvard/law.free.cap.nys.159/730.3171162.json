There was sufficient testimony that the hole had existed for at least six or seven weeks prior to the accident, and it was therefore error to refuse to submit the case to the jury on the question whether or not the city had constructive notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event.
