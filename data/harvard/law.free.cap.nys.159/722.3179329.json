Defendant is a doctor living at 330 East Fourth street. Soble had finished his work for the day, and was to take the automobile to the garage in Williamsburg over the so-called Deiancey Street or Williamsburg bridge. Pie went to his own home at No. 29 Cannon street to get his supper. No. 29 Cannon street is about half way between Deiancey street and Broome street, which is south of Deiancey.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-18\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention, in substance, is that, after Soble had finished his supper, he started for the garage, taking his wife and mother-in-law along for the ride. The machine was then standing in front of his house on the west side of Cannon street facing Broome, with its back toward Deiancey. For some reason Soble backed the machine and struck the plaintiff with ihe rear wheels. It is a question whether then Soble went off toward Broome or Deiancey streets. Defendant\u2019s claim is that plaintiff was sitting in the gutter on a chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The question whether Soble had his master\u2019s permission to stop at his own home for dinner was litigated at length. Although mere permission would not be determinative (see Cunningham v. Castle, 127 App. Div. 580, 586, 587, 111 N. Y. Supp. 1057) nevertheless, if he had such permission, it is evident that his stop for the meal while engaged in his master\u2019s service in returning the automobile to the garage did not remove him even temporarily from that service. In this respect the learned judge below charged the jury incorrectly when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">\u201cIf the owner told Mm, \u2018You can take my automobile and go to your home and get your dinner,\u2019 and he proceeded to do so, and he hurt somebody while doing so, .he would not be engaged at that time in the business of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> This error in the charge, however, except in so far as it may have conveyed to the jury a generally inaccurate impression as to the law of the case, was probably not material, because, whether at the actual time when Soble was taking his dinner he was engaged in his master\u2019s service or not, it is perfectly clear that after he had finished the meal, if he started for the garage, he had completely resumed his master\u2019s duties. Geraty v. Nat. Ice Co., 16 App. Div. 174, 44 N. Y. Supp. 659; Jones v. Weigand, 134 App. Div. 644, 119 N. Y. Supp. 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Bearing in mind the fact that the distance between Delancey and Broome streets covers but a short city block, it is perfectly apparent that, if Soble was on his way to the garage in Williamsburg, the mere fact that he went by way of Broome street, rather than by Delancey street, constituted a negligible deviation from the direct route. It had no effect to suspend the course of his service to his master. Quinn v. Power, 87 N. Y. 535, 41 Am. Rep. 392, and the Jones and Geraty Cases, supra. The court apparently recognized the fact that the problem for the jury to solve began when Soble resumed the conduct of the automobile after his meal. He said to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">\u201cThe question will be presented whether or not, after he had finished his meal at his home in Cannon street, he was proceeding to the garage directly for the purpose of storing the car for the night, or was he about to take his family to visit somebody, or for a ride. If he was proceeding directly to the garage, then he was employed in the business of the defendant; but if he was taking his wife and mother-in-law to visit somebody, or for a ride, then he was engaged in his own business, and not the business of the defendant, and there can be no liability fastened upon the defendant by reason of the fact that the chauffeur was using the defendant\u2019s car for Ms own entertainment or purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Later he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-10\">\u201cWe do know that, had he gone to the garage directly after being discharged for thel night at the defendant\u2019s place of business, it would have been the nearest way to go over the Delancey Street bridge, because the garage was near the Brooklyn end of that bridge. Having passed south of Delancey street to go to his home, if he desired to go to that garage by the nearest route presenting itself, he would naturally turn his car north again, to go to Delancey street and cross the bridge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">And then added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-12\">\u201cBut if, instead of turning to go toward Delancey _ street,. * * * he .started south toward Broome street, you may very well infer' from that fact that he was not proceeding in the nearest and direct way to his garage for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>(\u2022he purpose of storing the car for the night; and if he was taking Ms mother-in-law and his wife south, either for a drive, or to visit some persons, or to entertain them in any way, he was not then employed in the business of the defendant, and the defendant is not answerable for his negligence.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted to this portion of the charge, and particularly to the right accorded to the jury to draw \u201ca certain inference from the way the automobile was driven off, or the direction in which tlie automobile was driven off.\u201d This exception presents error for which the judgment must be reversed. There was no direct evidence <em>to </em>contradict the chauffeur\u2019s statement, when testfying on behalf of <em>defendant, </em>that he was proceeding to the garage, and that his wife and mother-in-law accompanied him only because they were going to Williamsburg, and he \u201cwould drop them off after he took them across the bridge,\u201d and \u201cthat that was what he did.\u201d There was, therefore, no evidence at all that after he had taken his meal he was engaged in other than his master\u2019s service, returning the automobile to the garage. As I have pointed out above, the mere fact that he went by way of Broome street, rather than Delancey street, for a short distance, would amount merely to a deviation from the direct route.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> I cannot find in this fact even the proverbial \u201cscintilla\u201d of evidence that lie was entering upon a joy ride or any purpose of his own; but even such a scintilla furnishes no adequate foundation upon which to base a finding. Matter of Case, 214 N. Y. 199, 203, 204, 108 N. E. 408, and cases there cited. The record as it comes to- us presented no issue as to the defendant\u2019s responsibility; it being uncontradicted by direct testimony or circumstance that at the time of the accident Soble was engaged in his master\u2019s service. The only question was whether the accident was the result of Soble\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">In connection with this subject, appellant claims that the court below committed further error by charging, in substance, that if the plaintiff was not seated on the sidewalk that was the end of the case. Appellant would have us infer from this that the court below had charged tiiat appellant\u2019s silting in the gutter was contributory negligence as matter of law. It is quite plain to me, however, from a reading of the context, that what the court did charge was that, if plaintiff was not sitting on the sidewalk, then she could not recover, because then her whole theory of the case failed. This had no reference to the question of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the e.vent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
