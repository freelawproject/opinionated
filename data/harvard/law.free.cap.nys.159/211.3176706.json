The answer, in addition to denials, sets up a fraudulent scheme to deceive defendant as to the amount of the deliveries. Plaintiffs were button makers, and defendant a manufacturer of ladies' coats. Appellant contends that plaintiffs failed to prove delivery, and failed to prove the agreed purchase price; that there was error in the admission of evidence of one of the plaintiffs as to his conversations with defendant's \u25a0deceased partner; that there was error in excluding defendant\u2019s \u201cgarment register\u201d from evidence; and that error was committed in permitting one of the plaintiffs to read from their carbon copy bills under the guise of refreshing his recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"A6h\">In order to prove delivery, one of the plaintiffs testified that he received order slips from defendant; that he made up corresponding boxes of buttons, and sent these boxes back by a delivery boy to defendant, with the original bills, the order slip, and a receipt. Plaintiff then called one of defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s. She testified that these receipts were initialed by her and the bills were \u201cchecked\u201d by her. She testified later, however, that the \u201cchecking\u201d on the bills was solely as to prices, and not as to quantities, and she also testified that, although she received merchandise, she did not know whether it was the quantity covered by the bill, and that she never examined or counted the buttons. The receipts never specified the quantities of buttons, but read merely \u201cone package.\u201d The delivery boy was not called to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is quite evident that all that plaintiffs established by this testimony was that they had received orders from the defendant; that these orders had been accurately filled, the goods packed to correspond, and a correct bill made out. But there is no proof of delivery, or competent proof of the agreed price. Such inference as might ordinarily be drawn from defendant\u2019s retention of the bills is destroyed by the absence of proof on the part of the plaintiffs of what defendant did with the bills and the positive evidence on defendant\u2019s part that before the last bills were received (none being payable until the end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>month) protest was made as to the quantities of the goods, and this suit resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In order to further show an agreed value, one of the plaintiffs testified to a conversation with defendant\u2019s deceased partner. This is clearly inadmissible under section 829 of the Code of Civil Procedure, provided that a person interested in the event shall not be examined as a witness in his own behalf against the survivor of a deceased person, which has been held to refer to a surviving partner.

E. 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
