The contention of the defendant is that the original judgment is not binding because of the failure to effect proper service on him. The judgment was a personal one for the recovery of a sum of money. The service of the summons was a substituted one. The Missouri statute prescribing the method of service is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-11\">\u201cA summons shall be executed, except as otherwise provided by law, either: First, by reading the writ to the defendant and delivering to him a copy of the petition; or second, by delivering to him a copy of the petition and writ; or, third, by leaving a copy of the petition and writ at his usual place of abode, with some person of his family over the age of fifteen years; * * * or, fifth, where there are several defendants, by delivering to the defendant who shall be first summoned a copy of the petition and writ, and to such as shall be subsequently summoned, a copy of the writ, or by leaving such copy at the usual place of abode of the defendant, with some person of his family over the age of fifteen years. * * * All copies of said writ shall be made by the officer serving same, and for each copy necessarily made by him, he shall be entitled to a fee of ten cents.\u201d Rev. St. Mo. 1909, \u00a7 1700.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">The sheriff\u2019s return read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-14\">\u201cI further executed this writ in the city of St. Louis this 16th day of September, 1904, by leaving a copy of the writ as furnished by the clerk for N. B. Tichenor, a defendant herein, at his usual place of abode with a person of his family over the age of 15 years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">The other defendants were served, but the returns showed that these services were made on the 17th of September. The defendant argues that the service on him was ineffective because, since at the time of service he had no residence in St. Louis, he could only be bound by a judgment based on a personal service of the summons, and also because the statute was not complied with, inasmuch as he was the first served, and no copy of the petition accompanied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-16\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The second objection questions the proper procedure under the Missouri statute. The plaintiff\u2019s expert, a Missouri lawyer, wavered in his rendering of the Missouri law, at one time stating on cross-examination that \u201cif no person had been served prior to Tichenor\u2014 if Tichenor was the first one served and no copy of the writ and petition was left with him, but left with a defendant subsequently served \u2014that would not be substantial compliance with the statute,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>later on redirect examination the witness contradicted himself, and stated that such service would be substantial compliance. The defendant\u2019s expert, on the other hand, positively testified that such service would be invalid, supporting his testimony with a reference to the case of Feurt v. Caster, 174 Mo. 289, 73 S. W. 576, which held that where a suit was against one defendant, and the return stated that a copy of the writ was served, and omitted to state that a copy of the petition accompanied it, as is required by the statute, the service was invalid, and a judgment based on it could be collaterally attacked. In view of the strict construction this statute has received on all occasions in the state of Missouri (Laney v. Garbee, 105 Mo. 355, 16 S. W. 831, 24 Am. St. Rep. 391; Rosenberger v. Gibson, 165 Mo. loc. cit. 23, 65 S. W. 237), it must be held that the statute should be absolutely complied with, and the service here should be held insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">It is true that a writ of error coram nobis brought by defendant herein before the circuit court of the city of St. Louis in 1910 to set aside this judgment was denied, but such denial was apparently placed upon the limitation of the scope of the writ, and the fact that under the writ the question of the validity of the service could not be raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\"><bracketnum>[2-4]</bracketnum> The objection as to the fact of domicile of the defendant, however, is one going to the broad common-law principles of jurisdiction. Upon this question this court is in no way bound by Missouri adjudications in its disposition of an effort to enforce the judgment in this state. White v. Glover, 138 App. Div. 797, 123 N. Y. Supp. 482. It appears to us from a consideration of the statutes that the intent of the statute was to prescribe a method of service on domiciled and not merely temporary residents, and that, therefore, by the terms of the statute as well as by the principles of the common law, the service would be ineffective if defendant was not at the time domiciled in Missouri, even though he happened to have a temporary \u201cplace of abode\u201d in the state. From the evidence, however, we consider that he had neither domicile nor place of abode in Missouri at the time of the service. The defendant himself testified that his home was in Dallas, Tex., although he and his family moved about the country, following the races and living in apartments a few months at a time. In 1902, 1903, and 1904 they lived in St. Louis during the summer months, but he testified that they left by the 1st of September at the latest. It is not shown at what place he is claimed to have lived when served by substituted service. A janitor in Thornby Place, St. Louis, swears to defendant\u2019s having resided there in September, 1904, when service is claimed to have been made; but the strong weight of the testimony is that he rented the house in Thornby Place in 1903, and not in 1904, and was not there in 1904, nor in St. Louis in September, 1904. No facts are shown from which an inference can be drawn that he intended at any time to make St. Louis his home, and the record is barren of any proof that his residence at any time in St. Louis was such as to raise a legal implication that he had consented to be bound by a personal judgment entered upon a substituted service of the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The judgment should therefore be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs. Settle order on notice. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
