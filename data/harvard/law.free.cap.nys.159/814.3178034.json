J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aiz\">This submitted controversy presents the sole- questian whether the plaintiff as executor can convey marketable title of certain realty. The power of sale must be sought in the fifth clause of the will, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-14\">\u201cRealizing that the present income from the investments and securities is extremely small and that even this must be constantly diminished by taxes on real estate, I desire that in order to augment said income the landed property be sold as soon as profitable sales can be negotiated and the proceeds reinvested in safe interest bearing bonds and mortgages. In no case is the money to be \u2018borrowed\u2019 by friend or foe, not even \u2018just until to-morrow.\u2019 Sales and reinvestments in the discretion of Mrs. Turrill; after her demise, of the other executors. I desire that the interest on the unsecured notes be paid promptly and I trust to the honor of the Turrill brothers to do this to augment the now small income and that the entire sum be paid over on the day of Mildred Mecum\u2019s majority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-15\">Are the words \u2018T desire\u201d to be construed in this case as precatory or mandatory? It is well settled that without violence done to the words they may be construed as equivalent to \u201cI will,\u201d or the like, if we conclude that such was the intention of the testator. Appeal of City of Philadelphia, 112 Pa. 470, 4 Atl. 4; Estate of Pforr, 144 Cal. 121, 77 Pac. 825; Meehan v. Brennan, 16 App. Div. 395, 45 N. Y. Supp. 57; Phillips v. Phillips, 112 N. Y. 197, 19 N. E. 411, 8 Am. St. Rep. 737; Moseley v. Bolster, 201 Mass, at page 143, 87 N. E. 606; Stewart v. Stewart, 61 N. J. Eq. 25, 47 Atl. 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">The will is the work of one who disregarded technical words. It is unconventional in form, original and quaint in composition. Therefore we need not pause to inquire whether in nicety the testator weighed the words \u201cI desire\u201d with such words as \u201cI will\u201d or \u201cI direct,\u201d and used the former phrase but to express advice. The scheme of the will with respect to a sale of the realty is plain. After bequest of all \u201cpersonal effects, such as household goods,\u201d the income and interest of the principal is given to Mrs. Turrill. The testator directs that the \u201cprincipal\u201d \u201cconsists of real estate, bonds and mortgages and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>bank deposits.\u201d Mrs. Turrill is made one of the executors. And so the testator provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-5\">\u201cSales and reinvestments in the discretion of Mrs. Turrill; after her demise, of the other executors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">In another part of the will it is provided as to the principal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\">\u201cFor reinvestment, it is subject to the discretion of Mrs. Turrill but with the understanding that these shall be in safe bond and mortgage securities interest bearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">I think that the testator considered that as the income payable to Mrs. Turrill was extremely small and was subject to diminution by the payment of taxes upon the realty, she intended to direct, not merely to advise, a sale and a reinvestment for the purpose of increasing the income which was to be paid to Mrs. Turrill during her life. Such a course is consonant with other specific directions contained in a will which throughout reveals the author as a person of strong prejudices and positive opinions, who intended to direct her representatives, not to counsel them.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">In accord with the terms of submission, there must be judgment for the plaintiff that the defendant perform said agreement and pay to the plaintiff $1,900, with interest from March <em>10, 1916, </em>but without costs of this action. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
