Plaintiff was one of its drivers, engaged \"m delivering beer. While making such a delivery to a saloon keeper at premises entirely disconnected with the brewery, he was injured through the collapse of an elevator on said premises. Defendant happened to be the owner of these premises, and has succeed'gei in the court below on the plea that the remedy given by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law is exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-20\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The case of Lester v. Otis Elevator Co., 169 App. Div. 613,155 N. Y. Supp. 524, is determinative of the point that that law does not ieprive the injured employ\u00e9 of his common-law remedy against a third person, by whose negligence lie may be injured, although at the time he was pursuing his duties under the terms of his employment. It seems to me to follow as the inevitable corollary of that proposition that, if he be injured while in the course of his master\u2019s employment through the negligence of that master when the latter is engaged in an enterprise altogether independent of and unrelated to the business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>in which the servant is employed (i. e., in this case the ownership of separate real estate), tire master as to that enterprise must be regarded as a third party. It is a matter of common knowledge that individuals and corporations operate and own, respectively, enterprises and properties entirely unrelated to and independent of one another. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law was surely not intended to prevent an employ\u00e9 from recovering under the common law for negligence of a person or corporation merely because in an entirely different capacity and interest he or it happened to be the owner of such an independent enterprise or property. This, for example, would, it seems to me, be apparent, if the plaintiff, while engaged in the business of the brewery conducted by the defendant, happened to be injured through the negligence of officers of a steamboat plying on a route hundreds of miles from this city, merely because the steamboat was owned by the brewery corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">COHALAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b152-7\">GUY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWf\">(dissenting). Plaintiff appeals from a judgment dismissing the complaint in an action brought to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by him while performing duties as an employ\u00e9 of the defendant in unloading certain barrels of beer placed in his custody as a truckman by defendant, with orders to deliver same at premises owned by the defendant where the accident occurred. Plaintiff\u2019s injury was due to the alleged defective condition of a sidewalk elevator belonging to defendant, on which, at the time of the accident, plaintiff was engaged in loading the beer in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The learned trial court dismissed the complaint, holding that plaintiff\u2019s only remedy was under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. It was stipulated on the trial by-both parties: ,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">\u201cThat defendant was the owner of the premises where the accident occurred; that defendant maintained and controlled the sidewalk elevator; that the elevator was in a defective condition; that the plaintiff was in the employ of the defendant as a brewery truck driver, and <em>at the time of the accident was engaged) in handling merchandise of the defendant, in tlie defendant\u2019s business; </em>that the defendant had theretofore secured the payment of compensation for injured employ\u00e9s and their dependents pursuant to the provisions of section 50 of chapter 67 of the Consolidated Laws; and that such payment was secured for the benefit of the plaintiff, as well as for the benefit of other employ\u00e9s.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Plaintiff states in his brief (page 3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">\u201cThe plaintiff does not dispute the right to his remedy under the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation L^w, nor is there any contentic\u2019n that the instant case militates against that law. The action was brought against the owner of the building at 100th street and Central Park West, in accordance with the provision of the statute, which provides that an injured employ\u00e9 may elect to take compensation from the employer, or resort to his remedy at common law, against a third party whose negligence brought about the injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">The sole point at issue on this appeal is whether the defendant is to be regarded as a third party, within the meaning of the statute, merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>because he was the owner of the building where the accident occurred and where the defect existed which caused plaintiff\u2019s injury. I am of the opinion that there is no ground whatever for the contention that defendant is a third party within the meaning of the statute. The law was enacted primarily for the purpose of definitely fixing and determining the respective rights and obligations of employers and employ\u00e9s as to injuries sustained by employes in the course of their employment and while engaged in the master\u2019s business for which they are employed. The statute does not contemplate that an employer shall have a dual legal personality\u2014a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde \u2014so far as relations with his employ\u00e9s are concerned, in connection with matters growing out of and directly connected with such employment. Whether the employer might be held liable as a third party, where he was the responsible cause of an employe\u2019s injury through agencies controlled by him, which were entirely separate, apart, and distinct from the employment of the injured employe, may be an interesting academic question, but has nothing whatever to do with this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The concession that plaintiff has a right of action against the defendant as his employer under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law carries with it the assumption that the injury occurred in the course of and connected with plaintiff\u2019s employment by the defendant. But, were there any doubt on that point, it is entirely removed by the further stipulation, entered upon the record, that \u201cat the time of the accident plaintiff was engaged in handling merchandise of the defendant, in the defendant\u2019s business,\" and this is supplemented by further proof that the elevator was the appliance furnished by the employer for the use of his employ\u00e9 in the performance of his duty in delivering the barrels of beer at the place where he was instructed to deliver them by his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
