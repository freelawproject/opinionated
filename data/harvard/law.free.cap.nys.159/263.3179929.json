Thus the court in effect held the complaint demurrable. Ketchum v. Van Dusen, 11 App. Div. 332, 42 N. Y. Supp. 1112; Baylies\u2019 Trial Practice (2d Ed.) 246, and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-22\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The motion for dismissal rested solely upon the proposition that the care required of the defendant, with respect to the character of the defect (not as to notice), was like unto the care required of the municipality, and that many decisions had absolved municipalities as matter of law from any negligence for depressions or defects in streets of even larger relative dimensions. Applying this rule of liability so far as invoked (Grissinger v. International Railway Co., 143 App. Div. 631, 128 N. Y. Supp. 63; Bateman v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>47 Hun, 429. See, too, Weldon v. N. Y., N. H. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 159 App. Div. at 654, 144 N. Y. Supp. 868; Durr v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 184 N. Y. 320, 77 N. E. 397), it might well have been that, when the facts were brought out by trial, the decisions would_ have justified, or even have required, the court to dismiss the plaintiff, in that as matter of law the defendant was not liable for a defect or depression of the dimensions in question. But in Faber v. City of New York, 213 N. Y. 411, 107 N. E. 756, the court, per Seabury, J., cites and approves the expression of Chase, J., in Terry v. Village of Perry, 199 N. Y. 79-82, 92 N. E. 91, 35 L. R. A. (N. S.) 666, 20 Ann. Cas. 796, that \u201ceach case must stand upon its own peculiar facts and the application of such well-known rules of law to such facts.\u201d When the court dismissed the plaintiff, it could not have known from the mere dimensions tire peculiar facts and circumstances of this case upon which to apply the law, and therefore it could not determine whether the case fell within the rule that declares municipalities are not liable for slight depressions or differences in its streets, or whether it fell within the exception that when a slight depression or difference in grade is peculiar and especially calculated to result in injury to those in lawful use of the street, liability may exist. Terry v. Village of Perry, supra, 199 N. Y. 84, 92 N. E. 91, 35 L. R. A. (N. S.) 666, 20 Ann. Cas. 796. Moreover, it did appear by the pleading that the depression or break was in close proximity to the fixed trade, and therefore it did not present the ordinary feature of a depression from the normal grade or surface of a city street.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> We think that a complaint that alleged personal injury to a plaintiff for the negligence of the defendant in permitting and maintaining the pavement in a city street to be improperly and dangerously constructed and to remain in an unsafe and dangerous condition in violation of its duty under section 98 of the Railroad Law, whereby the plaintiff when driving his vehicle in the street had the wheel of his vehicle caught and broken in \u201can abrupt break, hole, or hollow,\u201d so that the plaintiff was thrown to the pavement and injured, should not have been dismissed, as if demurred to, for not stating a cause of action, because the dimensions of the defect were described as \u201cabout 27\" long, 6\" wide, and 2\" deep.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial is granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
