The fraud alleged is that defendant\u2019s agent took plaintiff to the property and indicated that the line of the lots began at a point 40 feet from a certain fence line, whereas the lots sold under the contract signed by the parties actually began 80 feet from the fence line, and that plaintiff was informed at the lime he signed the contract that the lots therein described were the .ones which had been pointed out to him. Plaintiff further testified that he is illiterate and could not read the contract. Defendant\u2019s witnesses deny plaintiff\u2019s story completely, and in addition an attorney testified that he had explained the contract to plaintiff at great length in German, with a map of the property before him giving distances and locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Were there no other elements in the case, it would have presented merely a question of fact. It appears, however, that at the dose of plaintiff\u2019s case, defendant\u2019s chief point in his motion to dismiss was that the plaintiff had not shown that defendant had any knowledge of the deception practiced by his agent. The court denied the motion at that time \u201cwith the privilege to renew it at the end of the case.\u201d Thereupon defendant himself took the stand and disclaimed all knowledge of the misrepresentation alleged to have been made by his agent, and when objection was taken to this line of testimony, the court remarked, \u201cCertainly he has a right to prove he didn\u2019t know it.\u201d It is manifest that we cannot tell whether the complaint was dismissed because the learned judge below believed the defendant\u2019s version of the transaction rather than plaintiff\u2019s or because he thought that, as matter of law, the undenied fact that defendant had no knowledge o\u00ed the misrepresentation of his agent entitled him to judgment. Under the circumstances the judgment must be reversed because of the admission of this totally immaterial evidence. Respondent does not even attempt to justify its introduction, and appellant quite appropriately cites Bennett v. Judson, 21 N. Y. 238, and many other cases to the same effect. The weight given to this evidence by the trial court, as I have pointed out, cannot be determined by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
