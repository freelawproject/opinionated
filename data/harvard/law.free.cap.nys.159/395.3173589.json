Hardy executed and delivered to the plaintiff herein an assignment of said defendant\u2019s claim against her deceased husband\u2019s estate, to the extent of $2,150. .The consideration for this assignment is claimed to have been the advancement of moneys to defendant. On March 10, 1915, said defendant confessed judgment in favor of plaintiff for the same amount. In October, 1915, defendant moved to set aside the judgment by confession. This motion was denied, and, so far as we are advised, no appeal was taken from the order denying it. In March, 1916, one Lilian M. Brown, a subsequent judgment creditor of the defendant, moved upon affidavits in this action (to which she is not a party) to set aside, the above-mentioned assignment, and from the order granting her motion this appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">' That the order was without authority we think there can be no question. The assignment is a formal document, apparently properly executed and purporting to rest upon sufficient consideration. It was not given in the course of any judicial proceeding.- It is entirely irregular to vacate and annul it summarily by a motion founded on affidavits. If it is open to attack for any cause, plaintiff is entitled to insist that such attack shall be conducted by an action legally instituted and prosecuted according to the rules governing such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">The order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. Order filed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
