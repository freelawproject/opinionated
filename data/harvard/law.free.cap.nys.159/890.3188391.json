Macumber against the Detroit Cadillac Motor Car Company. Judgment for defendant, and plaintiff appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b928-18\">A judgment of the Supreme Court was entered in the office of the clerk of Kings county January 14, 1916, at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, dismissing a complaint for alleged conversion of an automobile. Defendant\u2019s answer denied the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s ownership, and of the alleged conversion. In defense it states that the automobile had formerly belonged to one Fogarty, who had delivered it to defendant for repairs, which defendant had made; that defendant held the automobile under its lien for the value and amount of such repairs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b928-19\">It appeared that defendant had rendered a bill for $992 for such repairs, which Fogarty disputed. Eventually Fogarty authorized one Quinlan to sell the automobile to any one who would contest and settle said bill at the proper amount. As such agent, Quinlan sold the automobile to plaintiff for $8, taking his promise to contest and settle defendant\u2019s repair charges; and thereupon a bill of sale of the automobile was given to plaintiff. After corresponding with defendant, plaintiff had an interview with its president, in which he objected to the amount of the .charges, and offered to pay $550, and demanded the automobile. The president offered to let the plaintiff take the car for $792, which he stated as the least sum defendant would accept. This action for conversion followed. It appeared on the trial that defendant had sued Fogarty on its bill of $992, and in that action had recovered a verdict for $665 on May 6, 1915. The court dismissed the complaint, and plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b928-20\">Argued before JENKS, P.

Plaintiff made no tender, but offered $550. The insistence on $792 was not a conversion. Nor did defendant lose its lien, because after-wards, on May 6, 1915, defendant\u2019s verdict against Fogarty was $127 less than the reduced sum it had claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Allen v. Corby, 59 App. Div. 1, 69 N. Y. Supp. 7, on which _appellant relies, war, an instance of detention on claims not the subject of lien. The liveryman there had a lien of $8.50 or $58.50; but, instead of standing on his lawful lien, he refused to restore the property except on payment of .$221, the balance of a general account for stabling, telephones, and miscellaneous items. He thus detained the property upon demands which could not be the basis of lien. The right to hold on a just lieu may be lost by insisting also on payment of other charges which are not liens. Kindelberger v. Kunow, 122 App. Div. 158, 106 N. Y. Supp. 597. But a lienor\u2019s right, based on services giving a lawful lien, may not fail if the jury\u2019s verdict should fall short of the sum charged and demanded. Here there has been no tender. Plaintiff\u2019s offer, inadequate in any view, did not discharge the lien. There being no conversion, the complaint therefore was rightly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">The judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
