Whatever merit there may be in the point, we think it is not available to plaintiffs on the appeal as a ground of error, for the reason that no objection was made at the trial to the submission of the case on the theory adopted, or request to submit it upon any other theory, and no exception was taken which presents the question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Upon the other grounds urged upon this motion, we find nothing that was not fully considered by us, or that we think points to any error in our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The motion is denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
