The affidavit of one of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, upon which the order that an execution issue was granted, stated that the earnings of defendant were $47.50 per month, together with the rent of a house of concededly the reasonable rental value of $20 per month. The motion to modify or vacate was supported by the affidavits of the defendant and of his employer, who is his son. By these affidavits it appears that, under an agreement between the defendant\u2019s brother and the defendant\u2019s employer, the latter built a house upon the lot of the former, which was to be occupied by a maiden sister of defendant, who was upwards of 60 years of age and was without means of support, and that the defendant should reside in the house with her and furnish her with food, fuel, and lights, and should receive from his said employer $49 per month for his services as superintendent of his son\u2019s greenhouses. No answering affidavits were presented upon the motion to vacate, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>though the defendant had been examined in proceedings supplementary to execution. I think that, upon the facts as presented, the motion to vacate should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Concededly wages of $49 per month for 52 weeks of the year do not constitute sufficient earnings to warrant issuing a garnishee execution, and clearly the whole rental value of the house, of $20 per month, cannot properly be included as part of the' earnings of the defendant. It is not claimed that the defendant had theretofore been placed under any legal obligation to support his sister. Whether the value of the \u25a0right given.to the defendant to live in the house with his sister, which must be considered not a mere gratuity, but as part of defendant\u2019s earnings, exceeds the reasonable value of the fuel, lights, and food necessarily furnished by him to her, does not appear. If it does exceed it, then I think the surplus constitutes earnings which should be added to the wages of $49 per month, and upon the total the right to a garnishee execution should be determined. The only statement bearing upon the subject is found in the affidavit of the son to the effect that the $49 wages is actually necessary for the living expenses of the defendant and his sister. The word \u201cearnings\u201d is a more comprehensive term than the word \u201cwages.\u201d Its signification is sufficiently extensive to include, not only the monthly wages paid the defendant, but also the pecuniary benefit to the defendant resulting from the agreement relative to the maintenance of the sister and the right of the defendant to live in the house free of charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed, and the order directing that an execution issue vacated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
