The car was running along about 25 feet from the right-hand curb. The son, who was plaintiff\u2019s only witness to the accident, testified that at a point about 100 feet north of Eighteenth street he put up his hand (which is the signal that he was going to stop). He then turned around and saw defendant\u2019s automobile about 150 feet beyond and about 20 feet from the curb, proceeding in the same direction, namely, to the south. When he reached the intersection of Eighteenth street, he put up his hand again, and then says that he turned around and saw defendant\u2019s automobile running along on the same line about 15 feet behind him. He then stopped, and defendant\u2019s automobile ran into the rear of plaintiff\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-20\">It is perfectly manifest on this record that plaintiff\u2019s son was guilty of contributory negligence. Not only did he violate every one of the traffic ordinances applicable to his case (except as to the rate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>speed), but his course was so irrational that it is difficult to understand what plaintiff can claim defendant should have done under the circumstances. Plaintiff\u2019s son testified that he had intended to turn west into Eighteenth street. Why he twice gave a stop signal, if he intended to' turn, is incomprehensible. If he intended merely to stop1, he violated the ordinance, which required him to do so at the curb. He also violated the ordinance which required him to keep as near the right-hand curb as possible while running along the road. This, however, under the circumstances, and at the rate of speed at which he was proceeding, was probably immaterial. More particularly, however, he violated the ordinance which requires that, in turning under these circumstances, he should keep as near as possible to the right-hand curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">I am of .opinion that, upon the facts conceded or claimed by the plaintiff, the son was plainly guilty of contributory negligence, and that no negligence can be predicated on the part of the defendant, because, in view of plaintiff\u2019s irrational course, he could formulate no sound plan for the safety either of his own or of the plaintiff\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
