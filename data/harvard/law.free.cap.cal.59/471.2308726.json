(\u00a7\u00a7 849, 410, and 416, Code of Civ. Proc.; <em>McMillan </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>11 Cal. 373; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Page, </em>35 id. 299; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bernal, </em>43 id. 385.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-9\">There being no jurisdiction acquired by the Justice of the Peace, it follows that the County Court of which the Superior Court of Kern County is the successor, could have no jurisdiction on an appeal from the decision of the Justice. The order of the Justice, setting aside the service of summons, was not an appealable order. (\u00a7\u00a7 974, 577, 963, and 964, Code Civ. Proc.; <em>People ex rel. Jones </em>v. <em>County Court of El Dorado County, </em>10 Cal. 19; <em>Funkenstein </em>v. <em>Elgutter, 11 </em>id. 328.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-10\">The order of the Superior Court commanding defendant to answer in that Court and proceed to trial, was an usurpation of original jurisdiction. <em>(Townsend </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>5 Cal. 52.) The writ of prohibition is the proper remedy. (\u00a7 1102, Code Civ. Proc.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-11\"><em>R. E. AricJc, </em>for Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-12\">In suits brought in the Superior Court, the law requires that a copy of the complaint must be served with the summons, but in the chapter of the Code of Civil Procedure regulating the manner of commencing- actions in Justices\u2019 Courts, the law provides only for the service of the summons, and does not require a copy of the complaint to be served. (Title xi, Chapter ii, Code Civ. Proc.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Section 849, Code of Civil Procedure, requires that the summons must he served in the manner prescribed in section 411.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-4\">The transcript of the Justice shows that the defendant, by its attorney, appeared, and moved the Court to set aside the service of summons, which was granted, and thereupon judgment was rendered against the plaintiff, which summarily disposed of his case. Admitting that it was proper to set aside the service of the summons, the plaintiff should have been granted the privilege of having another summons issued. (\u00a7 847, C. C. P.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-5\">It is claimed by petitioner that there had never been any trial of the \"cause in the Court below, and that we had no right to appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-6\">There is certainly a judgment rendered against us, a sentence of the law pronounced by the court upon matter contained in the record, and any party dissatisfied with a judgment rendered in a Justice\u2019s Court may appeal, etc. (\u00a7 974, Code Civ. Proc.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b501-7\">McKinstry, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Jurisdiction of the person of a sole defendant, in a Justice\u2019s Court, is obtained by service of the summons and copy of the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 405, 416, 849.) Section 410 provides, that a copy of the complaint must be served with the summons, and that the summons must be returned, with a certificate or affidavit of its service and of the service of a copy-complaint. The legal service of summons (which gives jurisdiction of the person of defendant) includes, as a necessary part of such service, service of the complaint. The Justice, therefore, did not have jurisdiction over the person of the defendant in the action of <em>Wells </em>v. <em>The Southern Pacific Railroad Company.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The Justice\u2019s Court did -not secure jurisdiction to proceed against the defendant by reason of its special appearance for the purpose of moving to set aside the service. But a rendition of a judgment against the plaintiff did not follow, as a necessary consequence, from the order granting the motion to set aside the service. The plaintiff might, perhaps, have applied for an <em>alias </em>summons. Whether the Justice, under the circumstances, erred in entering judgment\u2014the same being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>entered for the reason that plaintiff failed or refused to prosecute his action, or for any other reason\u2014was a question which the Superior Court had power to pass upon on appeal. Nor did a judgment against plaintiff necessarily follow from the order of the Justice denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for a default. If the judgment entered in the Justice's Court was erroneous, the Superior Court had power to reverse it, on the appeal of the party against whom the judgment went, or to affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">We think the Superior Court was authorized to hear the appeal although \u201cno statement of the case\u201d was filed. Section 975 of the Code of Civil Procedure relates to \u201c statements\u201d containing \u201c the grounds on which the party intends to rely upon the appeal, and so much of the evidence as may be necessary to explain the grounds;\u201d cases in which a statement of evidence is necessary to point the exceptions of the appellant. Where the alleged errors appear in the copy of the Justice\u2019s docket, or in the copies of papers, sent up by the Justice as required by Sections 975, 977, there can be no necessity for, and the statute does not require, a statement; which, in such cases, could only recite what appears in the record. If, therefore, the Superior Court had reversed the judgment of the Justice\u2019s Court, we would have refused this writ, whether we agree with the former Court or not. So if the Superior Court had affirmed the judgment of the Justice\u2019s Court, not because such judgment would have been right, but because the Superior Court had jurisdiction to reverse or affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">But it is obvious that the Superior Court could not make any order nor render any judgment which could affect the rights of the <em>defendant, </em>who had never been served with process, unless the defendant, by a general appearance, submitted itself to the jurisdiction. The defendant (petitioner here) appeared <em>specially </em>in the Superior Court to move a dismissal of the appeal. The Superior Court could not, and did not, entertain the appeal as an appeal \u201c on questions of law and fact.\u201d When an appeal is taken on questions of law and fact, the action must be \u201c tried anew\u201d in the Superior Court, such trial to be conducted in all respects as if the action had been commenced originally in that Court. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 976, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>980.) It is obvious the issues of <em>fact </em>can not be tried <em>anew </em>in the Superior Court until after they have been <em>tried </em>in the Justice\u2019s Court: Considering the appeal as an appeal on questions of law alone, the Superior Court could not order a \u201c new trial\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 980), because as yet the action had not been \u201c tided\u201d at all, in the sense in which the word is used in connection with new trials. The Superior Court had jurisdiction therefore only to affirm or reverse the Justice\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">From what has been said it follows that the Superior Court had no power to order the defendant there (petitioner here) \u201cto file its answer to plaintiff\u2019s complaint in said Superior Court by October 9,1880, at ten o\u2019clock A. M., and that said cause thereafter proceed to trial upon an issue of fact thus to be formed.\u201d This for two reasons: 1. Because defendant had not been served with a process nor appeared\u2014except specially\u2014in the Justice\u2019s Court, and the appellate Court did not acquire jurisdiction of the person of the defendant through the <em>plaintiff\u2019s </em>appeal. 2. Because the appeal of plaintiff only gave jurisdiction to the Superior Court to affirm or reverse the Justice\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">It has been repeatedly held here, however, that prohibition (a writ in its nature a prerogative writ) will not go from this Court, unless the attention of the Court whose proceedings are sought to be stayed has been called to the alleged excess of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">On the calling of the case in the Superior Court, respondent (defendant there, and petitioner in the present proceeding) moved <em>to dismiss the appeal </em>on the grounds: 1. That the judgment of the Justice\u2019s Court was not appealable. 2. That no statement on appeal had been settled or filed. 8. That no issue of fact had been made or tried in the Justice\u2019s Court. The motion was denied. But the Superior Court, instead of hearing the appeal or\u2014if argument was waived\u2014adjudging that the judgment of the Justice be affirmed or reversed, simply ordered the defendant to answer and proceed to the trial of an action wherein there stood, unreversed, a judgment against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The petitioner has never pleaded to the jurisdiction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Superior Court, or in any form objected that the Court had no power to make the order compelling it to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Doubtless, when petitioner shall (avoiding a general ap- \u25a0 pearance to the merits) object in the Superior Court to its order, that Court will refrain from further proceedings, except to set aside the order made in excess of its jurisdiction, and to enter judgment affirming or reversing the judgment of the Justice of the Peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Writ denied and proceedings dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Ross, J., and Morrison, 0. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
