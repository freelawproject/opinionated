(Stats. of 1881, p. 23.) Even if it had been so, we submit the two sections must be construed together, that is, sections 393 and 398. Section 8, article vi, of the new Constitution, provides that a Judge of any Superior Court may hold a Superior Court in any county at the request of a Judge of the Superior Court thereof, and upon the request of the Governor it shall be his duty so to do. Under the old Constitution there was no provision for providing for another District Judge, in case of disqualification, except at the request of the Judge so disqualified.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b158-12\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">The Judge of the Superior Court having been attorney and of counsel in the proceeding (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 170), should have granted the motion to change the place of trial. (Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Civ. Proc. \u00a7 398.) Such was the law when the motion was made. (Const., art. xxii, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Order reversed, and Court below directed to order the cause to be transferred for trial to the appropriate Superior Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
