The statute under which the Supervisors laid out this road was in force January 1,1880, and the case made by the record presents two questions: 1. Is said statute inconsistent with Section 14 of Article i of the Constitution ? 2. If it is, then is Section 14 of Article i self-executing, or does it require legislative action ? We concede the first point must be held against the appellant. But we claim that the fourteenth Section of Article 1 is not self-executing. The language\u2014\u201cas shall be prescribed by law\u201d\u2014in said section evidently contemplates some act of legislation on the subject, and until that has taken place no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>damages can Tbe assessed in pursuance of the constitutional provision. <em>(The People etc. </em>v. <em>The Board of Supervisors of Ulster County, </em>3 Barb. 332; <em>Groves </em>v. <em>Slaughter, </em>15 Pet. <em>449.)</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b349-4\"><em>Terry, McKimie, </em>and <em>Terry, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-5\">The \u201c act concerning roads- and highways in the County of San Joaquin,\u201d approved March 18, 1876, ceased to have any validity on the first of January, 1880, when the Constitution took effect. (Constitution, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 12, art. xxii.) It is in conflict with Section 14 of Article i of the Constitution, which is strictly prohibitory, and requires no legislation to enforce it. <em>(McDonald </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>54 Cal. 245; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Trustees of Pleasant Township, </em>21 Ohio St. 667; <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Lane, 4 </em>Id. 167; <em>Shaver </em>v. <em>Starrett, </em>Id. 495.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b349-6\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">On the authority of <em>Weber </em>v. <em>The Supervisors of the County of Santa Clara, supra, </em>266, judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
