C. 169; 1 Bish. Crim. Proc., \u00a7 498; <em>People </em>v. <em>Saviers, </em>14 Cal. 30; 1 Chit. Crim. L. 169; <em>State </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>1 Rich. (S.

Where a common law definition must be imported into a statute to give it effect, the indictment must allege the ingredients that complete the offense. <em>(Reg. </em>v. <em>Powner, </em>12 Cox Crim.

The acts constituting the offense are stated in ordinary and concise language, and in such manner as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended. (Penal Code, \u00a7 950.) Every person of ordinary intelligence understands what the crime against nature with a human being is.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">We find no error in the instruction to which our attention is called, and the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">Sharpstein, J., and Morrison, C.
