Campbell, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-12\">It appeared from the evidence (without substantial conflict) that the plaintiff negotiated with the defendant to sell him the land in controversy for fifty head of horses, provided the horses were as represented, and the defendant, on seeing the land, was satisfied with it; that and in pursuance of this negotiation a deed was signed by the plaintiff, and placed in the hands of its agent, Perrin, who was authorized to deliver it after examining and accepting the horses. Perrin and the defendant went to look at the horses, but saw only thirty-five head, the defendant stating that there were fifteen head more about twenty miles away, which he assured Perrin wer&lt; fully up to the average of the horses which he had seen. Perrin thereupon concluded to consummate the trade, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>gave the defendant the deed, and the defendant gave him a bill of sale of the horses\u2014all with the understanding that defendant was to have the privilege of going the next day to see the land, and if it suited him it was to be considered a trade; but upon examining the land he was dissatisfied, and returned the deed and took back the bill of sale. Afterwards, the defendant intending to go to San Francisco, where the office of the plaintiff was, Perrin gave him the deed to be delivered at the office of the company. The defendant, instead of doing this, had the deed recorded, and claimed that it had been duly delivered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-4\"><em>J. P.

Real Prop., <em>supra; Cutts </em>v. <em>York Co., </em>18 Me. 190; <em>Hadlock v. Hadlock, </em>22 Ill. 388; <em>Black </em>v. <em>Shreve, </em>13 N. J.

This is essential to constitute it a deed. <em>(Stephens </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>20 Barb. 332; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>12 Johns. 418; <em>Carnes </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>6 Rob. (N.

Eq. 457.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-4\">Tills was nothing more than a deed deposited with Perrin in escrow, as is abundantly proven, to be by him delivered to McCarthy, on certain conditions agreed on between the parties. <em>(Ford </em>v. <em>James, </em>4 Keyes, 300; <em>Los Angeles L. Co. </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>7 Pac. C. L. J) These conditions were never complied with; and no delivery of the deed, therefore, however honestly made, by Perrin, or whether done through fraud on the part of defendant, or by collusion between him and Perrin, could possibly have passed the title to the land. A strict compliance is always necessary.
