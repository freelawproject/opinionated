The complaint alleged the construction of a canal by the defendant 1 \u2018 to the head of Beach\u2019s Lake, \u201d by which water was discharged in the lake, and the level of the same raised so as to overflow the plaintiff\u2019s land, A demurrer was sustained to the complaint, apparently upon the ground, that the construction of the canal was authorized by the Act of March 12, 1868, which authorizes \u201cthe construction of a ditch or canal, for drainage purposes, leading from the north line of B Street, Sacramento, to the channel or slough known as ^Snodgrass Slough\u2019 or \u2018Bloom\u2019s Lake.\u2019\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b624-6\"><em>S'eld: </em>It does not appear, from the allegations of the complaint, that the canal was constructed as authorized by the Act.

There is no presumption in favor of such right. <em>(Bensley </em>v. <em>Mountain Lake Water Co., </em>13 Cal. 306-310; <em>Curran </em>v. <em>Shattuck, </em>24 id. 427; <em>Stanford v.

A. Anderson </em>and <em>Grove L. Johnson, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-5\">The construction of the Sacramento Drainage Canal of which appellants complain, was authorized by legislative grant and license. (Stat. 1867-8, p. 127; Stat. 1869-70; p. 127; Stat. 1871-2, p. 854; Stat. 1873-4, p. 604; Stat. 1877-8, p. 852.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-6\">The work being done, and canal constructed, under authority from the State, and for public uses, there is no injury in contemplation of law, and which license operates as a complete immunity from any action of this nature. <em>(Green </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>47 Cal. 536; <em>Hoagland </em>v. <em>City of Sacramento, </em>52 id. 142; <em>Baily </em>v. <em>New York, </em>3 Hill, 539; S. C., 38 Am. Dec. 669.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-7\">The alleged cause of complaint being part of a system of reclamation, and the land in question being swamp and overflowed land, the appellants are bound by the Acts of the legislature providing for its reclamation. <em>(Kimball </em>v. <em>Reclamation Fund Commissioners, </em>45 Cal. 344.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b625-8\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The Act of March 12, 1868 (Stat. 1867\u20148, p. 127), authorized \u201c the construction of a ditch or canal for drainage purposes, leading from the north line of R Street, Sacramento, to the channel or slough known as Snodgrass Slough or to Bloom\u2019s Lake.\u201d The complaint alleges the construction of a drainage canal from said city \u201cto the head of Beach\u2019s Lake.\u201d If, as contended on the oral argument, the canal was not completed to the lower point named in the Act, but fell short of it, and emptied the sewage into a lake or slough other than those specified, and by reason thereof the acts complained of were performed and the damage sustained, plaintiff doubtless has a cause of action, and is entitled to relief. Looking at the Act above referred to and the complaint, we can not say that the canal, terminating in Beach\u2019s Lake, has been constructed and used the entire distance contemplated by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with instruction to overrule the demurrer, with leave to defendant to answer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
