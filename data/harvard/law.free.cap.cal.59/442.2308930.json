(Bishop on Con., \u00a7 421; C. C., \u00a7 2794, subd. 3.) Under the agreement the debt was not due when the action was begun.

That, at that time, plaintiff was the owner of a bill of exchange for one hundred and forty dollars, drawn on defendant by one M. Elizalde, and there was due to plaintiff from one A. Varelas, an employ\u00e9 of defendant, eighty-five dollars and fifteen cents. That when the account was stated, as aforesaid, the defendant agreed to pay and satisfy the said balance of account, the bill of exchange, and the sum due from Elizalde, by forwarding to plaintiff from San Francisco, by Wells, Fargo &amp; Co.\u2019s express, five hundred and thirty-five dollars and thirty-four cents\u2014 two hundred and thirty-five dollars and thirty-four cents thereof to be in silver coin of the United States\u2014within one week from September 11, 1880; and that in consideration of the said promises of defendant, plaintiff agreed to the postponement of the payment of the said balance of account, until the expiration of one week from September 11, 1880. That in pursuance of the aforesaid agreement, and within the time limited, defendant forwarded from San Francisco by Wells, Fargo &amp; Co. the sum of five hundred and thirty-five dollars and thirty-four cents, including two hundred and thirty-five dollars and thirty-four cents in silver coin, as agreed upon. The Court below found the facts as averred in defendant\u2019s answer. There was evidence to sustain the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Defendant performed his contract when (within the week) he delivered the money to Wells, Fargo &amp; Co., at San Francisco, to be by them transmitted to plaintiff. The agreement was executed on his part. There was sufficient consideration for plaintiff\u2019s promise. In part it consisted in the assumption and payment by defendant of the debt of a third person, A. Varelas. The defendant agreed to pay this debt for a- consideration beneficial to him\u2014the forbearance of plaintiff to sue upon the balance of account. The promise of defendant to pay Varelas\u2019 debt was, therefore, an original obligation on his part, which constituted a valid consideration for-the promise of plaintiff. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2794.) The agreement was binding upon both parties. It followed that this action, brought before the expiration of the week during which plaintiff had agreed to wait, was prematurely brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\">The evidence with respect to any representations as to cattle, which, as claimed by appellant, induced plaintiff to enter into the agreement alleged in defendant\u2019s answer, was conflicting.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
