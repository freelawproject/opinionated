It is a peculiar, special, and limited liability. (Civil Code, \u00a7 322.) It does not exist at common law, and is created only by statute. <em>(Salt Lake City Nat.

P. R. R. Co., </em>52 Cal. 42.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-16\">Section 359, Code Civil Procedure, has no application to this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-17\">It must be evident that this section throughout speaks of tortious acts, and not of liability arising from contract. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>speaks throughout of penalties and forfeitures. These are the specific terms included by the generic term, \u201c liability created by law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-5\">How can a creditor who sues for a debt be said to be an \u201c aggrieved party \u201d within the meaning of the statute ? That term implies fraud or misrepresentation. Then section 359 says the action may be brought within three years after the discovery of the facts, etc., yet it has been decided time after time, both in this State and in other States, that the statute begins to run from the time of the contraction of the debt, or the time it becomes due. <em>(Davidson </em>v. Rankin, 34 Cal. 503; <em>Stilphen </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>45 id. 110. Thompson on Liability of Stockholders, Sec. 292; <em>Carroll </em>v <em>Green, </em>92 U. S. (2 Otto), 509 ; <em>Lindsay </em>v. <em>Hyatt, </em>4 Ed. Ch. 104; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Atlas Bank, </em>9 Metc. <em>182; Conklin </em>v. <em>Furman, </em>57 Barb. 484 ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cochituate Bank, </em>3 Allen, 42.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b574-6\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The suit is brought against stockholders to recover money had and received by a corporation more than two and less than three years before the commencement of the action. Defendants demurred generally, and also specially that it appeared from the complaint that the cause of action did not accrue within two years, etc. The Court below sustained the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">The construction of Section 359 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not free from difficulty. The section reads: \u201c This title does not affect actions against directors or stockholders of a corporation, to recover a penalty or forfeiture imposed, or to enforce a liability created by law, but such actions must be brought within three years after the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts upon which the penalty or forfeiture attached, or the liability was created.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">It was held in New York, that a suit against a stockholder of a corporation to charge him individually with a debt contracted by it, pursuant to a provision of the act of incorporation, was not an action spoken of in the Statute of Limitations as \u201c an action upon a statute, for a forfeiture or cause, the benefit and suit whereof is limited to the party aggrieved.\u201d <em>(Corning </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>1 Comst. 47.) In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>same case it was held, that where the charter of an incorporated company provided that the stockholders should be liable for its debts, and that a creditor could, after judgment obtained against the corporation, and execution returned unsatisfied, sue any stockholder and recover his demand, such stockholders were liable in an original and primary sense, like partners or members of an unincorporated association, and their liability was not <em>created </em>by the statute of incorporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">That, under such an act, the liability of the stockholders was primary, may be admitted. <em>A fortiori </em>when, as under our Code, the stockholder may be proceeded against originally for his proportion of a corporation debt. And so it has been repeatedly held in this State. In the New York case it would have been enough to have said that the stockholder was liable as upon his implied contract, arising out of the circumstance that he became a stockholder under the statute which imposed the obligation, and that an action based upon his implied promise, was not an action upon a statute for a <em>forfeiture, </em>or cause in the nature of a forfeiture. Section 359 of the Code of Civil Procedure is broader in its terms than the statute referred to in <em>Corning </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>1 Comst. 55. It provides that an action to enforce a liability created by law against the stockholder may be brought within three years after the discovery of the facts, etc. It is true, that the stockholder becomes a party to the contract by his own volition. It might be admitted, that, in the strict sense of the term, there may be, as insisted by respondents, no common law corporations, but, except for tlie express\u2022 language of our Constitution and statute, no such personal liability would attend the creation of a corporation proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Under our statutory law, then, the liability is created with respect to all stockholders, as stockholders, attaching itself to the particular individual when he becomes a stockholder. If the phrase \u201c aggrieved party\u201d suggests a <em>tort </em>committed, such is not the necessary consequence of the employment of the terms. Our attention has not been called to any provision of the statute which imposes any \u201c penalty\u201d or \u201c forfeiture\u201d upon a stockholder for any act as such, and no effect can be given to the words \u201c liability created by law,\u201d unless we apply it to the liability which the law imposes when one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>\"becomes a stockholder, and thus establishes the relation to the creditors of the corporation to which the law affixes the responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">In <em>Salt Lake City Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Hendrickson </em>(6 Rep. 212), the Supreme Court of New Jersey said: \u201cThe personal liability of the officers and stockholders of .a corporation, for a debt contracted by the corporation, must of necessity be the <em>creature </em>of the statute. Personal responsibility of stockholders is inconsistent with a body corporate at common law, and can arise only out of some positive prescription by legislative act.\u201d (Citing Field on Corporations, 55-74; <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Sturgess, </em>26 N. Y. 134, and other cases.) And in the Supreme Court of the United States, Chief Justice Waite said: \u201c The individual liability of stockholders in a corporation is always a creature of statute. It did not exist at common law.\u201d <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Little, </em>9 Rep. 335.)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">We conclude that the action was brought in proper time, and that the special demurrer should have been overruled. We think the general demurrer not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with directions to the Court below to overrule demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
