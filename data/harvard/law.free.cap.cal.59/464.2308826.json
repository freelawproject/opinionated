Rowland <em>v. </em>Eulogio F. de Celis, of date April \u202221,1877, an assignment to himself by Hayes, and a sheriff s \u25a0deed executed in pursuance thereof. An attachment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>issued and levied upon the interest of Eulogio in the land in controversy on the twenty-sixth day of December, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-5\">The Court found that both Hayes and the defendant had notice of the facts constituting the plaintiff\u2019s title.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b495-6\"><em>Graves &amp; Chapman, </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-7\">While a mere attachment or judgment lien is not protected by the recording laws, a purchaser at a judicial sale is protected in like manner as a purchaser from the party himself. (Freeman on Judgments, \u00a7 366; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>McGlasson, </em>18 Ia. 150; <em>Orth </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>8 Blackf. (Ind.) 420; <em>Runyan </em>v. <em>McClellan, </em>24 Ind. 165; <em>Pixley </em>v. <em>Huggins, </em>15 Cal. 133; <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Walley, </em>22 id. 224; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Badger, </em>23 id. 399; <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Light, </em>38 id. 653.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-8\">Our deed relates back to the attachment lien. <em>(Porter </em>v. <em>Pico, </em>6 P. C. L. J. 17.) It therefore overreaches the deed of January 2, 1877.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-9\">Now, to overcome this right in us, plaintiffs, we say, must maintain these three propositions: 1. That they had an equitable interest at the date of the levy of the writ; and 2. That Hayes had notice at the time of the sale; and 3. That defendant had notice at the time of the assignment to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-10\">But it is claimed by counsel for the plaintiffs that if the equitable interest existed at the time of the levy of our attachment, notice to us is of no consequence. The argument is that our attachment was no lien on their equity, and before the sale the legal title had been conveyed to them; that therefore at the time of the sale E. F. had nothing to sell, and some countenance to this doctrine is supposed to be found in <em>Hoag </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>55 Cal. 564.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-11\">But that case is no authority for any such proposition as is contended for here, viz., that notice to the purchaser is of no consequence. Without such notice the purchaser is protected. <em>(Emmons </em>v. <em>Moore et al., </em>85 Ill. 306; Civil Code, \u00a7 856.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-12\">Nobody pretends that we would not have a good title if there was not an implied or resulting trust in favor of these plaintiffs. But the statute is, \u201cNo implied or resulting trust can prejudice the rights of a purchaser * * * of real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>property for value and without notice.\u201d Hayes was a purchaser for value, and so was Porter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-5\">But it is claimed our deed does not relate hack to the attachment, because our writ of execution directed the sale of all the interest E. F. had at the time the judgment was docketed, and the deed recites a sale of that title, and purports to convey all the interest that E. F. had at that time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIC\">We answer, 1. The statute prescribes the form of executions on money judgments. (C. C. P., \u00a7 682, suhd. 1.) And we were not entitled to any other, and if the sale does not relate hack to the attachment, then the statute has provided an attachment lien and denied any means of enforcing it. 2. The point was decided in <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Pico, 55 Cal. 165. </em>The question there arose under this very deed and these very attachment proceedings. Besides it was settled before. <em>(Bagley </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>37 id. 121.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-7\">The Court could not direct the defendant to execute a conveyance. Having decreed that he had no title, there was nothing to convey. <em>(Brannan </em>v. <em>Patey, </em>58 Cal. 330.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b496-8\"><em>Glassell, Smith &amp; Smith, </em>for Respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-9\">The sole consideration of the conveyance of June 12, 1876, to Eulogio F. de Celis by Maclay and Porter, was the sale and conveyance of the property of the estate of Eulogio de Celis, deceased. There was, therefore, a resulting trust in favor of the heirs of said deceased. (C. C., \u00a7 853, and cases cited in the annotated edition; 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., \u00a7\u00a7 1196-1211.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-10\">There was also a constructive trust in their favor. For, undoubtedly, the agreement of Eulogio with Maclay for a re-conveyance back to himself of property of the estate sold by him as administrator, and the subsequent conveyance to him, were in fraud of the rights of the estate and of the heirs. (C. C. P., \u00a7 1576; C. C., \u00a7 2224; <em>Guerrero </em>v. <em>Ballerino, </em>48 Cal. 118; <em>O\u2019Conner </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>57 id. 293; <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Colby, 55 </em>id. 67; <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>id. 91; <em>Michoud </em>v. <em>Girod, </em>4 How. 553.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-11\">Therefore, by the deed to Eulogio from Maclay &amp; Porter, the plaintiffs acquired the equitable and beneficial ownership of the undivided thirteen fourteenths of Section 33, in controversy, and in equity (and therefore in this case) are to he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>regarded as the true owners. (Hill on Trustees, 316, 444, 278, <em>393; 2 </em>Spence\u2019s Eq. Jur. 3; 1 Perry on Trusts, \u00a7 227.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-5\">The attachment in the Rowland case bound only the interest of the debtor (Eulogio). <em>(Hoag </em>v. Howard, 55 Cal. 564; <em>Purdy </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>18 id. 350; <em>Plant v. Smythe, </em>45 id. 162; <em>Wilcoxson </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>49 id. 195; Hill on Trustees, 209, 379; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Tousley, </em>1 Paige, 283-4; <em>Lownsbury </em>v. <em>Purdy, </em>11 Barb. 494; <em>Averill </em>v. <em>Loucks, </em>6 id. 26, 27; Arnold v. <em>Patrick, </em>6 Paige, 315 ; <em>Hurst </em>v. <em>Hurst, </em>2 Wash. C. C. 78; 1 Perry on Trusts, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 346; Hill on Trustees, 269, 379, cited <em>supra; </em>2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., \u00a7 1503 b, and note 1, p. 999; <em>Pixley </em>v. <em>Huggins, </em>15 Cal. 131, 132; <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>12 id. 377; <em>Finch </em>v. Earl of Win<em>chelsea, </em>1 P. Wms. 278; <em>Ledyard </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>9 Paige, 132.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-6\">After, as well as before the attachment, therefore, the plaintiffs could have compelled a conveyance to them from Eulogio (Hill on Trustees, 539, 787); and Eulogio, in conveying to them, simply performed a duty which the law imposed upon him. The conveyance was, therefore, not in contravention \u00f3f the attachment, nor an unlawful act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-7\">Eulogio having conveyed to the plaintiffs (in execution of the trust), they became vested with the legal as well as the equitable title, and their deed being duly recorded, there is no principle of the law by which their title could be divested without their consent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-8\">Where the owner\u2019s deed is recorded before the judgment sale, though after the accruing of an attachment or judgment lien, no right can be acquired by a purchaser, either with or without notice. The only exception known to the law is that provided for in O. 0., \u00a7 1214. But our ease does not come within this exception. For our deed was first recorded; and we are not seeking to assert an equity against the defendant on an unrecorded deed, but a legal title resting upon a deed recorded long before he purchased. (1 Perry on Trusts, 220-223.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-9\">The defendant, therefore, whether he purchased with or without notice, acquired no interest, except that of Eulogio, to wit, an undivided one fourteenth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-10\">The doctrine of relation has no application. It is a principle as old as Coke, that \u201c relation is a fiction of law,\u201d and that \u201c in destruction of a lawful estate vested, the law will never make any fiction.\u201d <em>(Butler &amp; Baker\u2019s Case, </em>3 Co. 28.) \u201c <em>Be</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number><em>lati\u00f3 est fictio juris,\u201d </em>according to the resolution in <em>Menvill\u2019s Case </em>(13 Co. 19), and is upheld to advance a right, not to advance a wrong, or to defeat collateral acts which are lawful, and especially if they concern strangers. \u201c The limitation of the fiction, so as to prevent it from doing injuries to strangers, or defeating mesne lawful acts, is the common language of the books.\u201d <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>20 Johns. 536, citing numerous cases; <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>21 Barb. 589.) In this case we , come under all the exceptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-5\">We are strangers, not claiming under Eulogio, but by title superior and paramount to him, and prior to the attachment. The conveyance to us by Eulogio was (as we have shown) a \u201c lawful act,\u201d and the estate was lawfully vested in us. Moreover, there must be something to which the relation can be had. <em>(Doe </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>8 Cow. 285.) And this something, in this case, could only be the interest attached\u2014that is to say, Eulogio\u2019s interest, which was alone bound by the attachment. (See cases cited <em>supra; </em>see, also, <em>Shay </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>54 Cal. 169.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b498-6\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">This case was heard and decided by Department Two, and the following opinion was filed therein:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u201c That E. F. de Cells held whatever of the legal title to the premises in controversy was conveyed to him by Porter and Maclay, in trust for the plaintiffs, is beyond question. The attachment and the execution sale were of his interest only. The rights of the plaintiffs were not thereby affected. 1 Upon a sale of real property the purchaser is substituted to, and acquires all. the right, title, interest, and claim of, the judgment debtor thereto.\u2019 (Sec. 709, C. C. P.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">After a hearing in bank, we are satisfied with the judgment of the Department. The findings show that E. F. de Celis held the land in controversy in trust for the plaintiffs, and that the defendant, as well as Hayes, his assignor, had notice of that fact. We think that the evidence is sufficient to support the findings, and that, therefore, the plaintiffs were entitled to a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">Boss, J.,being disqualified, did not participate in this decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
