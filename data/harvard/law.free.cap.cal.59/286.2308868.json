(Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3123, 3124, 3125.) The possession of the note by Davis, one of the makers, raised the presumption that it was paid; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>it certainly showed that he did not own it. He could not own it legally. <em>(Bank </em>v. <em>Hammett, </em>50 N. Y. 158.) The note was largely overdue and dishonored. It was payable on November 9th, 1877. Davis pledged the note to Dezaldo September 28th, 1878, and to Stratford November 14th, 1878. The intervenors necessarily took it charged with notice of any infirmities as to title or validity. <em>(Strong </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>5 Rep. 385.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-5\"><em>S. 0. Houghton </em>and <em>John Reynolds, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">Bearing the indorsement of the payee, the title to the note passed by delivery. Davis being the agent of Templeton and having the note in his possession with her consent, and with her indorsement thereon, and the mortgage securing it being unsatisfied of record, he had apparent power to pledge the note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-7\">Where an agent is intrusted with blank indorsements, he has an implied authority to fill up and deliver the instruments, and although he acts fraudulently it will be valid in the hands of an innocent holder. (Edwards on Bills, 252; 1 Daniell on Neg. Inst. 645.) The intervenors were purchasers for value without notice. Davis had ostensible authority to dispose of the note, and the intervenors come within the protection of 0. 0., \u00a7\u00a7 2334, 2317, 2315, 2991, 1962, 3543.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b315-8\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">The intervenors do not seek to charge plaintiff as indorser of the note payable to her order, but claim to have acquired through her indorsement the legal title in the note, with a right to resort to the mortgage security to the extent of their claims. They loaned their money, respectively, to the payor and mortgagor, in whose possession they found the note, indorsed by plaintiff, long after the maturity of the obligation, and took from him the note and mortgage as security. It may be assumed that the fact the note was in possession of the payor after due, did not conclusively establish its payment, as against intervenors. On the other hand, the fact that plaintiff had indorsed the note and placed it in the hands of .the maker, did not clothe the latter with ostensible authority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>after it became due, to assign, pledge, or negotiate it for his own benefit. The intervenors were put upon inquiry, and, ascertaining the facts, would have known that the note had not been paid, but had been put in the payor\u2019s possession for a specific purpose, which had been accomplished, leaving the note in his hands as the mere agent of plaintiff\".</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
