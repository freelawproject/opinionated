The decision of the Supreme Court was conclusive upon the Court below only to the extent of the issues tried by the latter. <em>(Soule </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>14 id. 249; <em>French </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>21 Wall. 147; <em>Ex parte French, </em>91 U. S. 426.) It would be different if the order refusing a new trial had been affirmed, and the court below ordered to modify its judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-12\"><em>G.

On April 5th, 1879, that court entered a decree, according to the opinion delivered by the Supreme Court, from which the present appeal is prosecuted; and the appellant contends that the decree is erroneous, because it was rendered and entered: without a retrial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">But no new trial was ordered, and none was necessary; for the Supreme Court had determined the rights of the parties, and that determination was a final adjudication of the case itself, which only required to be embodied in form by the entry of a proper judgment in the lower Court, to make it enforceable. The entry of such a judgment was the only duty devolved upon the Court, under the mandate of the Supreme Court. <em>(Keller </em>v. Lewis, 56 Cal. 466.) If upon the going down of the remittitur from the Supreme Court the lower Court had retried the case, and upon such new trial had rendered a judgment, it would have been void. <em>(Argenti </em>v. <em>San Francisco, </em>30 Cal. 460.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">It is, however, urged that the opinion of the Supreme Court was not a final adjudication of the case, because there was no finding by the lower Court upon an issue presented in the case, as to the time when the defendants acquired the rights which they claimed. If there had been, it is urged, there would have been found-that their rights had accrued three days before the plaintiff acquired his equitable interest in the land by the deed, which was passed upon by the Supreme Court; and in the absence of a finding upon the issue, the defendants\u2019 rights were not considered and determined, and therefore the opinion of the Supreme Court in the case can not be final and conclusive against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>In the original record on appeal there appears to have been no assignment of error, that the lower Court failed to find upon any material issue in the case. Presumably, therefore, the findings of the case covered all the issues, and their consideration, in connection with the pleadings in the case, involved an adjudication of every question pertaining to the rights of the parties to the property in controversy, which has now passed beyond challenge. Whether that judgment was right or wrong, it became the law of the case for all subsequent proceedings in it. As Mr. Justice Field said in <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>San Francisco </em>(20 Cal. 39), \u201cit is more than authority. It is a final adjudication, from the consequences of which the Court can not depart, nor the parties relieve themselves.\u201d See also <em>Jaafe </em>v. <em>Skae, </em>48 Cal. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">MoKinstky, J., and Boss, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
