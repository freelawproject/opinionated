Wells, Jordan, Sale, </em>and <em>J. ParJeer,') </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-8\">The release of one of several joint obligors is a release of all. To this, authorities need not be cited. The principle is in fact admitted by the replications.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-9\">But the plaintiff denies that the release is vaild as to Montgomery. He sues him, with the rest of the obligors, and alleges that the release was procured by fraud. His replications are insufficient for several reasons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-10\">I. The second replication sets forth no act of fraud, nor that the plaintiff relied upon any act or representation of Montgomery in making the release. The fraud must be set out, in order that the court may judge whether the matter charged amounts to fraud, and also whether if there be fraud, it is in the execution or in the consideration. If there is fraud, it was by Montgomery upon the plaintiff, and the plaintiff has knowledge what it was; and in this respect the case is different from one where the alleged fraud was in a transaction between third persons. There can have been no fraud in procuring the release, unless the plaintiff relied, in some way, upon the representations or acts of Montgomery, or placed confidence in him; and this should be averred. 6 Cl. &amp; Fin., 444, 447, 488, 516 ; 1 Story Eq. Jur., \u00a7 205, &amp;c. But it is not to be intended from anything alleged in the second replication, that he did so.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-11\">The soundness of the objection to the second replication will appear further from the objection to the others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-12\">Chitty (if he is relied on) is not sustained in his proposition that it is unnecessary to state the particulars of the fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-13\">II. If there was any fraud alleged in the third and fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>replications, it is fraud in the consideration, and not in the execution ; and this is not sufficient at law. This is a good exception where there is an equity jurisdiction with power to relieve against fraud, as in New-Hampshire, however it may have been held in a jurisdiction where the matter can only be relieved at law, and where therefore the courts of law do imperfect equity, as far as their forms admit. <em>Vrooman </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>2 Johns., 177; <em>Dorr </em>v. <em>Munsell, </em>13 Johns., 430 ; <em>Franchot </em>v. <em>Leach, </em>5 Cowen, 506 ; <em>Champion </em>v. <em>White, </em>6 Cowen, 509 ; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>King, </em>6 Munf., 358, 366 ; <em>Asterbaut v. Shoemaker, </em>3 Hill\u2019s N. Y., 513.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-5\">It has been held generally that a party cannot avoid a speciality at law, by pleading that it was obtained by fraudulent misrepresentations. <em>Wyche </em>v. <em>McLin, 2 </em>Rand., 426, and see <em>Mease </em>v. <em>Mease, </em>Cowp., 47.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-6\">HI. But the special replications do not allege anything that amounts to fraud, even in the consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-7\">1. Because the fact or question, whether Holcomb had fulfilled or not, was no part of even the consideration for the release, which for aught which is alleged, was and is to be taken to be upon sufficient consideration. Such a representation as is set forth, had none of the elements of a consideration. If not true, it was, at most, a falsehood in a matter not passing between these parties, and therefore forming no part of the consideration. Ch. Con., 681.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-8\">2. Because, if not true, the representation was not fraudulent, unless its falsity was known to Montgomery at the time ; and no <em>scienter </em>is alleged or pretended. <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Trafton, </em>15 Maine, 225 ; <em>Early </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>9 B. &amp; C., 928 ; <em>Edmunds </em>v. <em>McLeary, 2 </em>Swan., 289; Ch. Con., 683 ; <em>Small </em>v. <em>Atwood, </em>1 Young, 461, 462, 487; <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Small, </em>6 Cl. &amp; Fin., 233, 330, 395, 396, 444, 445, 449, 450, 502.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-9\">3. The alleged representation was in relation to a matter respecting which Montgomery could not have had actual knowledge, and this must have been understood by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had equal means of knowledge with Montgomery. Better, in fact. He had therefore no right to rely upon and could not have relied upon the alleged representations. He only alleges that he executed the release in confidence of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>But being in relation to a matter of fact equally open to the inquiries of both parties and in regard to which neither could be supposed to trust the other, it is so far from furnishing a defence at law, that equity would not relieve. 1 Story Eq. Jur., \u00a7 \u00a7 146, 150, 191, 197 ; <em>Hough </em>v. Richardson, 3 Story\u2019s C. C. Rep., 690; Ch. Con., 681; 6 Cl. &amp; Fin., 339, 340, 446, 447.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-5\">The representations that the deputy had settled all demands, if made, was one to put the plaintiff on inquiry, and not one to which he could have understood he was to trust as an assertion of the fact. This appears from the nature of the case. <em>Trainer </em>v. Newcome, 3 Mer., 704; <em>Scott </em>v. Hanson, 1 Sim., 14; <em>Haycroft </em>v. Creasey, <em>2 </em>East., 92.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b548-6\"><em>Christie, </em>(with whom were Marston, and Eastman, and <em>J. S. Wells,) </em>for the plaintiff</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-7\">In support of the second replication, we say: the general\" allegation of fraud is sufficient, where the fraud relates to some particular act. It is so held in New-Jersey, <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>1 Coxe, 182; 6 Halst., 110; in Pennsylvania, <em>Stubbs, adm\u2019r </em>v. King, 14 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 208 ; 10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 25 ; in Indiana, <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Smock, 2 </em>Blackf., 316; in Miss., <em>Pemberton </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>6 Miss. Rep., 59, and also in several leading English cases. The precedent for such a general replication of fraud to a plea of release, is given, 2 Ch. Pl., 1158, and the doctrine is laid down at length, 1 Ch. Pl., 536, and authorities cited to sustain it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-8\">Such a general replication is used in <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>13 N. H. Rep., 231; and in <em>Dorr </em>v. <em>Munsell, </em>13 Johns., 430, in both which cases, issue was joined, and no objection taken to the manner of pleading. So also in <em>Daranda </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>6 C. &amp; P., 511; <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Rigley, </em>2 Ch. R., 298, and 5 M. &amp; S., 60. This point was expressly decided in <em>Tresham's case, </em>9 Co. Rep., 110, and in <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Peachy, </em>T. Ray, 303. See also <em>Wimbish </em>v. <em>Tailbois, </em>Pl. Com., 54 ; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Montague, 2 </em>Maul. &amp; Selw., 378 ; 3 Went. Ind., 12.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-10\">We give the following abstract of these cases, and authorities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMb\">\u201c A plea, that a bond was obtained by fraud, generally, is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>good plea.

Evans, 1 Coxe, 182.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-5\">\u201c In this case it was resolved, that the general objection of fraud, in the case was sufficient.\u201d <em>Tresham\u2019s case, </em>9 Co. Rep., 110.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-7\">\u201c The general averment of covin is good, without any special cause shown.\u201d <em>Wimbish </em>v. <em>Tailbois, </em>Pl. Com., 54.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-8\">\u201c A replication that an assignment was made by covin and fiaud, to cheat the plaintiff was held good.\u201d <em>Knight </em>v. Peachy, T. Ray., 303.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-9\">\u00a3\u00a3 A general plea to an action on a bond, that the bond was obtained by fraud and covin, without setting out the particulars of the fraud, is good.\u201d <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Smock, </em>2 Blackf., 316.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-10\">\u201c Fraud is a good defence at law ; and it is sufficient to allege fraud generally in a plea.\u201d <em>Pemberton </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>6 Miss., 57.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-11\">\u201c A general plea that a deed was \u00a3 obtained by the plaintiff by fraud and misrepresentation5 has been holden sufficient, on the ground that fraud usually consists of a multiplicity of circumstances, and therefore it might be inconvenient to require them to be particularly set forth.\u201d 1 Ch. Pl., 536, (ed. 1840 ;) 2 M. <em>&amp; </em>S., 378, <em>per </em>Lord <em>Ellenborough.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-12\"><em>\u201c </em>To a plea of release, plaintiff may reply <em>non est factum, </em>or that it was obtained by fraud or duress, and it is in general unnecessary to state the particulars of the fraud.\u201d 1 Ch. Pl., 553, (ed. 1809.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-13\">2. To the fourth cause of demurrer assigned, viz: \u00a3\u00a3 that the second replication amounts to no more than the plea of <em>non est factum,\u201d </em>we say: A plea, which admits the execution of the instrument, and sots up matter in avoidance, is not objectionable, as amounting to the general issue. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Page, </em>3 McLean, 167; <em>Page </em>v. <em>Prentice, </em>6 Blackf., 322.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-14\">3. It was not necessary to allege a <em>scienter </em>in the third and fourth replications,because the terms <em>\u201c'fraud\u201d </em>and <em>\u201cmisrepresentation\u201d </em>import an intention to deceive, and imply a knowledge of the falsity in law. Bouvier\u2019s Law' Dict., Articles <em>Fraud </em>and <em>Misrepresentation </em>; <em>Haycroft </em>v. <em>Creasey, </em>2 East., 108.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-15\">4. Courts of law have set aside contracts and specialties in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>numerous instances, for fraud in the consideration. <em>Cooling </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>6 D. &amp; E., 264; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>1 Coxe, 178; <em>Colburn </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>2 Rich., 386 ; 1 Bay, 278 ; 2 Bay, 11; 1 Dall., 17.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-5\">5. Courts of law and courts of equity have concurrent jurisdiction in matters of fraud, and will give relief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-6\">\u201c Fraud or covin, may, in judgment of law, avoid every kind of act.\u201d <em>Tresham\u2019s case, </em>9 Co.

Con., 678.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-9\">\u201c Where a fraudulent release is set up to a just debt, it would, it seems, be both inconvenient and inconsistent to prevent the plaintiff from defeating the instrument, merely because the party might obtain a remedy in equity; and when it is very possible that a court of. equity might again send the party to law, to have his case tried by a jury. If the party is willing to waive the advantage a court of equity would give him, there seems to be no reason, why he should not impeach the deed for fraud, by evidence upon the trial. 2 Saun.

The second replication of the plaintiff to the defendants\u2019 plea is sufficient in law for the plaintiff to maintain his action. A general plea of fraud, covin and misrepresentation is good. 1 Ch.

J., says: \u00a3\u00a3 Fraud and covin usually consist of a multiplicity of circumstances, and therefore it might be inconvenient to require them to be particularly set forth.\u201d A plea that a bond was obtained by <em>fraud generally, </em>is a good plea. <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>Coxe, 182. A general plea to an action on a bond, that the bond has been obtained by fraud and covin, without setting out the particulars of the fraud, is good. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Smock, </em>2 Blackf., 316. Archbold\u2019s Nisi Prius, 318, after giving the form of general plea of fraud, covin and misrepresentation, says, e\u00a3 If the particulars of the fraud, covin and misrepresentation can conveniently be set out, it is perhaps better to do so.

The fraud alleged in the third and fourth replications is not strictly fraud in the consideration. It is rather fraud practised upon the plaintiff as inducement or motive to perform an act, which he otherwise would not have performed, and by being thus misled, has received injury. For this he has his remedy at law as well as in equity. <em>\u201c </em>When fraudulent release is set up in answer to a just debt, it would, it seems, be both inconvenient and inconsistent to prevent the plaintiff from defeating the instrument by proof of fraud, merely because the party might possibly obtain a remedy in equity, and when it is very possible, that a court of equity might (the party guilty of fraud denying it on his oath,) again send the plaintiff to law to have his case tried by a jury. The party may, by recourse to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>a court of equity, obtain an answer from his adversary on oath, an advantage, which he. could not obtain at law, but if he choose to waive that advantage, there seems to be no reason in law or equity, why he should not impeach the deed for fraud, by evidence upon the trial. 3 Stark.

The misrepresentation is of something material. It was matter of. great consequence to the plaintiff, whether his deputy was in default in his office ; whether there had been \u201c a breach of the condition of the bond, or forfeiture of said condition by the acts of said deputyand whether said deputy \u201c had paid over all money by him collected by virtue of his office.\u201d It was also material to the defendant, Montgomery, as he was bound and obligated to indemnify and save harmless the plaintiff from all loss, damages and cost that should happen to him by reason of the acts, &amp;c., of said deputy. 0</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-10\">2. The representations constituted an inducement or motive to the act of the plaintiff, by which he was actually misled to his injury. This is sufficiently alleged in the replication. The plaintiff executed and delivered said writing of release to Montgomery \u201c in confidence of and by reason of these representations.\u201d And the injury also appears, to wit: the non-payment of money collected by said Holcomb, as deputy, which as a matter of law the plaintiff would be liable to pay without any remedy on the defaulting deputy or his sureties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>3. It is alleged that Montgomery <em>falsely </em>and <em>fraudulently </em>represented, &amp;c. This is sufficient, without further allegation that Montgomery knew the falsity of the representations. This appears from the objection of the defendants\u2019 counsel in itself. Counsel say \u2014 if not true, the representation was not fraudulent, unless its falsity was known to Montgomery at the time. If not fraudulent without knowledge, then the allegation of fraud is sufficient allegation of knowledge, and this position is sustained by authority. <em>Fraudulenter </em>without <em>sdens, </em>or <em>sdens </em>without <em>fraudulenter, </em>is sufficient in cases of false representations. <em>Pasley </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>2 Term Rep., 60 ; 6 Com. Dig., 54, Title Pleader.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-5\">4. The relation of Montgomery - to the deputy, Holcomb, was such, that he, Montgomery, was presumed to know better than the plaintiff the situation of the deputy. Montgomery was severally and jointly bound to the plaintiff, to indemnify him from all damage which might happen to him by reason of the acts of Holcomb, and the plaintiff had no certain means of ascertaining whether the representations were true or false. If an executor of a will should obtain a release from a legatee upon the misreprentation that he had no legacy left him by the will, which was false, or if a devisee should obtain a release from the heir at law upon a representation that the will was duly executed, when'it was not, \u2014 in each of these cases the release might be set aside for fraud. 1 Story Eq. Jur., \u00a7 196. In these cases the <em>legatee </em>and <em>heir </em>have each of them better means of ascertaining the truth of the representations, than the plaintiff had in this case, for the <em>record </em>would show the truth of the matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-6\">5.

Ind., 12, and it is in general unnecessary to state the particulars of the fraud. <em>TresharrHs case, </em>9 Co., 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><em>Tresham\u2019s case </em>was an action against an administratrix, in which she pleaded certain outstanding bonds of the deceased, and no assets further : Replication, as to certain of these, that deceased paid them in his lifetime, and that <em>thej per fraudem et covinam </em>of the administratrix, and to the intent to defraud the plaintiffs of their debt, were kept undischarged and uncancelled. It was resolved that the general allegation of fraud in the case at bar, was sufficient, as it was resolved in <em>Tailbois ease, </em>that general averment of covin was good, because covin is so secret, whereof by intendment another man can\u2019t have knowledge. And if the special matter of covin, which, as it is there held, <em>ex vi termini </em>ought to be betwixt two by intendment of law, a stranger can\u2019t have knowledge, <em>a fortiori </em>in the case of fraud, which may be in the heart of one only, for if- one by deed makes a fraudulent gift of his goods to divers, who know not of it, it is a fraud only in him who makes it.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The case of <em>Wimbish </em>v. <em>Tailbois, </em>Plow. Com., 38, is to the point, that an averment that a recovery in a real action was by covin between the parties, is good; and the question, whether the covin should not be specially averred, was argued at great length both by the counsel and the court, and it was' held, that the covin was well averred without special cause shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The case in the Yearbook, 33 Hen. VI., 5, abridged Bro. Ab. Trespass, 26, was trespass <em>de bonis asportatis. </em>The defendant pleaded a purchase in market overt. The plaintiff\u2019s reply was, that the seller by covin between him and the defendant sold them in said market overt, and it was held that no property passed, and no question made as-to the sufficiency of the replication.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The case of <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Peachy, </em>T. Ray., 303; Vent., 329, 331; S. C. Anon.; 2 T. Jon., 199, was thus: In debt for rent against an assignee of lessee, the defendant pleaded an assignment by him to J. S., such a day, and notice to the plaintiff be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>fore any rent accrued. The plaintiff, lessor, replied, that the assignment was to defraud him of his action by fraud and covin-. The defendant demurred, and it was urged, that fraud is not to be averred in this case, for the assignment was a lawful act; but it was answered, that fraud and covin made legal acts illegal and void. Judgment for the plaintiff, <em>Scroggs, </em>C. J. <em>diss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Coombe, 2 </em>Scott N. R., 597, in an action against a third indorser by a remote endorsee of a bill of exchange, defendant the pleaded, that he was induced to indorse the bill by the fraud, covin and misrepresentation of the plaintiff and two others of the indorsers, and other persons in collusion with them, and without value or consideration. The replication traversed the alleged fraud, covin and misrepresentation. To this there was a special demurrer, and the replication held good. It seems no question was made of the sufficiency of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In <em>Sherwood </em>v. <em>Jonson, </em>1 Wend., 443, it was held, that in a replication to a plea by an executor, of an outstanding judgment and no assets further, that the judgment was fraudulently obtained, it is sufficient' to allege fraud and covin generally, without showing the fraud specially. This is the same point raised and so decided in <em>Tresham\u2019s case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">In <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Smock, 2 </em>Blackf., 316, a general plea to an action on a bond, that the bond was obtained by fraud and covin, without setting out the particulars of the fraud, was held good.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">In <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>Coxe, 182, it was held, that a plea, that a bond was obtained by fraud generally, is a good plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">In <em>Pemberton </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>6 Miss., 59, it was held, fraud is \u00e1 good defence at law, and it is sufficient to allege fraud generally in a plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">In <em>Stower </em>v. <em>Wier, </em>10 S. &amp; R., 25, in debt on a single bill, the defendant pleaded, that the instrument was obtained from him by fraud. The plaintiff replied that it was the defendant\u2019s deed. It was held after verdict for the plaintiffs, that the plea was in the nature of a special <em>non est factum, </em>and the issue well joined, and the judgment regular.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">In <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Wibb, </em>2 Greenl. Rep., 257, in a <em>scir\u00e9facids </em>for further execution on a judgment on a probate bond, a plea by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the sureties, that the decree was obtained by fraud and collusion, without naming the parties to the fraud, was held bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Pleas in this general form are found in <em>Crail </em>v. <em>D\u2019Acth, </em>7 D. &amp; E., 670, (b.); <em>Hamfray </em>v. <em>Rigby, 5 </em>M. &amp; S. 60.; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Gadsden, 4 </em>Scott, N.

Rep., 230 ; and <em>Hewett </em>v. <em>Bronaugh, </em>3 Dana, 459; in which no exception was taken on account of this general form.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">This form of pleading seems to us well sustained by the decisions of ancient and modern times, by the books of precedents, and usage of the profession, as well as by the reason of the case. The defence of fraud may be shown in assumpsit under the general issue. Lawes Pl., in Asst., 586; 3 Ph. Ev., 88; Ch. Con., 295 ; 2 Kent Com., 482; or if the document is put in evidence under the general issue, fraud in it may be shown by parol evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">So fraud in any sealed instrument may be shown under the plea of <em>non est factum. Anon. </em>Lofft., 457 ; 1 Tidd\u2019s Pr., 595 ; <em>Whelpdales case, </em>5 Co., 119; 2 Wils., 341; <em>Vine </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>1 M. &amp; R., 337; 2 Greenl.

There would seem to be a very useless refinement, to require that the precise facts, by which the fraud was effected, should be stated in a special plea, when they are equally available under the general issue. Especially as it is never necessary to plead fraud, which is but a special <em>non est factum. Bickford </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>2 N. H. Rep., 74; 10 S. &amp; R., 25; <em>Union Bank </em>v. <em>Ridgeley, </em>1 H. &amp; G., 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">The third and fourth replications follow the form in 2 Ch. Pl., 464, (Day\u2019s Ed.,) a plea that a deed was obtained by fraud, also given in Hurlstone on Bonds, 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">The particular facts to beset out in the plea, as the matters by which the fraud was accomplished, must of course vary in each particular case; and in deciding upon the sufficiency of the statement of them, we have to consider, what is the nature of the misrepresentations, which are required to support the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>of fraud. Such misrepresentations are usually, either the <em>allegatio falsi, </em>or the <em>suppressio veri. </em>The first of these, the misstatement of facts, must be a statement of what is false, and known to be such, or not known to be true to the fraudulent party; in a point material to the contract to be made ; in relation to a matter not equally within the knowledge of the party imposed upon; which he did in fact rely upon; and by which he is actually misled and deceived to his injury. The second, the suppression of fact, must be of a matter material to the contract; known to the fraudulent party and not known to the other, nor equally open to be known ; which was either kept out of sight by artifice, or was such as the injured party had a right to expect the other to state; and by the ignorance of which, he was deceived and imposed upon. 1 Story Eq. Jur., \u00a7 200, &amp;c.; 1 Mad. Ch., 262, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Upon comparing the first of these with the allegations of the third and fourth replications, we think these pleadings contain all that is necessary to be alleged. The misstatements are clearly stated, and them materiality is apparent upon the pleadings. The knowledge in regard to these facts cannot be reasonably supposed to have been in possession of the plaintiff, especially when it is stated, that he confided in the statements made to him, and it is sufficiently alleged that the defendant was imposed upon and deceived. The answer given by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to the objection, that it is not alleged that the releasee knew of the falsehood of his statements is entirely satisfactory. It is alleged that those statements were fraudulently made, and that is a sufficient allegation that they were known to be untrue. These replications then being in good form and entirely sufficient, the demurrer must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\"We have examined the decisions in the State of New-York, to which our attention has been called by the counsel for the defendant; and we are aware of like decisions in Yirginia and North Carolina, in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, in Missouri and Arkansas, which are supposed to establish the points, that in an action upon a bond or other specialty, fraud is no defence, if it relate to the consideration of the instrument, and that it must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>be fraud in relation to the execution alone, that constitutes a defence ; and as a cor|llary to this, that a general plea of fraud and covin is bad, because it does not set forth that the fraud was in relation to the delivery or execution of the instrument. We have found no word in any book relating to the common law, which. gives the least countenance to the distinction set up in these cases, until the case of <em>Vrooman </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>2 Johns., 177, decided in 1807. No book, or case of earlier date than this, is cited in support of it, in any case we have seen. The case of <em>Vrooman </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>was decided entirely upon the authority of <em>Dollan </em>v. <em>Sammis, </em>cited and first published in a note appended to the case. The point of the last case was merely whether the failure of consideration was a defence to a bond, and it was decided there that it was not a defence. But the doctrine of the court in that case was the true one. The court say, <em>\u201c </em>There is no allegation that the plaintiff sold the chattel <em>fraudulently, </em>and <em>knowing he had no title. </em>There is no case in which a bond can be set aside, but when the consideration was void in law, <em>or there was fraud.\u201d </em>This implies, as strongly as language can imply anything, that a bond would be set aside for fraud, generally for any fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">In <em>Vrooman </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>the plea was fraudulent representations as to the character of the slaves for the price of which the bond was given, \u2014 and general demurrer. The judge, who delivered the opinion of the court, says, \u201c In <em>Dollan </em>v. <em>Sammis, </em>it was held, that the want or failure of consideration could not be set up at law to impeach a specialty. The principle applies to this case. It has been repeatedly decided, that the breach of a written warranty, as to the quality of goods sold, cannot be pleaded in discharge of a bond given for the consideration; <em>much less </em>ought parol representations, as to the quality of a thing, made antecedent to the contract, though <em>false and fraudulent, </em>and though they may have induced the defendant to make the purchase, be pleaded in avoidance of a specialty. The special plea forms no valid defence to this suit.\u201d The plea of fraud was in good form, setting forth the particulars. The decision was in effect, as it was expressed by the judge in the case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>Dorr v. Munsell, </em>13 Johns., 430, that \u201c a fraudulent representation of the plaintiff\u2019s rights.\u201d (i. e., of material facts,) \u201c is in substance a denial of any consideration for the bond !\u201d It was based upon a confounding of <em>fraud </em>with <em>want of consideration, </em>two things radically and essentially distinct, and standing upon principles entirely unlike. The principle of the common law is well settled, that fraud vitiates everything, contracts, obligations, deeds of conveyance, and even the records and judgments of courts, incontrovertible as they are on every other ground ; while want or failure of consideration alone is no defence to any specialty. This distinction was clearly recognized in <em>Dollan </em>v. <em>Sammis, </em>the case cited by the judge. In the case of <em>Bunn v. Lee, </em>4 Johns., 410, two years after, in 1809, the court held in a like case of debt on bond, and fraud pleaded, that the <em>consideration </em>for the promise was illegal and founded in fraud, being made for the purpose of preventing due scrutiny into the claim of the defendant to a discharge as an insolvent debtor, \u2014 and the court say, <em>\u201c </em>The present action being founded on a specialty does not vary the case ; the seal does not preclude an inquiry <em>into the consideration, </em>if illegal and <em>fraud</em>ulent.\u201d The court thus clearly recognized the common law doctrine, that fraud is a good defence to a bond. Yet upon this basis of <em>Vrooman </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>there was built up in New York a series of decisions, establishing a new and mischievous principle, that a seal was sufficient to preclude, in a court of law, all inquiry relative to fraud in the consideration of a sealed instrument. The innovation was evidently resisted by the bar, since no less than seven decisions upon the point are reported in that State in a little over twenty years. And the common law was restored by act of the legislature in the revised statutes of that State. See <em>Case </em>v. <em>Boughton, </em>11 Wend., <em>106. </em>Similar decisions made in Ohio and Indiana have led to the like restoration of the common law. See <em>Huston </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>3 Blackf., 171; <em>Greathouse </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>3 McLean, 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">These decisions do not appear by the Digests to have been followed in any of the New-England States, nor in Pennsylvania, Maryland, or South Carolina. And we entertain no doubt, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>this heresy will be rejected in every State, in which it has been recognized, whenever the subject shall be thoroughly examined.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
