The plaintiffs claim as coheirs and purchasers from other co-heirs of one Stephen Pendergast, formerly of Durham. After the trial was commenced, upon the general issue, Daniel Me-serve, John P. Meserve, and James D.

Dig. Abat. E., 10 ; Co. Litt., 198, a.; 1 Salk., 4 ; <em>Bradish </em>v. <em>Shenck &amp; </em>note, 8 Johns., 117 ; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Hoskins, </em>11 Mass., 419 ; <em>Cabell </em>v.

Joint-tenants, K.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-5\">If then, in order to maintain the action, we were obliged to join all the tenants in common, we contend that the nonsuit should be stricken off, and the action suffered to proceed, these parties being indemnified against costs ; or that the action should go without them, and a proportionate reduction of damages be made at the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-6\">It would work a great injustice to the twenty-nine other plaintiffs, if, on the one hand, they cannot safely omit to join these three; and on the other, cannot proceed in the suit after joining them. \u201c A permission allowed to one of several co-partners, plaintiffs, to dismiss a suit, so far as he is concerned in interest, amounts to nothing without ascertaining what that interest is and a court may refuse to allow one partner to dismiss a suit, which another insists on prosecuting.\u201d <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Carpen</em>ter, 10 Ala.Rep., 109.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b581-7\">Stiekney, and <em>J. 8. Wells, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-8\">We contend, in the first place, that these plaintiffs had the right to become nonsuit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-9\">By the common law, a plaintiff had the right to become non-suit at any time before verdict. 3 Black. Com., 376. And it is so held now in New-York and some other States. <em>Wooster </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>2 Wend., 285; 1 Wend., 65; 5 U. S. Dig., 454, 455, \u00a7 \u00a7 43, 44, 49, 50.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-10\">In Massachusetts, it is held, that a plaintiff may voluntarily become nonsuit, as a matter of right, at any time before the trial is commenced, but after that it is at the discretion of the court, if the defendant objects. <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>12 Mass., 47 ; <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>16 Mass., 317. The same is held in <em>Judge of Probate </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>13 N. H. Rep., 21.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-11\">It would seem, therefore, that one plaintiff has no right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>object to a nonsuit by Ms co-plaintiff; the defendant only, has that right in certain cases. The case <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Mower, </em>in error, 5 Mass., 407, is very similar to the present case. Wilson, one of the plaintiffs, whose name was used without his knowledge or consent, became nonsuit, and the court held that all the plaintiffs were thereby nonsuited. In this case, the three plaintiffs became nonsuit as soon as they learned that their names were used as plaintiffs in the action. There can be no doubt, therefore, of their right t\u00f3 become nonsuit. The other plaintiffs had no right to use their names as plaintiffs without their consent, nor to retain their names in the action, agamst their will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-4\">We contend, in the second place, that in personal actions, the nonsuit of one is a nonsuit of all the plamtiffs. <em>Kimball </em>&amp; <em>a </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>3 N. H. Rep., 96. The court in that case say, \u201c It is also a rule of law, that in personal actions, the nonsuit of one is the nonsuit of all the plaintiffs, although the rule is different in real and mixed actions. Bacon\u2019s Ab. Nonsuit, E. ; 10 Mass., 79 ; 5 Mass., 411. The same doctrine is laid down in 3 Thomas\u2019 Coke, 502. In personal actions brought by several plaintiffs, the release of the action by one of the plaintiffs is a good bar to the prosecution of the action by the others. <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>before cited. When there is a release of the action by one of the plaintiffs, it will not be contended, we presume, that the court have the right to allow the other plaintiffs to proceed in the action. One plaintiff has the same right to become nonsuit, that he has to release the action; and we contend that when one plaintiff becomes nonsuit, the court has no more right to allow the other plaintiffs to proceed in the action, either in their own names or in the names of all, than they have in the case of a release by one of the plamtiffs. In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Mower, </em>5 Mass., 411, before cited, C. J. <em>Parsons </em>says, \u201c It has been inquired what remedy a man has, who has a good cause, where no severance lies with another, who will not consent to prosecute. It is his folly, saith the law, to be concerned with such a man.\u201d That is a sufficient answer to the suggestion of the plaintiff, that injustice may be done to the twenty-nine other plaintiffs, if a nonsuit of the three be a nonsuit of all the plaintiffs. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>twenty-nine others may have their remedy as suggested by C. J. <em>Parsons </em>in that case, which is, that if any of the parties interested should unreasonably refuse to join in the prosecution of an action, he might be liable to the others in an action on the case for any damage thereby sustained. The case in 10 Ala. Rep., 109, cited by the plaintiffs does not apply to this case. The rights and liabilities of co-partners are different from those of tenants in common of real estate. There might be cases between partners, which would justify and require the court to interfere in that way; as where one co-partner has assigned all his interest to the others, in which case the others, in bringing the suit, must necessarily use the name of the firm; in such case the co-partner, who has no interest in the action, would not be allowed to release the action, or become nonsuit.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b583-5\">Bell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEq\">It is a rule of law, it is said by C. J. Richardson, in <em>Kimball </em>v. Wilson, 3 N. H. Rep., 101, that in personal actions, the nonsuit of one is the nonsuit of all the plaintiffs, although the rule is otherwise in real and mixed actions. We think no doubt can be entertained, that the rule is correctly stated. In this case of trespass, a nonsuit must of course be entered as to all the plaintiffs. <em>Wilson </em>v. Mower, 5 Mass., 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The counsel for both parties agree, that in personal actions tenants in common must <em>join; </em>and it is not questioned, that a release by one of the plaintiffs is a bar to the action; both of which points were directly in question in the case of <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Wilson. </em>The case of the nonsuit stands manifestly on the same ground as a release. An admission by one of the plaintiffs is also evidence against his co-plaintiffs. 1 Ph. Ev., 378 ; 1 Greenl. Ev., 203, \u00a7172. The writing presented to the court in this case, contains admissions which are almost necessai\u2019ily fatal to the case of the parties making them, and consequently to the case of all the plaintiffs. If either of these, the release, the nonsuit, or the admissions, can be excluded, the same principle would require that all of them should be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">In certain cases the courts have recognized an exception to what was once the universal rule of the common law, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>acts and admissions of the plaintiff in every form, were admissible to defeat his action. If the action is brought by an assignee in the name of the assignor, or his representative, or by a person beneficially interested, in the name of one, who may be regarded as his trustee, and application is made to the court at the proper stage of the case, the court will set aside a release executed by the nominal plaintiff, as fraudulent against the party really interested; and will not permit the plaintiff to interfere with the action, to the prejudice of the party really interested. <em>Webb </em>v. Steele, 13 N. H. Rep., 230; <em>Eastman </em>v. Wright, 6 Pick., 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Though the decisions on this point, of most frequent occurrence, relate to cases of assignment of choses in action, yet there seems no objection to the extension of the same principle to all cases, where the release of the action, or interference with it, is in violation of any contract between the parties, and a breach of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">None of the cases we have met with apply, where each of the plaintiffs has an equal interest in the claim in suit, and maintains the action, if at all, in his own right and for his own benefit, and where each has an equal right to control the suit. <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>before cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Tenants in common, in general, are not bound to each other by any contract. Their estates are several, and, in the case of real estates, may be recovered by separate actions. Each has the right to judge for himself, whether his rights have been infringed, and what is a proper indemnity for the injury done to him, and to decide for himself, whether a suit shall be brought for the injury, and how, and to what extent it shall be prosecuted. If he prevents his co-tenants from enforcing their rights by action, by refusing unreasonably and wrongfully to permit an action to be brought in his name, and thus shelters the wrong doer, there seems no reason, why he should not be held responsible for the consequences of the wrong. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Mower, </em>and <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Wright, ante. </em>On the other hand, an obstinate and irresponsible co-tenant should not have, as of course, the right to prosecute, in the name, and at the risk of his res<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>ponsible co-tenants, a claim, which they think unfounded, nor to pursue it in a manner which they think unreasonable. Such use of their names for his own purposes, should clearly not be permitted, except upon the most ample and satisfactory indemnity, which was not here offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">How far the court might have thought proper to interfere, upon a motion to reject the writing offered in this case, or to set aside a- release in a like case, if it had been shown that application had been made to the three plaintiffs, to permit their names to be used in the action for the benefit of the others, and that they had consented, upon being indemnified or otherwise, and notice of these facts given to the defendants before the making of this paper; or if it was shown, that-such application had been made, and such indemnity offered, and refused, and notice given to the defendant of these facts, and that, the action was brought for the exclusive benefit of the other plaintiffs, it is not necessary here to consider. Any fraudulent or covinous contrivance to defeat the action would present a different case from the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Plaintiff8 <em>Nonsuit.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
