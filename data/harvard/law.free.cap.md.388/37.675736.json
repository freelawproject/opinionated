We shall further hold, in light of the admission of the photographs and other evidence, that the closing argument by defendant\u2019s counsel was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">The motor vehicle accident giving rise to this tort suit occurred at the western end of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, in the eastbound lanes, as the parties were traveling from Virginia to Maryland.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The accident involved three motor vehicles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>in a rear-end chain collision. The plaintiff-petitioner, Cathy Mason, was operating the front automobile which was stopped, in the left eastbound lane, because of heavy traffic. Cathy Mason\u2019s brother, Gregory James Mason, was a passenger in her car. Stopped directly behind Cathy Mason\u2019s car was an automobile operated by Warren Goldman. The automobile operated by the defendant-respondent, Chauncey R. Lynch, had been in the adjacent lane of traffic. Lynch decided to change lanes, pulling his vehicle into the left lane behind Goldman\u2019s car. While Lynch was changing lanes and looking backward, his vehicle struck the Goldman vehicle in the rear. Even though Goldman\u2019s foot was on the brake pedal, the impact caused Goldman\u2019s car to strike the rear of Mason\u2019s car, pushing Mason\u2019s car forward. During Goldman\u2019s attempt to control his automobile after the initial impact, Goldman\u2019s car struck Mason\u2019s car in the rear a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Mason filed in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County this tort action against Lynch, alleging that Mason suffered personal injuries as a result of the accident and that these injuries were proximately caused by Lynch\u2019s negligence. Lynch answered by, <em>inter alia, </em>denying that he was negligent or that his actions caused Mason\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Prior to trial, counsel for both parties agreed not to call health care providers as witnesses at the trial and not to conduct discovery or depositions of experts. Instead, they stipulated to the submission of medical records and bills, including bills and reports from each of Cathy Mason\u2019s treating doctors, a report of an independent medical evaluation conducted at the request of defendant\u2019s counsel, and reports by Mason\u2019s doctors rebutting the defense\u2019s independent report. Counsel further agreed to a maximum jury verdict of $60,000. The doctors\u2019 reports submitted by Mason supported her contention that she had been injured as a result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>accident. One of those reports set forth the doctor\u2019s view that \u201cthere is no relationship between [the] degree of vehicle damage and [the] degree of patient injury.\u201d The doctor who had examined Mason at the defendant\u2019s request concluded in his report that most of the treatment received by her was unrelated to the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Also before trial, the plaintiffs attorney had filed a motion in limine, seeking an order precluding the defendant\u2019s attorney from offering in evidence at the trial photographs showing minimal damage to the plaintiffs automobile immediately after the accident. The motion also sought to preclude the defendant\u2019s attorney from arguing \u201cto the jury that the limited property damage shows [that] the force of the impact was insufficient to cause Plaintiffs injuries.\u201d The plaintiffs motion in limine relied upon a recent opinion by the Supreme Court of Delaware, <em>Davis v. Maute, </em>770 A.2d 36 (Del.2001), holding that, in a motor vehicle accident personal injury case, \u201cwhere liability is conceded and the sole issue is the extent of the plaintiffs personal injuries attributable to the accident,\u201d photographs showing minimal damage to the plaintiffs vehicle are not admissible to support an inference that the plaintiffs personal injuries resulting from the accident were also minimal, absent expert testimony warranting such an inference. <em>Davis, </em>770 A.2d at 40-42. The Delaware court also held, with regard to a defense counsel\u2019s argument to the jury, as follows <em>(id. </em>at 40, footnotes omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, a party in a personal injury case may not directly argue that the seriousness of personal injuries from a car accident correlates to the extent of the damage to the cars, unless the party can produce competent expert testimony on the issue. Absent such expert testimony, any inference by the jury that minimal damage to the plaintiffs car translates into minimal personal injuries to the plaintiff would necessarily amount to unguided speculation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Defense counsel opposed the motion in limine, arguing that, in Maryland personal injury actions growing out of motor vehicle accidents, photographs of the vehicles after the accidents have always been deemed admissible as relevant evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>dence. The defendant\u2019s attorney asserted \u201c[t]hat plaintiffs routinely introduce photographs of the vehicles that they were in when it shows substantial property damage specifically for the purpose of showing that the plaintiff could have had the injuries that were sustained.\u201d Defense attorney claimed that it is \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that there is some relationship between \u201cthe particular extent of vehicle damage and the likelihood of a particular injury.\u201d The defense concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnJ\">\u201cThat it\u2019s also interesting to note that the parties in this case have agreed that <em>no </em>experts would be called pursuant to an agreement to allow the medical bills in for a limit on recovery. That it\u2019s interesting to note that once this agreement was put into place that no experts would be called, Plaintiff now files this Motion in Limine in part based upon the fact that no experts would be called. This is unfair and clearly improper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">\u201cFinally, Maryland courts have never precluded the use of photographs of vehicles in auto accident cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The trial judge denied the motion in limine. Later at the trial, during the cross-examination of Cathy Mason, the witness testified to the accuracy of two photographs showing \u201cthe damage done to your [Mason\u2019s] car as a result of the accident.\u201d The photographs were admitted into evidence over the objection of plaintiffs counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Cathy Mason testified at trial that, although she was wearing a seat belt, she moved forward each of the two times that her automobile was struck, although she did not \u201chit anything in the car.\u201d Mason\u2019s attorney asked her whether she felt \u201churt at the scene of the accident,\u201d and Mason replied: \u201cNo. I was not hurt at the scene of the accident.\u201d Mason testified that, after the exchange of information among herself, Goldman, and Lynch, she \u201cwent home to watch TV,\u201d and that she had no \u201cexpectation\u201d that she was \u201cgoing to need any medical attention.\u201d She testified that when she woke up the next day, she had a headache, and that, later that day, she was having neck pain. She left work early the day after the accident, went to an emergency room of a local hospital, and received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>medication. Later she visited her primary physician about \u201chead pain, the neck pain, [and] upper shoulder pain,\u201d and her physician referred her to a physical therapy center where she received treatments, although she stated that the treatments did not alleviate the pain. Several months later, her lawyer referred her to a neurologist and an \u201corthopedic doctor\u201d who treated her. She was also treated by a dentist at the time. At the conclusion of Mason\u2019s direct testimony, her medical bills totaling $13,846.60 were introduced into evidence. Mason also claimed lost wages amounting to $373.97.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Cathy Mason\u2019s brother, Gregory Mason, testified that it had been \u201cstop-and-go traffic\u201d when the accident occurred, and that the Mason vehicle had been stopped for \u201ca few seconds\u201d when it was twice struck in the rear. Gregory Mason stated that both he and his sister moved forward when the car was hit. Gregory also stated that the vehicles were driveable after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Warren Goldman testified at the trial with regard to being struck by Lynch\u2019s car and, despite his foot being on the brake, striking Mason\u2019s car in front of him. Goldman testified that he saw no injuries on Mason such as a \u201ccut or bleeding\u201d but that she \u201cwas unhappy.\u201d He further testified that the property damage to his car, both in the rear and the front, was repaired at a cost between $500 and $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Chauncey Lynch testified as to how the accident occurred. He further testified, without objection, that the only damage to his vehicle consisted of \u201cpaint scratches\u201d and that his air bag did not \u201cdeploy.\u201d Lynch stated that no one at the accident scene \u201ccomplained of any injury, or any pain, or discomfort.\u201d He testified that all of the vehicles were driveable and that everyone drove away from the accident scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Following the above summarized testimony, the plaintiff moved for a directed verdict in her favor as to liability. The trial judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">During closing argument to the jury, defense counsel argued, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows (italics represent the portion which plaintiff challenges in this Court):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>\u201c[A]s far as putting a value on the case, I want you to start at the accident scene. Use your common sense, draw on your every day experiences, because one thing everybody agrees on, rush hour traffic. And everybody knows what rush hour traffic is like, stop and go, stop and go, stop and go, stop and go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\">\n<em>\u201cMy client hits Mr. Goldman\u2019s vehicle. Apparently, Mr. Goldman\u2019s vehicle then hits Miss Mason\u2019s vehicle. There is very little damage. You will have the photographs of Miss Mason\u2019s vehicle back there. And I am going to ask that you look at that vehicle and ask you if that\u2019s consistent with $13,000 in medical expenses. Again, use your common sense, draw on your every day experiences.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">\u201cKeep in mind she is seat belted. Keep in mind she does not hit her head, she does not hit her jaw, she does not hit any part of her body as a result of this accident. Keep in mind that she\u2019s not claiming \u2014 wasn\u2019t claiming any injury at the scene, was not cut or bleeding, was not complaining of any problems, any discomfort at the accident scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">\u201cAnd if you decide to put a value on this case \u2014 now, she does have medical treatment the day after, June 24. Then [she] sees Doctor Choi, her family doctor two times in July. Only two appointments in July. Then in August [she] has the physical therapy. Ask yourself what happens then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">\u201cThen we have the entire month of September, the entire month of October. There is no medical treatment whatsoever. What does she do? She goes to see a lawyer, and she goes to a lawyer to get a referral to a doctor. Now, again, I am not a doctor. [I] ask you to use your common sense, draw on your every day experiences. If you have a medical problem, do you go to a doctor or a lawyer? I submit if you have a medical problem, you go to a doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">\u201cYou say, hey, Doctor Choi, look. I have been through the physical therapy. Physical therapy, it is not working. It is not working. Refer me to a doctor. If you can\u2019t refer me to a doctor, I\u2019ll go to a medical referral service, something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201cWhat happens when she does go to the lawyer? A lawyer refers her to a Doctor Macedo, and suddenly what was [a] $2,000 in medical case jumps to a $13,000 medical case. What you have to ask yourself is any of medical treatment by these doctors causally related to the accident?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">The case was given to the jury with a verdict sheet prepared and submitted by the plaintiffs counsel, and not objected to by the defendant\u2019s counsel. After deliberations, the jury returned its verdict, in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">\u201c1. Was Defendant Chauncey Lynch negligent in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">/ Yes No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">If you find \u2018yes\u2019 to Question No. 1 go to Question No. 2. If you find \u2018no\u2019 in Question No. 1, go no further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">\u201c2. What amount do you award Plaintiff Cathy Mason:\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">For past medical bills $ 0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">For past lost wages $ 0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">For non-economic damages $ 0 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">Thereafter, judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff only for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">The plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial on two grounds. First, the plaintiff argued that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">\u201cit was undisputed by the defense\u2019s own expert that Plaintiff had sustained at least $1,983.60 in medical treatment cost damages as a result of this accident and, therefore, Plaintiff was entitled to a verdict in at least that amount as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">Second, the plaintiff repeated her earlier argument that \u201cthe photographs showing minimal damage to Plaintiffs vehicle\u201d should not have been admitted into evidence and that, \u201c[gjiven the absence of any expert testimony in this case establishing a correlation between vehicle damage and personal injury,\u201d defense counsel \u201cshould have been prohibited from inviting the jury to speculate about the existence of such a correlation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>In opposing the motion for a new trial, the defendant initially stated that he had consistently taken the position that he was not negligent and that his actions did not injure the plaintiff. The defendant pointed out that the jury had been instructed that \u201c \u2018it will be your duty to determine what, <em>if any, </em>award will fairly compensate the Plaintiff for the losses,\u2019 \u201d and that plaintiffs counsel had no objection to this instruction. (Emphasis in defendant\u2019s opposition). The defendant further asserted that the jury was instructed, without objection, that it was \u201c \u2018not required to accept <em>any </em>expert\u2019s opinion.\u2019 \u201d (Same). With regard to the second ground for the plaintiffs motion, the defendant reiterated the reasons previously set forth in his opposition to the plaintiffs motion in limine. The trial court, denied the motion for a new trial without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. <em>Mason v. Lynch, </em>151 Md.App. 17, 822 A.2d 1281 (2003). With respect to the admission of the photographs showing minimal damage to the plaintiffs automobile, the Court of Special Appeals distinguished the Delaware case of <em>Davis v. Maute, supra, </em>770 A.2d 36, on the ground that the defendant in <em>Davis </em>admitted liability, whereas the defendant in the present case contested liability. <em>Mason v. Lynch, supra, </em>151 Md.App. at 22-23, 822 A.2d at 1284. The Court of Special Appeals further pointed out that other courts considering the issue have not taken the same position as the Supreme Court of Delaware; those other courts have treated the admission of such photographs as a matter within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and \u201chave been more willing to accept the trial court\u2019s discretionary determination that the photographs were relevant to the question of damages.\u201d <em>Mason, </em>151 Md.App. at 23, 822 A.2d at 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The Court of Special Appeals also held that defense counsel\u2019s closing argument concerning damages was not improper, <em>Mason, </em>151 Md.App. at 24-27, 822 A.2d at 1285-1287. The intermediate appellate court relied upon this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Farley v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>355 Md. 34, 733 A.2d 1014 (1999), and pointed out that in the case at bar, as in the <em>Farley </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>case, the trial court had instructed the jury that the attorneys\u2019 closing arguments were not evidence in the case. In addition, the Court of Special Appeals explained (151 Md.App. at 27, 822 A.2d at 1287):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\">\u201cLike the defense counsel in <em>Farley, </em>appellee\u2019s counsel attempted to cast doubt on the reasonableness and necessity of appellant\u2019s medical costs by persuading the jury to disbelieve appellant and appellant\u2019s lay and expert witnesses regarding the seriousness of her injuries. Also like the defense counsel in <em>Farley, </em>appellee\u2019s counsel attempted to cast doubt in many ways, including commenting on the photographs showing minimal damage to the vehicle, appellant\u2019s testimony that she did not hit her body on the vehicle at impact or claim any injury at the scene, and the timing of medical treatment and lawyer referral to health care providers. Appellee\u2019s counsel\u2019s comments regarding the photographs, which were admitted into evidence while appellant was on the stand, were general in nature, and counsel did not attempt to make specific arguments that would call into play scientific principles that might require expert testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The plaintiff filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, posing the single question which we have set forth at the beginning of this opinion. The defendant did not file a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari. We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition, <em>Mason v. Lynch, </em>374 Md. 582, 824 A.2d 58 (2003), and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">As pointed out above, the Court of Special Appeals seemed to uphold the admission of the photographs on two grounds. First, the appellate court distinguished the Delaware case of <em>Davis v. Maute, mpra, </em>on the ground that liability had been conceded by the defendant in that case, whereas the defendant Lynch in the case at bar contested liability. Second, the Court of Special Appeals alternately appeared to agree with the majority of courts which have held that the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>such photographs is within the trial judge\u2019s discretion. We agree with the second ground. Regardless of whether liability had been conceded, the admission of the property damage photographs was within the trial judge\u2019s discretion, and there was no abuse of discretion in this case. The holding of the Delaware court in <em>Davis </em>is not consistent with traditional Maryland law concerning the admission of photographic evidence, and we decline to follow the <em>Davis </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Generally under Maryland law, in both civil and criminal cases growing out of occurrences at particular places, photographs of these places, such as accident or crime scenes, including photographs of things involved, injured persons, or victims, are normally considered to have some relevance. Along with other reasons for relevancy in particular cases, such \u201cphotographs have also been admitted to allow the jury to visualize the\u201d nature of the occurrence, <em>ie., </em>the \u201catrociousness of the crime\u201d or the extent of the accident. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 502, 495 A.2d 1, 8 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1093, 106 S.Ct. 868, 88 L.Ed.2d 907 (1986). Moreover, \u201c[i]t is an unquestioned rule that photographs may be introduced in evidence, either in a civil or criminal proceeding, to illustrate the description of a person, place, or object so as to explain or apply the evidence.\u201d <em>Corens v. State, </em>185 Md. 561, 570, 45 A.2d 340, 346 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">It is ordinarily within the discretion of the trial court to weigh the degree of relevance against any unfair prejudice which might arise from the admission of the photographs. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 5-403. The trial court\u2019s ruling on admissibility will not be overturned on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">These basic principles concerning the admissibility of photographs have been reiterated by this Court on numerous occasions. Thus in <em>Johnson v. State, supra, </em>303 Md. at 502, 495 A.2d at 8, the Court summarized the controlling law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">\u201cWe have consistently held that whether or not a photograph is of practical value in a case and admissible at trial is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>a matter best left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.... A court\u2019s determination in this area will not be disturbed unless plainly arbitrary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In <em>Hance v. State Roads Comm., </em>221 Md. 164, 172, 156 A.2d 644, 648 (1959), Judge Prescott for the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq\">\u201cLPjhotographs, if properly verified [no question of verification is here involved] and relevant to the issues in a case, may be admitted in evidence if they assist the jury in understanding the case or aid a witness in explaining his testimony; and the question of whether they are practically helpful or instructive to the jury is left to the discretion of the trial judge and his rulings thereon will not be disturbed in the absence of a showing of an abuse of the discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In a motor vehicle accident case, with regard to various challenges relating to the admission of photographs of the accident scene, this Court\u2019s reasoning underscored the admissibility of such photographs if properly verified <em>(Consolidated Gas Co. v. Smith, </em>109 Md. 186, 199, 72 A. 651, 656 (1909)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMM\">\u201cIt does not distinctly appear from the appellant\u2019s brief upon what ground these exceptions were taken, but the use of photographs \u2018wherever it is important to describe a person, place, or thing, in a civil or criminal proceeding, for the purpose of explaining and applying the evidence\u2019 ... is so well established and so fully recognized in our own decisions, that we assume the objection must have been not generally to their use in the case, but rather to their method of introduction. It is a matter of course that \u2018photographs must be shown by some extrinsic evidence to be correct representations of the place or subject as it existed at the time involved in the controversy.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-7\"><em>Sun Cab Co. v. Walston, </em>15 Md.App. 113, 136-137, 289 A.2d 804, 817 (1972), <em>aff'd, </em>267 Md. 559, 298 A.2d 391 (1973), was an action for the wrongful death of one person and for personal injuries suffered by several other persons, arising out of a collision between a taxicab and a truck. After a police officer testified that several photographs of the taxicab \u201caccurately represented the condition of the taxicab when he [the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>.officer] arrived at the scene,\u201d the trial judge admitted into evidence, over objections, the photographs. 15 Md.App. at 186, 289 A.2d at 817. The trial judge also admitted into evidence some photographs of the accident scene but excluded other photographs of the accident scene. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals rejected challenges to these rulings concerning the photographs on the ground that \u201cthe admissibility of photographs is largely within the discretion of the [trial] court.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Numerous other Maryland appellate cases have upheld trial court rulings concerning the admission of photographs, relying upon the principle that the admission or exclusion of the photographic evidence is essentially a matter of the trial court\u2019s discretion.

Thus, in several cases where trial judges have excluded photographs, their exercise of discretion has also been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>upheld on appeal. <em>See </em>cases collected in McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence, supra, </em>at 582-591. Among the scores of this Court\u2019s opinions involving the admission or exclusion of photographic evidence, it is extremely difficult to find cases in which this Court has held that the trial court\u2019s ruling, as to the admission or exclusion of photographs, constituted reversible error. The very few cases finding reversible error are ones where the trial courts admitted photographs which this Court held did not accurately represent the person or scene or were otherwise not properly verified. <em>See Pearson v. State, </em>182 Md. 1, 9-12, 31 A.2d 624, 627-629 (1943) (A capital rape case in which the trial court admitted a photograph of the victim which was not an accurate representation of the victim at the time of the crime and was not properly verified, and this Court held that the admission was reversible error); <em>Wimpling v.

The judgment appealed from will therefore be affirmed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">As earlier mentioned, the plaintiff herself testified that the photographs at issue accurately represented the damage done to her automobile as a result of the accident. None of the reasons for excluding the photographs recognized by Maryland law is applicable in this case. The photographs \u201callow[ed] the jury to visualize\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the nature of the accident. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The testimony, which was not objected to, described the apparent lack of personal injuries at the scene of the accident, the driveability of the three vehicles immediately after the accident, the minimal damage to Warren Goldman\u2019s automobile, the fact that airbags did not deploy, and the damage to Chauncey Lynch\u2019s vehicle consisting only of \u201cpaint scratches.\u201d The photographs \u201cillustrat[edj\u201d these \u201cdescriptionfsj\u201d and this testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A holding that the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting such photographs would represent an abrupt departure from prior Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Although this Court has not previously addressed the specific argument made by the plaintiff and upheld by the Supreme Court of Delaware in <em>Davis v. Maute, supra, </em>770 A.2d 36, namely that, absent expert testimony, there is no relationship between the personal injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident and the extent of the property damage, other courts have addressed the argument and rejected it. Courts have generally held that photographs and testimony, showing or describing vehicular damage or the nature of the impact, are relevant with respect to the personal injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident and, in the trial judge\u2019s discretion, are admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">For example, in <em>Gambrell v. Zengel, </em>110 N.J.Super. 377, 265 A.2d 823 (1970), the New Jersey appellate court held that photographs and testimony showing the damage to the motor vehicle involved and the distance traveled were admissible and relevant to the severity of the plaintiffs claimed injuries. The court explained (110 N.J.Super. at 379-381, 265 A.2d at 824-825):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">\u201cThe only purpose in admitting the photographs and police officer\u2019s testimony was to show the force of the impact through the damages to the vehicle and the distance traveled, which allegedly caused plaintiffs injuries. Defendants claim that it was unfair thus to permit the jury to infer that plaintiff sustained serious personal injury, since a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>heavy impact between two vehicles is an unreliable barometer of the severity of physical injury sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">\u201cIt must be conceded that the force of the impact, when two automobiles collide, does not necessarily justify an inference that the occupants of the vehicles sustained serious physical injuries.\u201d As defendants\u2019 medical expert expressed it:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">\u201cI have known people who step off a curb and break a leg and a car can turn upside down and you can be lucky and walk away from it without a scratch; * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u201cAt the same time it is a generally accepted rule that evidence of the speed at which the colliding cars were traveling, the severity of the physical impact and the manner of the happening of the accident is admissible where there is an issue as to the seriousness of plaintiffs injuries. And this, too, despite admitted liability.\u201d See <em>Martin v. Miqueu, </em>37 Cal.App.2d 133, 98 P.2d 816 (1940); <em>Johnson v. McRee, </em>66 Cal.App.2d 524, 152 P.2d 526 (1944); <em>Phillips v. Lawrence, </em>87 Ill.App.2d 60, 230 N.E.2d 505 (1967); <em>Hall v.

Mossman, </em>52 Wash.2d 885, 329 P.2d 1089 (1958), which was an action for damages arising from an automobile collision, in which the defendant admitted liability but contested the amount of damages. In upholding the admission of photographs and testimony showing the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>of vehicular damage, the Supreme Court of Washington stated (52 Wash.2d at 887-888, 329 P.2d at 1091):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\">\u201cFive photographs of the scene of the accident were admitted in evidence for the limited purpose of showing the force of the impact that resulted in damage to respondent\u2014 a whiplash injury.

The appellate court, however, emphasized that \u201c[w]e do not hold that expert testimony must always be required for such photographic evidence to be admissible\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s position in the case at bar, <em>ie., </em>that the photographs should not have been admitted and that defense counsel\u2019s closing argument based on the photographs was improper, is based on the plaintiffs contention that, absent expert testimony to the contrary, there is no \u201ccorrelation between vehicle damage and the likelihood of occupant injury.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s brief at 18). The contention that no correlation exists between vehicle damage and occupant injury, in turn, seems to be partly based on the notion that sometimes accidents with little property damage result in severe personal injuries, and sometimes accidents with great property damage result in minor personal injuries. The plaintiff heavily relies upon the report of one of her doctors who wrote as follows <em>(id. </em>at 4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">\u201cA further important point \u2014 studies have shown that there is <em>no </em>relationship between the amount of dollar damage, physical auto damage, or speed of impact to the amount of injury sustained by the patient. Metal is metal and soft tissue is soft tissue \u2014 there is no relationship to mutual damage. If there were, we would expect that <em>in every accident </em>in which one or both vehicles were totaled, the passengers would be either killed or severely damages\u2014 <em>and we know that is not the case.\u201d </em>(First emphasized phrase added; second emphasized phrase in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In other words, the plaintiff\u2019s theory seems to be that, because greater vehicular damage does not result in greater personal injuries, and lesser vehicular damage does not result in lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>personal injuries, <em>in every accident, </em>there can be no correlation between vehicular damage and personal injuries; therefore, vehicular damage evidence is not relevant. This, however, is not the test for relevancy. Maryland Rule 5-401 defines \u201crelevant evidence\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">\u201c \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">That there may be some automobile accidents, in which very minor impacts lead to serious personal injuries, and vice versa, does not mean that evidence concerning the impact is irrelevant to the extent of the injuries. Relevancy under the rule involves probabilities; complete certainty is not ordinarily required. As the Illinois appellate court explained in <em>Phillips v. Lawrence, supra, </em>87 Ill.App.2d at 63, 230 N.E.2d at 506-507, \u201c[rjelevancy is established where a fact offered ... renders a matter in issue more or less <em>probable,\u201d </em>and that \u201cevidence of the circumstances surrounding an accident is admissible,\u201d because it relates \u201cto the <em>probable </em>extent of personal injuries.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Courts, almost uniformly, have taken the position that there is in motor vehicle accident cases, as a matter of probability, a correlation between the nature of the vehicular impact and the severity of the personal injuries. As the plaintiff herself acknowledges, \u201c[tjhere apparently exists among laypersons a belief ... that significant injuries are unlikely in the absence of substantial property damage.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s brief at 10). Courts have generally taken the position that this belief is rooted in common sense \u2014 a position with which we agree. Moreover, in personal injury actions based on motor vehicle accidents, evidence, including photographs, of the accident scene and of the damage to the vehicles, is, within the trial court\u2019s discretion, admissible under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">In sum, the trial court in the instant case did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photographs showing the damage to the plaintiffs automobile. Consequently, defense counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>closing argument based upon the photographs and other evidence concerning the collision was not improper. <em>See, e.g., Farley v. Allstate, supra, </em>355 Md. at 56, 733 A.2d at 1025 (Closing argument by defense counsel was not improper, as, \u201c[cjontrary to the [plaintiff\u2019s] assertions, the record indicates that [defense counsel\u2019s] arguments as to the reasonableness and necessity of Mr. Farley\u2019s medical bills, treatment, and lost wages were based on facts in evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court of Delaware has recently appeared to narrow considerably its earlier holding in <em>Davis v. Maute, supra, </em>770 A.2d 36. In <em>Eskin v.

It was only the disingenuous reference to a \u2018fender bender\u2019 \u2014 after a trial judges express ruling forbidding what that phrase implied \u2014 that prompted our holding. <em>Davis </em>should not be construed broadly to require expert testimony in every case in order for jurors to be permitted to view photographs of vehicles involved in an accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">\"In short, <em>Davis </em>should be limited to its facts, recognizing that there may be many helpful purposes for admitting photographs of the vehicles involved in an accident where the case does not require supporting expert opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b99-7\">RAKER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6\">dissenting, in which BELL, C.J., joins:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court. I would hold that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting Lynch, respondent, to argue in closing argument that the photographs, depicting minimal property damage, were evidence that Mason, petitioner, was not injured. The photographs were not admitted improperly because the question of liability was at issue in the case; they were not admissible, however, to support any inference that because the property damage was minimal, the personal injury was minimal. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Defense counsel argued that, based on everyday experiences and common sense, the damage on the vehicle was not consistent with $13,008 in medical expenses, although perhaps consistent with \u201ca couple of thousand dollars.\u201d In my view, the argument is improper for several reasons. First, the weight of scientific literature is to the contrary. Second, there is no way that, based merely on the extent of property damage, a fact finder could assess the injury of a party and particularly, whether a party had a pre-existing injury that was exacerbated by the impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">This issue was addressed by the Supreme Court of Delaware in <em>Davis v. Maute, </em>770 A.2d 36 (Del.2001). The court held that absent expert testimony, a party may not argue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the seriousness of personal injuries from a car accident correlates to the extent of the damage to the cars. <em>Id. </em>at 40. The rule announced by the Delaware court is sound and is supported by the current scientific literature. I would apply a similar rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The majority characterizes a subsequent Delaware case, <em>Eskin v. Carden, </em>842 A.2d 1222 (Del.2004), as narrowing considerably the <em>Davis </em>holding. In my view, <em>Eskin </em>clarified <em>Davis </em>and did not narrow it. The <em>Eskin </em>court did not retreat from <em>Davis, </em>but rather stated as follows, \u201cfor guidance in future cases\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">\u201cIn <em>Davis, </em>defense counsel sought to argue that properly admitted photographs of slightly damaged cars supported a contention that the accident was a \u2018fender bender,\u2019 in order to persuade the jury that the forces causing damage to the vehicles in the accident could not have impacted the plaintiff sufficiently to have caused the injuries about which she complained. Before the \u2018fender bender\u2019 comment was made, the trial judge had specifically ruled that counsel could not present that very contention, based upon the photographs alone. The inference suggested by the too-clever-by-half phrase, \u2018fender bender,\u2019 inartfully attempted to circumvent the trial judge\u2019s ruling. <em>That was impermissible, because unsupported by expert testimony, that phrase left the Davis jury in a position to make \u2018unguided empirical assumptions on issues that are outside the common knowledge of laymen. \u2019 Although the common knowledge of \u2018laymen\u2019 may well include the common sense notion that the lesser the force in an accident, the less likely the average human body will suffer serious injury, that speculation does not account for other circumstances, such as preexiting injuries or the particularly susceptible individual.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1S\"><em>Id. </em>at 1233 (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Dr. Binderman, the only expert to testify to this issue at trial, testified that there is no correlation between the extent of injury a person suffers and the magnitude of physical damage to an automobile. He testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>\u201cA further important point \u2014 studies have shown that there is <em>no </em>relationship between the amount of dollar damage, physical auto damage, or speed of impact to the amount of injury sustained by the patient. Metal is metal and soft tissue is soft tissue \u2014 there is no relationship to mutual damage. If there were, we would expect that in every accident in which one or both vehicles were totaled, the passengers would be either killed or severely damaged\u2014 and we know that is not the case. But Dr. Moses\u2019 studies out of UCLA Facial Pain Center clearly show there is no relationship between degree of vehicle damage and degree of patient injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Respondent presented no evidence to contradict Dr. Binder-man\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Moreover, a review of some of the extant research studies support Dr. Binderman\u2019s opinion. <em>See, e.g., </em>R. Evans, <em>Some Observations on Whiplash Injuries, </em>10 Neurologic Clinics 975-77 (1992); J. MacNab, <em>Acceleration Extension Injuries of the Cervical Spine, in The Spine </em>647-60 (R. Rothman &amp; F. Simeone eds., 2d. ed.1982); H. Parmar &amp; R. Raymakers, <em>Neck Injuries From Rear Impact Road Traffic Accidents: Prognosis in Persons Seeking Compensation, </em>24 Inj. 75-78 (1993); D. Severy et al., <em>Controlled Automobile Rear-end Collisions, An Investigation of Related Engineering and Medical Phenomena, </em>11 Can. Servs Med. J. 727-59 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">For example, in <em>Low Velocity Impact, Vehicular Damage and Passenger Injury, </em>16 Cranio: The Journal of Craniomandibular Practice 226, 229 (1998), David B. Miller, D.D.S., concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">\u201cThere is no direct relationship between vehicular damage and injury to and prognosis for the occupant(s) of the damaged vehicle. Light vehicles at low speeds can generate considerable forces. These forces are sufficient to cause significant bodily injuries. Impact resistant bumpers and body frames are currently absorbing less force than in previous automotive designs. More kinetic energy is available for occupant injury. The occurrence of injury relates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>primarily to the amount of kinetic energy developed in the collision, the ability to dissipate that energy, victim awareness, body posture at impact and a myriad of other factors. Each accident and each victim is unique, and each must be evaluated objectively and individually based on the unique biomechanics and physics of the collision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In L. Nordhoff, Jr., <em>Motor Vehicle Collision Injuries, Mechanisms, Diagnosis and Management </em>288 (1996), the author concludes that \u201c[t]he assumption that injuries relate to the amount of external vehicle damage in all types of crashes has no scientific basis.\u201d In addition, the author concludes that \u201c[tjhere is little correlation between neck injury and vehicle damage in the low-speed rear-end collision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">A review of the scientific literature expresses the view that there can be a strong <em>inverse </em>correlation between injury levels and measurable vehicle crush, especially in low speed, rear-impact collisions. <em>See, e.g., </em>S. Foreman <em>&amp; </em>A. Croft, <em>Whiplash Injuries: The Cervical Acceleration/Deceleration Syndrome </em>(3d ed.2002); Nordhoff, <em>supra; </em>M. Robbins, <em>Lack of Relationship Betioeen Vehicle Damage and Occupant Injury, </em>Society of Automotive Engineers paper 970494 (1997). Principles of physics, engineering and medicine reveal that many factors influence the type and severity of personal injury, including the speed of collision, vector of crash (front, side, rear, etc.), mass ratios, vehicle \u201ccrashworthiness,\u201d and human factors such as size, age, gender, physical condition, and seating position of the occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In sum, there is no correlation, as the majority suggests, between vehicular damage and personal injuries such that jurors can rely on a description of the damage to establish the extent of any injury. Accordingly, in the absence of expert testimony, I would hold that it is an abuse of discretion to permit counsel to suggest a correlation between vehicle damage and the extent of personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Chief Judge BELL has authorized me to state that he joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
