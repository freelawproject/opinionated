As a result of that shooting, on April 17, 1991, Julian Gray, petitioner in this case, was convicted by a jury of second-degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a violent crime. The court sentenced Gray to thirty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>years\u2019 imprisonment for the murder and five-years\u2019 imprisonment for the handgun conviction. Gray appealed and on April 20, 1992, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed his convictions in an unreported opinion. Gray petitioned this Court for <em>certiorari, </em>and we denied the petition. <em>Gray v. State, </em>327 Md. 626, 612 A.2d 256 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">On July 28, 1999, Gray petitioned for postconviction relief. On December 22, 1999, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Judge Clifton J. Gordy, Jr., presiding, held a hearing on the petition, at which both the State and Gray presented witnesses. On January 10, 2000, Judge Gordy denied the post-conviction petition and issued a \u201cStatement of Reasons and Order of Court.\u201d On March 13, 2000, Gray filed an Application for Leave to Appeal, which was denied by the Court of Special Appeals on April 2, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">On August 20, 2003, Gray filed a \u201cPetition to Reopen Post Conviction Proceedings\u201d in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, pursuant to Md.Code (2001), \u00a7 7-104 of the Criminal Procedure Article. The State opposed the petition and on October 10, 2003, Judge Gordy denied Gray\u2019s petition, concluding that reopening would not be in the interest of justice. Gray filed an Application for Leave to Appeal, which was granted by the Court of Special Appeals on February 24, 2004. On September 13, 2004, in a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court. <em>Gray v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 635, 857 A.2d 1176 (2004). Gray petitioned this Court and on December 17, 2004, we granted <em>ceviiorati. Gray v. State, </em>384 Md. 448, 863 A.2d 997 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">We are asked to determine whether a circuit court is required under the Maryland Rules to render a supporting statement or memorandum explicating a decision to deny a request to reopen a postconviction proceeding. We hold that the court is not required to provide a detailed supporting statement or memorandum when ruling upon a petition to reopen a postconviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">During Gray\u2019s trial, fifteen-year-old Erika McCray<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> testified that on the night of the shooting, she went to her friend Peggy Riddic\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> house, located across the alley from a laundromat at North and Ruxton Avenues. McCray testified that she, Shauna Hantz, and two other friends named Tina and Neda, started to leave Riddic\u2019s house, and when she was at the doorway, McCray said she saw a \u201cbunch of guys,\u201d whom she did not know, \u201crunning through the alley so we ran back in.\u201d She testified that they ran back in the house for a few minutes because they thought the people they saw were \u201cstickup boys,\u201d meaning \u201cpeople who stick people up and take what they have like money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">McCray also testified that after a minute or two, she and the other girls came out of the house and while on the porch, they saw a \u201ccouple other guys\u201d walking from Moreland to Ruxton Avenue. McCray then testified that she saw two guys, one of whom was Gray, walk down Ruxton Road toward the laundromat and that \u201cthey was passing a few words.\u201d After that, McCray heard five or more gunshots. When asked what she did next, she testified that, \u201c[w]e just stood there and then we was stunned and then we walked around the corner.\u201d Then McCray testified that when she looked over towards the laundromat, she saw the victim falling down and she saw Gray \u201cgoing another direction.\u201d Gray was convicted of second-degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a violent crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Gray appealed, claiming that the trial court erred by admitting hearsay evidence and by precluding discussion of the lack of fingerprint evidence on the murder weapon. On April 20, 1992, Gray\u2019s convictions were upheld by the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Appeals. On September 15, 1992, we denied Gray\u2019s petition for <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">On July 28, 1999, Gray petitioned for postconviction relief, alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Gray argued that his attorney failed to (1) investigate affirmative defenses, (2) cross-examine Erika McCray effectively, (3) object to inadmissible evidence, and (4) present mitigating evidence at sentencing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court held a hearing on the petition and heard testimony from Gray, Gray\u2019s sister (Frankie Gray), Peggy Riddic, and John Denholm, Gray\u2019s trial counsel. Gray, Frankie Gray, and Riddic testified that McCray could not have seen the murder from the doorway of the house. Denholm testified that he was not aware of additional available witnesses and that he could not recall if he had visited the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">On January 10, 2000, Judge Gordy denied Gray\u2019s petition. Judge Gordy summarized Gray\u2019s argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">At the Post Conviction hearing, Petitioner and Frankie Gray testified that they informed trial counsel, Mr. Denholm that the State\u2019s only witness (Erica McCray) could not possibly have seen the murder from the porch of a nearby house (1823 Ruxton Avenue) where she testified she was located. Ms. Peggy Riddick, who lived in the house in question, also testified that she was ready and available to testify at Mr. Gray\u2019s trial that you cannot see the murder site if you are located at the front door on her porch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">Petitioner asserts that counsel should have visited the murder site and followed up on the information provided by the Petitioner and Frankie Gray that it was impossible for the State\u2019s witness to see the murder from the porch of the house in question. In failing to do so, Petitioner argues that trial counsel was unreasonably deficient in his duties and his non-action prejudiced the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Judge Gordy found that the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, requiring deficient performance of counsel, was \u201carguably satisfied.\u201d He noted that \u201cit would have been prudent to visit or at least obtain pictures of the homicide scene to better assess the testimony of the State\u2019s witness. In addition, the record supports Petitioner\u2019s view that the State\u2019s eyewitness could not have actually seen who shot the victim.\u201d Judge Gordy concluded, however, that Gray was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s performance. The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">Even if counsel had visited the crime scene, it would not have changed the testimony offered by the State\u2019s witness, which completely contradicted Petitioner\u2019s alibi defense. The State\u2019s witness testified that she saw Mr. Gray walking with the victim in the direction of where the murder took place; that the victim and Mr. Gray were \u201chaving words\u201d; that she saw the boy (victim) falling down; and that she saw the Defendant-Petitioner, Mr. Gray, leaving the murder scene going in the opposite direction down an alley. The State\u2019s eyewitness was no longer on the porch of the house in question when she witnessed these events. She had moved down the steps and off to the side enabling her to have a better view of the aforementioned events.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">Therefore, although she could not testify to who actually shot the victim, she did provide strong circumstantial evidence that Mr. Gray committed the murder. She also completely destroyed his alibi defense that he was at a hospital during his child\u2019s birth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">On April 2, 2001, the Court of Special Appeals denied Gray\u2019s March 18, 2000, Application for Leave to Appeal Judge Gordy\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">On August 20, 2003, Gray filed a petition to reopen the postconviction proceeding, pursuant to \u00a7 7-104 of the Criminal Procedure Article. Gray argued that his postconviction counsel was ineffective and that his case must be reopened to prevent the \u201cinjustice of the conviction of an innocent person.\u201d In support of his claims, Gray provided a written statement by McCray, dated May 9, 2003, indicating that portions of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>trial testimony were false. Gray had already questioned McCray\u2019s trial testimony in his postconviction hearing. With the petition to reopen, however, he provided for the first time, a statement from McCray that her trial testimony was partially false.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">In her May 9 statement, McCray claimed that at the time of the shooting she was inside Peggy Riddic\u2019s house and not on the porch as she had claimed at the trial. She further stated that the only actual knowledge she had of the shooting was provided to her by her friend Shauna, who is now deceased. McCray alleged that, after the shooting, Shauna told her that she had seen Gray with a gun earlier. McCray also claimed that she lied at Gray\u2019s trial because she was \u201cbitter\u201d about being detained at the Waxter Center, a juvenile facility, to ensure that she would testify. McCray stated that she gave a friend of Gray\u2019s her number because she felt guilty for lying. According to McCray, when Gray called, McCray informed him of her actions and asked for forgiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Gray also attached a written statement from Peggy Riddic, the person who lived in the home McCray was visiting during the shooting. Riddic\u2019s statement is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">I lived at 1823 Ruxton Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland at the time of this incident. Erika McCray, Shauna Hantz and Tina were inside my house at the time when we heard gunshots going off outside. There is no way that Erika McCray could have seen who did the shooting as she was inside my house at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">As previously noted, during Gray\u2019s postconviction hearing, Riddic testified that it would have been impossible to see the location of the shooting from her doorway. In support of his petition to reopen, however, Gray complained that at the postconviction hearing, counsel did not ask Riddic, as a preliminary matter, whether McCray was even at the doorway at the time of the shooting.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Gray asserted that the failure to ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>that question constituted ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The State argued that the petition should be denied because McCray\u2019s recanted testimony was not a basis for posteonviction relief and because Gray\u2019s postconviction counsel was not ineffective and did not prejudice Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">On October 10, 2003, Judge Gordy issued the following Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">The Petitioner Julian Gray has filed a Petition to Re-Open Post Conviction Proceedings and an attendant Memorandum. The State has filed a Motion in Opposition and an attendant Memorandum. This court has reviewed and considered the matters submitted by both counsel as well as the post conviction proceedings relevant hereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">IT IS ORDERED this 10th day of October, 2003, by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City pursuant to Maryland Code Annotated, Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 7-104 (2001) upon FINDING that to reopen post conviction proceedings in the matter, captioned above, is \u201cnot in the interest of justice,\u201d AND THEREFORE, the Petitioner Julian Gray\u2019s Motion to Re-Open Post Conviction Proceedings is DENIED, without hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">On September 13, 2004, in a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals upheld Judge Gordy\u2019s decision. <em>Gray v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 635, 857 A.2d 1176 (2004). Gray petitioned this Court and on December 17, 2004, we granted <em>certiorari. Gray v. State, </em>384 Md. 448, 863 A.2d 997 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">According to Maryland Rule 8-131(c) \u201cwhen an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d The clearly erroneous standard does not apply to legal conclusions. <em>Nesbit v. GEICO, </em>382 Md. 65, 72, 854 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>879, 883 (2004). \u201cWhen the trial court\u2019s order \u2018involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are legally correct under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d <em>Nesbit, </em>382 Md. at 72, 854 A.2d at 883 (quoting <em>Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609, 612 (2002)). We interpret the Md. Rules under the same standard of review. <em>Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604, 861 A.2d 78, 81 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The issue raised in this case, whether the court is required to provide a statement supporting its denial of a petition to reopen a postconviction proceeding, involves the interpretation of \u00a7 7-103 of the Criminal Procedure Article and Md. Rule 4-407. As such, our review is <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Section 7-103 of the Criminal Procedure Article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">(a) <em>Only one petition alloived. </em>\u2014 For each trial or sentence, a person may file only one petition for relief under this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">(b) <em>10-year filing period. </em>\u2014 (1) Unless extraordinary cause is shown, in a case in which a sentence of death has not been imposed, a petition under this subtitle may not be filed more than 10 years after the sentence was imposed. (2) In a case in which a sentence of death has been imposed, Subtitle 2 of this title governs the time of filing a petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Md.Code (2001), \u00a7 7-103 of the Criminal Procedure Article. Section 7-104 states that \u201c[t]he court may reopen a postconviction proceeding that was previously concluded if the court determines that the action is in the interest of justice.\u201d Md.Code (2001), \u00a7 7-104 of the Criminal Procedure Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">Chapter 400 of Title 4 of the Md. Rules governs the procedural rules for postconviction matters. Md. Rule 4-407 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>(a) <em>Statement. </em>The judge shall prepare and file or dictate into the record a statement setting forth separately each ground upon which the petition is based, the federal and state rights involved, the court\u2019s ruling with respect to each ground, and the reasons for the action taken thereon. If dictated into the record, the statement shall be promptly transcribed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">(b) <em>Order of court. </em>The statement shall include or be accompanied by an order either granting or denying relief. If the order is in favor of the petitioner, the court may provide for rearraignment, retrial, custody, bail, discharge, correction of sentence, or other matters that may be necessary and proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">(c) <em>Copy to the parties. </em>A copy of the statement and the order shall be filed with the clerk and sent to the petitioner, petitioner\u2019s counsel, and that State\u2019s Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">(d) <em>Finality. </em>The statement and order constitute a final judgment when entered by the clerk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">As we stated in <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995), \u201c[t]he first step in determining legislative intent is to look at the statutory language and \u2018[i]f the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oaks, </em>339 Md. at 35, 660 A.2d at 429 (quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204, 1206-07 (1994)). The same analysis pertains to our interpretation of the Md. Rules. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>360 Md. 250, 264, 757 A.2d 796, 804 (2000). Section 7-104 of the Criminal Procedure Article says nothing about whether the Circuit Court must give a particular type of statement (or any statement at all) when ruling on a request to reopen a postconviction proceeding. Moreover, Md. Rule 4-407 does not mention whether the requirement to provide a detailed statement, as stated in Md. Rule 4-407(a), is applicable to the denial of a petition to reopen postconviction proceedings. If the intent of a statute is not clear from its language, we may consider other sources. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>See Johnson v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore City, </em>387 Md. 1, 11, 874 A.2d 439, 445 (2005) (discussing the history and general purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and noting that we construe statutory language in light of the legislative purpose and statutory context). As noted in <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 525 A.2d 628 (1987),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">[w]e may and often must consider other \u201cexternal manifestations\u201d or \u201cpersuasive evidence,\u201d including a bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs, amendments that occurred as it passed through the legislature, its relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation, and other material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal, which becomes the context within which we read the particular language before us in a given case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-6\"><em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 515, 525 A.2d at 632-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The historical development of the Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act (UPPA), over time, reveals a legislative attempt to limit the number of postconviction petitions that can be filed. That statutory history supports our holding that the court is not required to treat a petition to reopen the same as a petition for postconviction relief. The reported opinion of the Court of Special Appeals in this case provides the following historical review of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">Since the enactment of the UPPA in 1958, the General Assembly has acted to limit the number of postconviction petitions that a person may file for each conviction. Originally, the UPPA \u201cdid not place any limit on the number of postconviction petitions which a petitioner was entitled to file.\u201d <em>Mason v. State, </em>309 Md. 215, 217-18, 522 A.2d 1344 (1987). But, effective July 1, 1986, Art. 27, \u00a7 645A was amended by adding subsection (a)(2), which provided that a \u201cperson may not file more than two petitions, arising out of each trial, for relief under this Subtitle,\u201d <em>Grayson v. State, </em>354 Md. 1, 3, 728 A.2d [1280] 1289 (1999).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">In 1995, the General Assembly again changed the number of petitions that could be filed to challenge a particular convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>tion. By Ch. 110 of the Acts of 1995 ... (I) and (II) were added to subsection (a)(2) and subsequently codified as Art. 27, 645A (a)(2)(I) and (iii). Under subsection (a)(2)(I), a person was permitted to \u201cfile only one petition arising out of each trial,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4 [728 A.2d 1280], and subsection (a)(2)(iii) provided that \u201c[t]he court may in its discretion reopen a postconviction proceeding that was previously concluded if the court determines that such action is in the interests of justice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">In 2001, the UPPA was repealed and reenacted at CP \u00a7\u00a7 7-101 <em>et seq. </em>The provision relating to the reopening of a postconviction proceeding is now codified at CP \u00a7 7-104 and contains \u201cnew language derived without substantive change.\u201d Revisor\u2019s Note. The words \u201cin its discretion\u201d were \u201cdeleted as surplusage.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\"><em>Gray, </em>158 Md.App. at 645-646, 857 A.2d at 1182. Consideration of the statutory purpose can help us determine the legislative intent. <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 517, 525 A.2d at 634 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">To interpret section 7-104 as requiring a court to render a supporting statement with respect to its decisions on petitions (treating them exactly like a petition for postconviction relief) would ignore the purpose of the postconviction legislation as revealed by its development over time \u2014 that is, to lessen the burden on the courts created by endless postconviction proceedings. <em>See Tillett v. Warden of the Md. House of Correction, </em>220 Md. 677, 679, 154 A.2d 808, 810 (1959) (Discussing the predecessor to the current postconviction statutes and noting the Legislature\u2019s intention \u201cto put a stop to the endless repetition of the same grounds of collateral attack upon convictions. Repeated petitions for writs of <em>habeas corpus </em>became such an abuse as to call for legislation which began in 1941.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">In addition to the historical development of the UPPA, a review of the statutory context within which \u00a7 7-104 is located supports our holding. Section 7-108 provides, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a person is entitled to assistance of counsel and a hearing on a petition filed under this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\">(b) <em>Exceptions. </em>\u2014 (1) If a person seeks to reopen a postconviction proceeding under \u00a7 7-104 of this subtitle, the court shall determine whether assistance from counsel or a hearing should be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Md.Code (2001), \u00a7 7-108(a)-(b) 1 of the Criminal Procedure Article.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The Legislature has treated petitions to reopen with less formality than petitions for postconviction relief, with respect to the rights to counsel and to a hearing. Consequently, it is logical to conclude that a petition to reopen may be treated less formally than a petition for postconviction relief, regarding what a court must do in explicating its ruling on such a petition. The logic of this reasoning is particularly strong in view of the fact that the \u201cright\u201d to have the court provide a detailed statement is not as significant as the right to counsel or the right to a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Citing <em>Pfoff v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 296, 583 A.2d 1097 (1991), Gray argues that a petition to reopen is the \u201cfunctional substitute\u201d for the former right to a second postconviction petition, and, as such, the court is required to treat it as a petition for postconviction for the purposes of issuing a \u201cmeaningful\u201d statement in support of the court\u2019s decision on the matter. In <em>Pfoff, </em>the Court of Special Appeals discussed the requirements of postconviction proceedings existing at the time, and noted that the petitioner was limited to two petitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>arising from the same trial. <em>Pfoff, </em>85 Md.App. at 302, 583 A.2d at 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The court also noted that Md. Rule 4-406(a) did not require a hearing for a second petition. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, the court noted that a judge\u2019s responsibility under Md. Rule 4-407(a) was to issue a detailed statement to resolve the second petition for postconviction relief. <em>Pfoff, </em>85 Md.App. at 303, 583 A.2d at 1101. Gray argues that those same requirements should be imposed on the court regarding petitions to reopen because, when the law permitted two postconviction petitions, the court did not have to grant a hearing on the second petition but still had to prepare the statement in accordance with Md. Rule 4-407(a). Gray\u2019s reliance on <em>Pfoff </em>is misplaced. The court in <em>Pfoff </em>did not apply Md. Rule 4-407(a) to a petition to reopen and, for that reason alone, the case is distinguishable. Moreover, the law on postconviction relief has changed since <em>Pfoff. </em>Petitioners no longer have a right to more than one petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">If a petition to reopen was the \u201cfunctional substitute\u201d of the former right to a second postconviction petition, the Legislature would not have required assistance of counsel and a hearing for the postconviction petition and then expressly removed or nullified the court\u2019s discretion to decide whether a person should receive those rights in the case of a petition to reopen. Additionally, if a petition to reopen was the \u201cfunctional substitute\u201d of a petition for postconviction relief, \u00a7 7-103, which states that \u201c[f]or each trial or sentence, a person may file <em>only </em>one petition for relief under this title,\u201d would be rendered meaningless. Md.Code. (2001), \u00a7 7-103 of the Criminal Procedure Article (emphasis added). If the Legislature intended for defendants to retain a right to a second postconviction petition, it would not have changed the law to take away that right. Finally, unlike \u00a7 7-103, \u00a7 7-104 does not prohibit a person from filing more than one petition to reopen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As noted by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Gray, </em>\u201cif <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>each request to reopen a closed proceeding required an in-depth assessment as to each of the issues upon which the petition was based, the effect would be an unlimited number of postconviction proceedings disguised as requests to reopen the proceeding.\u201d <em>Gray v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 635, 644-45, 857 A.2d 1176, 1181 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">There is no question that Md. Rule 4Al07(a) applies to initial postconviction proceedings. <em>See Davis v. State, </em>285 Md. 19, 400 A.2d 406 (1979) (holding that Rule BK45(b), the predecessor to Md. Rule 4-407, requires judges in postconviction proceedings to \u201cmake findings of fact as to every claim\u201d in order to avoid a remand); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>284 Md. 664, 399 A.2d 256 (1979) (holding that the court\u2019s order resolving an initial petition filed under the UPPA must comply with Md. Rule BK45(b)); <em>Farrell v. Warden of Md. Penitentiary, </em>241 Md. 46, 215 A.2d 218 (1965) (remanding a postconviction proceeding for findings of fact in accordance with Rule BK45(b)). We have not, however, found a case in which the rule has been applied to petitions to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Gray also relies on <em>Stovall v. Stale, </em>144 Md.App. 711, 800 A.2d 31, <em>cert. denied, </em>371 Md. 71, 806 A.2d 681 (2002). In <em>Stovall, </em>the Court of Special Appeals held that a postconviction petitioner,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">(1) is entitled to the effective assistance of postconviction counsel, and (2) has a right to reopen a postconviction proceeding by asserting facts that \u2014 if proven to be true at a subsequent hearing \u2014 establish that postconviction relief would have been granted but for the ineffective assistance of the petitioner\u2019s postconviction counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-8\"><em>Stovall, </em>144 Md.App. at 715-16, 800 A.2d at 34. Gray argues that the \u201cright\u201d to reopen because of ineffective postconviction counsel will \u201cring hollow without the concomitant requirement that the circuit judge render a meaningful statement as to these issues that could not have been raised in the initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>postconviction petition.\u201d We disagree. <em>Stovall </em>is distinguishable from the present case. <em>Stovall </em>does not address whether the court must provide a detailed statement similar to the one required under Md. Rule 4-407(a) when resolving a petition for postconviction relief. Furthermore, in view of \u00a7 7-104, we are not persuaded that the right to effective postconviction counsel will \u201cring hollow\u201d if the decision to write a detailed statement or a simple order in response to a petition to reopen is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We think it necessary to mention that insofar as <em>Stovall </em>could be misinterpreted to <em>require </em>a trial court to reopen a postconviction proceeding any time a defendant alleges that his postconviction counsel was ineffective, we reject such an interpretation. As explained in this opinion, the Legislature has left it within the court\u2019s discretion to decide whether a person seeking to reopen a postconviction proceeding should receive counsel or a hearing. Moreover, the Legislature has left it within the trial court\u2019s discretion to decide, in the interests of justice, if a postconviction proceeding should be reopened. <em>Stovall </em>should not be read to remove discretion from the trial court in those instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Having discussed what \u00a7 7-104 does <em>not </em>require, we now turn our attention to what it does require. Section 7-104 requires the court to exercise discretion when ruling on a petition to reopen a postconviction proceeding. The requirement to exercise discretion prevents the court from acting arbitrarily. \u201cThe court <em>may </em>reopen a postconviction proceeding that was previously concluded <em>if the couH determines </em>that the action is in the interests of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Md.Code (2001), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>\u00a7 7-104 of the Criminal Procedure Article (emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the court has discretion to determine if a postconviction proceeding should be reopened, it follows that the court also has discretion to determine how detailed a statement will be given in response to any such petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">We will only reverse a trial court\u2019s discretionary act if we find that the court has abused its discretion. As noted by this Court in <em>Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>384 Md. 606, 865 A.2d 603 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">\u201c \u2018Abuse of discretion\u2019 is one of those very general, amorphous terms that appellate courts use and apply with great frequency but which they have defined in many different ways.... [A] ruling reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling. The decision under consideration has to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable. That kind of distance can arise in a number of ways, among which are that the ruling either does not logically follow from the findings upon which it supposedly rests or has no reasonable relationship to its announced objective. That, we think, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>is included within the notion of \u2018untenable grounds,\u2019 \u2018violative of fact and logic,\u2019 and \u2018against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><em>Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>384 Md. at 628, 865 A.2d at 616 (quoting <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13-14, 648 A.2d 1025, 1031-1032 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In the Order denying the petition to reopen, Judge Gordy specifically noted that he had \u201creviewed and considered the matters submitted by both counsel as well as the postconviction proceedings relevant hereto.\u201d He then found that it was \u201cnot in the interest of justice\u201d to reopen the proceedings. That brief statement, when considered along with the record of this case, was enough to inform the parties and the appellate courts of the reasons for Judge Gordy\u2019s decision. As noted in <em>Williams v. State, </em>344 Md. 358, 371, 686 A.2d 1096, 1102-03 (1996), \u201c[tjhere is no requirement that the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion be detailed for the record, so long as the record reflects that the discretion was in fact exercised.\u201d As a result, we cannot say that Judge Gordy abused his discretion by writing the brief Order denying Gray\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Turning briefly to the merits of the petition to reopen, we note that it was not an abuse of discretion to refuse to reopen the postconviction proceeding in this case. It was not \u201cviolative of fact and logic\u201d for the trial court to conclude, as it obviously did, that even if Gray\u2019s postconviction counsel had asked Riddic if McCray was on the porch during the shooting, Riddic\u2019s answer would not have changed the outcome of the initial postconviction hearing. Riddic\u2019s testimony would only have raised a credibility issue between McCray and Riddic. Credibility of a witness is ordinarily not reviewable in a postconviction proceeding. <em>Walls v. Warden, Maryland Penitentiary, </em>242 Md. 401, 404, 219 A.2d 6, 7 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">As for McCray\u2019s recantation itself, we note that it occurred after the death of McCray\u2019s friend Shauna, the person who allegedly told McCray that she had seen Gray with a gun. In addition, there is no indication that the officer who obtained McCray\u2019s testimony believed it to be false or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>that the State knowingly used false testimony at trial. The allegation that perjured testimony was offered at trial, \u201cabsent a showing that the State knowingly used perjured testimony,\u201d is not a ground for postconviction relief. <em>Fisher v. Warden of Md. House of Correction, </em>225 Md. 642, 643, 171 A.2d 731, 731 (1961). As a result, it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to conclude that McCray\u2019s new statement did not present a reason, \u201cin the interests of justice,\u201d to reopen the postconviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. PETITIONER TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\">.

Gray asserts in his brief before this Court that if Riddic had been asked that question, \u201cshe would have testified that Ms. McCray was not in fact in the doorway when Mr. Hudson was shot.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b419-8\">. In addition, in keeping with \u00a7 7-108, Md. Rule 4-406(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">A hearing shall be held promptly on a petition under the [UPPA] unless the parties stipulate that the facts stated in the petition are true and that the facts and applicable law justify the granting of relief. If a defendant requests that the court reopen a postconviction proceeding that was previously concluded, the court shall determine whether a hearing will be held, but it may not reopen the proceeding or grant the relief requested without a hearing unless the parties stipulate that the facts stated in the petition are true and that the facts and applicable law justify the granting of relief.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\">. In addition, the statute does not specify when a defendant must file a petition to reopen, unlike petitions for postconviction relief in non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>death penalty cases, which have a 10-year filing period, \u201cunless extraordinary cause is shown.\u201d Md.Code (2001), \u00a7 7- 103(b) of the Criminal Procedure Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\">. The phrase \"interests of justice\u201d has been interpreted to include a wide array of possibilities. <em>See Love v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 420, 427, 621 A.2d 910, 914 (1993) (mentioning a long list of reasons for granting a new trial in the interests of justice). While it is within the trial court's discretion to decide when \"the interests of justice\u201d require reopening, we note that some reasons for reopening could include, for example, ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel or a change made in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>law that should bo applied retroactively. <em>See Oken v.
