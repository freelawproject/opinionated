Concluding that such damages are indeed compensable under that statute, we hold that, when a condemnor\u2019s pre-condemnation conduct results ultimately in formal condemnation proceedings, all damages resulting from that conduct ordinarily would be included in the award of \u201cfair market value\u201d relating to the condemnation award. On the record of this case, however, a justification may exist to permit the former property owner to pursue the alleged pre-condemnation damages in a separate action. In order to resolve whether that is appropriate, fact-finding may be required. A remand to consider that, therefore, is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">This case involves 33,000 square feet of commercially zoned land, previously owned by Reichs Ford Road Joint Venture (\u201cReichs Ford\u201d), a Maryland general partnership, located along Urbana Pike in Frederick County, Maryland. Prior to the formal exercise of eminent domain in 2001 by the State Roads Commission of the State Highway Administration of the Maryland Department of Transportation (\u201cSHA\u201d or \u201cAdministration\u201d), the land was improved with a gasoline service station.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In the summer of 1987, the SHA, pursuant to powers vested in it under \u00a7 40B of Article III of the Maryland Constitution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued a general public announcement pertaining to a newly proposed interchange at Routes 85/355, near the subject property, in Frederick County. In October of that year, Griffith Consumers (\u201cGriffith\u201d) entered into a ten-year lease agreement with Reichs Ford to operate a gas station on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>In a letter dated 20 December 1988, the SHA informed Reichs Ford that it had scheduled construction for the new interchange and that the project would affect substantially the subject property. The letter also stated that an appraiser was selected to appraise the subject property and that the SHA would make a purchase offer within six months. Although the SHA commissioned a number of ensuing appraisals, for which Reichs Ford made available its lease agreement and the monthly rental receipts during the lease tern, the Administration made no offers to purchase the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Seven years later, in August of 1995, Reichs Ford received another letter from the SHA advising that yet another appraiser had been selected to appraise the subject property, after which an offer of just compensation would be made. In February of 1996, the SHA offered to purchase the subject property for $950,000. A negotiated sale did not result from this offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Between 1996 and 1997, the SHA met with Griffith, the lessee of the subject property, to inform it of the intended condemnation and its entitlement to relocation assistance. The SHA also drafted a lease termination agreement for Griffith to execute and deliver to Reichs Ford. Upon the expiration of the initial lease term in 1997, Griffith elected not to exercise its option to extend the lease term with Reichs Ford, apparently due to the looming specter of condemnation. Griffith, however, did hold over temporarily on a month-to-month basis at a reduced rent, eventually vacating the property on 30 June 1998. Thereafter, Reichs Ford claims that it was unable to lease the property as a gas station or for any other economically viable use due to the SHA\u2019s plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Between 1998 and 2000, Reichs Ford requested informally, on several occasions, that the SHA formally exercise its eminent domain powers or abandon the proposed taking of the subject property. During this period, Reichs Ford continued regularly to update the SHA regarding the alleged damages being incurred as a result of the Administration\u2019s indecision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Nevertheless, the SHA did not take any meaningful steps toward the institution of formal condemnation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Frustrated with the SHA\u2019s inaction, Reichs Ford filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Frederick County on 31 January 2000, claiming damages based on a theory of inverse condemnation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Reichs Ford claimed that, by placing its property \u201cunder the cloud of imminent condemnation\u201d for such a lengthy period of time, the SHA rendered the property economically unusable and thus was liable for damages that accrued as a result of the unwarranted delay. Reichs Ford\u2019s complaint sought damages incurred from the time Griffith failed to exercise its option to extend the lease and the filing of the complaint. The damages included, among other things, lost rents, property taxes, and carrying costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">On 8 March 2001, the State instituted condemnation proceedings in the Circuit Court for Frederick County to acquire the subject property and the improvements thereon. Sometime thereafter, Reichs Ford and the SHA initiated settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>negotiations regarding all pending claims related to the subject property. Reichs Ford proposed two alternatives. First, it proposed to settle both the SHA\u2019s eminent domain action and the pending inverse condemnation suit for the total sum of $1,525,000. Alternatively, Reichs Ford proposed to settle <em>only </em>the eminent domain claim for $1,325,000, on the condition that it could continue to prosecute the inverse condemnation claim. The SHA, by letter of its counsel dated 19 June 2001, chose the second option and the parties executed an Agreed Inquisition in the eminent domain action calling for $1,325,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">This agreement was filed with the Circuit Court on 22 June 2001, resolving effectively the condemnation claim. The parties continued to litigate the inverse condemnation action. After the parties engaged in discovery, the SHA filed a motion in limine on 30 January 2003. The motion argued that the damages Reichs Ford was seeking, described in the body of the brief motion as \u201clost rental income, real property taxes, mortgage interest, etc.,\u201d were \u201cnot allowed in a condemnation case\u201d and asked the court for the following relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">A. That the Court enter an order barring plaintiff from introducing evidence at trial pertaining to lost rental income, real property taxes, etc.; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">B. For such other and further relief as the nature of the case may require.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The Circuit Court held a hearing on the motion in limine on 3 March 2003, during which the trial judge made the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">Basically what is before the court now is defendant\u2019s motion in limine, which I think, although it\u2019s not framed as a motion to dismiss, if 1 grant the motion in limine, I believe, ... it is, in effect, dismissing plaintiff\u2019s claim because the only element of damages alleged in this case are the lost profits and those items which are subject to [the SHA\u2019s] motion in limine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">The court continued, reasoning that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGO\">basically this is an in rem action and the measure of damages is the value of property taken. I don\u2019t find any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>authority that the Court finds compelling to authorize a suit in these circumstances where the measure of damages is loss of rental income in the in rem proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">Therefore, I am going to grant [SHA\u2019s] motion in limine as to any evidence as to lost profits and lost rental income for the period of time at issue in this case, which is prior to the actual condemnation being taken. So in effect, it is a legal motion to dismiss, and quite honestly, let the Court of Special Appeals tell us how we\u2019re supposed to proceed in these circumstances because this Court is just not clear, and I\u2019m erring on the side of viewing the statute being the value of the land taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">On 16 April 2003, the Circuit Court entered an order granting SHA\u2019s motion in limine and dismissing the case. Reiehs Ford noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On 19 October 2004, in an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court, holding that the proper vehicle for Reiehs Ford to have proven and recovered the damages sought in the inverse condemnation suit was the settled action for condemnation. The intermediate appellate court found that, although the damages claimed by Reiehs Ford may be recoverable in some instances, \u201c[cjlearly, the General Assembly intended for any diminution in value of property caused by the pre-condemnation activities of the condemnor be considered in computing fair market value\u201d in the SHA\u2019s eminent domain action. The Court of Special Appeals noted also that, although the General Assembly has provided for recovery beyond the fair market value in certain specified circumstances, none of these circumstances was present in Reiehs Ford\u2019s claim. Reiehs Ford petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted, 385 Md. 162, 867 A.2d 1062 (2005), in order to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">Did the Circuit Court err in precluding Reiehs Ford from introducing evidence of lost rental income, real property taxes, etc. resulting from the SHA\u2019s activities prior to its exercise of the power of eminent domain?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The Circuit Court granted the SHA\u2019s motion in limine, treating it as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action. Md. Rule 2-322. The question before us thus becomes whether the Circuit Court erred in dismissing Reichs Ford\u2019s inverse condemnation complaint based on the court\u2019s determination to exclude certain evidence. We review the grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo. Adamson v. Corr. Med. Servs., </em>359 Md. 238, 246, 753 A.2d 501, 505 (2000) (citations omitted). We examine whether the complaint, assuming all well-pleaded facts and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the pleader, states a legally sufficient cause of action. <em>Id. </em>at 246, 753 A.2d at 505. Dismissal is proper only if the complaint would fail to provide the plaintiff with a judicial remedy. <em>Bobo v. State, </em>346 Md. 706, 709, 697 A.2d 1371, 1373 (1997). In the present case, the Circuit Court concluded that, once Reichs Ford was precluded from presenting the implicated evidence of damages, dismissal of its claim was proper. In order to determine whether dismissal was proper in this case, we therefore must first examine whether granting the motion in limine was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The motion in limine, which the Circuit Court granted without elaboration, qualification or limitation, sought to exclude \u201cdamages for lost rental income, real property taxes, <em>etc.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the time period prior to the filing by the SHA of the eminent domain action. The motion in limine in this case is not a model of precision or clarity. A written motion must state its premises and relief sought <em>with particularity. </em>Md. Rule 2-311 (emphasis added). Because the motion in limine here used the vague term \u201cetc.\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>describe its request for potentially unlimited broad relief, how is a court to know the full extent of the assumed evidence it is being asked to exclude, or what the proper legal grounds for such a sweeping exclusion may be? The granting of the motion in limine in such wholesale fashion, without question, elaboration, qualification or limitation, leaves this Court with the untenable task of guessing, to some degree, at the full scope of the evidence intended to be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Even were we to overlook the relative vagueness of the request in the motion in limine, we conclude that granting the motion was legally incorrect. The SHA argued in its motion that types or categories of evidence it foresaw might be offered by Reichs Ford should be barred from consideration because, according to the SHA, \u201csuch damages are not admissible in a condemnation case.\u201d The Circuit Court agreed, stating that it did not \u201cfind any authority that the Court finds compelling to authorize a suit in these circumstances where the measure of damages is loss of rental income in the in rem proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In order to determine whether Reichs Ford may recover lost rents and other related damages in an inverse condemnation suit versus a traditional condemnation claim, we first must examine how, and under what authorities, a condemnee may be compensated when property is taken as a result of the exercise of eminent domain. Both the United States and Maryland Constitutions prohibit the sovereign from taking private property for public use without just compensation. U.S. Const. amend. V; Md. Const. art. 3, \u00a7 40. The measure of damages in a condemnation proceeding at common law in Maryland was the value of the real property taken. <em>Pumphrey v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>175 Md. 498, 505, 2 A.2d 668, 671 (1938). The general theory behind that conceptualization of just compensation was that the individual property owner should be placed in as good a position financially as he or she would have been but for the establishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>of the public project. <em>Dodson v. Anne Arundel County, </em>294 Md. 490, 494, 451 A.2d 317, 320 (1982). Moreover, the economic impact of a public project should be borne by the public as a whole and not by a single property owner or a group of individual property owners. <em>Armstrong v. United States, </em>364, U.S. 40, 49, 364 U.S. 40, 80 S.Ct. 1563, 1569, 4 L.Ed.2d 1554 (1960). Just compensation, as interpreted under the Maryland Constitution, however, only requires compensation for real property interests. <em>See, e.g., Shipley v. Balt. &amp; Potomac R. R. Co., </em>34 Md. 336, 343 (1871) (holding that just compensation means the actual value in money of the property). Losses incidental to an interest in real property, such as moving costs, taxes, and lost rents generally were not required to be compensated for when the government exercised its powers of eminent domain to take permanent and total possession of a property under the common law. <em>See id. </em>at 343 (stating that just compensation does not include benefits, advantages, or damages incidental to the interest in real property and caused by the public project). Practically speaking, there are many hidden costs involved in the acquisition of property by the government for public projects that have not been determined to be compensable as a matter of common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\"> In this case, Reichs Ford does not allege a traditional claim for just compensation as the result of formal condemnation, however, but rather seeks damages incidental to inverse condemnation. Inverse condemnation has been described as a \u201cshorthand description of the manner in which a landowner recovers just compensation for a taking of his property when condemnation proceedings have not been instituted.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Clarke, </em>445 U.S. 253, 257, 100 S.Ct. 1127, 1130, 63 L.Ed.2d 373 (1980). In claims for condemnation where there has been a temporary taking, courts have found that, based on federal constitutional principles, a proper measure of damages may be the lost rental value between the initial taking and the time that the property is returned or restored. <em>See Kimball Laundry Co. v. U.S., </em>338 U.S. 1, 7, 69 S. Ct. 1434, 1438, 93 L.Ed. 1765 (1949) (finding that for an expressly temporary governmental occupation of property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>effectively a temporary taking, a measure of fair market value may be the value a renter would have paid for the property). It would appear then that the Circuit Court\u2019s view in the present case that lost rental income is not admissible evidence in any condemnation context is not universally true. <em>See Bergeman v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>218 Md. 137, 140, 146 A.2d 48, 50 (1958) (noting that capitalizing rent is an approved method of valuation of property); <em>Brinsfield v. City of Baltimore, </em>236 Md. 66, 71, 202 A.2d 335, 337 (1964) (finding that capitalized rents are admissible when determining fair market value of a property to be condemned).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In <em>Kimball, </em>the Supreme Court held that, in the case of a temporary taking, lost rental income was part of the proper measure of damages. 338 U.S. at 7, 69 S.Ct. at 1438, 93 L.Ed. 1765. In that case, the government occupied a private laundry business on an expressly temporary basis so that it could be run as a laundry for U.S. Army personnel. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 338 U.S. 1, 69 S.Ct. at 1437, 93 L.Ed. 1765. After the property was returned to the private owner, the trial court awarded damages based on the lost rental income, as well as wear and tear beyond the norm of the company\u2019s equipment. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 338 U.S. 1, 69 S.Ct. at 1437, 93 L.Ed. 1765. In affirming the judgment of the trial court, the Supreme Court reasoned that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">determination of the value of temporary occupancy can be approached only on the supposition that free bargaining between petitioner and a hypothetical lessee would have taken place in the usual framework of such negotiations. We agree, however, with both lower courts, therefore that the proper measure of the award is the rental that probably could have been obtained, and so this Court has held in the two recent cases dealing with temporary takings. Indeed, if the difference between the market value of the fee on the date of taking and that on the date of return were taken to be the measure, there might frequently be situations in which the owner would receive no compensation whatsoever because the market value of the property had not decreased during the period of the taker\u2019s occupancy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 7, 338 U.S. 1, 69 S.Ct. at 1438, 93 L.Ed. 1765 (citations omitted); <em>U.S. v. General Motors Corp., </em>323 U.S. 373, 381, 65 S.Ct. 357, 361, 89 L.Ed. 311 (1945) (holding that, where the government occupies property temporarily, the measure of compensation is the measure of the interest taken, or the \u201cfair rental value\u201d); <em>see W.H. Pugh Coal Co. v. State, </em>157 Wis.2d 620, 460 N.W.2d 787, 791 (1990) (finding that lost income, such as rental value, when shown to a reasonable degree of certainty, may be admitted when determining just compensation in certain cases) (citations omitted). The Court also found that, constitutionally speaking, fair market value is usually the only measure of damages in an eminent domain condemnation. <em>Kimball, </em>338 U.S. at 5-6, 69 S.Ct. at 1438, 93 L.Ed. 1765. In the case of a temporary taking, however, fair market value alone may not be enough to equal just compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 338 U.S. 1, 69 S.Ct. at 1438, 93 L.Ed. 1765. Although <em>Kimball </em>involved a temporary taking under a formal condemnation scheme, we believe that its language is equally applicable to situations, such as that here, where the temporary taking occurs in an alleged inverse condemnation context. We therefore conclude that Reiehs Ford\u2019s proposed evidence of lost rental income and related damages should not have been barred pre-trial through the grant of a motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Reiehs Ford argues that there were two causes of action pleaded in the facts in its complaint. Reiehs Ford believes it is entitled to \u201cjust compensation\u201d for the value, as of the date the SHA filed the condemnation suit,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the property itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>and damages in inverse condemnation resulting from lost rents and carrying costs incurred from the time the tenant, Griffith, vacated the property until the day the condemnation suit was filed. <em>See Stone v. City of L.A., </em>51 Cal.App.3d 987, 994, 124 Cal.Rptr. 822 (1975) (finding that the losses of the property owner beyond the value of the real property and attributable to the lapse in time between the announcement of condemnation and the actual taking were compensable). Reichs Ford claims that its offer to settle the condemnation claim was consistent with this theory of two separate claims. In support of its assertion that there exists independently both an inverse condemnation claim and a traditional condemnation claim, under the circumstances of this case, Reichs Ford relies on the following language in <em>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. Los </em>Angeles, 482 U.S. 304, 319, 107 S.Ct. 2378, 2388, 96 L.Ed.2d 250 (1987),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">[t]he value of a leasehold interest in property for a period of years may be substantial, and the burden on the property owner in extinguishing such an interest for a period of years may be great indeed. Where this burden results from governmental action that amounted to a taking, the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that the government pay the landowner for the value of the use of the land during this period, (citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Reichs Ford argues that, because the SHA\u2019s activities with respect to the subject property, including its interactions with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Griffith, amounted to a taking of Constitutional dimension, it was therefore entitled to just compensation for that taking. <em>Id. </em>at 319, 107 S.Ct. at 2388, 96 L.Ed.2d 250 (1987).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Reichs Ford bases its takings claim on its contention that, as a result of the SHA\u2019s activities, a new lessee could not be found and the property could not be used in any other profitable way.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The SHA argues, however, that Reichs Ford\u2019s claim for inverse condemnation should fail because any damages that occurred as a result of the SHA\u2019s pre-condemnation conduct was subsumed in the award of \u201cfair market value\u201d entered in the Agreed Inquisition condemnation award. The SHA contends that, under Md.Code (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-105 of the Real Property Article,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the fair market value of the property taken under the powers of eminent domain includes all diminution in value proximately caused by the public project. \u00a7 12-105 provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\u00a7 12-105. Fair Market Value</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">(a) <em>Effective date of authority if continuing powers of condemnation </em>\u2014 In this section, the phrase \u201ceffective date of legislative authority for the acquisition of the property\u201d means, with respect to a condemnor vested with continuing power of condemnation, the date of specific administrative determination to acquire the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>(b) <em>Fair market value </em>\u2014 the fair market value of property in a condemnation proceeding is the price as of the valuation date for the highest and best use of the property which a vendor, willing but not obligated to sell, would accept for the property, and which a purchaser, willing but not obligated to buy, would pay, excluding any increment in value proximately caused by the public project for which the property condemned is needed. In addition, fair market value includes any amount by which the price reflects a diminution in value occurring between the effective date of legislative authority for the acquisition of the property and the date of actual taking if the trier of facts finds that the diminution in value was proximately caused by the public project for which the property condemned is needed, or by announcements, or acts of the plaintiff or its officials concerning the public project, and was beyond the reasonable control of the property owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The SHA argues that the phrase \u201cdiminution in value\u201d applies to all lost rents and carrying costs, if Reichs Ford is entitled to these damages at all, from the date that the SHA specifically determined to acquire the subject property. In the SHA\u2019s view, because the parties settled the issue of the \u201cfair market value\u201d of the property, as defined by \u00a7 12-105, in the Agreed Inquisition executed in the condemnation case, the damages claimed by Reichs Ford in its inverse condemnation suit already have been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">We are called upon to determine whether \u00a7 12-105 contemplates the inclusion in an award of fair market value in a condemnation case of lost rents and other incidental damages solely attributable to the period between when the condemnor initially announces the public project and when the condemnation eventually is initiated. This question is one of statutory interpretation and, as such, is purely a legal one. <em>Mohan v. Norris, </em>386 Md. 63, 66-67, 871 A.2d 575, 577 (2005).

Servs. v. Maryland State Highway Admin., </em>375 Md. 211, 224, 825 A.2d 966, 974 (2003). First looking to the language of the statute itself and its stated intention, the Court accords the words of the statute their ordinary and natural significance. <em>Id. </em>at 224, 825 A.2d at 974 (citations omitted). Equally important, the statute is to be read so that no word, phrase, clause, or sentence is rendered meaningless. <em>Fraternal Order of Police of Montgomery County v. Mehrling, </em>343 Md. 155, 180, 680 A.2d 1052, 1065 (1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Although just compensation traditionally has been measured by the concept of fair market value, this conceptualization is merely the constitutional minimum. Fair market value was defined at common law as \u201cwhat a reasonable owner, willing but not obligated to sell would accept and a reasonable buyer, willing but not obligated to buy, would pay.\u201d <em>See State Roads Comm\u2019n v. Warriner, </em>211 Md. 480, 485, 128 A.2d 248, 251 (1957) (reiterating the common law definition of fair market value). This standard, however, as previously observed, may not compensate fully a property owner for all of his or her expenses relating to a condemnation proceeding. <em>Shipley, </em>34 Md. at 343 (noting that it is for the Legislature to decide what, if any, other incidental damages are to be awarded beyond the Constitutional minimum of just compensation in a condemnation case). In order to bridge the gap between \u201cjust\u201d compensation and \u201cfull\u201d compensation, States and other governments are free to expand the range of available compensable damages by statute or regulation. <em>Lore v. Board of Public Works, </em>277 Md. 356, 358-359, 354 A.2d 812, 814 (1976). This approach was acknowledged initially in Maryland when, at the sugges<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>tion of this Court,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the General Assembly set out to liberalize the definition of fair market value. Report of the Legislative Council Committee to Revise the Condemnation Laws of Maryland, 274,14 November 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Pursuant to this goal, the General Assembly commissioned a study of the problems inherent in the measure of fair market value in Maryland, which, prior to the relevant statutory enactments in 1963, was defined solely by common law. Report to the General Assembly of 1963, Proposed Bills, Special Committee Reports, vol. 1, 3 (stating that an intention of the bill was to codify all of the substantive law of condemnation, which to that point existed largely only in case law). The General Assembly, in enacting the statutory scheme in response to the study, stated its intention clearly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">It is desired to codify in the Code all of the substantive law of condemnation, much of which has existed as case law. In doing this, the Committee has <em>liberalized </em>provisions for damages and other expense and losses on the part of condemnees and tenants of condemned property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">One of the main problems contemplated by the study was that of public governmental announcements that affected property values. Report of the Legislative Council Committee, <em>supra, </em>at 281; 1963 Md. Laws, Chap. 52. Occasionally, as happened in the present case, the government announces its intention to take certain property or involve itself in public projects long before the actual taking occurs. <em>See City of Baltimore v. United Five and Ten Cent Stores, </em>250 Md. 361, 369, 243 A.2d 521, 525 (1968) (finding that, under \u00a7 12-105, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>jury could consider all diminution of value from the time the condemning authority made the first announcement of the public project involving the subject property). As alleged in Reichs Ford\u2019s complaint here, the property may experience a substantial diminution in value caused by, among other things, vacating tenants and the inability to put the property to any other viable use, and other costs of maintaining a property while waiting for the government formally to exercise eminent domain or renounce its interest. Report of the Legislative Council Committee, <em>supra, </em>at 281; 1963 Md. Laws, Chap. 52. Other exemplary problems noted by the study included a lack of compensation for moving costs. Report of the Legislative Council Committee, <em>supra, </em>at 275; 1963 Md. Laws, Chap. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">In an attempt to remedy these problems, the Legislature enacted \u00a7 12 \u2014 105(b), which, as initially introduced in the Legislature, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">The fair market value of property in a proceeding for condemnation shall be the price as of the valuation date for the highest and best use of such a property which a seller, willing but not obligated to sell, would accept for the property, and which a buyer, willing but not obligated to buy, would pay, therefore, excluding any increment in value proximately caused by the public project for which the property condemned is needed, plus the amount, if any, by which such price reflects a diminution in value proximately caused by the public project for which the property condemned is needed, or by announcements or acts of the plaintiff or its officials concerning such public project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">1963 Md. Laws, Chap. 52. During the legislative process, the bill was amended by adding new language relating to the date of the valuation of the property, which is indicated below in capital letters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">The fair market value of property in a proceeding for condemnation shall be the price as of the valuation date for the highest and best use of such property which a seller, willing but not obligated to sell, would accept for the property, and which a buyer, willing but not obligated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>buy would pay therefore excluding any increment in value proximately caused by the public project for which the property condemned is needed, plus the amount, if any, by which such price reflects a diminution in value OCCURRING BETWEEN THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SUCH PROPERTY AND THE DATE OF THE ACTUAL TAKING IF THE TRIER OF FACTS SHALL FIND THAT SUCH DIMINUTION IN VALUE WAS proximately caused by the public project for which the property condemned is needed, or by announcements or acts of the plaintiff or its officials concerning such public project, AND WAS BEYOND THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF THE PROPERTY OWNER.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\">IF THE CONDEMNOR IS VESTED WITH A CONTINUING POWER OF CONDEMNATION, THE PHRASE EFFECTIVE DATE OF LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY FOR THE ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY, AS USED IN THIS SECTION, SHALL MEAN THE DATE OF SPECIFIC ADMINISTRATIVE DETERMINATION TO ACQUIRE SUCH PROPERTY.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">1963 Md. Laws, Chap. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Keeping in mind that the Legislature intended to liberalize fair market value, including allowing compensation for the problems identified in the study, we conclude that inclusion of the foregoing language was intended to allow compensation for demonstrable damages occurring as the result of the condemnor\u2019s conduct during the pre-condemnation period. The SHA argues, however, that because the loss of rental value is not a \u201cdiminution in value,\u201d Reichs Ford is not entitled to recover such damages in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Diminution in value is defined generally as the act or process of decreasing, lessening, or taking away. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 490 (8th ed.2004). The diminution in value typically is calculated based on the reduction in market value that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>caused by the public project. <em>Id. </em>When a tenant vacates a property, the property\u2019s market value is reduced as well as the value of the property to the owner. <em>See Bern-Shaw Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Mayor of Balt., </em>377 Md. 277, 300, 833 A.2d 502, 515 (2003) (finding that, in a \u201cquick-take\u201d action where the vacating tenants had caused a great deal of destruction to the property while moving out, allowing the jury to see the property in that condition was prejudicial to its determination of \u201cjust compensation\u201d). Not only will the property likely sell for less in an open market, it may become a millstone around the neck of the property owner, constantly causing the expenditure of funds with little or no return on investment. Report of the Legislative Council Committee, <em>supra, </em>at 281; 1963 Md. Laws, Chap. 52 (noting that, when tenants vacate, the property may lie idle before condemnation and become subject to vandalism and other problems). In keeping with the stated goal of just compensation, to place the property owner in as good a financial position as if eminent domain had never happened, it follows that fair market value, as contemplated by the definition provided by the Legislature, includes related lost rental income.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the Legislature intended to compensate property owners for a wide range of detrimental effects that the exercise (or threatened exercise) of eminent domain might have, including those categories <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>of damages apparently sought by Reichs Ford in this case, from the time that the governmental body or agency vested with the taking power decides to take the specific property until the date of the actual taking.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under the statutory scheme of \u00a7 12-105, any compensable damages resulting during the period prior to a formal condemnation ordinarily should be considered and awarded, where appropriate, in the condemnation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In the instant case, Reichs Ford claims to have suffered nearly the same types of damages the General Assembly foresaw. After the public project was announced and remained pending, the tenant vacated the property, creating a situation in which Reichs Ford claims it suffered a loss in rental income, the payment of continuing real property taxes, mortgage interest, insurance, and other costs associated with maintaining the property. Although Reichs Ford here is claiming only for the period of time between the end of the tenant\u2019s initial lease term and the formal initiation of the eminent domain action in 2001, the lapse of time between the announcement of the public project and the ultimate condemnation was considerable, almost fourteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Including in the concept of \u201cjust compensation\u201d the recovery of lost rents and other damages to an interest in the real property prior to the actual condemnation supports the Legislature\u2019s intention of liberalizing the definition of fair market value and protecting property owners by creating an incentive for the State expeditiously to resolve or prosecute condemnation proceedings rather than, as in this case, possibly dragging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>its feet. If lost rental value and other related damages are not recoverable, it might encourage a condemning authority simply to extend, without justification, the \u201cencumbering\u201d period prior to condemnation. <em>Dodson, </em>294 Md. at 506, 451 A.2d at 326 (noting that the independent recovery for delay was used to imposed some sort of sanction for arbitrary and capricious acts by the condemnor).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We also conclude that combining a claim for damages from a temporary taking with the ultimate condemnation action is supported by principles of judicial economy. This would be consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting \u00a7 12-105 to include all possible damages caused by public announcements regarding public projects in the assessment of fair market value at the time of the ultimate taking. <em>See Id. </em>at 505, 451 A.2d at 325 (observing that, at common law, if a landowner receives just compensation for the actual value of his property, he or she would have to sue separately in tort for damages related to unreasonable delay in payment of just compensation). The actual value of vacant property that cannot be rented or put to any other economically viable use is usually far lower than property that can be used in productive ways. Similarly, the longer a property continues to stand idle, the more speculative the diminution in value becomes, especially if possible rental income cannot be taken into account when determining the award. Not allowing the condemnee to receive other real property damages incidental to the condemnation creates undesirable and potentially significant transaction costs that may defeat the purpose of just compensation. In the present case, however, we have an unusual situation to which we must apply our determination that ordinarily precondemnation damage claims should be subsumed in the \u201cfair-market value\u201d awarded in the ensuing eminent domain proceeding. Reichs Ford agreed to an award of \u201cfair market value\u201d for its property in the condemnation action, without limitation or qualification expressed in the Agreed Inquisition. Ordinarily, that would mean that it received all that it was entitled to under \u00a7 12-105, including the damages claimed in the inverse condemnation action. Yet, extenuating circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>stances were suggested at oral argument<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and in this record that may justify allowing Reichs Ford to pursue its \u201cinverse condemnation\u201d claims in the present litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Equitable estoppel is comprised of three basic elements: 1) a voluntary representation of one party, 2) that is relied on by the other party, 3) to the other party\u2019s detriment. <em>Creveling v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>376 Md. 72, 102, 828 A.2d 229, 247 (2003). The party attempting to prove estoppel bears the burden of adducing facts that support its contention. <em>Cunninghame v. Cunninghame, </em>364 Md. 266, 289, 772 A.2d 1188, 1202 (2001). The record contains a letter, dated 19 June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>2001, from the SHA\u2019s attorney to Reichs Ford\u2019s counsel relating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">After our conversation today, I spoke to my clients, []. I explained that you gave mo two alternative proposals. The first was that we would settle both cases with an Agreed Inquisition in the amount of $1,525,000 inclusive of prejudgment interest and the second was that you would execute an Agreed Inquisition in the amount o $1,325,000 inclusive of prejudgment interest though would settle ONLY the condemnation action and that you would continue to litigate your claims of inverse condemnation related to this action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">My client has given me the authority to accept your second proposal. SHA agrees that it will execute an Agreed Inquisition in the amount of $1,325,000 inclusive of prejudgment interest and that you will continue to litigate your claims of inverse condemnation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The Agreed Inquisition executed and filed in the condemnation proceeding was for the amount of $1,325,000. No mention of the pending inverse condemnation suit or claim appears in the Agreed Inquisition; however, there also is in this record indication that the SHA was made aware at intervals by Reichs Ford, over the course of time between the termination of Griffith\u2019s lease and initiation of the formal condemnation action, of the mounting claimed pre-condemnation damages. How this state of affairs affects the SHA\u2019s ability to claim now that Reichs Ford received everything to which it was entitled under \u00a7 12-105 in the eminent domain action may require some fact-finding which, in the first instance, is committed to the fact-finder. This may be considered by the trial court on remand. We express no opinion whether, as a matter of law, estoppel may be applied against the SHA in this matter in any event, leaving that to the parties to address more fully on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>PROCEEDINGS; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY THE STATE OF MARYLAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-7\">.

Reichs Ford's argument appears to be that the government's declarations about pursuing the road project and how that impacted the subject property prevented it from doing as it pleased with its land, namely renting it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b555-8\">.

Llere, Reichs Ford seeks damages relating to loss of value to its property, <em>i e., </em>lost rental value, unlike in <em>Solko, </em>where the property owner sought damages relating to litigation regarding the property, not damages to the property itself. <em>Id. </em>at 153, 570 A.2d at 380.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\">.
