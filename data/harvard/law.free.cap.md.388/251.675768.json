The motion to dismiss was denied. On November 14, 2002, the Circuit Court for Frederick County, sitting as a juvenile court, found that Anthony W. was involved in the delinquent act. Anthony W. filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and the intermediate appellate court reversed the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We granted the State\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, which contains two questions combined into one. For purposes of clarity, we separate and reword the two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that the accomplice corroboration rule applicable in criminal cases applies in juvenile cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals improperly hold that the evidence was insufficient to find that Anthony W. committed the act of malicious destruction of property because there was no corroboration of the testimony of the two alleged accomplices?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">We hold that the common law rule, applicable in criminal proceedings, requiring independent evidence to corroborate the testimony of an accomplice, also applies in juvenile cases. As to the second question, however, we reverse the Court of Special Appeals. We hold that the trial judge was not clearly erroneous in finding that the State\u2019s two witnesses were not accomplices whose testimony needed to be corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Sometime during the late evening of May 10 and early morning of May 11, 2002, Jose Gonzales, Keith Steers, and Anthony W. were driving around the area of Kemptown Church Road in Frederick County with no particular destination in mind. According to the testimony of Keith Steers, the front seat passenger and one of two witnesses for the State, Anthony W. told Jose Gonzales, the driver, to stop the car in the parking lot of Kemptown Elementary School. After Gonzales stopped the car, Anthony W. exited the car from the back seat and went toward a school bus. Shortly thereafter, Steers and Gonzales also got out of the car and went to the rear of the school bus, which was about fifteen feet from the car. Steers testified that the respondent entered the bus by breaking the glass in the front door of the bus. According to Steers, Anthony W. smashed a number of windows with a fire extinguisher stored in the bus and sprayed the interior. Steers and Gonzales testified that they entered the bus shortly after Anthony W. and attempted to stop him from breaking additional windows. Neither Steers nor Gonzales broke any windows. They did, however, remove a box of road flares as all three left the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">On cross-examination, Steers testified that he had been charged with misdemeanor theft for taking the box of flares from the bus, and that the charge was stetted<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in exchange for his testimony against the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In a series of questions, the defense attorney for Anthony W. asked Steers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">Q. Now you say that your case was placed on the stet docket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Q. And was that, what was the agreement that your case be placed on the stet docket, Mr. Steers? Did you make an agreement with the, with the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoZ\">A. That I stay out of trouble.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">Q. Did you also make an agreement that if your case, your theft case was placed on the stet docket, that you would testify against\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">A. Oh\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">Q. \u2014Tony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">Q. Now at the time that your case was ... and you, you said you were charged with misdemeanor theft?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">Q. And that\u2019s what was placed on the stet, stet docket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">Q. So, and do you know what the penalty for misdemeanor theft is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-14\">A. It\u2019s a $5000 fine and up to a year and a half in jail, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-15\">Q. All right. So you knew that by testifying against, against Tony, you could avoid being prosecuted and potentially facing that penalty and jail. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-16\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-17\">The State\u2019s second witness, Gonzales, after being advised of his rights, declined to testify until the State entered a <em>\u201cnol pros </em>with prejudice\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on his theft charge, which also stemmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>from the taking of the box of flares from the bus. After a recess, the State agreed to either enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>with prejudice or dismiss the case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">According to Gonzales, he was \u201cjust driving around cuz ... there was nothing to do,\u201d when they all decided to drive down the road past the elementary school. After parking on the left-hand side of the building where the school buses were parked, he then testified that the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">Tony got out of the car and just tried to find a way into the bus. We circled the bus around one time to see if there was [sic] any windows open. And then he got through the [passenger] door [of the bus] like I said at the first time. He\u2019d broken in from the inside somehow. I don\u2019t know how he did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">:|; * * \u2756 * :\u00a1\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">[Anthony W.] [g]ot on the bus, started looking around, went up and down the aisle found a fire extinguisher, looked at it for a minute, then apparently brought it back outside the emergency exit in the back of the bus. He bashed out the windows with his foot at the time. And then had opened after he\u2019d broken the glass and then went inside with the fire extinguisher and just squirted all of the inside of it, and then just randomly started bashing out windows. And at the time I was in the driver seat of my car saying what are you doing? Get out. Don\u2019t do that. You know, someone\u2019s gonna come and find out.... I was trying to get him off the bus, telling him not to do that, and he kept doing that. So at the time I was saying this from my car. Then I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>got onto the bus and tried to grab a hold of him. I told him to get off the bus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">Keith was in the ... passenger side ... [n]ext to me. We were both telling him to get off the bus. Get off the bus. And Keith was telling me constantly what is he doing. Tell him to get off the bus. Get him off the bus. We, at the same time, we were just telling him to get off the bus. He wouldn\u2019t listen. So Keith got on the bus and tried to pull him off. He wouldn\u2019t do it so Keith got back off the bus. Then I tried to get him off. He wouldn\u2019t budge. And then I got off the bus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Gonzales admitted that while he and Steers were on the bus he stole the box of flares and that Steers took one from the box.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, respondent moved for dismissal, alleging that the State\u2019s case consisted of the testimony of two accomplices that was not corroborated in any manner. The juvenile court judge denied the motion. The court found that the State\u2019s two witnesses were not accomplices for the purposes of the accomplice corroboration rule. In a written order issued the day of the adjudicatory hearing, the court stated that the State had proven \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that Anthony W. was involved as alleged for the charge of malicious destruction of property. On November 14, 2002, respondent was placed on probation and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $250.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court. <em>In re Anthony W., </em>159 Md.App. 514, 859 A.2d 679 (2004). The majority reasoned that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">they [the three youths] drove to the scene and drove around looking for open windows on a bus, from which one may reasonably infer they intended to enter. Finding no easy access, [Anthony W.] broke the door of a bus and entered. The alleged accomplices voiced no objections until the window breaking ensued. The offense was committed when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>door was broken open; the window breaking was not a separate offense, it was an acceleration of the illegal activity in which all three were engaged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"><em>In re Anthony W., </em>159 Md.App. at 519, 859 A.2d at 682. In conclusion, the Court of Special Appeals stated that, \u201c \u2018as a matter of sound policy,\u2019 the rule requiring corroboration of accomplice testimony applies in juvenile proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Special Appeals then held that Anthony W. was wrongly adjudicated as being involved based on the uncorroborated testimony of two witnesses who were, \u201cin [the court\u2019s] view\u201d both accomplices. Thereafter, we granted <em>certiorari. </em>385 Md. 161, 867 A.2d 1062 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The standard of appellate review that we apply in a juvenile delinquency matter is mandated by Maryland Rule 8-131(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The first question presented to this Court is whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the accomplice corroboration rule applies in juvenile cases. As a pure question of law, the appropriate standard of review is <em>de novo. </em>When the trial court\u2019s decision \u201cinvolves an interpretation and application of Maryland ... case law, [we] must determine whether the [trial court\u2019s] conclusions are legally correct ... \u201d. <em>Nesbit v. Government Employees Insurance Company, </em>382 Md. 65, 72, 854 A.2d 879, 883 (2004). <em>See Helinski v. Harford Mem. Hosp., Inc., </em>376 Md. 606, 614, 831 A.2d 40, 45 (2003) (noting that we must apply the law as we discern it to be); <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 368, 735 A.2d 491, 497 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The second question is whether the intermediate appellate court erred in concluding that the evidence was insufficient to support the juvenile judge\u2019s finding of involvement because there was no corroboration of the testimony of the two alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>accomplices. In the case, <em>In re Timothy F., </em>343 Md. 371, 380, 681 A.2d 501, 505 (1996), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">Appellate review of the [trial] court\u2019s judgment on the evidence is limited to determining whether there is a sufficient evidentiary basis for the court\u2019s underlying factual findings. In a criminal case, the appropriate inquiry is not whether the reviewing court believes that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but rather, whether after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We have applied the same standard of review in juvenile delinquency cases. <em>In re Antoine H., </em>319 Md. 101, 107-108, 570 A.2d 1239, 1242 (1990). Consistently, we have held that the judgment of the trial court will not be disturbed unless the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Timothy, </em>343 Md. at 380, 681 A.2d at 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Whether the accomplice corroboration rule applies to juvenile proceedings is a matter of first impression in this Court. The State relies on <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. 85, 646 A.2d 1012 (1994), as well as the legislative history of the juvenile causes law, to support its assertion that the accomplice corroboration rule, applicable in criminal cases, does not apply in juvenile proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">In 1969, on the recommendation of the Rules Committee, we adopted Md. Rule 912(c), which specified that, \u201c[t]he rules of evidence applicable to criminal cases shall apply to [juvenile] delinquency hearings.\u201d Md. Rule 912(c) (effective July 1, 1969).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The State argues that if the history of the law of juvenile causes was complete as of July 1, 1969, an argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>could be made that the corroboration requirement applies in juvenile proceedings. The language of Md. Rule 912(c), however, no longer exists and its language has not survived. <em>See In re Delric H., </em>150 Md.App. 234, 246, 819 A.2d 1117, 1124 (2003) (\u201cAs a result of the amendment to Chapter 900 of the Maryland Rules, there is no present counterpart to former Rule 912(c), nor has there been since the passage of the Juvenile Causes Act in 1975.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In 1975, Chapter 900 of the Maryland Rules was completely revised. The new evidence rule regarding adjudicatory hearings stated that, \u201c[t]he allegations of a juvenile petition alleging delinquency must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt before a respondent may be adjudged delinquent. An uncorroborated confession made by a child out of court is not sufficient proof of delinquency.\u201d Md. Rule 914(e)(1). In an Order of this Court dated June 5, 1996, effective January 1, 1997, we renumbered this rule. It is currently Md. Rule 11-114 (2005). Language with respect to the proof in a petition alleging delinquency has remained the same throughout the subsequent revisions to Rule 914(e)(1). It is the State\u2019s position that silence on the issue of accomplice testimony compels the conclusion that the rule requiring corroboration was never intended to be applied in juvenile proceedings, and it should not be said to apply now.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The State further argues that the rule requiring the corroboration of accomplice testimony has never been constitutionally compelled, and, therefore, it is not necessary for this Court to adopt the rule to juvenile proceedings as we have done in the adoption of other constitutional procedural safeguards. <em>See In re Thomas </em>J., 372 Md. 50, 811 A.2d 310 (2002) (holding that the right to a speedy trial extends to juvenile delinquency proceedings, as one of \u201cthe essentials of due process and fair treatment\u201d required by <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967)); <em>In re Michael </em>W., 367 Md. 181, 786 A.2d 684 (2001) (extending the double jeopardy prohibition to juvenile proceedings); <em>In re Parris W., </em>363 Md. 717, 770 A.2d 202 (2001) (extending the right to counsel to juvenile proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Respondent adopts the position taken by the Court of the Special Appeals that the accomplice corroboration rule applies to juvenile delinquency proceedings. Respondent also notes the similarities between criminal and juvenile proceedings,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> including the common applicability of the reasonable doubt standard.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, the respondent recognizes that the accomplice corroboration rule is a product of case law promulgated by this Court. While it is true that no Maryland Rule or statute imposes the accomplice corroboration rule to juvenile cases, the respondent asserts that it is equally true that no Maryland Rule or statute imposes such a requirement in adult prosecutions. Furthermore, according to the respondent, the rationale for the accomplice corroboration rule in adult proceedings is to provide evidentiary protection to the accused and to provide such protection is a legitimate concern present in juvenile proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\n<em>The Accomplice Corroboration Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In order to sustain a conviction of an adult based upon the testimony of an accomplice, that testimony must be cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>roborated by some independent evidence. <em>Williams v. State, </em>364 Md. 160, 179, 771 A.2d 1082, 1093 (2001) (\u201cThe longstanding law in Maryland is that a conviction may not rest on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.\u201d); <em>Collins v. State, </em>318 Md. 269, 280, 568 A.2d 1, 6 (1990) (\u201cThe rule in Maryland that a person accused of a crime may not be convicted based on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is well established.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The accomplice corroboration rule was created by this Court in the case of <em>Luery v. State, </em>116 Md. 284, 81 A. 681 (1911), which noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">[T]he undoubted fact is that the experience of the courts, which is certainly much greater than that of juries, is that it is unsafe, at least in the great majority of cases, to rest a conviction upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice .... As the reason for the rule, as adopted by most courts, is that the testimony of an accomplice alone and unsupported is regarded as too doubtful to be safe, the important matter is to have him supported in at least some of the material points involved tending to show the guilt of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\"><em>Luery, </em>116 Md. at 293-94, 81 A. at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The necessity for the rule was later explained and emphasized in <em>Watson v. State, </em>208 Md. 210, 117 A.2d 549 (1955), in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">The reason for the rule requiring the testimony of an accomplice to be corroborated is that it is the testimony of a person admittedly contaminated with guilt, who admits his participation in the crime for which he particularly blames the defendant and it should be regarded with great suspicion and caution, because otherwise the life or liberty of an innocent person might be taken away by a witness who makes the accusation either to gratify his malice or to shield himself from punishment, or in the hope of receiving clemency by turning State\u2019s evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-10\"><em>Watson, </em>208 Md. at 217, 117 A.2d at 552 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">In <em>Brown v. State, </em>281 Md. 241, 378 A.2d 1104 (1977), the defendant appealed a murder conviction contending that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>rested solely on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. On <em>certiorari, </em>the parties addressed whether the longstanding rule that a person accused of a crime may not be convicted on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice should be abandoned. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\u201c[T]he evidence of an accomplice is universally received with caution and weighed and scrutinized with great care.... When such a one has as a motive the prospect of freedom, a milder sentence or the favor of the officers who have him in charge, an innocent one may undoubtedly be made to suffer, if great caution is not used. Hence, it would seem to be safer to require some corroboration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\"><em>Brown, </em>281 Md. at 243-244, 378 A.2d at 1106-1107 (quoting <em>Luery, </em>116 Md. at 292-93, 81 A. at 684). Not much in the way of evidence is required to corroborate the testimony of an accomplice. <em>Brown, </em>281 Md. at 244, 378 A.2d at 1107. This Court saw the need to retain the accomplice corroboration requirement due to the escalating prosecutorial trend to freely utilize accomplices as State witnesses. <em>Brown, </em>281 Md. at 246, 378 A.2d at 1108. In <em>Brown, </em>we also noted that, \u201c[even] those jurisdictions which ... do not require corroboration of an accomplice\u2019s testimony all reflect concern about the reliability of accomplice testimony,\u201d and recognize that the \u201ctestimony should be received with caution and scrutinized with care.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>281 Md. at 245, 378 A.2d at 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\n<em>Juvenile Causes Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\u201cPrior to the beginning of the twentieth century, under the common law view prevalent throughout the country, children above the age of seven were tried as adults,\u201d and they \u201cwere afforded the same legal protections and received the same punishments as adult criminal offenders.\u201d <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. 85, 90, 646 A.2d 1012, 1014 (1994) (citing <em>In re Johnson, </em>254 Md. 517, 521, 255 A.2d 419, 421 (1969), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>403 U.S. 926, 91 S.Ct. 2257, 29 L.Ed.2d 706 (1971)). Following a national trend for reform, due to an acknowledgment of the inherent differences between adults and children, jurisdictions throughout the country began creating separate systems of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>courts that addressed the needs of juvenile offenders. <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. at 90, 646 A.2d at 1014. \u201cIn contrast to the adversarial nature of the adult system ... juvenile proceedings were informal and flexible in nature, psychiatric and psychological assistance was sought, the rules of evidence relaxed, and many proceedings were not open to the public.\u201d <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. at 91, 646 A.2d at 1014 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Over the next century, however, delinquency proceedings began to take on the more rehabilitative and retributive nature of adult criminal proceedings. <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. at 90-91, 646 A.2d at 1014. Whether specific protections provided to adult defendants would also be provided to juveniles was first discussed in depth in 1967 by the United States Supreme Court in <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.E.2d 527 (1967). Because of the increasingly penal overtones of juvenile court systems, <em>Gault </em>held that juvenile proceedings which may lead to commitment in a state institution must measure up to the \u201cessentials of due process and fair treatment.\u201d These essentials include written notice of the charges to the child and parents in advance to allow for preparation, notification of the right to either retained or appointed counsel, awareness of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, and, absent a valid confession, a determination of delinquency and an order of commitment based only on sworn testimony subject to the opportunity for cross-examination in accordance with constitutional requirements. <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.E.2d 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u201cWe have previously noted that juvenile proceedings are civil and not criminal in nature....\u201d <em>In re Thomas J., </em>372 Md. 50, 57, 811 A.2d 310, 314 (2002) (quoting <em>In re Anthony R., </em>362 Md. 51, 69, 763 A.2d 136, 146 (2000)). Nonetheless, we recognize that only a prosecutor can initiate juvenile delinquency proceedings. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 3-8A-10(c)(4)(ii) of the Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Article. The juvenile delinquency proceeding is a prosecution in lieu of criminal proceedings. <em>See In re William A. </em>313 Md. 690, 694, 548 A.2d 130, 132 (1988); <em>see also Lopez-Sanchez v.

In that case we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">The raison d\u2019etre of the Juvenile Causes Act is that a child does not commit a crime when he [or she] commits a delinquent act and therefore is not a criminal.

State, </em>133 Ga.App. 895, 212 S.E.2d 650, 653 (1975) (citing <em>West v. State, </em>232 Ga. 861, 209 S.E.2d 195 (1974); <em>Quaid v. State, </em>132 Ga.App. 478, 208 S.E.2d 336 (1974)).

The Georgia court emphasized Georgia\u2019s statutes requiring, <em>inter alia, </em>proof beyond a reasonable doubt and United States and Georgia Supreme Court decisions extending criminal rights to juveniles. <em>Id. </em>The Georgia court then concluded that a \u201cjuvenile charged with \u2018delinquency\u2019 is entitled by right to have the court apply those common law jurisprudential principles which experience and reason have shown are necessary to give the accused the essence of a fair trial,\u201d including independent corroborative evidence of an accomplice\u2019s testimony. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">In _, <em>A Minor v.

The court opined that, \u201c[ajlthough the Nevada statute by its terms forbids only \u2018convictions\u2019 upon uncorroborated accomplice testimony, this Court has not interpreted this language mechanically.\u201d , <em>A Minor, </em>608 P.2d at 510. In addition, the statute governing juvenile adjudications requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt upon competent, material, and relevant evidence that a child has committed the acts by reason of which he is alleged to be delinquent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The court held that the corrob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>oration requirement should be applied in juvenile proceedings consistent with <em>Breed v. Jones, </em>421 U.S. 519, 95 S.Ct. 1779, 44 L.Ed.2d 346 (1975) (holding that in the interest of fundamental fairness, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, attaches to a juvenile\u2019s adjudicatory hearing). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Although Georgia and Nevada have recognized that applying the accomplice corroboration rule to juvenile proceedings comports with \u201ccommon law jurisprudential principles\u201d and \u201cfundamental fairness,\u201d two jurisdictions have declined to extend the rule. The California Supreme Court held that, although a conviction statutorily requires corroboration of accomplice testimony,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a finding of juvenile delinquency does not constitute a conviction. Therefore, the court held that the statute does not require application of the rule to juvenile proceedings. <em>In re Mitchell P., </em>22 Cal.3d 946, 151 Cal.Rptr. 330, 587 P.2d 1144, 1146 (1978). As a matter of constitutional due process, the court noted that \u201cthe essentials of due process and fair treatment,\u201d as stated in <em>Gault, </em>\u201c[do] not compel the accomplice corroboration rule in either criminal or juvenile proceedings.\u201d <em>In re Mitchell P., </em>151 Cal.Rptr. 330, 587 P.2d at 1147. Consequently, the court was not compelled to extend the rule as a matter of constitutional due process. The court also remarked that, although the accomplice corroboration rule has been codified by the California Legislature to apply to adults in criminal proceedings, equal protection does not require that the rule also apply in juvenile proceedings. <em>In re Mitchell P., </em>151 Cal.Rptr. 330, 587 P.2d at 1148-49. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>court concluded that the disparities between juveniles and adults were reasonably related to the purpose of keeping juvenile proceedings sufficiently informal and distinct from adult criminal proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In <em>Munhall v. State of Arkansas, </em>337 Ark. 41, 986 S.W.2d 863 (1999), the Arkansas Supreme Court agreed with the California court and declined to apply the Arkansas statute <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> requiring corroboration of accomplice testimony to juvenile proceedings. The Arkansas court explained that the clear legislative intent as evidenced by the plain language of the statute limits its applicability to adults. The words \u201cconviction,\u201d \u201cfelony,\u201d and \u201cdefendant\u201d do not apply in juvenile proceedings. <em>Munhall, </em>986 S.W.2d at 864. The court concluded that \u201c[i]f the accomplice-corroboration rule ... is to be extended to juvenile hearings, it must be by legislative enactment.\u201d <em>Munhall, </em>986 S.W.2d at 865. Subsequently, in 2001 the Arkansas legislature amended their statute to reflect that in felony cases the accomplice corroboration rule applies in juvenile proceedings. <em>See </em>Ark.Code Ann., \u00a7 16-89-111(e)(1)(A) (1987, 2003 Supp.) (\u201cA conviction or an adjudication of delinquency cannot be had in any case of felony upon testimony of an accomplice including in juvenile court, unless corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant or the juvenile with the commission of the offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Similar to juvenile court statutes in both Georgia and Nevada, Maryland Rule ll-114(e)(l), which governs adjudicatory hearings in juvenile proceedings, requires that allegations that a juvenile committed a delinquent act be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See also </em>Md.Code (2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-8A-18(c)(l) of the Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art. (stating that before a child is adjudicated delinquent, the standard of proof lor allegations in the petition that the child has committed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>delinquent act must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt). The right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt has been held to apply to both adults and juveniles by the United States Supreme Court. <em>See In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1075, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970) (\u201c[T]he constitutional safeguard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is as much required during the adjudicatory stage of a delinquency proceeding as are those constitutional safeguards applied in <em>Gault,\u201d </em>such as the right to counsel and the privilege against self-incrimination.).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Because the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in juvenile cases is the same standard applied in adult criminal cases, the same concerns regarding the potentially untrustworthy nature of an accomplice\u2019s testimony in adult criminal proceedings, as noted in <em>Watson, </em>are also present in juvenile cases. In the present case, the Court of Special Appeals pointed out that, \u201ca juvenile faced with the possibility of removal from his home and placement in some state facility for rehabilitation or treatment is no less entitled to the benefit of the accomplice-corroboration rule than an adult faced with possible incarceration for committing an identical offense. That analogy supports the concept of fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>In re Anthony </em>W., 159 Md.App. 514, 524, 859 A.2d 679, 685 (2004). And as the respondent notes in his brief, the interest of trustworthy evidence applies with equal force regardless of the age of the person accused. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The State relies on the case of <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. 85, 646 A.2d 1012 (1994), in which we addressed the question of whether the Criminal Rules of Procedure, under Title 4 of the Maryland Rules, apply to an adjudicatory proceeding in a juvenile case. The respondent in that case argued that the rules of Title 4 are applicable to juvenile proceedings when there is no guidance within the juvenile rules themselves. <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. at 89-90, 646 A.2d at 1014. After considering \u201cthe pertinent procedural rules in light of the history and underlying policies of the juvenile court,\u201d we held that juvenile delinquency proceedings are governed <em>exclusively </em>by Chapter 900 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>criminal rules under Title 4 do not apply to juvenile proceedings. <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. at 90, 646 A.2d at 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Although Chapter 900 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure exclusively governs juvenile delinquency proceedings, it is also within our authority to develop or extend common law rules. As stated in <em>In re Victor B., </em>\u201c[j]uvenile proceedings are governed by a separate, pervasive scheme of specific statutes and rales developed by the Maryland General Assembly and the Court of Appeals.\u201d <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. at 96, 646 A.2d at 1017. Pursuant to this authority and in the interest of fundamental fairness, we extend the rule requiring accomplice corroboration to juvenile proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Having concluded that the accomplice corroboration rule applies in juvenile proceedings, we consider the question of whether the rule applies in this case. The juvenile court concluded that Steers and Gonzales were not accomplices, and, therefore, their testimony did not require independent corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The juvenile court\u2019s analysis was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">[It had been argued that] fundamentally ... an individual cannot be convicted on the basis of uncorroborated accomplice testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-10\">The fact that they drove the Respondent away, I don\u2019t believe makes anyone accomplices or accessories under any form of analysis because there was not, at least on the evidence I have, whatever we might assume, there\u2019s not evidence that the intent was to conceal the act or the perpetrator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-11\">I think Jose Gonzales testified rather sincerely that they pulled into the school parking lot and that while they were there, when they were in the parking lot, the Respondent, Tony W., got out of the car, broke into the bus, and started <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>to break out windows and sprayed the fire extinguisher. At some point after he started that, both Gonzales and Steers got onto the bus. To one extent or another, how vehemently and how sincerely they, they told him it was time to get, to stop it. Or not whether to stop it or not, but to leave. And I accept that when they got off they committed these thefts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">It seems to me that this misdemeanor destruction of property began with the Respondent [Anthony W.] alone on the school bus. The fact that Gonzales and Steers at some point in this continuum may have committed independent crimes, misdemeanors, does not make them accomplices to this in the sense of the word for purposes of the evidentiary rule. For that reason I\u2019m .. . going to find that Tony is involved as to [the] charge of malicious destruction of property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u201cTo be an accomplice a person must participate in the commission of a crime knowingly, voluntarily, and with common criminal intent with the principal offender, or must in some way advocate or encourage the commission of the crime.\u201d <em>State v. Raines, </em>326 Md. 582, 597, 606 A.2d 265, 272 (1992) (quoting <em>Watson v. State, </em>208 Md. 210, 219, 117 A.2d 549, 553 (1955); <em>State v. Foster, </em>263 Md. 388, 393, 283 A.2d 411, 413 (1971)). The act for which the respondent was adjudged, malicious destruction of property, is a misdemeanor. As such, all accessories are chargeable as principals. <em>Roddy v. Finnegan, </em>43 Md. 490, 503-504 (1876); <em>Seward v. State, </em>208 Md. 341, 346, 118 A.2d 505, 507 (1955); <em>Watson v. State, </em>208 Md. 210, 217, 117 A.2d 549, 552 (1955). \u201cThe test commonly applied as to whether a witness is an accomplice is whether he himself could have been indicted and punished for the offense, either as a principal or as an accessory.\u201d <em>Harriday v. State, </em>228 Md. 593, 596, 182 A.2d 40, 42 (1962) (citing <em>Coleman v. State, </em>209 Md. 379, 386, 121 A.2d 254, 257 (1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In <em>Coleman, </em>the defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to convict him because he was convicted solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>as the result of the uncorroborated testimony of a witness he considered to be an accomplice. During the alleged accomplice\u2019s testimony, she stated that she knew nothing about the intent of the defendant to steal property, and there was no evidence that she served in the participatory role as a lookout. <em>Coleman, </em>209 Md. at 387, 121 A.2d at 258. We stated, \u201c[t]his case was tried by the trial judge without a jury. This Court should not reverse a judgment of conviction in a nonjury case unless it finds that the trial court\u2019s conclusion was clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held in that case that the trial judge was not clearly erroneous in finding that the witness was not an accomplice to the crime for which the defendant was convicted because there was evidence that the alleged accomplice sat outside in a truck while the breaking and entry occurred and that she had no knowledge that a crime was planned. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In <em>Seward, </em>the defendant was convicted of malicious destruction of property for destroying a water tower and screen door with a bomb while associating with a group of boys. The defendant appealed based on the trial judge\u2019s finding that the defendant encouraged the commission of the crime and was therefore chargeable as a principal to the delinquent act. <em>Seward, </em>208 Md. at 346, 118 A.2d at 506-507. Again, this Court stated that a judgment of conviction in a nonjury case should not be reversed unless the trial court\u2019s conclusion was clearly erroneous. <em>Seward, </em>208 Md. at 346, 118 A.2d at 506-507. The defendant admitted to the police that all of the participants in the act discussed setting off the bomb, that he knew who was making the bomb, and who was setting it off. <em>Seward, </em>208 Md. at 349, 118 A.2d at 508. Knowing that the placing of the bomb was contemplated, the defendant continued association with the group of boys and arrived at the locations with the intention of detonating a bomb and watching it explode. <em>Seward, </em>208 Md. at 349-350, 118 A.2d at 508. We there concluded that, from the evidence or from proper inference from the evidence, the trial judge was not clearly wrong in finding that the appellant in some way encouraged the commission of the crime and was therefore an accomplice. <em>Seward, </em>208 Md. at 350, 118 A.2d at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>In <em>Watson, </em>the defendant was convicted for the murder of a baby. The defendant claimed that one of the witnesses was an accomplice and that he could not be convicted based on the witness\u2019s uncorroborated testimony. <em>Watson, </em>208 Md. at 216-217, 117 A.2d at 552. There was no evidence that the witness knew that the defendant intended to kill the child until he got the tub of water and put the child in it. <em>Watson, </em>208 Md. at 219, 117 A.2d at 553. There was no evidence that she aided or abetted the crime or encouraged it. <em>Id. </em>In holding that she was not an accomplice we stated: \u201cTo be an accomplice a person must participate in the commission of the crime ... with common criminal intent with the principal offender, or must in some way advocate or encourage the commission of the crime.\u201d <em>Watson, </em>208 Md. at 219, 117 A.2d at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Returning to the present case, the Court of Special Appeals held that Anthony W., Steers, and Gonzales were all participants in the misdemeanor offenses of malicious destruction of the bus and the theft of the property inside. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqk\">Finding no easy access, [respondent] broke the door of a bus and entered. The alleged accomplices voiced no objection until the window breaking ensued. The offense was committed when the door was broken open; the window breaking was not a separate offense, it was an acceleration of the illegal activity in which all three engaged. We know of no authority for defining and accomplice based on who did what after an illegal entry is gained. The objective was to enter the bus by whatever means was required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\"><em>In re Anthony W., </em>159 Md.App. 514, 519-520, 859 A.2d 679, 682 (2004). Due to this finding and the requirement that the accomplice corroboration rule applies to juvenile delinquency proceedings, the Court of Special Appeals held that Steers\u2019s and Gonzales\u2019s testimony needed independent corroboration, thereby reversing the judgment of the juvenile court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>In re Anthony W., </em>159 Md.App. at 519, 859 A.2d at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>The question of whether the Circuit Court, sitting as a juvenile court, properly found that the two witnesses were not accomplices, is a mixed question of law and fact.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">If there is no conflict in the evidence as to a witness\u2019s participation in a crime, or where his participation is conceded, the question whether the witness is an accomplice is one of law for the trial judge to determine.

State, </em>58 Md.App. 626, 635, 473 A.2d 1329, 1333 (1984), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>311 Md. 147, 533 A.2d 271 (1987). <em>See also, </em>Maryland Rule 8-131(c). \u201cThis Court determines whether there was any evidence, or proper inference from the evidence, upon which the trial court could find the defendant guilty. If the record shows such evidence or proper inference, the Court of Appeals cannot find that the decision of the trial court was clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Seward, </em>208 Md. at 346, 118 A.2d at 507 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The burden of proving that Steers and Gonzales were accomplices rested on the respondent. \u201c[The courts] have consistently recognized as the rule that the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a witness is an accomplice is on the defendant asserting it. They have applied it, and we have not repudiated it.... We deem it to be the rule in this State.\u201d <em>Bennett v. State, </em>283 Md. 619, 623, 392 A.2d 76, 78 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Respondent contends that, as a matter of law, Steers and Gonzales were accomplices whose testimony required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>independent corroborative evidence. Where the trial judge has ruled that the witness is an accomplice as a matter of law, for the appellate court to reverse that decision, the proof must be so clear and decisive that reasonable minds could not differ in coming to the same conclusion. <em>Burroughs v. State, </em>88 Md.App. 229, 240, 594 A.2d 625, 630 (1991). <em>See also, Bishop v.

While we may agree with the Court of Special Appeals that there was sufficient evidence to determine that Steers and Gonzales were, in fact, accomplices to the delinquent act charged, the evidence does not demand or require that an appellate court make such a finding. In addition, \u201c[w]e have held repeatedly that when evidence relating to whether a witness is an accomplice is capable of being determined either way and justifies different inferences in respect thereto, the question is for the determination of the trier of fact....\u201d <em>State v. Foster, </em>263 Md. 388, 393-394, 283 A.2d 411, 413-414 (1971) (citing, with approval, the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Foster v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 40, 46, 272 A.2d 810, 813 (1971)). Therefore, the clearly erroneous standard of review is appropriate for this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The rationale behind the clearly erroneous standard is settled. The trial judge is physically present during the testimony and is able to observe matters not usually reflected in a cold record, such as the demeanor and credibility of witnesses. \u201cThat is to say, the judge has his finger on the pulse of the trial.\u201d <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 278, 604 A.2d 489, 493 (1992). In <em>$3,417.46 U.S. Money v.

Doolan, </em>283 Md. 579, 581, 391 A.2d 840, 841 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Despite the Court of Specials Appeals\u2019s finding that Anthony W.\u2019s window breaking was \u201can acceleration of the illegal activity in which all three engaged,\u201d we held in <em>Coleman </em>that, \u201cthe term \u2018accomplice\u2019 does not include a person who has guilty knowledge, or is morally delinquent, or who was even an admitted participant in a related but distinct offense.\u201d <em>Coleman, </em>209 Md. at 385, 121 A.2d at 257 (quoting 2 Wharton, Criminal Evidence, 229, \u00a7 448 et seq. (12th Ed.)). In the present case, Steers and Gonzales admittedly participated in the taking of a box of flares from the bus. This act, however, is a separate and distinct offense from the malicious destruction of property. Likewise, assuming, for the sake of argument, that the property was posted against trespassers,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> all parties here participated in that crime by entering the property and boarding the bus. Trespass, however, like the crime of theft is a separate and distinct offense. In addition, there is no evidence in the record that the alleged accomplices knew that the respondent intended to break the door of the bus and damage the interior of the bus. The court was not required to conclude from the evidence of their presence at the scene of the crime or their participation in distinct crimes that the alleged accomplices aided or encouraged the damage to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>bus. As the juvenile court judge found, \u201cthe fact that Gonzales and Steers at some point in this continuum may have committed independent crimes ... does not make them accomplices to [the malicious destruction of property] in the sense of the word for purposes of the evidentiary rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Analyzing the evidence and testimony in the record, a rational trier of fact could have found that Steers and Gonzales were not accomplices.
