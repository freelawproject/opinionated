Danner was injured in Baltimore City while performing carpentry services at the behest of his employer, Timothy Stivers (\u201cStivers\u201d). Danner lost the use of his left hand and was unable to work. He filed for workers\u2019 compensation benefits with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">On 14 June 2002 the Commission ordered Stivers to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Danner. Stivers, who did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance, did not make the advanced payments. Accordingly, Danner requested payment from the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund (\u201cthe Fund\u201d), initially in a letter dated 17 July 2002 and thereafter in letters dated 23 August 2002 and 25 September 2002. The Fund refused to pay Danner. Danner petitioned the Commission for relief and it ordered the Fund to pay, in addition to the earlier ordered benefits, a 40% penalty on all monies due Danner and a $500 attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The Fund sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The Circuit Court granted Danner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the Fund\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The Fund appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court, although holding that the Fund had an obligation to pay compensation to Danner pursuant to the Commission\u2019s 14 June 2002 order, reversed on the penalty and attorney\u2019s fee awards because it believed the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act did not permit the imposition of such sanctions against the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The Fund petitioned this Court to issue a writ of certiorari to consider the order to pay compensation to Danner. Danner petitioned us regarding the intermediate appellate court\u2019s reversal of the award of the penalty and attorney\u2019s fee. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>granted both petitions, 384 Md. 448, 863 A.2d 997 (2004), to consider the following questions, which we reword for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">I. Whether the Commission erred by ordering the UEF to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits when the Fund had no duty to pay the award while the issue of the possible statutory employer was awaiting resolution by the Commission and the ultimate rejection of that issue was before the Circuit Court in the judicial review action;[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">II. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred by reversing the judgment imposing penalties and attorney\u2019s fee for failure to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Danner upon default in payment by an uninsured employer under the 14 June 2002 award?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">We shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals regarding the Fund\u2019s obligation to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits and the penalty to Danner, but shall reverse with regard to the attorney\u2019s fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">On 16 February 2001, Danner was working as a carpenter on the 2nd floor of the Wentworth Building on 300 Cathedral Street in Baltimore. His employer was Timothy Stivers, who had no workers\u2019 compensation insurance at the time. One of Danner\u2019s responsibilities while performing wood and trim work was to operate a band saw. He lacerated his left arm when his sweatshirt sleeve became ensnared in the saw blade, pulling his left arm into the blade. As a result, Danner lost substantial use of that arm and hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Danner filed with the Commission a timely claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. On 6 June 2002,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>hearing on Danner\u2019s claim was attended by Danner and the Fund.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a 14 June 2002 order, the Commission awarded compensation benefits to Danner, deciding, among other things, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\">1. Danner sustained an accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment on 16 February 2001;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">2. Danner\u2019s disability resulted from that accidental personal injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">3. Danner be paid temporary total disability at the rate of $400.00, payable weekly beginning 16 February 2001 and continuing as long as the claimant remains temporarily totally disabled;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">4. the correct name of the employer to be Timothy Stivers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">5. Timothy Stivers was uninsured at the time of the accidental injury....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">The Commission, at the request of the Fund,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> deferred a decision on an issue raised by the Fund as to whether an entity identified as \u201cNWJ\u201d was Danner\u2019s statutory employer pursuant to \u00a7 9-508 of the Labor and Employment Article of the Maryland Code. (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Neither the Fund nor Stivers sought immediate judicial review of the Commission\u2019s 14 June 2002 Award of Compensation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Danner promptly sent Stivers a copy of the award and demanded payment. Nonetheless, Stivers did not pay the award. On 17 July 2002, Danner notified the Fund of Stivers\u2019s non-payment and requested payment from the Fund. The Fund refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">On 13 September 2002 the Commission decided that NWJ was not Danner\u2019s statutory employer. On the same day, the Fund filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for judicial review regarding the Commission\u2019s decision as to NWJ\u2019s status.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Fund did not seek in that action review of the 14 June 2002 award of benefits to Danner.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Contemporaneous with the filing of the Fund\u2019s initial judicial review petition, Danner filed a complaint with the Commission that the order to pay him workers\u2019 compensation benefits remained unfulfilled. On 26 November 2002 the Commission held a hearing to determine whether Danner was entitled to sanctions against the Fund for its failure to pay the compensation benefits as ordered. On 11 December 2002, the Commission found as follows, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">The Commission finds on the issue presented that the answer is \u201cYES\u201d; and finds that the Fund shall pay unto Frederick W. Miller, Esquire, counsel for [Danner], a counsel fee in the amount of $500.00; and shall pay unto the claimant a 40% penalty on all moneys due the claimant beginning February 16, 2001 and ending November 12, 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The Fund sought judicial review on the record in the Circuit Court of the sanctions order. After oral argument, the court granted Danner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>the Fund\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. The Circuit Court directed the Fund to pay Danner the benefits that he was awarded on 14 June 2002 and left undisturbed the Commission\u2019s order for payment of the penalty and attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">On 14 August 2003, the Fund appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. It alleged first that workers\u2019 compensation benefits were not owed by the Fund to Danner because the Fund\u2019s legal obligation to pay under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act had not been triggered. Second, the Fund alleged that it could not be ordered, as a matter of law, to pay a penalty or an attorney\u2019s fee. As to the first contention, the intermediate appellate court answered that the pendency following the Commission\u2019s 14 June order of the question of whether NWJ was Danner\u2019s statutory employer did not operate to defer the Fund\u2019s legal obligation to pay the unappealed 14 June 2002 compensation award following Stivers\u2019s failure to pay. <em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Danner, </em>158 Md.App. 502, 514, 857 A.2d 615, 622 (2004). To the second point, the Court of Special Appeals found that the penalty and attorney\u2019s fee were not authorized by law to be imposed against the Fund. <em>Id. </em>at 515, 518, 857 A.2d at 623, 624-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The issues framed by the parties in this case are solely legal ones. We must decide: (a) whether the Fund\u2019s obligation to pay a claimant when the employer is in default is suspended by operation of \u00a7 9-1002; (b) whether, as a matter of law, a penalty may be assessed against the Fund; and, (c) whether, as a matter of law, an attorney\u2019s fee may be assessed against the Fund. Because this case was decided in the Circuit Court by the grant of summary judgment where cross-motions were filed, our appellate review begins with the question of whether the Circuit Court, in reviewing the Commission\u2019s decision, properly determined that there was no genuine dispute as to a material fact. Richard P. Gilbert &amp; Robert L. Humphreys, Jr., <em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook </em>\u00a7 17.7 at 348 (2d ed.1993). We then review the resultant questions of law de novo. Md. Rule 2-501(a); <em>John</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number><em>son v. Mayor of Balt.

Howard County, </em>337 Md. 248, 254, 653 A.2d 425, 427 (1995). The primary source from which to determine legislative intent is the plain meaning of the statutory language. <em>Pelican Nat. Bank v. Provident Bank of Maryland, </em>381 Md. 327, 336, 849 A.2d 475, 480 (2004). \u201cWhen the plain meaning is clear and unambiguous, and consistent with both the broad purposes of the legislation and the specific purpose of the provision being interpreted, our inquiry ordinarily is at an end.\u201d <em>Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 653, 705 A.2d 1128, 1131 (1998). If, after considering the plain language in its ordinary and common sense meaning, two or more equally plausible interpretations arise, however, then the general purpose, legislative history, and language of the act as a whole is examined in an effort to clarify the ambiguity. <em>Haupt v. State, </em>340 Md. 462, 471, 667 A.2d 179, 183 (1995). We will \u201cneither add nor delete words in order to give the statute a meaning.... \u201d <em>Harris v. Bd. of Educ. of Howard County, </em>375 Md. 21, 31, 825 A.2d 365, 371 (2003) (citations omitted). Because this case involves the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, we also endeavor to interpret its provisions liberally, where possible, in order to effectuate the broad remedial purpose of the statutory scheme. \u00a7 9-102; <em>Bowen v. Smith, </em>342 Md. 449, 454, 677 A.2d 81, 84 (1996) (citing <em>Para v. Richards Group of Wash. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>339 Md. 241, 251, 661 A.2d 737, 742 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The Fund generally exists as a source of last resort in Maryland to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits to a claimant and protect that claimant from an uninsured employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>er who refuses to pay a workers\u2019 compensation award. Gilbert &amp; Humphreys, Jr., <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 2.2-4 at 24; <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Comm\u2019n v. Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Guar.

Laws, Chap. 152, \u00a7 86 (stating the purpose of the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Fund primarily receives its funds from assessments collected under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. It also receives interest and investment income derived from those funds. \u00a7 10-314.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The General Assembly intended generally to maintain a balance within the Fund of between $3,000,000 and $5,000,000 by directing the Director of the Fund to suspend collection of assessments against employers and insurers when the Fund\u2019s balance equals $5,000,000 and commence collection of the assessments when the balance is less than, or approaches within a three month projection, $3,000,000.00. \u00a7 9-1011(a) &amp; (b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When the Commission grants an award against an uninsured employer, it assesses a penalty against that employer to be paid to the Fund.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u00a7 9-1005. The Fund also is subrogated to the rights of claimants and uninsured employers in order to assist it in recouping moneys disbursed by the Fund to claimants where a third party ultimately is determined to be hable for those payments. \u00a7\u00a7 9-1003-9-1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>The Fund\u2019s obligation to pay workers arises not from an award of compensation by the Commission, but from \u00a7 9-1002 of the Labor and Employment Article. There are procedural steps within that statute necessary to be accomplished in order to trigger the Fund\u2019s obligation to pay. The statute states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-4\">\u00a7 9-1002 \u2014 Payment from the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 An award is payable out of the Fund in accordance with this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">(b) <em>Default. </em>\u2014 Unless an application for review has been timely filed under subsection (g) of this section or a notice of appeal timely served,[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] an employer is in default on a claim by a covered employee or the dependents of a covered employee if the employer fails to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">(3) pay compensation in accordance with an award within 30 days after the date of the award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-10\">(d) <em>Payment; notice of objection. </em>\u2014 (1) On receipt of a notice of default, an employer promptly shall pay the award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-11\">(2) To object to an award, the employer, within 30 days after receipt of the notice of default, shall notify the Commission of the reasons why the employer objects to the award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-12\">(3) The notice of objection by the employer to the Commission selves as an application for review under subsection (g) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-13\">(e) <em>Application for payment from Fund. </em>\u2014 If the employer does not pay the award and does not notify the Commission of its objection to the award in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, the covered employee or the dependents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>of the covered employee may apply to the Director for payment from the Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\">(f) <em>Payment or application for review. </em>\u2014 On receipt of an application for payment, the Fund may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">(1) pay the award; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">(2) apply for review under subsection (g) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">(g) <em>Procedure; review.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">(1) The provisions of Subtitle 7 of this title about procedure and the right to appeal apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">(i) a covered employee or the dependents of a covered</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">employee who file a claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-11\">(ii) the uninsured employer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-12\">(iii) the Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-13\">(2) The right of review of the Fund includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-14\">(i) raising issues;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-15\">(ii) discovery; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-16\">(iii) a hearing before the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-17\">The Fund contends that \u00a7 9-1002(b), read with \u00a7 9-1002(g), operated to stay the Fund\u2019s obligation to pay compensation to Danner pursuant to the 14 June 2002 order because an application for review and a subsequent appeal were timely served by the Fund regarding the reserved issue of whether NWJ was the statutory employer of Danner. Under those circumstances, the Fund argues, the \u201cemployer\u201d cannot be \u201cin default,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 9-1002(b), for two reasons. First, had NWJ been adjudicated to be a statutory employer, that decision would have placed NWJ in the shoes of Danner\u2019s actual employer, Stivers. Because a demand for payment of benefits was not made to NWJ, the thirty day time period for default by the employer could not have run.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On a second, more procedural tack, the mere fact that the Commission had not adjudicated NWJ\u2019s status (and the Fund ultimately ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>pealed the adverse determination) precluded the Fund\u2019s obligation from arising.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Danner counters that Stivers was in default because he refused to make payment within thirty days following receipt of notice of the 14 June 2002 award of temporary total disability (TTD) benefits, a final order. That award was not contested on appeal, rendering \u00a7 9-1002(g) inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Section 9-1002(b) states there is no \u201cdefault\u201d by an employer if there is a timely application for review to the Commission or a notice of timely appeal served.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This provision does not operate regarding Danner\u2019s TTD award, however, in the manner the Fund contends. Although including the descriptive term \u201ctemporary,\u201d a temporary total disability benefits award describes the quantity of time the claimant is deemed totally disabled and entitled to receive benefits, not whether the award is an interlocutory order. <em>Great Am. Ins. Co. v. Havenner, </em>33 Md.App. 326, 331, 364 A.2d 95, 98 (1976); \u00a7\u00a7 9-618-622. The award of TTD benefits was a final, appealable order because it finally adjudicated Danner\u2019s legal right to TTD benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 332, 364 A.2d at 99; <em>see Montgomery County v. Ward, </em>331 Md. 521, 528-29, 629 A.2d 619, 623 (1993) (holding that action of administrative agency is final if \u201cit determines or concludes the rights of the parties ...\u201d.) (quoting <em>Md. Comm\u2019n on Human Rel. v. Balt. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>296 Md. 46, 56, 459 A.2d 205, 211 (1983)); <em>see Paolino v. McCormick &amp; Co., </em>314 Md. 575, 583, 552 A.2d 868, 871-72 (1989) (holding order denying TTD benefits finally adjudicated claimant\u2019s potential legal rights was final and appealable). Neither Stivers nor the Fund appealed this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The Fund argues that it could not have appealed the 14 June 2002 order because it was not ordered thereby to pay compensation. The Fund, however, may appeal an order by the Commission if it is aggrieved by that order. The Fund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>is aggrieved when the claimant satisfies its obligation of application to the Fund under \u00a7 9-1002(e) and makes demand for payment. That occurred in this case when Danner\u2019s counsel sent the Fund a letter, dated 17 July 2002.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Neither Stivers nor the Fund timely raised any issue concerning the legitimacy or amount of that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The Fund claims, however, that the deferred administrative adjudication of the issue of whether NWJ was Danner\u2019s statutory employer foreclosed the occurrence of a default under \u00a7 9 \u2014 1002(b) because it believes that NWJ, as an alleged statutory employer, also should be considered an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 9-1002(b). In <em>Para v. Richards Group of Wash. Ltd. P\u2019Ship, </em>339 Md. 241, 252, 661 A.2d 737, 743 (1995), we explained that the statutory employer provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_-\">the protection of the injured worker who might otherwise receive no compensation for work-related injuries if the workers\u2019 immediate employer had not obtained workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>compensation coverage and had little resources to pay damages in a personal injury action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Those provisions permitted the principal contractor to be considered as \u201can employer\u201d of the subcontractors\u2019 workers. <em>Id. </em>at 253, 661 A.2d at 743-44. The Fund\u2019s view would embrace the term \u201cstatutory employer\u201d within the meaning of \u201cemployer\u201d in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The Fund\u2019s view may not be reconciled with the language of the statute or the undisputed facts of the present case. Danner had an employer, Stivers, regardless of the resolution of NWJ\u2019s status. Although the issue of whether a statutoiy employer existed, if resolved affirmatively, could relieve the Fund ultimately from the obligation to continue to pay the compensation order, Danner\u2019s \u201cemployer\u201d at the time of the award was Stivers. Moreover, the potentiality for NWJ to be found to be Danner\u2019s statutory employer should not provide the basis for the Fund to avoid, delay, or defer its obligation to pay because the Fund is entitled to full subrogation rights should it pay benefits to a claimant and later gain the right to recover the payment of those benefits from a statutory employer.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Hence, the Fund subsequently could recover from NWJ, if, as, and when the latter was determined to be liable, for any payments the Fund made previously to Danner as the result of the 14 June 2002 Commission order. Given that both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the uninsured employer and the Fund presumably are better able to bear the cost of deferred adjudication of collateral issues than the injured worker who has been found to be entitled to relief, the adverse effects of an unpaid compensation award upon the injured worker are far greater than those of a compensation award paid contingently by the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The Fund further contends that a prior codification of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act supports the alleged stay of its duty to make compensation payments where there is an outstanding issue. Former \u00a7\u00a790 and 95 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u00a7 90.

Laws, Chap. 8) (emphasis added). The Revisor\u2019s Note to the 1991 Volume of \u00a7 9-1002 provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">This section is new language derived without substantive change from former Art. 101, \u00a7 90(a) through (c) and \u00a7 95 ... [and] the former phrase \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of this article,\u201d is deleted as surplusage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">These sections are not different in substance from the provisions in the current \u00a7 9-1002. Neither former section addresses whether an outstanding issue not affecting directly the validity of the underlying compensation award would suspend the Fund\u2019s obligation otherwise to pay the award. Rather, we conclude that the previous codification supports our determination here that only the raising of issues directly related to the validity of the Commission order establishing the award of compensation, and any subsequent timely appeal of the relevant administrative adjudication of these issues, are the intended statutory triggers for deferring the Fund\u2019s obligation to pay. We found no language or legislative history to support the Fund\u2019s assertion that it had no obligation to pay Danner because of the pendency of a reserved issue collateral to the award of compensation. Our construction effectuates the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u2019s purpose of protecting the covered injured workers and providing timely relief to the injured employees. <em>Lutter, </em>342 Md. at 345, 676 A.2d at 56 (stating \u201cthe legislature\u2019s purpose in creating the Fund was to protect injured workers whose employers failed, either willfully or negligently, to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance for them.\u201d). To interpret the statute otherwise would allow a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>myriad of indirect and collateral issues to impede the injured worker from timely receipt of needed compensation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">On 26 November 2002 the Commission held a hearing regarding whether sanctions for non-payment of benefits to Danner should be assessed against the Fund. On 11 December 2002, the Commission ordered the Fund to pay to Danner a 40% penalty on the amount of benefits due Danner between 16 February 2001 and 12 November 2002. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals, however, and hold that there is no statutory authority for the Commission to assess a penalty against the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Danner contends that because the Fund failed to pay an award within 30 days, without good cause, it was liable for penalties under \u00a7 9-728. Our analysis of this question begins and ends with the imbedded issue of whether the Commission may assess penalties against the Fund as an employer or insurer.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Section 9-728 (b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\"><em>Within 30 days. </em>\u2014 If the Commission finds that an <em>employer or its insurer </em>has failed, without good cause, to begin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>paying an award within 30 days after the later of the date that the award is issued or the date that payment of the award is due, the Commission shall assess against the <em>employer or its insurer </em>a fine not exceeding 40% of the amount of the payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Penalties may not be assessed against the Fund because it is not an enumerated party liable for penalties within the terms of \u00a7 9-728. The statute unambiguously states who may be held liable for penalties \u2014 1) employers <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and 2) insurers. The Fund is neither. Although Subtitle 7 leaves the term \u201cinsurer\u201d undefined, we read Subtitle 7 in harmony with the remainder of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act scheme. An \u201cauthorized insurer\u201d is defined as: \u201ca stock corporation or mutual association that is authorized under the Insurance Article to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance in the State.\u201d \u00a7 9-401(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Similarly, in Subtitle 3, an \u201cinsurer\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">(i) a stock corporation or mutual association that is authorized under the Insurance Article to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance in the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">(ii) the Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">(iii) a governmental self-insurance group that meets the requirements of \u00a7 9-404 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\">(iv) a self-insurance group of private employers that meets the requirements of Title 25, Subtitle 3 of the Insurance Article; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-11\">(v) an individual employer that self-insures in accordance with \u00a7 9-405 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">Section 9 \u2014 316(a)(3). The Fund does not fall within any of these definitions. Rather, the Fund is a state entity established under Title 10, Subtitle 3 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. It does not operate for profit, as would a corporation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>a mutual association. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10-314-10-320 (governing operational aspects of the Fund). The definition of \u201cinsurer\u201d under \u00a7 9-316 does not include the Fund, but specifically includes the Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund, also established under Title 10 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. When both the Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund and the Fund are established under the same title and legislative scheme, but the General Assembly distinguishes between them by including one, but not the other in \u00a7 9-316, the exclusion lends support to the construction that the Legislature did not intend to make the Fund liable potentially for penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In its 11 December 2002 order, the Commission awarded Danner a $500 attorney\u2019s fee for his effort to bring to heel the Fund\u2019s recalcitrance in not paying the TTD award. The order purportedly applied \u00a7 9-734, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">If the Commission finds that a person has brought a proceeding under this title without any reasonable ground, the Commission shall assess against the person the whole cost of the proceeding, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">We disagree with the Court of Special Appeals, concluding instead that the Commission\u2019s authority to make such an award is supported by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The threshold that must be crossed initially is whether the Fund\u2019s conduct was reasonable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In <em>Stevens v. Rite-Aid, Corporation, </em>340 Md. 555, 557, 667 A.2d 642, 643 (1995), we explored the statutory language of \u00a7 9-734 while determining Stevens\u2019 alleged right to \u201creopen\u201d her claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>pursuant to \u00a7 9-736 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. We explained that \u00a7 9-734 was codified originally as \u00a7 57 of Article 101 of the Maryland Code and that the re-codification of Article 101 into Title IX of the Labor and Employment Article was \u201cnot intended to have substantive effect\u201d on the new codification. <em>Id. </em>at 561-63, 667 A.2d at 645-46; <em>see </em>Gilbert &amp; Humphreys, Jr., <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 2.3 at 34. An attorney\u2019s fee awarded pursuant to \u00a7 9-734 is a sanction against the conduct of a party acting without reasonable ground. <em>Stevens, </em>340 Md. at 564, 667 A.2d at 646. Although \u00a7 9-734 is titled as \u201cFrivolous Proceedings,\u201d it is clear from the intent of the re-codification that the title is merely to distinguish the sanction portion of an award of an attorney\u2019s fee in \u00a7 57 from the general provision permitting the award of an attorney\u2019s fee found in \u00a7 9-731. We need not decide whether the Fund acted frivolously in order to affirm the award of the attorney\u2019s fee under \u00a7 9-734.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">It is clear from the transcript of the 26 November 2002 hearing that the Commission held that the Fund did not have any reasonable ground for withholding payment to Danner of the 14 June 2002 award. The Commission refused to accept the Fund\u2019s assertion that a hearing on 13 September 2002 regarding the status of NWJ and the subsequent appeal of the resultant adverse order was a timely or legitimate attempt to postpone the Fund\u2019s obligation to pay in the face of Danner\u2019s demand letter of 17 July 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Danner argues that the Fund acted unreasonably in refusing to pay him the benefits the Commission had awarded. The Fund argues that it did not pay Danner merely because it reasonably interpreted \u00a7 9-1002 to operate to abate its obligation to pay Danner. It proffered to the Commissioner that its ongoing contention as to NWJ and its appeal regarding the Commission\u2019s resolution of NWJ\u2019s status was a reasonable ground for it to believe it had no obligation to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In this case, the Circuit Court rejected the contention (and agreed with the Commission) that the Fund had no reasonable grounds for proceeding with a lengthy administrative chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>lenge and later an appeal of a collateral issue as a basis for not paying Danner\u2019s TTD award. The Fund did not meet its burden before the Commission to demonstrate that it had an actual, reasonable ground to decline or defer payment of Danner\u2019s award. The Circuit Court, in rejecting the Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment, left the Commission\u2019s order for a $500 attorney\u2019s fee intact. We shall not re-weigh facts considered before the Commission. We have stated often that provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cshould be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes. Any uncertainty in the law should be resolved in favor of the claimant.\u201d <em>E.g., Gleneagles, </em>385 Md. at 496, 869 A.2d at 855; <em>Harris, </em>375 Md. at 57, 825 A.2d at 387; <em>Mayor of Balt. City v. Cassidy, </em>338 Md. 88, 97, 656 A.2d 757, 761-62 (1995). Both the public policy concerning the plight of the unpaid (and potentially unable to work) claimant and the statutory language of the Act support the timely payment of benefit awards. The Fund\u2019s statutory interpretation in this case, though found erroneous ultimately, may have been a reasonable argument to maintain if the Fund had no means to recoup from the uninsured employer or other responsible third party its payment of funds to the claimant if paid contingently. The Circuit Court did not err as a matter of law in denying the Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED REGARDING ATTORNEY\u2019S FEE AWARD, OTHERWISE AFFIRMED; CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO ENTER JUDGMENT CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY TO ENTER JUDGMENT CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

Consistent with \u00a7 9-1201 of the Labor and Employment Article of the Maryland Code, we will refer to Title 9 of the 1999 Replacement Volume of the 1991 Labor and Employment Article as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.

Section 9-737 authorizes appeals to the Circuit Court from orders of the Commission through a petition for judicial review.

The Fund, at oral argument, argued, for the first time according to our review of the record, that the notice requirements to the uninsured employer under \u00a7 9-1002(c) &amp; (d) were not completed as a necessary prerequisite to a proper application to the Fund for payment. The Fund's argument properly presented to us is that the delay in resolution by the Commission of NWJ's status precluded the existence of a final order and that the Fund\u2019s continuing appeal of the decision further precluded its obligation to pay benefits. Moreover, the Fund stated before the Commission during the 26 November 2002 hearing that Danner had complied with all the required rules for the payment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnX\">[Commission]: And all the other rules were complied with, payments were requested and payment denied, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">[The Fund]: Yes, the Fund is not going to pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">We do not address the notice deficiency argument that was neither part of the Fund\u2019s Petition, nor briefed.

It also serves as a second notice that the uninsured employer\u2019s payment is overdue (assuming the claimant's claim for benefits is the first instance of notice) and triggers the uninsured employers right to review under \u00a7 9-1002(g). \u00a7 9-1002(c); <em>see </em>Gilbert &amp; Humphreys, Jr., <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 14.3-1 at 300.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\">.
