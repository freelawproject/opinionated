The Petition alleged that Respondent, who was admitted to the Bar of this Court on December 18, 1990, violated several Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d), specifically, 1.1 (Competence),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.3 (Diligence),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1.4 (Communication),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 1.5 (Fees),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>1.15 (Safekeeping Property),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 1.16(d) (Declining or Terminating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Representation),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 8.4 (Misconduct),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Maryland Rule 16-606 (Name and Designation of Account),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Maryland Rule 16-609 (Prohibited Transactions),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and Section 10-306 of the Business Occupa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>tions and Professions Article of the Maryland Code (2000, 2004 Repl.Vol.) (Misuse of Trust Money).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">In accordance with Maryland Rules 16-752(a) and 16-757(c),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we referred the petition to Judge Mickey J. Norman of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for an evidentiary hearing and to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. On February 2, 2005, Judge Norman held a hearing and on March 10, 2005, issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, in which he found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Cherry-Mahoi had violated MRPC 1.3, 1.5, 1.15(a) and (b), 1.16(d),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 8.1, 8.4, Maryland Rules 16-606 and 16-609, and Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article:</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u201cThis matter arises from the Respondent\u2019s representation of Ms. Clark and her two children who were victims in a personal injury automobile accident. In May 2002, the Respondent settled the claims, received settlement funds and distributed the proceeds to the parties. The Respondent also received and was to hold in trust, personal injury protection funds (PIP) to pay certain unpaid medical providers. Ms. Clark did not immediately authorize the payment of those medical expenses. In October 2002, when those same medical expenses were to be paid, because the Respondent had depleted funds from her trust account, there were insufficient funds in the Respondent\u2019s account to satisfy the outstanding medical bills. The Respondent deposited personal funds into her trust account in order to pay the medical bills when they came due. Ms. Clark filed a complaint with the Attorney Grievance Commission. As a result of their investigation the Respondent has been charged with violating the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\n<em>Findings of Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u201cThe Petitioner alleges that the Respondent was admitted as a member of the Bar of this Court on December. 18, 1990 (\u00b6, 2) and (T. 27, lines 21-22).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She testified that the majority of her legal work had been in public interest law starting with the Maryland Disability Law Center (T. 59, line 5). From there, she went into private practice for two years and also, on a contractual basis, represented clients for the Public Defender\u2019s office (T. 58). Primarily she has worked as a subcontractor for a private attorney who represented children, who were, or alleged to have been, abused and neglected (T. 49, lines 13-16). While working as a subcontractor, the Respondent also maintained an office for the practice of law at 9722 Groffs Mill Drive, Suite 116, Owings Mills, Maryland 21117(\u00b6 2). However, on her attorney trust account, which is improperly labeled IOLTA, she lists an address of 220 E. Lexington Street, Suite 904, Baltimore, Maryland 21202-3525. The Respondent testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>that, around the time of the incident, which gave rise to the petition, she did not have an active private practice (T. 46, lines 6-9), and in July 2002, she was making an effort to eliminate her private practice of law (T. 51, lines 17-25).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u201cIn the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, Petitioner asserts that Respondent engaged in professional misconduct, as defined by Maryland Rule 16-701(1). This allegation arises from the Complaint filed by Mary Emma Clark who the Respondent represented. The Respondent filed an Answer admitting some of the factual allegations but generally denied any intentional wrongdoing. In its findings of fact, the Court incorporates the allegations listed in this Complaint, outlined by Petitioner in \u00b6 4-16 of the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action. At the hearing before the Court, the Petitioner called both the Respondent and John DeBone to testify. The Respondent also testified on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u201cAs alleged in the complaint of Mary Clark, and in accordance with the Respondent\u2019s own admission, the Court finds as a fact that the Respondent represented Mary Emma Clark and her two children, Rashaad and Ebony Kelly (hereinafter, \u201cClark case\u201d). That representation sought compensation for injuries arising out of an automobile accident. The case was settled in May 2002 (T. 28, lines 1-10).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\u201cBy her own admission, during May 2002, the Respondent settled the Clark case for an aggregate amount of $11,000.00 (\u00b6 5) (T. 28, lines 14-15). On May 15, 2002, the Respondent deposited that settlement check, into her escrow account, which she improperly labeled \u201cIOLTA\u201d (\u00b6 6). The Respondent admitted at trial that the account in which she deposited the settlement funds was labeled IOLTA (T. 29, lines 1-3). However, she denies culpability stating she was not familiar with setting up and maintaining escrow accounts (T. 59 line 24 to T. 60 line 3). The Respondent testified that she went to Provident Bank, explained her need to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>an attorneys escrow account in compliance with the IOLTA rules, and the account was improperly titled by the bank employee who set up the account. The Respondent claims that she relied on the experience of Provident Bank employees and therefore believed that it was permissible for an attorney trust account to carry that title (T. 43, lines 2-19).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u201cThe Respondent admitted, that in addition to receiving the settlement check in the Clark case, Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO) also issued personal injury protection (PIP) checks to be paid to the Respondent\u2019s clients. These checks were forwarded to the Respondent in May 2002(\u00b6 7). In her answers the Respondent admitted that on or about May 24, 2002, she deposited $4,019.75 representing the PIP benefits into her escrow account. Again on May 28, 2002, the Respondent deposited an additional $117.35 in PIP benefits into that same account (\u00b6 8). These admissions were corroborated by the testimony of John DeBone a paralegal for the Attorney Grievance Commission. Mr. DeBone has worked for the Attorney Grievance Commission for ten years. His responsibilities include performing attorney trust account analysis, and the attorney trust overdraft program on overdrafts of attorney trust accounts (T. 8, lines 13-23). Mr. DeBone reviewed the Respondent\u2019s bank records and prepared a spreadsheet (Petitioner\u2019s exhibit 2) analysis of her attorney trust account (T. 9, lines 1-5).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u201cMr. DeBone testified that he reviewed Ms. CherryMahoi\u2019s escrow account and the related bank records, and confirmed that during May 2002, GEICO issued PIP checks for Ms. Clark and her two children, totaling four thousand, one hundred and thirty-seven dollars and ten cents ($4,137.10) from deposits on the two dates listed above (T. 15, lines 12-16).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u201cFurthermore, the Respondent testified that, in May 2002, she received PIP benefits on behalf of the Clark family, which she deposited in her trust account (T. 28, lines 16-20). Copies of the Respondent\u2019s Provident Bank Rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ords were admitted into evidence (Petitioners exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u201cPetitioner alleges that, although the money was deposited into Respondent\u2019s account, the Respondent failed to notify Ms. Clark of the receipt of the personal injury protection payments from GEICO (\u00b6 9). Respondent denies this allegation. The respondent testified that: \u201cI had shared with [Ms. Clark] that I had received the checks from her PIP provider ... she told me not to pay the bills because the bills had already been paid.\u201d (T. 44, lines 19-23). A review of the personal injury settlement sheets, which were signed by Ms. Clark (sub-exhibits 1-3 of Petitioner\u2019s exhibit 1), delineates the PIP funds. The Court finds that the Petitioner has not proven that the Respondent failed to notify Ms. Clark that she had received personal injury protection payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u201cThe Petitioner also alleges that the Respondent endorsed the checks in her client\u2019s name prior to their deposit. This allegation is corroborated by Petitioner\u2019s exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 8. The GEICO PIP checks made out to Mary E. Clark, and those made out to her as guardian of Ebony and Rashaad Kelly, were endorsed in Mary Clark\u2019s and Ada Cherry-Mahoi\u2019s names by Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u201cPetitioner claims that the Respondent failed to make timely payments to medical providers from the funds she maintained in trust for that purpose (\u00b6 10), and the Respondent failed to maintain funds in trust for the payment of medical providers prior to the payment of said providers (\u00b6 11). The Provident Bank records (Petitioner\u2019s exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 8), and the spreadsheet prepared by Mr. DeBone (Petitioner\u2019s exhibit 2), reveal that between May 2002 and the end of September 2002, the Respondent converted funds from her trust account to her personal use. The Respondent does not deny these facts, however she denies any intentional fraud or misappropriation. Further the Respondent testified that Ms. Clark asked the Respondent to reserve paying certain medical providers, believing that she or her husband\u2019s insurance might have paid all or part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>of the bills (T. 31, lines 7-10). While waiting to learn if the medical bills had been paid from some other source, the Respondent did not pay the providers (T. 31, lines 17-23). The Respondent does not dispute that she withdrew funds between May and September 2002, and converted them to her personal use. She testified that she \u201cwas under the belief that any money remaining in the account would have been my fees because normally my procedure was to go ahead and pay bills almost immediately after receiving the funds.\u201d (T. 46 lines 11-14) and (T. 55, lines 2-25). The Respondent testified that, due to her poor record keeping, and that she generally did not keep excessive amounts of money in the account, she believed the money she withdrew belonged to her. The Respondent\u2019s belief that any funds remaining in her IOLTA account must have belonged to her, is inconsistent with the evidence in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u201cThe settlement check and PIP payments for the Clark case were all deposited in the Respondent\u2019s trust account during May, 2002. The settlement check was deposited on May 15, 2002, and all PIP benefits were deposited by May 28, 2002. The respondent testified that, within two to three weeks of disbursing the proceeds from the settlement, Ms. Clark directed her not to pay medical providers (T. 29, lines 17-25).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">\u201cPetitioner: And you recall that Ms. Clark told you, at least at some point, not to pay the providers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">\u201cRespondent: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">\u201cPetitioner: And isn\u2019t it true that she told you that roughly at the time that you disbursed money to her in settlement of the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">\u201cRespondent: It was after that, after the disbursement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmS\">\u201cPetitioner: How long after?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">\u201cRespondent: Maybe two or three weeks later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">The disbursement of the proceeds from the settlement was made on May 20, 2002. The PIP checks were deposited after that. Three weeks after paying the proceeds from the settlement would have been sometime during the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>week of June, 2002. It was at that time that the Respondent learned that Ms. Clark did not want the Respondent to pay some of the medical providers. Ms. Clark and the Respondent both knew there was approximately four thousand, one hundred and thirty-seven dollars and ten cents ($4,137.10) in PIP funds held in the Respondent\u2019s trust account. Those funds were the subject of the discussion between the Respondent and Ms. Clark to refrain, at that time, from paying certain medical benefits. For the Respondent to say that she \u201cwas under the belief that any money remaining in the account would have been my fees\u201d boggles the mind. Especially when she just had a conversation with her client who told her not to pay medical providers from the PIP fees, which the Respondent was then holding in her trust account. By the end of May, 2002, the Respondent had already paid herself more fees from the Clark case than she was entitled. During June, 2002, the same time that she is having the discussion with Ms. Clark about not paying some medical providers with fees from the trust account, the Respondent withdraws twenty four hundred dollars ($2,400.00) from that account. The Respondent had already taken her fee for settling the Clark case. Having just discussed with Ms. Clark her desire to refrain, at least temporarily, from paying certain medical bills (T. 55, lines 2-25), the Respondent knew that she was holding, in her trust account, monies that would eventually be paid to medical providers or surrendered to her clients. The Court finds as a matter of fact that the Respondent knew that she was misappropriating funds that were held in her trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u201cThe Respondent testified that her full-time position was affecting her ability to maintain a private practice (T. 52, lines 1-4). She also testified that she was experiencing professional stress; felt that she was overwhelmed because of the demands of her full-time job. She also claimed to have physical issues; hypertension and an injured leg (T. 61). The Court does not believe that the Respondent has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that these factors are mitigating pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u201cIn October, 2002, when the outstanding medical bills from the Clark case needed to be paid, there were insufficient funds in the Respondent\u2019s trust account to satisfy those bills. In order to pay those medical bills, the Respondent testified that she relied on a fee generated by a legal matter she handled for her mother on behalf of a family member. On October 10, 2002, Respondent deposited, into her attorney trust account, a four thousand dollar ($4,000.00) money order (Petitioner exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 8, page 27) provided by Bernice Cherry, Respondent\u2019s mother (T. 34, lines 3-14).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u201cThe Respondent testified that she was unaware that it was improper to place a fee into her attorney trust account (T. 34, lines 12-19). The Respondent admits that, but for the four thousand dollars ($4,000.00) received from Bernice Cherry, she would have been unable to pay the outstanding medical bills due from the Clark case (T. 36, lines 5-13). The court finds, as a fact, that the Respondent failed to maintain funds in trust for the payment of medical providers, and that she used her personal funds to pay those providers when the bills became due.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u201cThe Petitioner asserts that the Respondent took a fee greater than that to which she was entitled and that she failed to reimburse to her clients amounts to which she was not entitled (\u00b6 12). The evidence reveals that the Respondent was entitled to a total fee of $3,663.00 (Petitioner\u2019s exhibit 1, sub-exhibits 1-3; and T. 16, lines 16-17). As a fee the Respondent received $1,731.60 for settling Mary Clark\u2019s claim and $965.70 per client for settling the claims for Ebony Kelly and Rashaad Kelly. From the Clark case trust account, the Respondent withdrew $4,225.00 in May 2002 and $2,400.00 in June 2002 (T. 17-18; Petitioner\u2019s exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 8, and Petitioner\u2019s exhibit 2). On June 17, 2002,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Respondent wrote a check, in the amount of $400, made out to \u201ccash\u201d (\u00b6 15), a violation of Maryland Rule 16-609. As a result of Respondent\u2019s withdrawal of monies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>from her attorney trust account in excess fees due her, she was forced to pay medical providers with funds she received from her mother, a person not associated with the Clark case (\u00b6 13). The Court finds as a fact that the Respondent took an amount of money greater than that to which she was entitled, and that she failed to reimburse to her clients\u2019 amounts to which she was not entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u201cThere seems to be no dispute that once Ms. Clark filed her complaint, the Respondent paid the outstanding medical bills (T. 64, line 20-22). The Respondent also testified that, since the complaint was filed, she has taken remedial action to correct her errors. She still has a private practice with a few cases pending. However, she has taken steps to have other counsel step in to represent her clients should the results of this proceeding prevent her from doing so (T. pgs. 65-66).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u201cPetitioner alleges, and the Court finds as fact, that the Respondent willfully and knowingly misappropriated and used for her own business and/or personal use, the funds of her clients (\u00b6 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\u201cThe Petitioner alleged that the Respondent committed professional misconduct in violation of Maryland Rule 16-701(1), as delineated in the complaint of Mary Emma Clark. Pursuant to the facts of said complaint, and the findings of fact laid forth above, this Court finds that Respondent did commit Professional Misconduct in violation of Maryland Rule 16-701(1). Furthermore, Petitioner represents and charges that, by her actions and omissions as set forth above, the Respondent unethically and unprofessionally violated certain Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">\u201c1. The Petitioner alleges that the Respondent violated Rule 1.1 \u2014 Competence, which states \u201ca lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thorough<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d The comment to that rule suggests that the court consider: \u201cwhether a lawyer employs the requisite knowledge and skill in a particular matter, relevant factors including the relative complexity and specialized nature of the matter, the lawyer\u2019s general experience, the lawyer\u2019s training and experience in the field in question.\u201d The basis for the Petitioner\u2019s allegations is that the Respondent intentionally converted client funds to her own use. There is no suggestion or evidence that the Respondent did not handle the subject matter of the action, an automobile tort, with lawyerly skill and ability. This Court finds that the Respondent did not violate Rule 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u201c2. The Petitioner alleges that the Respondent violated Rule 1.3 \u2014 Diligence, which states: \u201cA lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d Among other things, a \u201clawyer should act with commitment and dedication to the interests of the client and with zeal in advocacy upon the client\u2019s behalf.\u201d Ms. Clark directed the Respondent to refrain from paying some of the medical providers. She alleged that some of the medical providers may have been compensated by other insurance and directed the Respondent not to pay those providers. The circumstance, which spawned Ms. Clark\u2019s complaint, was the Respondent\u2019s failure to pay medical expenses for which Ms. Clark was receiving delinquency notices. \u201cMs. Clark was getting stressed about the fact that letters were coming to her from collection agencies for unpaid bills.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s sub-exhibit 5, Respondent\u2019s October 15, 2002 letter to Bar Counsel, pg. 2, 2nd paragraph). It is clear from the reasonable inferences which can be drawn from the evidence in this case, that prior to Ms. Clark\u2019s complaint to Bar Counsel, there were insufficient funds in the Respondent\u2019s escrow account from the Clark case to satisfy outstanding claims for reimbursement by certain medical providers. On one hand, the Respondent was complying with her client\u2019s wishes in not surrendering payment to certain medical providers. However, if on or about October 1, 2002, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Ms. Clark had directed the Respondent to pay the outstanding medical providers, the Respondent would have been unable to do so because she had converted to her own use funds which should have been held in trust from the Clark case. This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent did violate Rule 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u201c3. The Petitioner alleges that the Respondent violated Rule 1.4 \u2014 Communication, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">(a) a lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u201cThe Respondent kept Ms. Clark well informed concerning the subject matter of the case. The Respondent filed for PTP benefits in the matter, communicated with Ms. Clark about the settlement offer and prepared and executed settlement sheets (Petitioner\u2019s sub-exhibit 1-3), which her clients signed. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the Respondent did not keep her clients informed about the status of their cases or did not provide them with the necessary information to make informed decisions about the subject matter of the cases. This Court finds that the Respondent did not violate Rule 1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u201c4. The Petitioner alleges that the Respondent violated Rule 1.5 \u2014 Fees, which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">(a) a lawyer\u2019s fee shall be reasonable. The factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">(2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">(4) the amount involved and the results obtained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">(5) the time limitations imposed by the client of by the circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">\u201cThe Respondent knowingly violated this rule by taking for herself a fee greater than that which she had agreed upon. The Respondent agreed to accept 33.3% of the settlement proceeds. The settlement totaled $11,000.00. The Respondent was entitled to a fee of three thousand, six hundred and sixty-three dollars ($3,663.00) (Petitioner\u2019s sub-exhibit 1-3, personal injury settlement sheets). The Respondent received and deposited the $11,000.00 settlement check on May 15, 2002. Prior to that deposit, there was only $41.73 in the Respondent\u2019s escrow account.

Two days later on May 30, 2002, the Respondent wrote check 241 payable to herself for three hundred dollars ($300.00). The next day, May 31, 2002, she wrote herself a one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) check (#242). Check numbers 240 through and including 242 had no notations on the memo line. At that time the only funds in the Respondent\u2019s escrow account, other than $41.73, were from the Clark case. Within two weeks of receiving the eleven thousand dollar ($11,000.00) settlement check, and within one week of receiving the first PIP payments, the Respondent had withdrawn five thousand seventy-five dollars ($5,075.00) which was fourteen hundred and twelve dollars ($1,412.00) more than she was entitled. By June 3, 2002, two and one half weeks after receiving the settlement check, the account balance for the Clark case, which was the only escrow account the Respondent was managing, was two thousand, six hundred and sixteen dollars and eighty-three cents ($2,616.83).

Because the Respondent took more fees than she had agreed upon, and by failing to inform her clients\u2019 of her withdrawal of those additional fees, the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that, the Respondent did violate Rule 1.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">\u201c5. The Petitioner alleges that the Respondent violated Rule 1.15 \u2014 the Safekeeping of Property, states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-12\">(a) A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third personal that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property. Funds shall be kept in a separate account maintained pursuant to Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules. Other property shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such account funds and of other property shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of five years after termination of the representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-13\">(b) Upon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the client or third person. Except as stated in this Rule or otherwise permitted by law or agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client or third person any funds or other property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>that the client or third person is entitled to receive and, upon request by the client or third person, shall promptly render a full accounting regarding such property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u201cWhen holding property for a client, including money, a lawyer acts as a fiduciary. Money must be placed in an appropriate trust account or accounts if more than one account is warranted. The Respondent claimed that she did not know that it was improper to commingle fees with her escrow account, nevertheless she did commingle funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u201cThe evidence is that, on or about October 10, 2002, the Respondent received, from her mother Bernice Cherry, a fee of $4,000.00, in the form of a money order. The Respondent deposited that amount into her trust account, thereby commingling it with the funds from the Clark case. At that time, the Clark funds in the trust account had been depleted to approximately two hundred and twenty-five dollars ($225.00).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u201cOn July 9, 2002, the Respondent deposited sixty-one hundred dollars ($6,100.00) into her escrow account. That sum was for the settlement of a personal injury case she handled for her husband Kenneth Mahoi (T. 35, lines 12-24).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alc\">\u201cPetitioner: did you have a fee with your husband?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8m\">\u201cRespondent: Well, because it was my husband, what he had said was we would use the money to pay necessary expenses.

It was whatever we recover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuK\">\u201cPetitioner: But you did the work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">\u201cRespondent: Yes I did the work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">\u201cPetitioner: So any fee associated with that would be within the sixty-one hundred, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">\u201cRespondent: Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">\u201cThe sequencing of the checks written after receiving the Kenneth Mahoi settlement is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">Date Kenneth Mahoi</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">posted Cheek # Payee-description Amount Settlement Balance</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">Settlement cheek deposited 7-9-02</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">$6,100</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>7-9-02 252 EZ Storage $ 98.00 $6,002</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">7-9-02 253 Ada Cherry-Mahoi $ 200.00 $5,802</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">7-11-02 254 Ada Cherry-Mahoi $2,200.00 $3,602</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">7-11-02 255 Ada Cherry-Mahoi $1,900.00 $1,702</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">7-15-02 256 Kenneth Mahoi $ 800.00 $ 902</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">7-22-02 257 Ada Cherry-Mahoi $ 600.00 $ 302</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">7-23-02 258 Ada Cherry-Mahoi $ 300.00 $ 2</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">\u201cThe Respondent testified that the recovery from the Kenneth Mahoi personal injury case was income to the Respondent and her husband <em>\u201cwe </em>[emphasis added] would use the money to pay necessary expenses.\u201d Because those funds were personal funds, they should not have been commingled with other funds in the escrow account. The funds related to the Clark case, should have been kept in a <em>properly labeled </em>attorney trust account, and not commingled with any personal funds belonging to the Respondent. The Respondent failed to keep funds in a separate account pursuant to Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ1\">The Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent did violate Rule 1.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">\u201cSubsection (b) of Rule 1.15 requires a lawyer to promptly deliver to a party or third person, any funds that the client or third person is entitled to receive. The Respondent testified that after receiving the PIP checks in May of 2002, Ms. Clark directed her to withhold paying certain medical expenses because those expenses may have been covered by other health insurance policies (T. 31, lines 7-20). The total PIP benefits received in the Clark case were $4,137.10. By the end of September, 2002, the Respondent had taken $2,962.00 more than she was entitled to from the Clark case. In the beginning of October, 2002, when the outstanding medical providers needed to be paid, there were insufficient funds from the Clark trust account to satisfy those bills. It was at that time that the Respondent\u2019s mother paid a fee for some undisclosed type of legal work previously completed. It is more than a little suspicious that the alleged fee of four thousand dollars ($4,000.00) was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>infused into the Respondent\u2019s trust account at a time she needed to pay three thousand, one hundred and eighty-nine dollars and thirty-five cents ($3,189.35) in outstanding medical bills (T.36, lines 14-17). The Respondent does not deny that but for the money order from her mother, she would have had insufficient funds in the trust account to pay the outstanding medical expenses (T. 16, lines 9-13). Because the Respondent had depleted the funds from the Clark case, which should have been held in trust, she was unable to pay the medical bills when Ms. Clark requested her to do so. Because the Respondent was unable to promptly deliver to the medical providers that to which they were entitled, the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent did violate Rule 1.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u201c6. The Petitioner alleges that the Respondent violated Rule 1.16 \u2014 Declining or Terminating Representation, which states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">c) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interest, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned. The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u201cThe Respondent did not protect her client\u2019s interest when she converted funds from the Clark case to her own use. Therefore, the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent did violate Rule 1.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u201c7. The Petitioner alleges that the Respondent violated Rule 8.1 \u2014 Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">An applicant for admission or reinstatement to the bar, or a lawyer in connection with a bar admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not: (a) knowingly make a false statement of material fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u201cIn her answer to the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, the Respondent denies labeling her trust account as an \u201cIOLTA\u201d account (\u00b6 6). At the hearing, the Respondent did not dispute that her trust account was labeled \u201cIOLTA.\u201d She relied on bank personnel to properly title the account (T.43). Having been made aware of her error, the Respondent has closed her IOLTA account and reopened an account that is properly titled attorney escrow account (T.66, 17 lines \u00cd0 \u2014 11). The Court finds that the Respondent was woefully uninformed about properly establishing and labeling an attorney trust account, but does not believe that she intentionally made a false statement when she initially denied mislabeling her escrow account. The Respondent denies that she failed to maintain funds in trust for the payment of medical providers prior to the payment of those providers (\u00b6 11). She denies taking a greater fee than that to which she was entitled (\u00b6 12) and she denies willfully misappropriating funds (\u00b6 14). She also claims that she was unaware that it was improper to commingle fees with trust account funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u201cThere was only forty-one dollars and thirty seven cents ($41.37) in her trust account at the time the Respondent deposited the funds from the Clark case into that account. The Respondent\u2019s fee for her services in the Clark case was three thousand, six hundred and sixty three dollars ($3,663.00). The only funds deposited in her escrow account up to June 20, <em>2002</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>were derived from the Clark case. As of that date there was no other source of funds in her trust account other than from the Clark case. By June 20, 2002, she had withdrawn and made payable to herself a total of five thousand, four hundred and fifty dollars ($5,450.00) which was one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven dollars ($1,787) more than the fee she agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u201cOn that day, had Ms. Clark directed the Respondent to pay the outstanding medical providers there would have been insufficient funds to do so. The Respondent admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>that she was winding down her civil practice and testified that she was not reconciling her trust account (T. 46, lines 24-25 and T. 48, lines 5-10). During the months of May and June 2002, with the exception of one hundred dollars ($100.00, see footnote 3), the Clark case was the only source of funds in the Respondent\u2019s trust account. Handling the funds in the Respondent\u2019s trust account from the Clark case was not complicated. The Clark case was the single and sole contributor to the Respondent\u2019s trust account. Yet, in a little over a month, May 15, 2002 to June 20, 2002 the Respondent had taken from the Clark trust account more money than to which she was entitled. The Court finds that the Respondent intentionally converted funds in excess of her fee to her personal use. Having done so, there were insufficient funds in the trust account to satisfy outstanding medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u201cIn her answers to the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, the Respondent denies paying medical providers with funds she received from a person or persons not associated with the Clark case. After receiving a complaint from the Petitioner, on October 10, 2002, the Respondent deposits a four thousand dollar ($4,000.00) money order into her trust account. The Respondent testified that the money order was from her mother as a fee for doing \u201csome legal work ... on behalf of my nephew, her grandson\u201d (T. 34, lines 6-8). There is no doubt that, but for that contribution there would have been insufficient funds in the trust account to pay the outstanding medical expenses, related to the Clark case (T. 16, lines 9-13). It is more than mere coincidence that the alleged four thousand dollar ($4,000.00) fee paid my the Respondent\u2019s mother was infused into the trust account at a time when the Respondent needed to pay and subsequently did pay $3,189.35 in outstanding medical bills (T. 36, lines 14-17). The Respondent does not deny that, but for the deposit received from her mother, she would have had insufficient funds in the trust account to pay the outstanding Clark medical expenses (T. 16, lines 9-13). The Court finds that the Respondent intentionally obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>and used the contribution from her mother to pay for the delinquent medical expenses, which could not be satisfied from the trust account because the Respondent had converted those funds to her own use. The Court finds that the Respondent knowingly and intentionally paid medical providers with her personal funds. The Court further finds that Respondent denied doing so and as such, that constituted an intentional misrepresentation of material fact in connection with a disciplinary matter and therefore the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated Rule 8.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u201c8. The Petitioner alleges that the Respondent violated Rule 8.4 \u2014 Misconduct, which states, in relevant part: It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">(a) violate or attempt to violate the rules of professional conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">(b) commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">\u201cBy finding that Respondent\u2019s actions were intentional, the Court necessarily finds that she violated Rule 8.4, relating to Professional Misconduct. The testimony in the case revealed that Respondent knew what fees were owed to her as a result of the Clark case; she knew how much money she withdrew over the period of time prior to paying the medical bills, and she knew that, when the time came to pay them, that there were insufficient funds in her attorney trust account to do so. At that time, Respondent inappropriately deposited personal funds, not client trust funds, into her attorney trust account, for the purpose of covering the deficit and paying off the outstanding medical bills on behalf of Ms. Clark. Based on the above evidence and findings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>fact, this Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated Rule 8.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u201c9. The Petitioner alleges that the Respondent violated Maryland Rule 16-606 \u2014 Name and Designation of the Account, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">An attorney or law firm shall maintain each attorney trust account with a title that includes the name of the attorney or law firm and that clearly designates the account as \u201cAttorney Trust Account,\u201d \u201cAttorney Escrow Account,\u201d or \u201cClient\u2019s Funds Account\u201d on all checks and deposit slips. The title shall distinguish the account from any other fiduciary account that the attorney or law firm may maintain and from any personal or business account of the attorney or law firm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u201cRespondent titled her attorney trust account as an IOLTA account. While she denies any intentional wrongdoing, the Court finds that the responsibility to properly designate the account, in accordance with this Rule, lay solely with Respondent. Therefore, by failing to designate the account as \u201cAttorney Trust Account,\u201d \u201cAttorney Escrow Account,\u201d or \u201cClient\u2019s Funds Account,\u201d the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent Violated Maryland Rule 16-606.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u201c10. The Petitioner alleges that the Respondent violated Maryland Rule 16-609 \u2014 Prohibited Transactions, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">An attorney or law firm may not borrow or pledge any funds required by these Rules to be deposited in an attorney trust account, obtain any remuneration from the financial institution for depositing any funds in the account, or use any funds for any unauthorized purpose. An instrument drawn on an attorney trust account may not be drawn payable to cash or to bearer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">\u201cAs explained in the above findings of fact, Respondent acted in violation of this rule by withdrawing funds greater than the amount of the fee owed to her. Not only did the Respondent mislabel her Attorney Trust account, she took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>money from that account and misappropriated it for her own personal use. On June 17, 2002, the Respondent wrote and endorsed a check for cash (Petitioner\u2019s exhibit 1, sub-exhibit 8, page 14) (T. 7, line 25; page 18, lines 1-4). Her clients did not authorize the Respondent\u2019s personal use of funds in excess of her fees, and writing a check for cash was also improper. For the reasons stated herein, the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated Maryland Rule 16-609.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u201c11. The Petitioner alleges that the Respondent violated \u00a7 10-306 by misusing trust money. Business Occupations and Professions Article, Maryland Code, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">A lawyer may not use trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u201cUpon consideration of the findings of facts stated herein, the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent intentionally converted to her own use money entrusted to her as an attorney in violation of \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">In proceedings involving attorney discipline, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Seiden, </em>373 Md. 409, 419, 818 A.2d 1108, 1114 (2003) (sustain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ing Bar Counsel\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s findings where Petitioner did not charge the Respondent for violations of the MRPC) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">B. <em>Respondent\u2019s Exceptions to -Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Respondent takes exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she knowingly and willfully misappropriated funds held in her trust account by alleging that she \u201cwas [mistakenly] under the belief that any money remaining in the account would have been [her] fees\u201d and that she mismanaged the account, rather than purposefully misappropriated funds. The hearing judge found to the contrary and concluded that, \u201cthe Respondent knew that she was misappropriating funds that were held in her trust account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The evidence adduced during the hearing clearly and convincingly established that the Respondent received a settlement check and personal injury protection (PIP) payments for the Clark case, the proceeds of which were deposited into her trust account. Respondent testified that, although she knew her fee for the Clark case was 33.3% of the settlement proceeds, which amounted to $3,663.00, she withdrew $2,962.00 beyond the $3,663.00, even though she knew those monies were to be maintained for payment of various medical bills. The bank statements for the account reflect that Respondent wrote a multitude of checks to herself and a check for cash on the escrow account, totaling $6,625.00, between the time the settlement check and PIP payments were deposited and when Respondent paid the medical providers:</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Date</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Written Check # Payee \u2014 description Amount</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">5-15-02 235 Ada Cherry-Mahoi-Reimbursement $ 150.00</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">5-18-02 236 Ada Cherry-Mahoi $2,000.00</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">5-20-02 238 Ada Cherry-Mahoi $ 975.00</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">5-28-02 239 Ada Cherry-Mahoi $ 500.00</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">5-28-02 240 Ada Cherry-Mahoi $ 300.00</p>\n<p id=\"b194-15\">5-30-02 241 Ada Cherry-Mahoi $ 300.00</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>5- 31-02 242 Ada Cherry-Mahoi $1,000.00</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">6- 4-02 243 Ada Cherry-Mahoi $ 250.00</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">6-12-02 244 Ada Cherry-Mahoi $ 350.00</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">6-15-02 246 Cash $ 400.00</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">6-20-02 247 Ada Cherry-Mahoi $ 200.00</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">6-26-02 248 Ada Cherry-Mahoi-Reimbursement $ 200.00</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Essentially, Respondent withdrew nearly double the agreed upon fee that she was entitled to receive, when funds should have been maintained in the trust account to pay the medical providers, and used personal funds to pay the outstanding bills only after Ms. Clark filed a complaint with Bar Counsel. Respondent also has admitted that the checks made payable to her from the account \u201cwere used for ... business and personal purposes.\u201d We, therefore, conclude that the hearing judge\u2019s findings that the Respondent knowingly and willfully misappropriated entrusted funds are supported by clear and convincing evidence and overrule Respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">C. <em>Conclusions of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">The hearing judge determined that Respondent acted in violation of MRPC 1.15(a) when she deposited personal funds into her trust account, thereby commingling her client\u2019s funds with her own.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">MRPC 1.15(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-13\">A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property. Funds shall be kept in a separate account maintained pursuant to Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules. Other property shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such account funds and of other property shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of five years after termination of the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">On July 9, 2002, the Respondent deposited $6,100.00 into her trust account, which was for the settlement of a personal injury case that she had handled for her husband. During the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>hearing, the Respondent testified that the recovery from the case was income to her and her husband and that they \u201cwould use the money to pay necessary expenses.\u201d Subsequently, on October 10, 2002, the Respondent received a \u201cfee\u201d of $4,000 from her mother for legal services performed on a matter unrelated to the Clark case, which she then deposited into her trust account. On both occasions, Respondent commingled personal funds with monies from the Clark case, which were in the only trust account being maintained by the Respondent. As such, she failed to keep her personal funds in a separate account from her trust account in violation of MRPC 1.15(a). <em>See Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. at 370-71, 872 A.2d at 711-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The hearing judge also concluded that the Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(b) and 1.3 in her handling of the Clark matter when she failed to promptly pay medical providers. Respondent claims that Ms. Clark had directed Respondent to refrain from paying some of the medical providers because the bills already may have been paid. Nevertheless, as the hearing judge found, there were insufficient funds in Respondent\u2019s escrow account to pay the outstanding claims by the medical providers should Ms. Clark have directed Respondent to do so, and that once the bills became due and Ms. Clark began receiving delinquency notices from the medical providers, Respondent failed to promptly pay those outstanding bills. Whether Ms. Clark clearly directed payment of the bills, it is apparent that Respondent could not pay the providers from insufficient funds. We have previously held that an attorney who does not pay a client\u2019s debts from settlement funds violates Rule 1.15(b), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">Upon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the client or third person. Except as stated in this Rule or otherwise permitted by law or by agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client or third person any funds or other property that the client or third person is entitled to receive and, upon request by the client or third person, shall promptly render a full accounting regarding such property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. at 369-70, 872 A.2d at 710; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Stolarz, </em>379 Md. 387, 399-400, 842 A.2d 42, 49 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">In addition, an attorney\u2019s failure to pay medical providers demonstrates a lack of diligence in violation of Rule 1.3, which states that a \u201clawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gallagher, </em>371 Md. 673, 710, 810 A.2d 996, 1018 (2002). Because Respondent was unable to promptly pay the medical providers the monies that they were entitled to receive, she violated both Rules 1.15(b) and 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The same behavior also violates Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, which provides that \u201c[a] lawyer may not use trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Prichard, </em>386 Md. 238, 246-47, 872 A.2d 81, 85-86 (2005); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 481-82, 671 A.2d 463, 479-80 (1996). We have held that funds withheld by an attorney from the settlement proceeds of a client for payment to third party medical providers constitutes \u201ctrust money.\u201d <em>Prichard,, </em>386 Md. at 246, 872 A.2d at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">We agree with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that the Respondent violated MRPC 1.5 requiring a lawyer to charge reasonable fees and MRPC 1.16(d) requiring that a lawyer take reasonable steps to protect a client\u2019s interest. The Respondent was entitled to receive $3,663.00 for handling the Clark matter, but withdrew $6,625.00 from her trust account, which at that time solely consisted of Clark\u2019s settlement proceeds. Not only did Respondent take substantially more fees than agreed upon, she failed to inform her client of her withdrawal of those additional fees. We have previously held that charging an unreasonable fee and failing to communicate the basis for the fee constitute violations of Rule 1.5, as well as a violation of 1.16(d) by converting client funds and collecting an unearned fee. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

The title shall distinguish the account from any other fiduciary account that the attorney or law firm may maintain and from any personal or business account of the attorney or law firm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Respondent failed to title her attorney trust account in compliance with this Rule. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

In this case, Respondent\u2019s conduct was dishonest and deceitful in violation of Rule 8.4(c) in that she willfully and knowingly misappropriated client funds that were to be held in trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">This Court also has found conduct constituting the misappropriation of client or third party funds to be \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d in violation of Rule 8.4(d). <em>See Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. at 374-75, 872 A.2d at 713; <em>James, </em>385 Md. at 663, 870 A.2d at 245; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

We have recognized that \u201cpublic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>confidence in the legal profession is a critical facet to the proper administration of justice\u201d and conduct that negatively impacts on the public\u2019s image or the perception of the courts or the legal profession violates Rule 8.4(d). <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. at 375, 872 A.2d at 713, the appropriate sanction for a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, including consideration of any mitigating factors. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

We have often stated that the misappropriation of entrusted funds \u201cis an act infected with deceit and dishonesty, and, in the absence of compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction, will result in disbarment.\u201d <em>James, </em>385 Md. at 666, 870 A.2d at 245; <em>Prichard, </em>386 Md. at 238, 872 A.2d at 81; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.
