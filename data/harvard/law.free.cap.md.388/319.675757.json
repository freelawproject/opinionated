Sweeney brought suit against Savings First Mortgage, L.L.C. (Savings First) in the Circuit Court for Frederick County, alleging a violation of the Maryland Finder\u2019s Fee Law. Md.Code (1975, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-801-12-809 of the Commercial Law Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Savings First acted as a mortgage broker for Ms. Sweeney in the procurement of two mortgage refinance loans within a one-year period. Ms. Sweeney alleged that the mortgage broker fee charged by Savings First in connection with the second loan was in violation of the Maryland statute, specifically \u00a7 12-804(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Savings First responded to Ms. Sweeney\u2019s suit by filing a motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. In support of its motion, Savings First argued that the Finder\u2019s Fee Law was preempted by \u00a7 501(a)(1) of the Federal Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, in the alternative, was barred by the applicable Maryland one-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Circuit Court granted the motion, dismissing Ms. Sweeney\u2019s complaint with prejudice based on its conclusion that \u00a7 1735f-7a of Title 12 of the United States Code preempted the Maryland statute. Ms. Sweeney noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted certiorari, <em>Sweeney v. Savings First Mortgage, L.L.C., </em>385 Md. 511, 869 A.2d 864 (2005), on our initiative while the appeal was pending in the intermediate appellate court, in order to consider the following question of first impression in this State:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">Is Maryland\u2019s Finder\u2019s Fee Law, and the limits it places on the fees that mortgage brokers may charge, preempted by the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (DIDMCA)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Based on our analysis of the federal statute, and an investigation of the legislative history behind the DIDMCA, we hold that the Maryland Finder\u2019s Fee Law is not preempted in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>case. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Frederick County and remand this matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">On 29 August 2000, Savings First acted as a mortgage broker in obtaining a refinance loan for Ms. Sweeney and Harry E. Stockman<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> secured by a residence at 9204 Oak Tree Circle in Frederick, Maryland. The amount of the loan was $140,250 and the lender for the transaction was First Union National Bank of Delaware. As payment for its efforts in brokering the loan, Savings First received a mortgage broker fee of $8,427. The following year, on or about 12 July 2001, Savings First arranged a replacement mortgage refinance loan for the same residence for Ms. Sweeney and Mr. Stock-man in the amount of $158,400. The lender in this second transaction was Concorde Acceptance Corporation (Concorde). The mortgage broker fee paid to Savings First in the second transaction was $10,788. The mortgage broker fee for each transaction was rolled into the amounts financed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Ms. Sweeney filed a complaint on 1 March 2004 in the Circuit Court for Frederick County seeking a judgment in the amount of $30,564 against Savings First.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ms. Sweeney contended that the maximum fee allowed by Maryland law for Savings First\u2019s brokering of the second loan was $1,452, or 8% of $18,150, the amount of the second loan in excess of the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>loan. The relevant portions of \u00a7 12-804 of the Maryland Finder\u2019s Fee Law state:</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Fees mortgage broker permitted to charge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">(a) <em>Maximum amount of finder\u2019s fee. </em>\u2014 A mortgage broker may charge a finder\u2019s fee not in excess of 8 percent of the amount of the loan or advance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">(c) <em>Mortgage loan obtained more than once on same property. </em>\u2014 A mortgage broker obtaining a mortgage loan with respect to the same property more than once within a 24-month period may charge a finder\u2019s fee only on so much of the loan as is in excess of the initial loan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Md.Code, \u00a7 12-804.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">Savings First filed its motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, on 14 May 2004. Savings First argued that Ms. Sweeney\u2019s complaint stated no basis for relief because her claim was barred by law for either of two reasons. The first contention was that \u00a7 501(a)(1) of the DIDMCA expressly preempts application of the Maryland Finder\u2019s Fee Law. Under this federal statute, a state is prohibited from \u201cexpressly limiting the rate or amount of interest, discount points, finance charges, or other charges\u201d applying to qualifying mortgages. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1735f-7a(a)(l) (2000). Savings First\u2019s alternate argument was that Ms. Sweeney\u2019s claim was barred by the one-year statute of limitations applicable to penalties and forfeitures.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Savings First included affidavits in support of its motion demonstrating particular facts, beyond those alleged in Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Sweeney\u2019s complaint, that it contended were material and not in genuine dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">At the conclusion of the motions hearing on 18 August 2004, the Circuit Court ostensibly granted the motion to dismiss Ms. Sweeney\u2019s claim, with prejudice, because \u00a7 1735f-7a preempted the cause of action brought under \u00a7 12-804 of the Maryland Commercial Law Article. In ruling on the motion, the Circuit Court did not state whether it had considered the additional facts offered by Savings First in its affidavits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Upon a motion by either party for summary judgment, the court \u201cshall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party\u201d if there is shown to be \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact.\u201d Md. Rule 2 \u2014 501(f). There appears from the record to be no genuine dispute of any material fact. Thus, whether the grant of summary judgment is appropriate is entirely a question of law. <em>Johnson v. Mayor of Balt., </em>387 Md. 1, 5, 874 A.2d 439, 442 (2005). On appeal, the matter is reviewed <em>de novo </em>to determine if the trial court was \u201clegally correct\u201d in its decision. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the case before us turns on the interpretation of a federal statute and whether that statute preempts the Maryland law that is the basis of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Courts must begin the process of statutory interpretation \u201cwith an analysis of the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Holland v. Big River Minerals Corp., </em>181 F.3d 597, 603 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Cir.1999); <em>accord Comptroller v. Phillips, </em>384 Md. 583, 591, 865 A.2d 590, 594 (2005). We must determine if the language \u201chas a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U.S. 337, 340, 117 S.Ct. 843, 846, 136 L.Ed.2d 808, 813 (1997); <em>accord Phillips, </em>384 Md. at 591, 865 A.2d at 594. If the statutory language is found to be ambiguous, it is necessary to look beyond the statute itself and into the legislative history for guidance as to the intent of Congress in passing the statute. <em>Holland, </em>181 F.3d at 603; <em>accord Phillips, </em>384 Md. at 591, 865 A.2d at 594. In interpreting federal statutory law, a court may look beyond the plain language of a statute when: 1) Congress has expressed a clear intent contrary to the statutory text; 2) literal application would frustrate the purpose of the statute; or 3) literal application would \u201cproduce an absurd result.\u201d <em>Holland, </em>181 F.3d at 603 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In addressing a statute enacted to preempt state law, our system of federalism has caused the Supreme Court to presume \u201cthat Congress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action.\u201d <em>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </em>518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 2250, 135 L.Ed.2d 700, 715 (1996). This presumption against preemption especially has been true in areas historically governed by the police power of the states, and has led to narrow interpretations of such express preemption provisions. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>505 U.S. 504, 518, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 2618, 120 L.Ed.2d 407, 423 (1992)). We adopt the view of the Supreme Court that it is our (the Court of Appeals of Maryland\u2019s) \u201creasoned understanding\u201d of the statute\u2019s purpose that helps us to determine the scope of preemption; we must consider how the statute was meant to \u201caffect business, consumers, and the law.\u201d <em>Medtronic, </em>518 U.S. at 486, 116 S.Ct. at 2251, 135 L.Ed.2d at 716.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We must examine the Maryland Finder\u2019s Fee Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>against the express preemption provision of the DIDMCA, as well as the possibility that the law is preempted through conflict with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Ms. Sweeney raises three arguments in her attempt to demonstrate that the DIDMCA does not preempt the Finder\u2019s Fee Law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Her first contention is that the DIDMCA preemption only covers aspects of covered loans affecting interest, and does not extend to consumer protection statutes like the Maryland Finder\u2019s Fee Law. Next, Ms. Sweeney argues that the DIDMCA only applies to purchase money loans and not to refinance mortgage loans. Finally, Ms. Sweeney advances that the DIDMCA only applies to creditors. Her reasoning continues that, because Savings First is a mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>broker, not a creditor, the Finder\u2019s Fee Law is not preempted. We shall address each of Ms. Sweeney\u2019s arguments in turn, ultimately reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court solely because the DIDMCA applies only to creditors and not to mortgage brokers. Thus, the DIDMCA preemption does not affect enforcement of the Maryland Finder\u2019s Fee Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The first of Ms. Sweeney\u2019s arguments that we will address is that the intended scope of the DIDMCA preemption is too narrow to cover the Maryland Finder\u2019s Fee Law. She advances the argument that the federal statute only covers state limitations on the rate or amount of interest that a lender may charge. Additionally, because the Finder\u2019s Fee Law is a consumer protection statute, Ms. Sweeney argues that it may not be preempted by the DIDMCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\n<em>1. The DIDMCA\u2019s Scope is not Limited to Interest Rates or Amounts.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The plain language of the statute states that the DIDMCA is not limited to rates and amounts of interest. The applicable language provides that any state laws \u201cexpressly limiting the rate or amount of interest, <em>discount points, finance charges, or other charges ... </em>shall not apply.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1735f-7a(a)(l) (2000) (emphasis added). Thus, the statute refers to, in addition to interest, two other specific types of fees or charges that are controlled by the DIDMCA. It contains also the catch-all provision of \u201cother charges,\u201d demonstrating Congress\u2019 intent to broaden, not narrow, the scope of the statute in this regard. Ultimately, we must decide whether, all other things being equal, finder\u2019s fees, as defined by Maryland law,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> would fall under the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>interpretation of \u201cdiscount points, finance charges, or other charges.\u201d We conclude that they would.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u201cFinance charge\u201d is defined as \u201cthe sum of all charges, payable directly or indirectly by the person to whom the credit is extended, and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a) (2000). This definition also includes finder\u2019s fees and mortgage broker fees as examples of types of charges that could be included in the determination of the finance charge. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(3), (a)(6). From this codified definition, it appears as though Congress intended to include finder\u2019s fees when it enumerated \u201cdiscount points, finance charges, or other charges\u201d as items exempted under \u00a7 501(a) of the DIDMCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The relevant legislative history of the statute supports this conclusion. Senate Report 96-368 states that Congress intended to exempt from state regulation those items included in the annual percentage rate (APR).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The APR is \u201cthe actual cost of borrowing money, expressed as an annualized interest rate.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 831 (8th ed.2004); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1606(a)(1)(A) (2000) (stating that APR is \u201ccalculated according to the actuarial method of allocating payments made on a debt between the amount financed and the amount of the finance charge\u201d). Ms. Sweeney points out that mortgage broker fees were not added to the APR/finance charge definitions until an amendment to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) in 1995.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Her argument is that because the formulation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>what was included in calculating the APR did not contain borrower-paid mortgage broker fees in 1980 when the DIDMCA was enacted, Congress could not have intended to exempt those fees when it expressed its desire to exempt from state regulation fees included in the APR.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Had Congress intended to exempt only those items that were part of the APR in 1980 at the time of the DIDMCA\u2019s enactment, it could have done so by specifically stating what those items were. By using APR, a commonly known and defined term, we believe it was Congress\u2019 intent for the exemption to expand or contract necessarily -with changes in the economic landscape and mortgage lending marketplace. This seems especially true considering that an amendment to the TILA was enacted at the time of the DIDMCA\u2019s passage.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Senate specifically exempted the items making up the APR, knowing that the APR could, and likely would, be altered.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The regulations of the governing federal agency appear to coincide with these conclusions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Congress granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the authority to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) (now the Office of Thrift Supervision) to interpret and regulate the DIDMCA. 12 U.S.C. 1735f-7a(f) (2000). The FHLBB issued a number of regulations to help interpret and govern this area of regulation. Finance charges, as defined by the FHLBB, encompass the \u201ccost of consumer credit as a dollar amount. It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the consumer....\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.4(a) (1996). The same section states that mortgage broker fees are finance charges and finder\u2019s fees are an example of finance charges. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.4(a)(3), (b)(3) (1996). Based on the interpretation of the authorized federal agency, acting in its area of expertise, finder\u2019s fees indeed would be embraced within \u201cdiscount points, finance charges, or other charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\n<em>2. The Finder\u2019s Fee Lato is not a Consumer Protection Statute Exempted From Preemption By the Terms of the DIDMCA.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Congress enumerated a narrow list of consumer protection laws to which the DIDMCA would not be applicable.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The commonality among the items in this list is that Congress wished to allow the States to regulate or continue regulating those areas not related directly to the cost of credit. It is the cost of credit (the APR) that Congress specifically referenced immediately before stating its intent to allow state regulation of certain fees. Ms. Sweeney would prefer an interpretation of the law that would have Congress inhibiting the State\u2019s ability to regulate items encompassed by the cost of credit, while at the same time granting them broad powers to create exceptions that allow the States to enforce any kind of law designed to protect borrowers. Such an interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>intent of Congress would be illogical. Ms. Sweeney relies mainly on the authority of two federal cases in making this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">In <em>Grunbeck v. Dime Sav. Bank of New York, </em>the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that a New Hampshire statute was not preempted by the DIDMCA. 74 F.3d 331, 344 (1st Cir.1996). Ms. Sweeney believes that this decision supports her contention that the Maryland Finder\u2019s Fee Law, as a \u201climitation designed to protect borrowers,\u201d should be exempt from preemption. In <em>Grunbeck, </em>the terms of the mortgage created a situation where the lender essentially was charging interest on interest. <em>Id. </em>at 335. This practice was illegal under New Hampshire\u2019s Simple Interest Statute (SIS) requiring that a lender charge only simple interest<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> on a first mortgage. <em>Id. </em>at 335 n. 1. Although the First Circuit did mention that the SIS afforded considerable protection to consumers, its decision was grounded on the state law not expressly limiting the rate or amount of interest. <em>Id. </em>at 340, 343-44. The case before us is distinguishable in that the Maryland Finder\u2019s Fee Law expressly <em>does </em>limit the rate or amount of the finance charge by capping the finder\u2019s fee at 8%.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The second case relied on by Ms. Sweeney also is not comparable to the case before us. That case involved a Pennsylvania consumer protection statute that prohibited the inclusion of certain non-interest charges in a home improvement loan transaction. <em>In re Barber, </em>266 B.R. 309, 318-19 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.2001). According to the bankruptcy court, because the DIDMCA was intended <em>only </em>to preempt laws that imposed ceilings on interest rates, the Pennsylvania statute was not preempted because it prohibited non-interest charges. <em>Id. </em>at 319. The <em>Barber </em>analysis takes too narrow a view of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the federal statute. As discussed above, the DIDMCA does not apply <em>only </em>to interest rates, but also to \u201cdiscount points, finance charges, or other charges.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1735f-7a(a)(l) (2000). Ms. Sweeney\u2019s case would be distinguishable in any event. The charges involved in <em>Barber </em>were <em>non-interest </em>charges that come within the consumer protection provision of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.3; here, the Finder\u2019s Fee Law limits fees that Congress did not intend to exempt among the enumerated list of consumer protection laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Next, Ms. Sweeney points out that the loans in this case were refinance mortgages, not purchase money loans, and, as a result, the DIDMCA does not apply to the pertinent transaction. In support of this contention, she relies entirely on <em>Mitchell v. Trs. of U.S. Mut. Real Estate Inv. Trust, </em>144 Mich.App. 302, 375 N.W.2d 424 (1985). This reliance is misguided and misinterprets the holding of the Michigan appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">In <em>Mitchell, </em>the court held that the DIDMCA did not preempt the Michigan usury law as it applied to the loan agreement at issue. 375 N.W.2d at 431. The state usury law in Michigan established a hard cap on interest rates at 7%. <em>Id. </em>at 427.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Appellants there took a second, \u201cwraparound\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> mortgage to pay additional debts beyond their original debt for the purchase of their home. <em>Id. </em>at 426. The lender of the wraparound mortgage admitted its loan was subordinate to the original purchase money loan,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and not secured by a first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>lien. <em>Id. </em>at 429. Although the <em>Mitchell </em>court stated in dicta that it believed \u00a7 501 of the DIDMCA should be limited to purchase money loans, it held that the state usury statute was not preempted because the loan at issue did not constitute a first lien. <em>Id. </em>at 481-32. This interpretation coincides with the plain language of the federal statute.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The pertinent portion of the DIDMCA reads: \u201c... the laws of any State expressly limiting the rate or amount of interest . .. shall not apply to any loan ... which is \u2014 secured by a first lien on residential real property....\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1735f-7a(a)(l)(A) (2000). Congress did not intend to apply the DIDMCA preemption to every loan; Congress only preempted state laws regulating loans secured by a first lien. Although the loan in Ms. Sweeney\u2019s case was not a purchase money loan, it was secured by a first lien. Because <em>Mitchell\u2019s </em>holding is legally and factually distinguishable, Ms. Sweeney\u2019s argument, that the DIDMCA does not apply in this case because her mortgage was a refinance transaction, is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">As a final argument, Ms. Sweeney focuses on Savings First\u2019s status as a mortgage broker, rather than a lender/creditor. Ms. Sweeney claims that the intent of the statute was to grant immunity to specific parties to qualified loans from specific types of state laws. Savings First counters that the only matter of importance under the DIDMCA is that the mortgage in question meet the qualifications of the statute, thus exempting the entire transaction from regulation by state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>law. The relative validity and persuasiveness of this argument turns on whether Congress enacted the DIDMCA principally to regulate the actors or the transactions in the regulated field.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In order to have the DIDMCA apply, the transaction must involve a qualifying mortgage. Under \u00a7 1735f-7a(a)(l), a loan or mortgage must meet three requirements: be secured by a first lien on residential real property; be made after 31 March 1980; and be a \u201cfederally related mortgage loan\u201d as defined by the National Housing Act (NHA).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">There is no dispute that Ms. Sweeney\u2019s mortgage with Concorde meets the first two requirements. For a loan to qualify as a federally related mortgage it must satisfy some part of the definition found in \u00a7 527(b) of the NHA. Savings First alleged facts indicating that Concorde was indeed a creditor under the NHA, making loans totaling over $1,000,000 annually. Ms. Sweeney did not dispute these facts. The Concorde mortgage at the center of this controversy qualifies as a \u201cfederally related mortgage.\u201d Having determined that the DIDMCA <em>may </em>apply to the mortgage because it satisfies this requirement of the statute, we must determine if it <em>does </em>apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Savings First contends that because the transaction in question is a qualified mortgage under the DIDMCA, the Finder\u2019s Fee Law is preempted. According to it, once a loan is found to meet the requirements of the federal statute, the transaction is removed from the authority of the states to regulate. In contrast, Ms. Sweeney argues that the DIDMCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>preemption provision operates <em>only </em>with respect to the party acting as the creditor in a qualifying mortgage transaction. Ms. Sweeney argues that Savings First, a mortgage broker, is beyond the narrow scope of the federal law in this regard. We conclude that either party\u2019s interpretation is facially plausible from a fair reading of the plain language of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1735f-7a.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">A statute is ambiguous where it can be reasonably read to have either of two interpretations. Holland, 181 F.3d at 603 (citing <em>Robinson, </em>519 U.S. at 342, 117 S.Ct. at 846, 136 L.Ed.2d at 814); <em>accord Phillips, </em>384 Md. at 591, 865 A.2d at 594. Accordingly, we look to the legislative history to glean, if possible, the purpose of \u00a7 501(a) of the DIDMCA. According to the U.S. Senate Reports published at the time the DIDMCA was enacted, the economic climate of our nation at that time was very different than it is today. In contrast with today\u2019s near record low interest rates and abundance (some would say overabundance) of available credit, the late 1970\u2019s experienced skyrocketing interest rates and lenders unwilling or reluctant to lend. S.Rep. No. 96-368, at 19 (1980); <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 236, 254. Congress determined that a lack of available mortgage funds was in part caused by states restricting interest rates to below market levels:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">The Committee finds that where state usury laws require mortgage rates below market levels of interest, mortgage funds in those states will not be readily available and those funds will flow to other states where market yields are available. This artificial disruption of funds availability not only is harmful to potential home-buyers in states with such usury laws, it also frustrates national housing policies and programs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\"><em>Id. </em>In response, Congress passed the DIDMCA to restrict state usury laws in an effort to \u201cease the severity of the mortgage credit crunches of recent years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18. \u201c[T]he overriding objective of the act was to assist both borrowers and lenders by freeing up additional credit for housing.\u201d <em>Quitter v. Barclays Am./Credit, Inc., </em>764 F.2d 1400, 1403 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Cir.1985) (en banc) (per curiam) (J. Hill, dissenting). Congress, it seems, was focused then on a national housing policy that would encourage lenders to lend and borrowers to borrow. Hindsight informs us today that Congress\u2019 goals in this regard have been exceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">There are few other sources to turn to in order to find further clarification as to who or what was intended to benefit from the preemption provision of the DIDMCA. Ms. Sweeney cites three unpublished opinion letters of the federal agency delegated the responsibility to regulate in this area, claiming support for her position that only lenders qualify as creditors. Although such commentaries are not binding on this Court, there is some guidance to be found there. Two of those letters were a response to specific questions about a lender, and offer little clarification as to the status of a mortgage broker in relation to \u00a7 501(a). The third opinion letter, however, responded to a request to interpret the regulations governing the preemption of state usury laws. 1989 WL 1114192 (O.T.S.) (Eugene M. Katz, Acting Deputy General Counsel, Office of Thrift Supervision) (1989). The agency opinion commented that the FHLBB \u201cnoted that certain lenders will be eligible for usury preemption if they are considered creditors\u201d under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). <em>Id. </em>(quotations removed).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">One thing is certain, mortgage brokers are not included in the definition of \u201ccreditor\u201d under the TILA.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> A 1982 amendment to the TILA narrowed the definition of \u201ccreditor.\u201d At that time, a \u201cperson who regularly arranged for the extension of consumer credit\u201d was removed from the definition of \u201ccreditor.\u201d Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, Pub.L. No. 97-320, \u00a7 702(a), 96 Stat. 1469, 1538 (1982). Prior to the 1982 amendment, the definition easily would have been read to include mortgage brokers as creditors, thus eliminating the question presented in the case before this Court. By removing language from the definition of \u201ccreditor\u201d that could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>include mortgage brokers, we find that Congress intended to <em>eliminate </em>those entities from the definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Savings First argues that this change in definition was an effort to protect real estate brokers from any liability as creditors under the TILA. In so arguing, Savings First cites the Senate report discussing the purpose of the amendment. The report indeed does make specific reference to real estate brokers and the conflict that their inclusion in the definition of \u201ccreditor\u201d creates with Congress\u2019 intent to simplify the TILA. S.Rep. No. 97-536, at 43 (1982); <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3054, 3097. Savings First seems to imply that, because of the specific reference to <em>real estate </em>brokers, Congress was not intending necessarily to limit the definition of \u201ccreditor\u201d to remove <em>mortgage </em>brokers from its coverage. That does not appear to us to be an accurate reading of the Senate report. The report concludes its discussion on' the purpose of section 702(a) of Pub.L. 97-320 with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">[TJhe Committee believes it is essential to clarify this coverage issue and prevent similar questions from arising in the future by eliminating \u201carrangers of credit\u201d from the Act\u2019s coverage and thereby limiting the law\u2019s application to <em>actual professional extenders of credit.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The issue of whether a mortgage broker should have been covered by the TILA certainly may be viewed as a \u201csimilar question\u201d to that of a real estate broker\u2019s inclusion within its coverage. By limiting the law to <em>\u201cactual professional extenders of credit,\u201d </em>Congress foreclosed the need for that question to be addressed by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Based on our interpretation and understanding of the legislative history behind the DIDMCA, and related statutes and regulations, we conclude that Savings First, as a mortgage broker, did not qualify as a creditor regulated by the DIDMCA. We also believe the proper interpretation of the DIDMCA\u2019s preemption provision is to offer immunity from state regulation to lenders in order to promote a national housing policy, not to offer the same protections to any party to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>transaction to which a qualified lender is also party. Therefore, Maryland\u2019s Finder\u2019s Fee Law is not preempted expressly by federal statute on the basis that a mortgage broker is a lender or creditor within the meaning of that statute.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The Maryland Finder\u2019s Fee Law is very narrow in its scope: it applies only to mortgage brokers and the fees they charge borrowers. Congress\u2019s intent in passing the DIDMCA was to protect lenders from state regulation and promote a national housing policy encouraging the free flow of money to borrowers. Mortgage brokers are outside the reach that Congress intended for the federal statute. For that reason, we find that the Finder\u2019s Fee Law is not preempted by the DIDMCA. We reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-12\">.

In <em>Geier, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court referred to this as \u201cconflict preemption.\u201d 529 U.S. at 874, 120 S.Ct. at 1922, 146 L.Ed.2d. at 927.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\">. A brief filed by the amici curiae in support of Ms. Sweeney raised an additional argument that Maryland took advantage of an opt out provision in the DIDMCA, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">At any time after March 31, 1980, any State may adopt a provision of law placing limitations on discount points or such other charges on any loan, mortgage, credit sale, or advance described in subsection (a)(1) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1735f-7a (b)(4) (2000). We agree with Savings First\u2019s response that Maryland did not exercise its ability to opt out of this provision. Although the General Assembly did amend the Finder\u2019s Fee Law after 31 March 1980, the subsections relevant to the present case were left unchanged. <em>See </em>1981 Md. Laws, Chap. 153 (amending \u00a7 12-804 to add subsection (e), barring mortgage brokers from charging finder\u2019s fees when they also act as lender in a transaction); 2000 Md. Laws, Chap. 691 (amending \u00a7 12-804 to change the language of subsections (b) and (e)). The legislative history of the amending bills contained information specifically acknowledging the opt out provision of the federal statute, but did not accept expressly that offer. Had it been the intent of the General Assembly to take advantage of the opt out, we believe it would have acted to do so in explicit terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\">.
