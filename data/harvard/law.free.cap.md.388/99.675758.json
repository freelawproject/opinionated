We conclude that the court did not err and hold that when a DNA method analyzes genetic markers at sufficient locations to arrive at an infinitesimal random match probability, expert opinion testimony of a match and of the source of the DNA evidence is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The Grand Jury for Prince George\u2019s County charged Anthony Eugene Young with, <em>inter alia, </em>three counts of second degree sexual offense and three counts of third degree sexual offense. A jury in Prince George\u2019s County convicted petitioner of one count of second degree sex offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">At trial, the State presented the following evidence: On September 27, 2001, a thirteen year-old boy participated in an internet chat room called \u201cGay Twenties.\u201d Young, who was thirty-seven at the time, participated in the chat room as well. Young contacted the boy via instant messenger <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and telephone and arranged a rendezvous at the boy\u2019s apartment. The next day, Young visited the boy\u2019s home, and the two engaged in oral and anal sex. On October 2, Young visited the boy\u2019s home unannounced and again engaged him in anal sex. During the second encounter, the boy\u2019s mother returned home from work. After Young left, the boy eventually disclosed to his mother what had occurred. Later that night, the mother and child contacted the police. The boy was taken to the hospital where he was examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Identification was the primary issue at trial. The State offered three types of identification evidence. First, the State presented testimonial evidence, primarily that of the boy. Young challenged the testimonial evidence, emphasizing the boy and his mother\u2019s failure to identify Young in a police photo array and claiming that the boy was not credible. Second, the State tendered evidence that Young participated in the chat room. Young did not dispute that evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Third, the State presented DNA evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>The DNA evidence consisted of an analysis of two DNA samples. The first was obtained from the boy by a forensic nurse who examined him at the hospital and took a swab of his rectal area. The second was procured by an officer of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department who, with Young\u2019s consent, took two swabs of Young\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In this appeal, Young challenges the testimony of Rupert Page, a forensic DNA analyst for the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, who examined the samples on behalf of the State. The court received Page as an expert in profiling and forensic serology. Page testified that other than identical twins, no two people have the same DNA profile. He then described his testing of the anal swabs from the boy and the oral swabs from Young. Page explained that he used a process called differential extraction to separate the sperm cells from the boy\u2019s skin cells on the anal swab. He testified that he made a microscope slide of the sperm cells, obtained a DNA profile from the slide, and compared the profile to Young\u2019s profile obtained from the oral swabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In response to the State\u2019s questions, Page repeatedly testified that the two DNA profiles \u201cmatched.\u201d Page did not provide any basis for this conclusion, other than to state that his conclusion was based on his comparison of the two samples. He did not identify which DNA sequences he reviewed, and only on cross-examination did he note that he employed the polymerase chain reaction (\u201cPCR\u201d) method. Page did not testify to the probability that a random person\u2019s profile would have matched the profile taken from the boy. Defense counsel objected repeatedly, arguing that, based on <em>Armstead v. State, </em>342 Md. 38, 673 A.2d 221 (1996), the witness was required to provide probability statistics to accompany and support his conclusion. For example, defense counsel stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">\u201cYour Honor, the Armstead case concluded.... My understanding is that the Court of Appeals concluded that the legislature intended to render the sexual statistics admissible, not just the raw evidence of DNA match, and what the State seems to be trying to do is to say there is a match as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>opposed to providing what the statistical information was that was provided to give the jury a chance to make that determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The court permitted the witness to testify that the DNA profiles \u201cmatched,\u201d but did not allow him to testify that Young was the source of the DNA obtained from the anal swab. Instead, the court admitted into evidence Page\u2019s DNA report, over defense counsel\u2019s objection. In this report, Page noted that he employed the PCR method and the AmpFISTR Profiler Plus PCR Amplification Kit and AmpFISTR Cofiler PCR Amplification Eat to examine DNA markers along a combined thirteen loci and a gender identification locus.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Page concluded, \u201cThe sperm fraction of the Anal Swab (Rl) contains DNA from a male. To a reasonable degree of scientific certainty (in the absence of an identical twin), Anthony Young (Kl) is the source of the DNA obtained from the sperm fraction of the Anal Swab (Rl).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Page\u2019s report contained no statistical data to support his conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Young\u2019s cross-examination of Page focused on the whereabouts of a particular piece of evidence not presented at trial and on the significance of Page\u2019s references to \u201ctechnical artifacts\u201d in his comparison of the DNA samples. Young did not ask Page any questions about statistics.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The State relied heavily on the evidence that the DNA samples matched. In its opening statement, the State argued that the DNA evidence showed \u201ca perfect match, all the way down the line\u201d and that the \u201cDNA evidence will prove conclusively that Anthony Young was the source of the semen recovered from [the victim\u2019s] anus, removing any doubt you may have whatsoever, leading to the only conclusion, and that is the conclusion that Anthony Young is guilty of the charges submitted to you.\u201d In its closing statement, the State argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>that the DNA evidence revealed \u201can exact match\u201d \u201cstraight down the line.\u201d In its rebuttal argument, the State responded to Young\u2019s challenges to the testimony of identification and the victim\u2019s credibility by pointing to the DNA evidence. In response to Young\u2019s emphasis of the failure to identify him in the photo array, the State said, \u201cThat\u2019s a red herring. You know why? Because it doesn\u2019t make any difference, because the DNA says it was Anthony Young who had anal intercourse with [the victim]. So don\u2019t be fooled by that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The jury found Young guilty of one count of second degree sexual offense. The court sentenced Young to a term of twenty years incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Young noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, that court affirmed. The Court of Special Appeals appears to have relied on two bases. First, the court distinguished <em>Armstead v. State, </em>342 Md. 38, 673 A.2d 221 (1996). The court explained that while a DNA match based on a comparison of one locus is virtually meaningless without accompanying statistical testimony, a match at thirteen different loci has such a low random match probability that there is no requirement of accompanying statistical data. Second, the court held that even if statistical evidence were required, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">We granted Young\u2019s petition for a Writ of Certiorari. 384 Md. 157, 862 A.2d 993 (2004). Young raises the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">\u201cWhether it was error to admit \u2018expert testimony\u2019 that there was a DNA \u2018match\u2019 in the absence of any foundation for such an assertion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals and hold that the Circuit Court did not err in admitting the expert\u2019s testimony of a match in conjunction with testimony that to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, the defendant was the source of the DNA evidence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In this Court, Young argues that the trial court erred in overruling his objections to Page\u2019s testimony. He contends that <em>Armstead </em>requires the admission of contextual statistics when the State asserts that there is a DNA match. According to Young, stating that DNA profiles match without providing the statistical probability is meaningless, because DNA statistics vary based on the defendant\u2019s ethnic group or the number of loci examined. In Young\u2019s view, Page\u2019s testimony thus had no probative value and was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The State responds that the DNA evidence was relevant and admissible, without any testimony about statistical probability. According to the State, <em>Armstead </em>did not require testimony about statistical probability. Rather, this Court\u2019s strong statements about the admissibility of statistical probability testimony should be viewed in the context of Armstead\u2019s questioning of the testimony\u2019s admissibility and the controversy within the scientific community about the validity of such evidence. In addition, the State argues that scientific advances in DNA testing since <em>Armstead </em>have eliminated any uncertainty about the meaning of the term \u201cmatch.\u201d The State contends that in all cases, the probability that another person besides an identical twin has the same DNA profile has become so remote that an expert witness can testify to a DNA match without explaining the statistical probability. In the alternative, the State argues that even if the court erred, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Given the scientific advancements resulting in a remote probability that another individual has an identical profile to Young, the jury could not have been swayed by testimony of the probability.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">We conclude that scientific advances in DNA profiling enable an examiner employing particular methods and analyzing genetic markers at a sufficient number of loci to testify, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, to the source of the DNA evidence. We hold that in such circumstances, as in the instant case, the expert is not required to accompany his \u201cmatch\u201d testimony with contextual statistics. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Circuit Court did not err in admitting the expert\u2019s testimony of a match.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">III.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">We have described the science of DNA evidence as follows: \u201cDeoxyribonucleic acid (\u2018DNA\u2019) is the organic material that provides the genetic instructions for all individual hereditary characteristics. <em>See Armstead v.

The PCR method can be carried out in a laboratory, with results obtained in a significantly shorter time than with the previously common restriction fragment length polymorphism (\u201cRFLP\u201d) analysis. NRC II at 70. Additionally, the PCR method usually permits an exact identification of each allele, sidestepping RFLP\u2019s measurement uncertainties. <em>Id. </em>These advantages, along with the method\u2019s utility for analyzing minute DNA samples, have resulted in a vast expansion in the use of the PCR method. <em>Id.; see State v. Belken, </em>633 N.W.2d 786, 798 (Iowa 2001) (noting that \u201cthe PCR method has emerged as the predominant method of DNA typing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Once PCR amplification has been completed, analysis of the DNA profile and match determination can be conducted through the utilization of several different genetic markers. <em>See Tankersley, </em>956 P.2d at 490. The markers employed by the laboratory in the instant case are short tandem repeats (\u201cSTR\u201d). STRs are DNA sequences consisting of two to six base pairs. <em>See Commonwealth v. Rosier, </em>425 Mass. 807, 685 N.E.2d 739, 742 (1997); John M. Butler &amp; Christopher H. Becker, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, <em>Improved Analysis of DNA ShoH Tandem Repeats With Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry 2 </em>(2001). STRs particularly are useful in analyzing small DNA samples, because loci containing STRs are present with great frequency throughout the chromosomes. <em>See Rosier, </em>685 N.E.2d at 742. The loci have a large number of alleles and usually are susceptible to unique identification. <em>Id. </em>The FBI has designated thirteen core STR loci and a sex-typing marker (amelogenin) for identification in its national database of convicted felons, the Combined DNA Index System (\u201cCO-DIS\u201d). <em>See </em>Butler &amp; Becker, <em>supra, </em>at 2.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>DNA profiling typically is used to compare a suspect\u2019s DNA with a sample of DNA taken from a crime scene. <em>See Amstead, 342 </em>Md. at 52, 673 A.2d at 228. \u201cDNA profiling\u201d is a catch-all term for a wide range of methods employed to study genetic variations, including RFLP and PCR/STR typing. <em>See Tankersley, </em>956 P.2d at 491. All types of DNA analysis involve three basic steps: (1) processing or typing of the DNA samples (to produce x-ray films that indicate the lengths of the polymorphic fragments); (2) match determination (comparison of the films to determine whether any sets of fragments match); and (3) statistical analysis (to determine the statistical significance of any match between the two DNA samples). <em>See id.; Nelson v. State, </em>628 A.2d 69, 75 (Del.1993). This three-step process produces two distinct, but interrelated, types of information: (1) molecular biological information (whether a match exists between an unknown DNA sample and a sample taken from a suspect); and (2) population genetics information (if a match exists, the statistical probability that the unknown sample came from a third party with the same DNA pattern as the suspect). <em>See Nelson, </em>628 A.2d at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">DNA evidence cannot be attributed conclusively to one person unless examiners analyze the entire DNA molecules of the DNA evidence and the DNA sample from that person respectively. Two unrelated individuals can have identical DNA fragments that are examined in a particular type of DNA <em>analysis </em>\u2014 i.e., identical DNA patterns at the targeted loci. <em>See Nelson, </em>628 A.2d at 75; <em>State v. Williams, </em>574 N.W.2d 293, 297 (Iowa 1998); <em>State v. Vandebogart, </em>136 N.H. 365, 616 A.2d 483, 486 (1992); <em>State v. Cauthron, </em>120 Wash.2d 879, 846 P.2d 502, 513 (1993) (en banc). The underlying theory of the forensic use of DNA testing is that as the number and variability of the polymorphisms analyzed increases, the odds of two people coincidentally sharing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>same DNA profile becomes vanishingly small. <em>Williams, </em>574 N.W.2d at 297; <em>see also Commonwealth v. Crews, </em>586 Pa. 508, 640 A.2d 395, 401 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Therefore, when a DNA \u201cmatch\u201d has been declared, a conclusive identification of a crime suspect as the source of the unknown DNA sample is not being made. Rather, the suspect simply has been \u201cincluded\u201d as a possible source of the DNA material, because the suspect\u2019s DNA sample has matched the crime scene DNA sample at a certain number of critical alleles. <em>See Tankersley, </em>956 P.2d at 490; <em>Williams, </em>574 N.W.2d at 297; <em>Vandebogart, </em>616 A.2d at 486; <em>Crews, </em>640 A.2d at 401; George Bundy Smith <em>&amp; </em>Janet A. Gordon, <em>The Admission of DNA Evidence in State and Federal Courts, </em>65 Fordham L.Rev. 2465, 2472 (1997). The issue still remains of just how many other people in the population could share the same DNA profile with the suspect. <em>See Tankersley, </em>956 P.2d at 490; Smith &amp; Gordon, <em>supra, </em>at 2486.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Once a DNA match determination has been made, forensic scientists perform statistical analysis of population frequencies to estimate the statistical significance of the match, by calculating the likelihood that a random person <em>(i.e., </em>not the person whose DNA actually was left at the crime scene) would match the crime scene sample, commonly referred to as the \u201crandom match probability.\u201d <em>See Tankersley, </em>956 P.2d at 490; <em>Nelson, </em>628 A.2d at 75; <em>Williams, </em>574 N.W.2d at 297; <em>Watts v.

In order to make a statistical evaluation of a declared match, it is necessary to know how frequently a genotype occurs in the relevant reference population. <em>See State v. Carter, </em>246 Neb. 953, 524 N.W.2d 763, 776, 780 (1994). Genotype frequency calculations are performed to determine the relative frequency of a random match within a sample population database. <em>See Commonwealth v.

These probability estimates are achieved using theoretical population genetics models in order to determine the frequency with which a given genetic pattern will occur in a defined population. <em>See Watts, </em>733 So.2d at 225; <em>Vandebogart, </em>616 A.2d at 488; Smith &amp; Gordon, <em>supra, </em>at 2473-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Probability calculations generally are made using the \u201cproduct rule.\u201d The product rule, also known as the \u201cmultiplication method,\u201d states that the likelihood of a match occurring for an entire DNA segment can be determined by calculating the match probability for each polymorphic allele and then multiplying those probabilities together. <em>See Armstead, </em>342 Md. at 69-70, 673 A.2d at 236; <em>Williams, </em>574 N.W.2d at 297; <em>Curnin, </em>565 N.E.2d at 448; <em>Watts, </em>733 So.2d at 224-25; <em>Vandebogart, </em>616 A.2d at 488; <em>Cauthron, </em>846 P.2d at 513. To give a basic example, if a matching DNA sample contains two independent alleles, and there is a 10% chance of a random match of the first allele and a 20% chance of a random match of the second, the product rule would suggest that there was a two percent chance that a random person in the population shared the same DNA profile (.10 x .20 = .02).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The State argues that recent scientific advances in DNA analysis have resulted in infinitesimal random match probabilities, thus eliminating the necessity for the State to accompany match evidence with statistical evidence.

The fact remains that a match cannot identify the source of the relevant DNA sample conclusively unless the entire DNA molecule is viewed. Under certain circumstances, however, new technologies result in infinitesimal random match probabilities that would be deemed conclusive by all but mathematicians and philosophers. The instant case thus confronts us -with the question of whether and to what extent these scientific advances have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>altered the holding of <em>Armstead </em>that contextual statistics <em>must </em>accompany match testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Central to this question is whether, in such cases, a trial court may permit testimony of \u201csource attribution.\u201d A witness testifying to \u201csource attribution\u201d or \u201cuniqueness\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> would state that in the absence of identical twins, it can be concluded to a reasonable scientific certainty that the evidence sample and the defendant sample came from the same person <em>(i.e. </em>from the same source). <em>See </em>L.M. Goos et al., <em>The Influence of Probabilistic Statements on the Evaluation of the Significance of a DNA Match, </em>35 Can. Soc\u2019y Forensic Sci. 77, 81 (2002). Source attribution would fulfill the need to give meaning to the term \u201cmatch.\u201d Source attribution would inform the jury that the matching patterns are as unique as the Mona Lisa, and not as common as a picture with two eyes or even a four-leaf clover.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The first report of the National Research Council unambiguously presented accompanying statistical testimony as necessary and emphasized the inappropriateness of testifying to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>uniqueness of the genotype. The National Research Council recognized the potential for unique identification, but noted that the typing systems employed at that time did not examine enough loci. The report stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">\u201cCan DNA typing uniquely identify the source of a sample? Because any two human genomes differ at about 3 million sites, no two persons (barring identical twins) have the same DNA sequence. Unique identification with DNA typing is therefore possible provided that enough sites of variation are examined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201cHowever, the DNA typing systems used today examine only a few sites of variation and have only limited resolution for measuring the variability at each site.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Committee on DNA Forensic Science, National Research Council, <em>DNA Technology in Forensic Science </em>74 (1992) [hereinafter \u201cNRC I\u201d]. The report then concluded that \u201c[t]o say that two patterns match, without providing any scientifically valid estimate (or, at least, an upper bound) of the frequency with which such matches might occur by chance, is meaningless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a consequence of its comments about uniqueness, the report stated that the current DNA methods did not permit experts to testify to uniqueness. The report stated as follows: \u201cRegardless of the calculated frequency, an expert should \u2014 given ... the relatively small number of loci used and the available population data \u2014 avoid assertions in court that a particular genotype is unique in the population.\u201d NRC I at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">With the rapid scientific advances in DNA typing, the National Research Council presented an updated view of uniqueness in its 1996 report. Defining \u201cuniqueness,\u201d the Committee stated that an evidentiary profile \u201cmight be said to be unique if it is so rare that it becomes unreasonable to suppose that a second person in the population might have the same profile.\u201d NRC II at 136. Addressing the comment of the 1992 report that, given the small number of loci used, an expert should not testify to uniqueness, the 1996 report stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>\u201cBecause more population data and loci already are available, and still more will be available soon, we are approaching the time when many scientists will wish to offer opinions about the source of incriminating DNA....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">\u201cWe can say only that after one reaches some threshold, the point at which DNA testing is extensive enough to warrant an opinion as to the identity of the source becomes a matter of judgment. Does a profile frequency of the reciprocal of twice the Earth\u2019s population suffice? Ten times? One hundred times? There is no \u2018bright-line\u2019 standard in law or science that can pick out exactly how small the probability of the existence of a given profile in more than one member of a population must be before assertions of uniqueness are justified.... There might already be cases in which it is defensible for an expert to assert that, assuming that there has been no sample mishandling or laboratory error, the profile\u2019s probable uniqueness means that the two DNA samples come from the same person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">\u201cOpinion testimony about uniqueness would simplify the presentation of evidence by dispensing with specific estimates of population frequencies or probabilities. If the basis of an opinion were attacked on statistical grounds, however, or if frequency or probability estimates were admitted, this advantage would be lost. Nevertheless, because the difference between a vanishingly small probability and an opinion of uniqueness is so slight, courts that decide on a criterion for uniqueness and determine that the criterion has been met may choose to allow the latter along with, or instead of, the former, when the scientific findings support such testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 194-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The National Research Council\u2019s conclusions make clear that once profile frequency reaches a certain level of infinitesimalness, there is no scientific basis for requiring statistical testimony to accompany match testimony. The 1996 report accepted the concern about scientific justifiability articulated in the 1992 report and adopted as a rationale in <em>Armstead; </em>the 1996 report stated that \u201cit would not be scientifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>justifiable to speak of a match as proof of identity in the absence of underlying data that permit some reasonable estimate of how rare the matching characteristics actually are.\u201d NRC II at 192. It concluded, however, that once a profile may be considered unique, it is scientifically justifiable to testify to a match without accompanying statistics. <em>Id. </em>(stating that \u201c[o]nce science has established that a methodology has some individualizing power, the legal system must determine whether and how best to import that technology into the trial process\u201d). Additionally, the National Research Council concluded that at the point in which the profile is considered unique, source attribution would be an appropriate means to explain a match to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 195; <em>see also </em>Bruce Budowle et al., <em>Source Attribution of a Forensic DNA Profile, </em>2 Forensic Sci. Comm.

As the excerpt from the NRC II report indicates, there appears to be wide agreement that defining \u201cuniqueness\u201d is not a statistical task; rather courts or legislatures can determine under what circumstances and with less than what statistical probability a profile can be considered \u201cunique.\u201d <em>See </em>NRC 11 at 137, 194; James F.

Cauthron, </em>120 Wash.2d 879, 846 P.2d 502 (1993) (en banc), experts testified that the DNA sample from the victims matched the defendant\u2019s DNA profile and that they had no doubt that the defendant was the source of the samples. Relying in large part on the 1992 National Research Council report, the Washington Supreme Court held that the trial court erred in permitting the experts to testify to uniqueness and to testify of a match without accompanying statistics. <em>Id. </em>at 515-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In <em>State v. Buckner, </em>125 Wash.2d 915, 890 P.2d 460 (1995) (en banc) (per curiam), an expert testified that the DNA evidence taken from the victim and the defendant matched, that the random match probability among people of European descent was one in 19.25 billion, and that the profile was unique. The court reversed, holding that the expert\u2019s testimony of uniqueness violated <em>Cauthron\u2019s </em>holding. <em>Id. </em>at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Following the release of the 1996 National Resource Council report, the court reconsidered its decision. In <em>State v. Buckner, </em>133 Wash.2d 63, 941 P.2d 667 (1997) (en banc), a unanimous court repudiated its previous opinion. The court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">\u201cThe original opinion in this case also disapproved testimony in terms of statistical probabilities which implies or states that defendant is uniquely identified as the person in the human population who left the forensic sample. In 1993, this court accepted the proposition that an absolute identification of an individual could be made based upon DNA analysis provided that the technology exists to do so, because, except for identical twins, each individual\u2019s DNA is unique. <em>State v. Cauthron, </em>120 Wash.2d 879, 900, 846 P.2d 502 (1993). At the time <em>Cauthron </em>was decided, we understood that this stage of technology would exist only when the entire DNA molecule could be compared to another entire DNA molecule. <em>Id. </em>It is now apparent that is not the case, as explained in the newest report of the National Research Council\u2019s Committee on DNA Forensic Science. <em>That rejDort ... states: \u2018The match probability computed in forensic analysis refers to a particular evidentiary profile. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>That profile might he said to be unique if it is so rare that it becomes unreasonable to suppose that a second person in the population might have the same profile.\u2019 </em>National Research Council, Commission on DNA Forensic Science: <em>The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence </em>136 (1996). \u201cThus, we now conclude there should be no bar to an expert giving his or her expert opinion that, based upon an exceedingly small probability of a defendant\u2019s DNA profile matching that of another in a random human population, the profile is unique. As in the case of all expert testimony, the opposing side will be able to challenge the expert\u2019s opinion and present its own experts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 667-68 (emphasis added); <em>see also Burmingham v.

State, </em>342 Md. 38, 673 A.2d 221 (1996), restriction fragment length polymorphism (\"RFLP\u201d) analysis was the most common method used in forensic DNA analysis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>RFLP involves the use of the DNA loci that contain \"variable number tandem repeat\" (\"VNTR\") sequences, which are stretches of DNA in which a short nucleotide core sequence of base pairs is repeated in tandem along the chromosome.

As a result of VNTR sequencing, the length of a given allele, which is measured by the number of repeated base pairs, varies from person to person. <em>See State v. Vandebogart, </em>136 N.H. 365, 616 A.2d 483, 486 (1992). VNTR loci particularly are useful in forensic DNA analysis because they have a very large number of different alleles. <em>See Armstead, </em>342 Md. at 52, 673 A.2d at 227. RFLP analysis yields distinct DNA profiles because the exact number of repeats, and therefore the length of the VNTR region, varies from one allele to another, and different VNTR alleles can be identified by their length. <em>See </em>Smith &amp; Gordon, <em>supra, </em>at 2467.

The terms \"source attribution\u201d and \"uniqueness\u201d appear to be used interchangeably. To the extent that the terms have been distinguished, authors have preferred \"source attribution,\u201d in order to emphasize that the relevant reference population depends on the context of the case. Thus, the expert should calculate the probability that another person within the relevant population of potential sources of the DNA sample would share the DNA profile. The relevant population typically will not be the entire world population. For that reason, the expert attributes the source of the sample, rather than claiming that the defendant\u2019s DNA profile is \"unique.\u201d <em>See </em>Bruce Budowle et al., <em>Source Attribution of a Forensic DNA Profile, </em>2 Forensic Sci.
