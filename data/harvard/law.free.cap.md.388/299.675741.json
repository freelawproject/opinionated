Dr. Goldstein, an orthopedic surgeon, sought a determination of whether PCIGC or Medical Mutual was obligated to provide a defense and indemnification for him in a contribution action filed by Montague Blundon, III, M.D. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County held that both companies were obligated to provide a defense and to indemnify Dr. Goldstein. PCIGC and Medical Mutual appealed. Prior to consideration of the matter in the Court of Special Appeals we granted <em>certiorari </em>on our own motion. <em>See Medical Mutual Liability Society of Maryland v. Goldstein, </em>385 Md. 161, 867 A.2d 1062 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>PCIGC contends that the trial court erred in failing to apply the bar date restriction included in the definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d in PCIGC\u2019s operating statute, Md.Code (1995, 2003 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 9-301(d)(l) of the Insurance Article (\u201cINS\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the alternative, it argues that the trial court erred in determining that PCIGC and Medical Mutual have a co-extensive duty to defend and indemnify Dr. Goldstein. According to PCIGC, the trial court\u2019s interpretation violated INS \u00a7 9-310,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which requires Dr. Goldstein to exhaust coverage by another insurer before pursuing coverage by PCIGC. Medical Mutual argues that the trial court erred in declaring it responsible for the defense and indemnification because its policy explicitly excludes coverage for claims \u201cfirst made\u201d prior to the policy period. It also argues that Dr. Goldstein should be estopped from taking a position that is inconsistent with the theory, which he successfully argued against PCIGC, that the contribution claim is \u201cthe same injury\u201d asserted in the medical malpractice action because it is an \u201cadditional claim made for damages resulting from the same injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">We hold that, based on the plain language of the statute, Dr. Goldstein\u2019s claim for indemnification is not a \u201ccovered claim\u201d because it was not presented to PCIGC prior to the absolute and final bar date as required by INS \u00a7 9-301(d)(l)(ii). Timely notice to PCIGC of an actual claim is not timely notice of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>potential claims arising out of the same event. Accordingly, PCIGC is not obligated to provide a defense and to indemnify Dr. Goldstein in the contribution action. Additionally, we hold that, based on the language of the Medical Mutual policy, Medical Mutual is not required to provide a defense or indemnification to Dr. Goldstein in the contribution action. Although the contribution action was \u201cfirst made\u201d during the coverage period, January 1, 2002, to January 1, 2003, the first claim against Dr. Goldstein arising out of the injury to Ms. Taylor was made prior to the coverage period. The policy specifically states that \u201c[a]ll \u2018claims\u2019 for damages arising out of any one \u2018incident\u2019 will be deemed to have been made at the time the first of those \u2018claims\u2019 is first made against any insured.\u201d Therefore, the claim is not covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The contribution action arose from a medical malpractice suit brought by Shirley Taylor against Doctors Goldstein and Blundon on January 6, 1995. The malpractice suit, HCA No. 95-006, arose from a surgical procedure performed in 1992 on Ms. Taylor\u2019s hip by Dr. Blundon. Dr. Goldstein assisted in the surgery. On February 20, 1997, the Health Claims Arbitration Panel entered an award against Dr. Blundon in the amount of $503,189.64, and entered an award in favor of Dr. Goldstein. On November 20, 1997, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County confirmed the Panel\u2019s determination. Dr. Blundon appealed. We affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling. <em>See Blundon v. Taylor, </em>364 Md. 1, 770 A.2d 658 (2001). No appeal was taken by either Dr. Blundon or Ms. Taylor regarding the Panel\u2019s conclusion in favor of Dr. Goldstein. On April 16, 2002, Dr. Blundon filed the underlying contribution action, HCA No. 2002-177, seeking $312,450 plus cost and interest from Dr. Goldstein. The contribution action has been stayed pending the outcome of this litigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>After receiving notice of the contribution action, Dr. Gold-stein notified Medical Mutual and PCIGC. He sought a defense and indemnification from both companies pursuant to his respective insurance policies. PCIGC denied coverage on the basis that the claim was filed two-and-a-half years after the final bar date established in the PIE Mutual insolvency proceeding and, therefore, the claim was not a \u201ccovered claim\u201d within the meaning of INS \u00a7 9-301(d)(l). Medical Mutual denied coverage on the basis that the policy Dr. Goldstein maintained with the company was a \u201cclaims first made\u201d policy which limits coverage to \u201cclaims which are first made against any insured during the policy period for \u2018incidents\u2019 occurring after the Retroactive Date specified in the Declaration.\u201d The policy further states that \u201call claims for damages arising out of any one \u2018incident\u2019 -will be deemed to have been made at the time the first of those \u2018claims\u2019 is first made against any insured.\u201d Medical Mutual took the position that because the underlying medical malpractice suit was the first claim made against an insurer for damages arising out of the treatment of Ms. Taylor, the claim was \u201cfirst made\u201d in 1995 and, therefore, not covered by its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">In March of 2003, Dr. Goldstein filed a declaratory judgment action against PCIGC and Medical Mutual to determine whether either company was obligated to provide him with a defense and indemnification in the contribution action. PCIGC filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative a motion for summary judgment on the same grounds that it originally denied the claim. On June 2, 2003, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County denied PCIGC\u2019s motion on the basis that the language of the PIE Mutual policy,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which defines the contribution action as a claim pursuant to the policy, \u201cdoes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>have some relevance.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">PCIGC filed a motion for reconsideration and Dr. Goldstein filed a motion for summary judgment. The court began the hearing by noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">To me, when I read it, the claim itself clearly falls within the definition of a covered claim under the PIE [Mutual] policy. The issue is does the statute which defines covered claim, change that when it refers to the time it has to be filed and the order with the absolute drop dead bar date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">After argument by both parties the court granted Dr. Gold-stein\u2019s motion, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">The aspect of this claim that we\u2019re talking about which, in essence, is the cross claim not filed earlier, is only under the PIE [Mutual] policy because it is an extension of the original claim that was made. And, since the earlier one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>was timely, this being the extension of it, I\u2019m finding that it is as well timely and not covered by the bar date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">PCIGC indicated that they would appeal the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In May of 2004, Dr. Goldstein filed a motion for summary judgment against Medical Mutual. Medical Mutual opposed the motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on the \u201cclaim first made\u201d basis discussed above. Medical Mutual also argued that Dr. Goldstein should be estopped from taking a position that is inconsistent with the theory that he successfully argued against PCIGC, that the contribution claim is \u201cthe same injury\u201d asserted in the medical malpractice action because it is an \u201cadditional claim made for damages resulting from the same injury.\u201d On July 6, 2004, a hearing was held regarding the motions. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">Well, it is truly a fascinating issue and I think the art of writing insurance policies is trying to figure out all the permutations and combinations of things that could happen in the future and plan for them. And here we have two different policies with slightly different language in the policies and I guess the question is can you walk that fine line where potentially you could have coverage by both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">And looking at the language in the old, in the PIE [Mutual] policy, any additional claim made for damages resulting in the same injuries shall be considered a claim hereunder, which doesn\u2019t seem to have the same parameters on it and it seems to me that there is kind of a narrow alley between those respective coverage definitions that would allow for coverage of the Med Mutual policy, without being inconsistent, which it does, at first glance, seem to be but it seems to me that under both of those languages, that coverage could be found without one contradicting the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">So for those reasons, I am going to find that summary judgment is appropriate in favor of Dr. Goldstein. I do find that there is no genuine dispute as to material fact and that the fair and appropriate reading of the policy would provide that this is a claim made within the coverage period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>The appeals from both declaratory judgment actions were consolidated into the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We recently discussed our standard of review for a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in the case of <em>Rockwood Cas. Ins. Co. v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>385 Md. 99, 867 A.2d 1026 (2005). We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">Under Md. Rule 2-501(e), summary judgment may be granted if \u201cthe motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d When making a summary judgment decision, the trial court must npt determine any disputed facts. Rather, considering the undisputed facts, the court must decide if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Williams v.

Subsequently, PIE Mutual was determined to be insolvent and the Franklin County court executed an order of liquidation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>On February 17, 1999, the Franklin County court entered an order stating, in relev\u00e1nt part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">2.

It is governed by subtitle 3 of Title 9 of the Insurance Article. INS \u00a7\u00a7 9-301 through 9-316. It is a private, nonprofit, nonstock corporation. INS \u00a7 9-304(a)(2). The purpose of the subtitle is \u201cto provide a mechanism for the prompt payment of covered claims under certain policies and to avoid financial loss to residents of the State who are claimants or policyholders of an insolvent insurer; and to provide for the assessment of the cost of payments of covered claims and protection among insurers.\u201d INS \u00a7 9-302. Insurance companies doing business in Maryland are required as a condition of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>authority to transact business in the State to be a member of PCIGC. INS \u00a7 9-304(b). Member insurance companies pay an annual assessment to cover the expenses of PCIGC incurred as a result of an insurance company\u2019s insolvency. INS \u00a7 9-306(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">PCIGC is only obligated to pay \u201ccovered claims.\u201d INS \u00a7 9-306;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>see also Maryland, Motor Truck, </em>386 Md. at 95, 871 A.2d at 594. The term \u201ccovered claim\u201d is defined in INS \u00a7 9-301(d). It provides, in relevant part, that a \u201ccovered claim\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALf\">(1) [A]n insolvent insurer\u2019s unpaid obligation, including an unearned premium: (i) that: 1. A .... arises out of a policy of the insolvent insurer issued to a resident or payable to a resident on behalf of an insured of the insolvent insurer; (ii) that is presented on or before the last date fixed for the filing of claims in the domiciliary delinquency proceeding as a claim to the corporation or to the receiver in the State; (iii) that: ... was incurred or existed before, on, or within 30 days after the determination of insolvency; and (iv) that arises out of a policy or surety bond of the insolvent insurer issued for a kind of insurance to which the subtitle applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEY\">INS \u00a7 9 \u2014 301(d)(1). Accordingly, PCIGC is obligated to provide Dr. Goldstein with a defense in the contribution action provided the claim is an unpaid obligation of PIE Mutual that satisfies all four requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">PCIGC does not challenge Dr. Goldstein\u2019s position that the contribution action is an unpaid obligation of PIE Mutual. The PIE Mutual policy provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">If any claim is first made during the policy period alleging injury to an individual that would be covered by this policy, any additional claim made for damages resulting from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>same injury shall be considered a claim hereunder. A claim shall be considered to be first made when the Company first receives written notice of the claim or occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">By the terms of the policy, the contribution claim is an \u201cadditional claim made for damages resulting from\u201d the injury to Ms. Taylor, and, consequently, is considered a claim under the policy. Likewise, PCIGC does not challenge that the requirements (i), (iii), and (iv) are met. What PCIGC does dispute is requirement (ii) \u2014 that a claim must be presented to PCIGC on or before the last date fixed for the filing of claims in the domiciliary proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The \u201clast date fixed for the filing of claims\u201d or \u201cthe Absolute Final Bar Date\u201d in the liquidation of PIE Mutual, as established by the Court of Common Pleas for Franklin County, was September 23,1999. The contribution action was filed April 16, 2002, approximately two-and-a-half years after the \u201clast date fixed for the filing of claims.\u201d Apparently, Dr. Goldstein had no notice of the contribution suit until it was filed. Although the record does not indicate precisely when Dr. Goldstein notified PCIGC of the lawsuit, beyond stating that he did notify them after he received notice of the action, he clearly notified them after September 23,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995). \u201cThe first step in determining legislative intent is to look at the statutory language and \u2018if the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as written.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204, 1204 (1994)). Based on the plain language of the statute, the contribution claim is not a \u201ccovered claim\u201d because it was not \u201cpresented [to PCIGC] on or before the last date fixed for the filing of claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Despite the plain language of the statute, Dr. Goldstein contends that in determining what qualifies as a \u201ccovered claim\u201d within the meaning of the statute, the court should look <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>to the underlying insurance policy. His argument is that because the contribution claim would be a claim under the policy, it is a \u201ccovered claim\u201d within the meaning of the statute. In support of this argument, he relies on the case of <em>Igwilo v. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Corp., </em>131 Md.App. 629, 750 A.2d 646 (2000). The question in <em>Igivilo </em>was how many \u201ccovered claims\u201d existed. The court quoted from INS \u00a7 9-301(d) for the definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d stating that it is \u201can insolvent insurer\u2019s unpaid obligation . .. that ... arises out of a policy of the insolvent insurer.\u201d <em>Igwilo, </em>131 Md.App. at 637, 750 A.2d at 650. The court looked to the language of the policy and concluded that there existed two \u201ccovered claims\u201d that were subject to the $299,900 statutory cap per \u201ccovered claim.\u201d <em>Igwilo, </em>131 Md.App. at 645, 750 A.2d at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Dr. Goldstein\u2019s reliance on <em>Igwilo </em>is misplaced. As we noted in the present case, the definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d in INS \u00a7 9 \u2014 301(d)(1) encompasses more than the section quoted in the Court of Special Appeals opinion. It is a four-part definition that places limitations on what qualifies as a \u201ccovered claim\u201d pursuant to the statute. The intermediate appellate court in <em>Igwilo </em>aptly noted that \u201cwhat constitutes a \u2018claim\u2019 under the policy does not resolve the issue of what constitutes a \u2018covered claim\u2019 under the statute.\u201d <em>Igwilo, </em>131 Md.App. at 641, 750 A.2d at 652. By definition, not all claims recognizable under the insurance policy are \u201ccovered claims\u201d pursuant to the statute. Only those \u201cunpaid obligations\u201d of the insolvent insurer that satisfy all four parts of the definition are \u201ccovered claims\u201d pursuant to the statute. If we adopted Dr. Goldstein\u2019s position that the sole question in determining what qualifies as a \u201ccovered claim\u201d is whether the claim would be covered by the underlying policy, then sections (d)(ii)-(iv) of INS \u00a7 9-301 would be rendered meaningless. Such a result is contrary to our case law. <em>See Mayor &amp; Council of Rockville v. Rylyns Enterprises, Inc., </em>372 Md. 514, 550, 814 A.2d 469, 490 (2002) (stating that \u201c[i]f reasonably possible, a statute is to be read so that no word, phrase, clause, or sentence is rendered surplus-age or meaningless\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Dr. Goldstein further argues that because the PIE Mutual policy states that \u201cany additional claim made for damages resulting from the same injury shall be considered a claim hereunder,\u201d presentment of the medical malpractice claim \u201ccomprehended not only the immediate claim set forth in the [medical malpractice] complaint, but also any additional claims arising from the same injury.\u201d The argument continues saying, \u201c[tjherefore, the presentment that PCIGC received for [the medical malpractice suit] before the bar date comprehended the presentment of the contribution claim.\u201d This appears to be the position taken by the Circuit Court in granting Dr. Goldstein\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court stated that \u201cbecause it is an extension of the original claim that was made. And, since the earlier one was timely, this being the extension of it, I\u2019m finding that it is as well timely and not covered by the bar date.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The filing deadline in the statute represents a legislative determination that PCIGC is not liable for every claim that could be brought against the insurance carrier had it not become insolvent. The deadline makes it possible for PCIGC to reasonably anticipate its potential liability which in turn allows it to participate in the liquidation proceedings of the insolvent insurer and assess its members accordingly. <em>See </em>INS \u00a7\u00a7 9-309(c)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 9-306(d)(l)(ii).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The deadline serves the important purpose of providing finality to both the liqui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>dation proceeding and PCIGC\u2019s potential liability resulting from the insolvency of an insurance carrier. If the filing of a claim provided notice to PCIGC of all potential claims arising out of the one incident, PCIGC\u2019s potential liability would extend until the statute of limitations ran on all potential claims arising out of the original claim. As this case illustrates, such a result renders PCIGC unable to seek recovery against the bankruptcy estate of the insolvent insurer for those claims because the estate is not obligated to accept claims filed after the bar date, thus frustrating section 9-309(c) of the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Other courts that have addressed the issue of claims filed beyond the bar date have reached the same conclusion as we do today \u2014 that the various guarantee associations are not liable for the late-filed claims. <em>See Union Gesellschaft Fur Metal Industrie Co. v.

We have noted that \u201c[w]hen determining coverage under an insurance policy, \u2018the primary principle of construction is to apply the terms of the insurance contract itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc., v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 566, 581, 735 A.2d 1081, 1089 (1999) (internal citations omitted); <em>see also, Mut. Fire, Marine &amp; Inland Ins. Co. v. Vollmer, </em>306 Md. 243, 250, 508 A.2d 130, 133 (1986) (noting that \u201c[u]nless a statute, regulation, or public policy would be violated, the first principle of construction of insurance policies in Maryland is to apply the terms of the contract\u201d). We begin, therefore, with the language of Dr. Goldstein\u2019s policy with Medical Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Section I of the Medical Mutual policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">We will pay, on behalf of an insured, those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of a \u201cclaim\u201d caused by an \u201cincident\u201d occurring in the \u201ccoverage territory\u201d and arising out of \u201cprofessional services.\u201d This insurance only applies to \u201cclaims\u201d first made against any insured during the policy period for \u201cincidents\u201d occurring after the Retroactive Date specified in the Declarations. It does not apply to any \u201cincident\u201d occurring or \u201cclaim\u201d first made against any insured after the termination of the policy period. All \u201cclaims\u201d for damages arising out of any one \u201cincident\u201d will be deemed to have been made at the time the first of those \u201cclaims\u201d is first made against any insured. This insurance is subject to all terms, conditions, and exclusions included in this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The word \u201cclaim\u201d is defined in the policy as \u201ca \u2018suit\u2019 or other request for compensation, made by or on behalf of an injured party, because of alleged \u2018bodily injury,\u2019 \u2018property damage,\u2019 or \u2018personal injury\u2019 to which this insurance policy applies.\u201d The word \u201cincident\u201d is defined, in relevant part, as \u201ca single act or omission or a series of related acts or omissions (including, but not limited to, multiple misdiagnoses) arising out of the rendering or failure to render \u2018professional services\u2019 to a single person.\u201d \u201cSuit\u201d means \u201ca civil proceeding alleging damages because of \u2018bodily injury,\u2019 \u2018property damage,\u2019 or \u2018personal injury\u2019 to which this insurance applies. \u2018Suit\u2019 includes an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>arbitration proceeding alleging such damages to which you must submit or to which you submit with our consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Dr. Goldstein\u2019s policy with Medical Mutual is a \u201cclaims made\u201d policy as opposed to an \u201coccurrence\u201d policy. We discussed the distinction between the two types of policies in <em>Vollmer, </em>306 Md. 243, 508 A.2d 130. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">Generally speaking, \u201coccurrence\u201d policies cover liability inducing events occurring during the policy term, irrespective of when an actual claim is presented. Conversely, \u201cclaims made\u201d (or \u201cdiscovery\u201d) policies cover liability inducing events if and when a claim is made during the policy term, irrespective of when the events occurred. There are, of course, hybrids of the two varieties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\"><em>Vollmer, </em>306 Md. at 252, 508 A.2d at 134 (internal citations omitted). We went on to note that \u201c \u2018[c]laims made,\u2019 or \u2018discovery\u2019 policies ..., are of relatively recent origin and were developed primarily to deal with situations in which the error, omission, or negligent act is difficult to pinpoint and may have occurred over an extended period of time,\u201d as is often the case in professional malpractice cases. <em>Vollmer, </em>306 Md. at 253, 508 A.2d at 135 (internal citations omitted). Although Dr. Goldstein\u2019s insurance policy is a \u201cclaims made\u201d policy, the specific terms of that policy limit his right of recovery against Medical Mutual. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Dr. Goldstein argues that the contribution claim constitutes an entirely new action because Dr. Blundon chose to file a separate action, HCA No. 2002-177, instead of filing a cross-claim in the medical malpractice suit, HCA No. 95-0006. He concludes that \u201cHCA 2002-177 is an actual claim filed within Dr. Goldstein\u2019s policy period with Medical Mutual and Medical Mutual should therefore be obligated to assume his defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The problem with this argument is that it disregards the language of the policy which states that \u201c[a]ll \u2018claims\u2019 for damages arising out of any one \u2018incident\u2019 will be deemed to have been made at the time the first of those \u2018claims\u2019 is first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>made against any insured.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Assuming, for purposes of argument, that the contribution claim is a new and distinct claim from the medical malpractice suit, it clearly arises from the same \u201cincident,\u201d the injury to Ms. Taylor.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Based on the language of the policy, the contribution action is \u201cdeemed to have been made at the time the first of those claims is first made against any insured,\u201d in this instance January 6, 1995, when the medical malpractice suit was filed. To be covered by the Medical Mutual policy, the first claim arising out of the injury to Ms. Taylor must be made during the coverage period. The coverage period of Dr. Golstein\u2019s policy with Medical Mutual was January 1, 2002, to January 1, 2003. The first claim arising out of Ms. Taylor\u2019s injury, however, was filed seven years before the Medical Mutual coverage period.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">We hold that, based on the language of the policy, Medical Mutual is not required to provide a defense or indemnification to Dr. Goldstein in the contribution action. Although the contribution action was first made during the coverage period, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the first claim arising out of the injury to Ms. Taylor was made prior to the coverage period. The policy specifically states that \u201c[a]ll \u2018claims\u2019 for damages arising out of any one \u2018incident\u2019 will be deemed to have been made at the time the first of those \u2018claims\u2019 is first made against any insured.\u201d Therefore, the claim is not covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We appreciate the hardship to Dr. Goldstein that results from our holdings here today. Through no fault of his own, Dr. Goldstein is left without coverage for a claim that but for PIE Mutual\u2019s insolvency would have been covered by his PIE Mutual policy. The PCIGC statute serves to lessen the impact on Maryland residents insured by insurance companies that become insolvent. The coverage, however, is not absolute. If the statute is to be amended to cover claims which are unknown to the insured of an insolvent insurer prior to the bar date, that change must come from the General Assembly. In addition, we are not at liberty to disregard the language of a policy issued by a solvent insurance company and require that it cover claims which are the obligation of an insolvent insurance company. Insurance companies doing business in Maryland already bear a portion of the burden of insolvent insurance companies through assessments by PCIGC.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.

The PIE Mutual policy provides that \"if any claim is first made during the policy period alleging injury to an individual that would be covered by this policy, any additional claim made for damages resulting from the same injury shall be considered a claim hereunder. A claim shall be considered to be first made when the company first receives notice of the claim or occurrence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\">. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">Okay. Well, I'll be honest with you. I'm the <em>nisi priits </em>Judge here and probably what I have to say about this is of little moment, but it seems to me that there are some policy issues here. One is the finality right of the receiver. That\u2019s a very important issue because I think the receiver has to be able to gauge what its exposure is because it doesn\u2019t have the ability to go and charge premiums and things like that. And depending on the statutory scheme behind these kinds of things that may or may not be a very important deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">The other, I think, important policy question is whether or not persons who receive a decision that they are not liable from which a final appeal is not taken, is expected to anticipate that this contingent litigation and I think that the answer to both of those is that they're both very strong, important reasons, one is in the microcosm and one is in the macrocosm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">The court is required to choose between the two policy concepts, and in this case, I think that the court will deny the motion for summary judgment because it is my belief that the language of the PIE [Mutual] policy probably does have some relevance. Whether or not, as [counsel for Dr. Goldstein] asserts, that it encompasses \"how claims are handled\u201d or not strikes me as problematic but it seems to me it\u2019s probably an issue as to matter of law as to what the PIE [Mutual policy] says and whether or not that makes it into a new claim or into a survival claim.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b347-10\">. PIE Mutual provided Dr. Goldstein with a defense in the Taylor suit until its insolvency.

In determining PIE Mutual\u2019s insolvency, tlie Ohio court specifically held that contingent and future claims were subject to the bar date. The order provided that \"[ajll Contingent Claims and all Future Claims, as defined in the Notice, will be forever barred and foreclosed after September 23, 1999.\" The contribution claim, as it existed at the time of the bar date, was a future claim as Dr. Goldstein had no knowledge of its existence prior to the bar date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b357-5\">. In its brief, Medical Mutual notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">The rationale behind such policies is clear: by explicitly limiting coverage to new claims, insurance carriers avoid the problems associated with assuming the coverage, defense, or indemnity for claims with which they had no involvement in the decision-making, negotiations, investigations, or litigation process because the claim was made under a prior policy.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\">. Although we need not decide the issue today, the question of whether a contribution action can be \"a new and distinct\u201d claim is an interesting one. The right to contribution is inchoate \"until one joint tortfeasor \u2018has by payment discharged the common liability or has paid more than his pro rata share thereof.' \" <em>Montgomery County v.

Because a legal determination of liability among joint tortfeasors is required to maintain a contribution action, it would seem that the two causes of action cannot be \"new and distinct\u201d because liability for contribution arises only from a legal determination of joint liability or settlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
