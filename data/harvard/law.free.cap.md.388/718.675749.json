Vol.) Title 9 of the Labor and Employment Article, the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), as a result of an injury sustained in the course of employment, which, except for the illegal resident status, would be compensable. The Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) ruled that Diego E. Lagos, the appellee, although an undocumented alien, was an employee, as defined by \u00a7 9-202, who sustained a work related injury, for which he was eligible to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County, on judicial review, affirmed. This Court, on its own initiative and prior to review of the issue by the Court of Special Appeals, granted the petition filed by Design Kitchen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>and Baths and its insurer, Princeton Insurance Co., the appellants, for a writ of certiorari. <em>Design Kitchen and Baths v. Lagos, </em>378 Md. 176, 835 A.2d 1103 (2003). We shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The appellee, while operating a saw in the employ of Design Kitchen and Baths, sustained an injury to his left hand, which required, in addition to other medical treatment, two surgical procedures to repair. As a result, he filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation with the Commission. Aside from the issues of accidental injury, causal relationship, average weekly wage, and who was the responsible insurer, the Commission was required to address, at the insistence of the appellants, the appellee\u2019s eligibility, as an undocumented alien, to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The parties agree that the facts surrounding the appellee\u2019s injury meet all the necessary requirements of a compensable injury under the Maryland Worker\u2019s Compensation Act and that, but for the appellee\u2019s undocumented/illegal resident status,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his claim would be compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The Commission found in favor of the appellee. It held that the appellee suffered \u201can accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment on August 20, 2001; and [found] that the disability of the claimant is the result of the aforesaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>accidental injury; and that as a result thereof the claimant was temporarily totally disabled from May 14, 2002 to June 17, 2002 inclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The appellants filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. They subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment, relying on the appellee\u2019s undocumented alien status and, specifically, his answer to interrogatories, in particular, Interrogatory No. 1, in which the appellee confirmed that he had no social security number. The appellee cross-moved for summary judgment. The Circuit Court denied the appellants\u2019 summary judgment motion and granted the appellee\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. It then remanded the case to the Commission. The appellants, in response, timely noted an appeal. As indicated, we granted certiorari on our own motion to consider what we discern to be the sole issue presented by this appeal, whether the appellee\u2019s undocumented worker status affects his eligibility to receive worker\u2019s compensation benefits under the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The appellants contend that the appellee\u2019s status as an undocumented/illegal alien prohibits his legal employment, thus precluding his being, or being able to prove that he is, a \u201ccovered employee.\u201d More particularly, they argue that, inasmuch as the appellee is prohibited by his undocumented/illegal alien status from entering into an employment contract and, in any event, \u201cany alleged contract of employment is void as it is in direct conflict with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986,\u201d his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits must be denied. This result is mandated, they submit, by \u201cthe absence of an employment contract\u201d \u2014 \u201c[wjithout a social security number, there can be no legal contract for hire\u201d \u2014 and the lack of current case law and immigration policy favorable to the appellee\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">It is critical to the appellants\u2019 argument that \u00a7 9-202 does not expressly address the effect undocumented/illegal alien status and/or illegal employment for other than minors has on \u201ccovered employee\u201d status. Of equal significance to their argument is the clarity of \u00a7 9-202; because it is a provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, a remedial statute, it is subject to the rule that, \u201c[the Act] should be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes. Any uncertainty in the law should be resolved in favor of the claimant,\u201d <em>Harris v. Board of Education of Howard County, </em>375 Md. 21, 57, 825 A.2d 365, 387 (2003); <em>Podgurski v. OneBeacon Ins. Co., </em>374 Md. 133, 142, 821 A.2d 400, 406 (2003) (citing <em>Watson v. Grimm, </em>200 Md. 461, 472, 90 A.2d 180, 185 (1952)); <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Cassidy, </em>338 Md. 88, 97, 656 A.2d 757, 761-762 (1995) (quoting <em>Victor v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., </em>318 Md. 624, 629, 569 A.2d 697, 700 (1990)); <em>Lovellette v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>297 Md. 271, 282, 465 A.2d 1141, 1147 (1983), and thus interpretation of its provisions may depend upon whether its terms are clear or ambiguous. As to the latter point, the appellants maintain that, rather than ambiguous or unclear, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>\u00a7 9-202 is simply silent on the issue of the effect of undocumented/illegal alien status or illegal employment on eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Consequently, they assert, liberal interpretation of \u00a7 9-202, in that regard, is neither required nor permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Also essential to the appellants\u2019 argument is the Immigration Reform and Control Act (\u201cIRCA\u201d), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1324, and its interpretation by the Supreme Court in <em>Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board, </em>535 U.S. 137, 122 S.Ct. 1275, 152 L.Ed.2d 271 (2002). Characterized by the Supreme Court as \u201ca comprehensive scheme,\u201d <em>Hoffman Plastic Compounds, </em>535 U.S. at 147, 122 S.Ct. at 1282, 152 L.Ed.2d at 281, by its enactment of the IRCA, Congress declared that \u201cit is unlawful for a person or other entity to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien knowing the alien is an unauthorized alien [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] with respect to such employment.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a (l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Emphasizing the reasoning of the Supreme Court in <em>Hoffman Plastic Compounds, </em>that the award of backpay to an illegal alien, who legally could not have earned the wages upon which the backpay is based, who fraudulently obtained the job in the first place and whose qualification to receive it depended on his remaining in the country illegally, \u201ctrivialize[s] the immigration laws, it also condones and encourages future violations,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 150, 122 S.Ct. at 1284, 152 L.Ed.2d at 283, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>the appellants analogize that case to this one.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They reason:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">\u201cRegardless of whether it was the Claimant or the Employer who violated the IRCA, it is the Claimant that seeks indemnity and medical benefits for wages he could not have legally earned at a job, which was borne of a fraudulent act. The Supreme Court made no distinction as to who circumvented the IRCA, only that the undocumented alien was not eligible for backpay as a result of his undocumented status.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The appellants rely heavily on the Virginia experience, as well. They point out that the Virginia Supreme Court, presented with the identical issue with which this case presents this Court, under a similar factual pattern, construed \u00a7 65.2-101 of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Virginia analog to \u00a7 9-202, in conjunction with the IRCA, concluding that the claimant, an illegal alien, was not an \u201cemployee\u201d under the Virginia Act. <em>Granados v. Windson Development Corp., </em>257 Va. 103, 108-109, 509 S.E.2d 290, 293 (1999). The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">\u201cGranados was not in the service of Windson under any contract of hire because, under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, an illegal alien cannot be employed lawfully in the United States. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number><em>also </em>Code \u00a7 40.1-11.1.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] Therefore, Granados was not eligible to receive compensation benefits as an \u2018employee\u2019 under the Act because his purported contract of hire was void and unenforceable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Subsequent to the <em>Granados </em>case, and in response to it, the Virginia Legislature amended \u00a7 65.2-101 to broaden the definition of \u201cemployee.\u201d That statute now provides, as relevant, that an \u201cemployee\u201d is \u201c[e]very person, <em>including aliens </em>and minors, in the service of another under any contract of hire or apprenticeship, written or implied, <em>whether lawfully or unlawfadly </em>employed.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>See Rios v. Ryan, </em>35 Va.App. 40, 542 S.E.2d 790, 792 (2001) What the appellants find significant about the Virginia experience, and persuasive, as well, is that the original statute was silent as to the issue of undocumented/illegal aliens. It was an act of the Virginia Legislature, not the Commonwealth\u2019s appellate courts, that amended the statutory definition of \u201cemployee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The definition of \u201ccovered employee\u201d is set forth in Md. Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-202 of the Labor and Employment Article. It is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">\u201c(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Except as otherwise provided, an individual, including a minor, is a covered employee while in the service of an employer under an express or implied contract of apprenticeship or hire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>\u201c(b) <em>Unlawful employment </em>\u2014 Minors.\u2014A minor may be a covered employee under this section even if the minor is employed unlawfully.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Pursuant to subsection (a), an employee must meet two conditions to qualify as a \u201ccovered employee,\u201d he or she must: (1) be \u201cin the service of an employer\u201d; and (2) that service must be in connection with \u201can express or implied contract of apprenticeship or hire.\u201d Subsection (b) makes express, as to minors, what subsection (a) does not explicitly address with respect to other employees, that unlawful employment of a minor does not preclude the minor from being a \u201ccovered employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">We are presented with an issue of statutory interpretation. The goal with which we approach the interpretation of a statute is to determine the intention of the Legislature in enacting it. <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 128, 756 A.2d 987, 991 (2000). Indeed, \u201cascertaining] and carrying] out the real intention of the Legislature,\u201d is the cardinal rule of statutory construction, <em>Mazor v. Dep\u2019t of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 360, 369 A.2d 82, 86 (1977) citing <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 421, 348 A.2d 275, 278 (1975); <em>Fairchild v. Maritime Air Serv., </em>274 Md. 181, 185, 333 A.2d 313, 315-16 (1975); <em>Purifoy v. Merc.-Safe Dep. &amp; Trust, </em>273 Md. 58, 65, 327 A.2d 483, 487 (1974), and it is to that canon that we turn first. In examining a statute we give words their ordinary and natural meaning. <em>Chase, </em>360 Md. at 128, 756 A.2d at 991, citing <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995); <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448, 451 (1994); <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753, 755 (1993); <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 145-146, 626 A.2d 946, 950 (1993). Moreover, we read the statute so that \u201cno word, phrase, clause or sentence is rendered surplusage or meaningless.\u201d <em>Buckman, </em>333 Md. at 524, 636 A.2d at 452; <em>Condon, </em>332 Md. at 491, 632 A.2d at 755; <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. White, </em>275 Md. 314, 319, 340 A.2d 236, 240 (1975). \u201cWhere the words of a statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning,\u201d the Court will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>give effect to the statute as the language is written. <em>Moore v. Miley, </em>372 Md. 663, 677, 814 A.2d 557, 566 (2003). Thus, when the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, a court may neither add nor delete language so as to \u201creflect an intent not evidenced in that language,\u201d <em>Condon, supra, </em>332 Md. at 491, 632 A.2d at 758, nor may it construe the statute with \u201c \u2018forced or subtle interpretations\u2019 that limit or extend its application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730, 732 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Both parties agree that \u00a7 9-202 is not ambiguous.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We also agree. Moreover, we have no doubt that the clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>and unambiguous language of \u00a7 9-202 encompasses undocumented aliens. The statute plainly and simply states that, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided,\u201d a \u201ccovered employee\u201d is characterized by two elements: he or she, pursuant to \u201can express or implied contract of apprenticeship or hire\u201d is \u201cin the service of an employer.\u201d When the plain language of the statute is applied to the factual circumstances <em>sub judice, </em>without giving it a liberal interpretation in favor of the appellee, the appellee nevertheless clearly qualifies on both accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The legislative history of \u00a7 9-202 confirms this interpretation. <em>See Chase, </em>360 Md. at 131, 756 A.2d at 993 (when the language of a statute is unambiguous, \u201cthe resort to legislative history is a confirmatory process; it is not undertaken to contradict the plain meaning of the statute\u201d). <em>See Coleman v. State, </em>281 Md. 538, 546, 380 A.2d 49, 54 (1977) (\u201c[a] court may not as a general rule surmise a legislative intention contrary to the plain language of a statute or insert exceptions not made by Legislature\u201d). Before its repeal and re-enactment as a new section, \u00a7 21 provided for the payment of compensation \u201cfor injuries sustained or death incurred by employees engaged in ... extra-hazardous employments,\u201d which it then enumerated in approximately 50 succeeding paragraphs. Md. Code (1957, 1964 Replacement Volume) Art. 101, \u00a7 21. After the repeal and re-enactment of that provision, <em>see </em>1970 Md. Laws ch. 741, the Act contained a provision expressly defining \u201ccovered employee\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">\u201cEvery person, including a person under eighteen years of age, <em>whether lawfully or unlawfully employed, </em>in the service of an employer under any contract of hire or apprenticeship, express or implied, and all helpers and assistants of employees whether paid by the employer or employee, if employed with the knowledge, actual or constructive, of the employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">(Emphasis added). It was codified at Md. Code (1957, 1964 Replacement Volume, 1971 Cum. Supp.), Article 101, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>\u00a7 21(b)(1).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It remained so codified until 1991, when, pursuant to Code Revision, the General Assembly repealed Article 101 and, to replace it, enacted the Labor and Employment Article. 1991 Md. Laws ch. 8. Section 9-202 is the successor provision to \u00a7 21(b)(1). As we have seen, it is styled differently, having two subsections, rather than one, and some of the language, most notably, for our purposes, the phrase, \u201cwhether lawfully or unlawfully employed,\u201d have been changed from that used in \u00a7 21(b)(1). A Revisor\u2019s Note detailing the changes and their effect, placed following \u00a7 9-202, is instructive. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">\u201cREVISOR\u2019S NOTE: This section is new language derived without substantive change from former Art. 101, \u00a7 21(b)(1), as that item related to individuals in the service of an employer under a contract of hire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">\u201cThe word \u2018minor\u2019 is substituted for the former phrase \u201cperson under eighteen years of age\u201d, for brevity. <em>See </em>Art. 1, \u00a7 24 of the Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">\u201cIn subsection (a) of this section, the word \u2018individual\u2019 is substituted for the former word \u2018person\u2019, since this title covers only a human being. As to the definition of \u2018person\u2019, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1-101 of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">\u201cThe provisions of former Art. 101, \u00a7 21(b)(4) that related to an individual in the service of a political subdivision are deleted as unnecessary in light of the broader reference to an individual in the service of an employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">While the Revisor\u2019s Note does not highlight or explain expressly the deletion of the phrase, \u201cwhether lawfully or unlawfully employed,\u201d we do know from the Note that the revisions were intended to be \u201cwithout substantive change.\u201d That is confirmed by the Report of the Department of Legislative Reference. Department of Legislative Reference, <em>Report </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number><em>on House Bill 1 </em>at 1 (January 14, 1991). That Report characterized the purpose of the revisions as being the \u201cimprovement of organization, elimination of obsolete or unconstitutional provisions, resolution of inconsistencies and conflicts in the law, correction of unintended gaps or omissions in the law, deletion of repetitive or otherwise superfluous language, and general improvement of language and expression.\u201d Because revisions that were substantive and policy issues were highlighted for the General Assembly and the deleted phrase was not the subject of any such highlighting, it safely may be assumed that \u201cwhether lawfully or unlawfully employed\u201d was deleted as repetitive or surplusage. We agree with amici, therefore, that the Legislature, more than thirty (30) years ago, by enacting legislation that included the phrase, \u201cwhether lawfully or unlawfully employed,\u201d manifested an intention that even unlawfully employed workers be \u201ccovered employees\u201d in the workers\u2019 compensation system. That intention thirty odd years later retains its vitality; a revision made without substantive change, in no way can be construed as evidencing an intention to exclude <em>any party </em>to a contractual relationship, \u201cwhether lawfully or unlawfully employed, from being eligible to receive workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">This result is consistent with, and indeed furthers, the purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, to \u201cprotect[] employees, employers, and the public alike.\u201d <em>Polomski v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>344 Md. 70, 76, 684 A.2d 1338, 1341 (1996). As we explained in <em>Polomski,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">\u201cTo be sure, the Act maintains a no-fault compensation system for employees and their families for work-related injuries where compensation for lost earning capacity is otherwise unavailable. <em>See Bethlehem-Sparrows Point Shipyard v. Damasiewicz, </em>187 Md. 474, 480, 50 A.2d 799, 802 (1947); <em>Paul v. Glidden Co., </em>184 Md. 114, 119, 39 A.2d 544, 546 (1944). At the same time, however, the Act also recognizes the need to protect employers from the unpredictable nature and expense of litigation, and the public from the overwhelming tax burden of \u2018caring for the helpless human wreckage found [along] the trail of modern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>industry.\u2019 <em>Liggett &amp; Meyers Tobacco Company v. Goslin, </em>163 Md. 74, 80, 160 A. 804, 807, (1932); <em>Brenner v. Brenner, </em>127 Md. 189, 192, 96 A. 287, 288 (1915).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 76-77, 684 A.2d at 1341. For these same reasons, public policy also favors the inclusion of undocumented workers as \u201ccovered employees\u201d under the statute. Exclusion of this class of persons from the statute\u2019s coverage would retard the goals of workers\u2019 compensation laws and leave these individuals with only two options, receive no relief for work related injuries or sue in tort. Moreover, without the protection of the statute, unscrupulous employers could, and perhaps would, take advantage of this class of persons and engage in unsafe practices with no fear of retribution, secure in the knowledge that society would have to bear the cost of caring for these injured workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">The majority of courts in states with statutes similar to ours that have considered the issue have reached the same result. In <em>Dowling v. Slotnik, </em>244 Conn. 781, 712 A.2d 396, 407-409 (1998), the Supreme Court of Connecticut construed its statute, defining \u201cemployee,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201cany person who ... [h]as entered into or works under any contract of service ... with an employer ...,\u201d [<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] to include undocumented workers within the group of workers able to invoke the remedy provided by that State\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Similarly, the Superior Court of New Jersey has held that \u201cemployee,\u201d as defined in its Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u201cis synonymous with servant, and includes all natural persons ... who perform service for an employer for financial consideration ...,\u201d N.J.S.A. 34:15-36, and includes undocumented workers. The court reasoned, \u201cunless undocumented aliens, like longshoremen or \u2018casual employees,\u2019 are expressly excluded, they self-evidently fall within the statutory definition.\u201d <em>Fernandez-Lopez v.

Ryan, </em>35 Va.App. 40, 542 S.E.2d 790, only one court, the Wyoming Supreme Court, has construed its Workers\u2019 Compensation Act as excluding undocumented workers. <em>Felix v. State ex rel., Wyoming Workers\u2019 Safety and Compensation Div., </em>986 P.2d 161 (Wyo.1999). That court\u2019s interpretation is understandable, moreover, because the statute defined \u201cemployee\u201d in terms of \u201clegally employed minors and aliens authorized to work by the United States department of justice, immigration and naturalization service.\u201d Thus, the court reasoned, applying canons of statutory interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">\u201cWyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 27-14-102(a)(vii) expressly lists <em>\u201caliens authorized to work by the United States department of justice, immigration and naturalization service </em>\u201d as \u201cemployees\u201d who may be covered by workers\u2019 compensation. This specific phrase is meaningless if all aliens are considered \u201cemployees\u201d whether authorized to work in this country or not. If the legislature intended that all employed aliens be covered by workers\u2019 compensation it would not have precisely stated that aliens authorized to work here are considered employees. To give effect to all the language in the statute, we conclude that an alien not authorized to work in the United States is not an \u201cemployee\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 27-14-102(a)(vii).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-7\"><em>Felix, </em>986 P.2d at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">The arguments advanced by the appellants, namely, that undocumented/illegal alien status prohibits legal employment and, thus, precludes one in that status from being, or being able to prove that he or she is, a covered employee and, in effect, that <em>Hoffman Plastic Compounds, supra, </em>535 U.S. 137, 122 S.Ct. 1275, 152 L.Ed.2d 271, makes clear that the IRCA preempts State workers\u2019 compensation acts or, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>least, precludes an award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an undocumented worker, as contradictory of the IRCA and that decision, have been rejected by the courts that have considered them.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The Court in <em>Hoffman Plastic Compounds </em>addressed the application of the IRCA to undocumented workers. There, the employer had terminated its employee, later determined to have been an illegal alien, for engaging in pro-union activities. Discharge of a worker for that reason was unlawful. For that reason and despite his illegal alien status, the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cthe NLRB\u201d) awarded the discharged employee backpay for the employer\u2019s wrongful termination. <em>Id. </em>at 140-41, 122 S.Ct. at 1278-79, 152 L.Ed.2d at 276-77. The Supreme Court reversed, concluding that Congress would not have intended that backpay be paid to an employee \u201cwhere but for an employer\u2019s unfair labor practices, an alien-employee would have remained in the United States illegally, and continued to work illegally, all the while successfully evading apprehension by immigration authorities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149, 122 S.Ct. at 1283, 152 L.Ed.2d at 282. In fact, the Court stated its view that \u201cawardfing] backpay to illegal aliens would unduly trench upon explicit statutory prohibitions critical to federal immigration, as expressed in the IRCA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151, 122 S.Ct. at 1284, 152 L.Ed.2d at 283-284.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">As previously indicated, <em>supra, </em>the <em>Hoffman Plastic Compounds </em>Court acknowledged the comprehensiveness of the IRCA regime, the scheme Congress adopted to \u201cprohibit! ] the employment of illegal aliens in the United States.\u201d <em>Hoffman Plastic Compounds, </em>535 U.S. at 147, 122 S.Ct. at 1282, 152 L.Ed.2d at 281. It also recognized that under that regime, \u201cit is impossible for an undocumented alien to obtain employment in the United States without some party directly contravening explicit congressional policies. Either the undocumented alien tenders fraudulent identification, which subverts the cornerstone of IRCA\u2019s enforcement mechanism, or the employer knowingly hires the undocumented alien in direct contradiction of its IRCA obligations.\u201d Id. at 148-49, 122 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>1283, 152 L.Ed.2d at 282. With that backdrop, the Court offered a rationale for its conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">\u201cAs we have previously noted, IRCA \u2018forcefully\u2019 made combating the employment of illegal aliens central to \u2018[t]he policy of immigration law.\u2019 <em>INS v. National Center for Immigrants\u2019 Rights, Inc., </em>502 U.S. 183, 194, and n. 8, 112 S.Ct. 551, 116 L.Ed.2d 546 (1991). It did so by establishing an extensive \u2018employment verification system,\u2019 \u00a7 1324a(a)(l), designed to deny employment to aliens who (a) are not lawfully present in the United States, or (b) are not lawfully authorized to work in the United States, \u00a7 1324a(h)(3).... This verification system is critical to the IRCA regime. To enforce it, IRCA mandates that employers verify the identity and eligibility of all new hires by examining specified documents before they begin work. \u00a7 1324a(b). If an alien applicant is unable to present the required documentation, the unauthorized alien cannot be hired. \u00a7 1324a(a)(l).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">\u201cSimilarly, if an employer unknowingly hires an unauthorized alien, or if the alien becomes unauthorized while employed, the employer is compelled to discharge the worker upon discovery of the worker\u2019s undocumented status. \u00a7 1324a(a)(2). Employers who violate IRCA are punished by civil fines, \u00a7 1324a(e)(4)(A), and may be subject to criminal prosecution, \u00a7 1324a(f)(l). IRCA also makes it a crime for an unauthorized alien to subvert the employer verification system by tendering fraudulent documents. \u00a7 1324c(a). It thus prohibits aliens from using or attempting to use \u2018any forged, counterfeit, altered, or falsely made document\u2019 or \u2018any document lawfully issued to or with respect to a person other than the possessor\u2019 for purposes of obtaining employment in the United States. \u00a7\u00a7 1324c(a)(l)-(8). Aliens who use or attempt to use such documents are subject to fines and criminal prosecution. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Id at 147-48, 122 S.Ct. at 1282-83, 152 L.Ed.2d at 281-82. This rationale has provided the foundation for arguments by employers that undocumented/illegal workers are ineligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits because such benefits are pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>empted or because employment contracts with such workers are illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Before the Connecticut Supreme Court in <em>Dowling </em>were two arguments advanced by the employer/respondent, directly raising preemption. The employer argued that (1) because it requires an employer to make payments to the undocumented worker, a workers\u2019 compensation award constitutes a \u201ccivil sanction\u201d against the employer, which is preempted by the IRCA, \u00a7 1824(a)(h)(2) and (2) an award of workers\u2019 compensation is impliedly preempted by the IRCA because it contravenes the purpose of the IRCA. The court rejected both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">With respect to direct preemption, it concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-7\">\u201cSection 1324a(h)(2), the express preemption provision of the Immigration Reform Act, only prohibits that states from imposing civil <em>sanctions </em>upon those who employ undocumented aliens. Because workers\u2019 compensation benefits are designed [ ]\u2019to <em>compensate the worker for inju\u00f1es </em>arising out of and in the course of employment, <em>without regard to fault, </em>by imposing a form of strict liability on the employer^]; (emphasis added) <em>Panaro v. Electrolux Corp., </em>208 Conn. 589, 598-99, 545 A.2d 1086 (1988); <em>Jett v. Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 217, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979); an award of such benefits reasonably cannot be described as a \u2018sanction.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3g\">712 A.2d at 403. As to the implied preemption argument, it opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-8\">\u201cThe primary purpose of the Immigration Reform Act was to establish procedures that make it more difficult to employ undocumented workers and to punish employers who knowingly offer jobs to those workers. <em>National Labor Relations Board v. A.P.R.A. Fuel Oil Buyers Group, Inc., supra, </em>134 F.3d [50] at 55-56; see <em>United States v. Todd Corp., </em>900 F.2d 164, 165 (9th Cir.1990). The Immigration Reform Act itself gives no indication that Congress intended the act to preempt state laws whenever state laws operate to benefit undocumented aliens. Indeed, [\u2019] it is clear from [the] legislative history [of the Immigration reform Act] that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Congress anticipated some conflict between the new statute and various state ... statutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">712 A.2d at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Other courts have reached similar results on the preemption/preclusion issue. <em>See Correa v. Waymouth Farms, Inc., </em>664 N.W.2d 324, 329 (Minn.2003) (\u201cAs written, the IRCA does not prohibit unauthorized aliens from receiving state workers\u2019 compensation benefits____Thus, we conclude that the IRCA was not intended to preclude the authority of states to award workers\u2019 compensation benefits to unauthorized aliens.\u201d); <em>Safeharbor Employer Servs. I, Inc. v. Cinto Velazquez, </em>860 So.2d 984, 986 (\u201cIRCA does not contain express preemption language nor does it so thoroughly occupy the field as to require a reasonable inference that Congress left no room for states to act. Further, since <em>Hoffman </em>found benefits other than backpay to be applicable to illegal aliens, there is no conflict between state and federal law in this case.\u201d); <em>Reinforced, Earth Co. v. W.C.A.B. </em>(Astudillo), 749 A.2d 1036, 1038 (\u201cthe IRCA does not, in and of itself, preclude an illegal alien from being considered an \u2018employee\u2019 for purposes of the Act.\u201d); <em>Ruiz v.

Although noting its superficial appeal, the court in <em>Fernandez-Lopez v.

We want to make it clear that this case is in no way analogous to <em>Hoffman Plastic Compounds. </em>They differ in at least three significant respects: (1) the appellant in <em>Hoffman Plastic Compounds </em>was unlawfully terminated for his participation in a union organizing campaign, unlike in the instant case where the appellee sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits after he was injured in the course of performing his employment duties; (2) the appellee in the instant case actually performed his duties and was in the process of performing them when he was injured, while the appellant in <em>Hoffman Plastic Compounds </em>sought, and was awarded, back pay for being wrongfully discharged; and (3) the appellant in <em>Hoffman Plastic Compounds </em>produced fraudulent documents to establish his legal authority to work in the United States, while the appellee in the instant case simply left the space for his social security number blank on his employment application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b766-9\">. Section 65.2-101 of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, in material part, defined an \u201c[ejmployee\u201d as \u201c[ejvery person, including a minor, in the service of another under any contract of hire.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b767-9\">.

The appellants maintain that the fact that \u00a7 9-202 does not expressly mention aliens and, with respect to individuals other than minors, the lawfulness of the employment simply means that it is silent on these points; it does not render the statute ambiguous, thus triggering the liberal interpretation that we have held applies to remedial statutes. We are not persuaded. Statutes do not often mention every one, or category, of the subjects to which they apply. Nevertheless, we regularly interpret those statutes and apply them, when appropriate to whatever object they are determined to relate. As the Amici, Public Justice Center, National Employment Law Project and National Immigration Law Center, point out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-7\">\u2018\u2018The statute is 'silent' on this question to precisely the same extent that it is \u2018silent\u2019 on the question of whether, for example, women, or individuals who are left-handed, can qualify as 'covered employees'\u2014 that is to say, not at all. Undocumented immigrants, women, and left-handed people are all 'covered employees\u2019 if they are 'in the service of an employer under an express or implied contract of apprenticeship or hire.' \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">In any event, a statute\u2019s failure to address an issue logically covered by its subject or with which it was promulgated to deal is not mere silence, evoking no interpretive ramifications. Because the application of the statute to the omitted issue is pertinent, if not critical, to its meaning, the silence, the failure to address the issue, may itself be an ambiguity and, where appropriate, does, and should, trigger the liberal interpretation rule applicable to remedial statutes. <em>See Pak v.

Maj. op. at 730, 882 A.2d at 824. I reach the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Section 9-202 of the Labor and Employment Article, the key statutory provision at issue here, provides that the definition of a \u201ccovered employee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-10\">(a) In general. \u2014 Except as otherwise provided, an individual, including a minor, is a covered employee while in the service of an employer under an express or implied contract of apprenticeship or hire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-11\">(b) Unlawful employment \u2014 Minors.\u2014A minor may be a covered employee under this section even if the minor is employed unlawfully.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Maryland Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.), Labor and Employment Article, \u00a7 9-202.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The Majority opinion appropriately recites the primary canon of statutory construction: the Court will ascertain and carry out the real intention of the Legislature. Maj. op. at 728, 882 A.2d at 823. In doing so, the Court will \u201cread the statute so that \u2018no word, phrase, clause or sentence is rendered surplusage or meaningless.\u2019 \u201d Maj. op. at 728, 882 A.2d at 823 (citations omitted). If the statute\u2019s words are plain and unambiguous, then the Court \u201cwill give effect to the statute as the language is written\u201d and will refrain from adding or deleting language to \u201c \u2018reflect an intent not evidenced in that language.\u2019 \u201d Maj. op. at 729, 882 A.2d at 823 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Yet, the Majority neglects to abide by these statutory construction principles in application to the present case. The Majority opinion declares that \u00a7 9-202 \u201cplainly and simply states that, \u2018[ejxcept as otherwise provided,\u2019 a \u2018covered employee\u2019 is characterized by two elements: [1] he or she, pursuant to \u2018an express or implied contract of apprenticeship or hire\u2019 [2] is \u2018in the service of an employer.\u2019 \u201d Maj. op. at 730, 882 A.2d at 824 (citations omitted). That summation, however, describes only the content of sub-section (a) of the statute. Section 9-202 is made up of <em>two </em>sub-sections. The Majority opinion ignores the second sub-section in its analysis. Doing so renders sub-section (b) superfluous and nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Section 9-202(b) provides that minors are covered employees even if unlawfully employed. Although neither \u00a7 9-202(a) nor (b) expressly states that an adult, in order to be considered a covered employee, is subject to a lawful employment requirement, it is implied not only by the language and structural position of \u00a7 9-202(b), but also by its mere existence. The Majority\u2019s construction, in effect, revises the plain language of \u00a7 9-202(b), as well as the structure of \u00a7 9-202, to state that both minors and adults may be covered employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>even if employed unlawfully. By ignoring \u00a7 9-202(b), the Majority creates an interpretation reflecting an intent not evidenced by the Legislature\u2019s chosen language, construing it with a forced interpretation that hyper-extends its plain meaning. The plain meaning of the language of the full statute prevents me from joining the Majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Furthermore, the Majority\u2019s use of legislative history here is inconsistent with established principles of statutory construction normally applied by the Court. After finding the statute to be unambiguous, the Majority reflects upon the legislative history of \u00a7 9-202 as part of a claimed \u201cconfirmatory process.\u201d Maj. op. at 730, 882 A.2d at 824 (citations omitted). Here it appears that the Majority is using legislative history to justify its tacit disregard of \u00a7 9-202(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">We have quite recently and frequently abided by the canon that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">[i]f there is no ambiguity in [the statute\u2019s] language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent ends; we do not need to resort to the various, and sometimes inconsistent, external rules of construction, for \u201cthe Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A46\"><em>Kushell, IV v. Dept. of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 577, 870 A.2d 186, 193-94 (2005) (quoting <em>Arundel Corp. v. Marie, </em>383 Md. 489, 502, 860 A.2d 886, 894 (2004)); <em>see also Smack v. Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 304-05, 835 A.2d 1175, 1178-79 (2003); <em>Maryland Div. of Labor and Industry v. Triangle Gen.

Montgomery County, </em>328 Md. 721, 736-37, 616 A.2d 894, 901-02 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">For instance, in <em>Triangle General Contractors, </em>the Court interpreted the meaning of a provision of the Maryland Prevailing Wage Act, after recodification, finding its language to be clear and unambiguous and affecting a substantive change in the statute as it existed before recodification. <em>Triangle </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number><em>Gen. Contractors, </em>366 Md. at 422, 784 A.2d at 542. Though we considered the Revisor\u2019s Note to the recodification, which stated that no substantive change from the former version of the provision was intended, we were not blinded to the plain meaning of the current version of the statute, refusing to \u201cexpress an intention which [was] not evidenced in the original form.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Welsh v. Kuntz, </em>196 Md. 86, 93, 75 A.2d 343, 345 (1950)).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The Majority certainly would have been justified in reviewing the legislative history of the predecessor to \u00a7 9-202 (Md. Code, Art. 101, \u00a7 21(b)(1)), including the Revisor\u2019s Notes to the recodification and the Report of the Department of Legislative Reference on House Bill (H.B.) 1-1991, had it found \u00a7 9-202 to be ambiguous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Only upon the occasion that the statute\u2019s plain meaning is uncertain would the presumption arise that a recodified version does not affect a substantive change unless the Legislature\u2019s intent to modify the law was unmistakable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Triangle General Contractors, </em>366 Md. at 422-23, 784 A.2d at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">In addition to the Revisor\u2019s Notes and the Report of the Department of Legislative Reference on H.B. 1 cited in the Majority opinion, it should be noted that the recodification was not merely a renumbering or a series of stylistic changes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>the prior relevant law. Chapter 8 of the Acts of 1991 (enacted H.B. 1-1991); <em>see also Triangle General Contractors, </em>366 Md. at 422, 784 A.2d at 543 (discussing the Maryland Prevailing Wage Act recodification process). Yet, the Legislature unanimously enacted, relatively early in the 1991 session (21 March 1991) and without amendment, the 845-page H.B. 1 that became the Labor and Employment Article. The Legislature turned to the subject of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act an additional five times during the 1991 session (enacted after H.B. 1 was passed), enacting both substantive and stylistic changes to various sections, though not to \u00a7 9-202 (all of these bills addressed other sections of the new Labor and Employment Article). <em>See </em>Chapters 21, 440, 510, 575, 669 of the Acts of 1991. That these other bills made no further changes or corrections to \u00a7 9-202 as enacted in H.B. 1, suggests that the Legislature at least acquiesced in the changes, even the substantive ones, made by H.B. 1 in reenacting the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act as part of the Labor and Employment Article, the Revisor\u2019s Note notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Perhaps the Majority rationalizes its interpretation of the statute because it believes that H.B. 1 mistakenly failed to include \u201cadults\u201d in \u00a7 9-202(b) when it re-structured former Md. Code, Art. 101, \u00a7 21(b)(1). The predecessor to \u00a7 9-202, \u00a7 21(b)(1), provided that \u201c[ejvery person, including a person under eighteen years of age, whether lawfully or unlawfully employed ...\u201d was a covered employee. The clause \u201cwhether lawfully or unlawfully employed\u201d in \u00a7 21(b)(1) most likely modified \u201cevery person\u201d- \u2014 adults and minors, although there is room for grammatical debate on that score. The Code Revision Commission that drafted H.B. 1-1991 may have misunderstood in the reconstruction process the grammatical sense of the sentence in the predecessor statute and revised the section into two parts; be that as it may, there is no doubt in my mind that the clause \u201cwhether lawfully or unlawfully employed\u201d in \u00a7 9-202(b) now modifies only minors. Whether the Legislature and its advisors/staff in 1991 blundered into the current structure of \u00a7 9-202, the Majority\u2019s argument that the Legislature intended no substantive changes to the law in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>its adoption of H.B. 1-1991 is hindered because the Legislature had ample opportunity to correct the mistake (if a mistake it was) later in the same session as well as over the years since.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Despite the potential for a drafting error, we should not deign to repair the presumed damage. The Court, though charged with the duty to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature, is not obliged to fix the Legislature\u2019s error, if there is one here, especially when a statute otherwise appears clearly written on its face. A better policy, and one usually followed by this Court, is to employ a more disciplined approach and apply the plain meaning rule of statutory construction in such instances. <em>See Kuskell, IV, </em>385 Md. at 577, 870 A.2d at 193-94; <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 304-05, 835 A.2d at 1178-79; <em>Triangle General Contractors, </em>366 Md. at 421-22, 784 A.2d at 542; <em>Chesapeake Amusements, </em>363 Md. at 28, 766 A.2d at 1042; <em>Abramson, </em>328 Md. at 736-37, 616 A.2d at 901-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Thus, even had the Majority found \u00a7 9-202 to be ambiguous (which perhaps it <em>did </em>\u2014 see <em>supra </em>note 2) and concluded from its legislative history that the Legislature intended to provide that both minors and adults were not subject to a lawful employment requirement, the Court is not in a legitimate position to revise the statute by judicial fiat. To do so is inconsistent with our more modern cases and extends the Court\u2019s reach beyond limits presumably we would respect in a case with less compelling social and policy implications. Therefore, I respectfully dissent. I would reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\">.
