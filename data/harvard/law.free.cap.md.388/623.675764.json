Taylor, </em>371 Md. 617, 624-629, 810 A.2d 964 (2002), but we were unable to decide the questions in that case because the trial court\u2019s judgment in <em>Taylor </em>was held to be non-appealable. In the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>however, we shall be able to reach both of the statutory interpretation issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The defendant, Richard Joseph Moore, was indicted in the Circuit Court for Frederick County on five counts. The first count charged a violation of a subsection of the Child pornography statute, which was then Art. 27, \u00a7 419A(e), and now is codified as \u00a7 ll-207(a)(5) of the Criminal Law Article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Counts two through five each charged the common law offense of attempt, with the attempts involving the statutory crimes of third degree sex offense under then Art. 27, \u00a7 464B(a)(4) and (5), now codified as \u00a7 3-307(a)(4) and (5) of the Criminal Law Article. Counts two, three, four, and five were identical, charging that \u201cMoore, on or about July 12, 2002, at Frederick County, Maryland, did unlawfully attempt to commit a sexual offense in the third degree upon a fourteen year old minor .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The defendant Moore pled \u201cnot guilty,\u201d and he was tried on counts one and two based upon an agreed statement of facts which the prosecuting attorney orally recited at the trial. The State also filed a nolle prosequi for each of counts three, four, and five.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The agreed statement of facts, with our changes representing grammatical, punctuation, and technical wording corrections, reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">\u201cOn July 9th of 2002, Deputy First Class Sabol, with the Frederick County Sheriffs Office, was currently assigned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>the Maryland State Police Internet Crimes Against Children Taskforce. She accessed the Internet in an undercover capacity posing as a 14-year-old minor female.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">\u201cDeputy Sabol, using her undercover screen name, accessed an Internet chatroom. Deputy Sabol, posing as an undercover minor, received an unsolicited contact by a person using the name of Runner5K.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">\u201cRunner5K engaged in a sexually explicit conversation with Deputy Sabol. Runner5K stated that he was <em>5 </em>foot 10 inches tall, 168 pounds with short brown hair and hazel green eyes. During the conversation, Runner5K asked for a detailed description of the person with whom he was communicating. Deputy Sabol provided him with a description of the person including height, weight, color of hair, and eyes. Runner5K also requested the person\u2019s clothing size. He requested the age of the person, which Deputy Sabol replied was 14-years-old. Runner5K stated that he wanted to meet for sex with the 14-year-old minor who was actually Deputy Sabol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">\u201cOn 7/10/2002 Deputy Sabol accessed the internet once again in an undercover capacity, again using the same name and description of the fictitious 14-year-old female. Deputy Sabol received an unsolicited contact, that is an instant message, from someone using the name RunnerlOK.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">\u201cDeputy Sabol had learned earlier that the name RunnerlOK belonged to the same person using the name of Runner5K.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">\u201cRunnerlOK engaged in a sexually explicit conversation with Deputy Sabol, during which time RunnerlOK indicated that he understood that the person with whom he was communicating was 14 years of age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-10\">\u201cRunnerlOK stated, \u2018If we were going to do this we would have to be very discreet.\u2019 And, \u2018the best place to go would be your apartment if your mom isn\u2019t there.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-11\">\u201cDuring the course of the conversation RunnerlOK indicated that he also wanted to meet the person\u2019s friend, who also was described as a 14-year-old minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\u201cHe indicated in his chat that he wanted the two 14-year-old minors to engage in oral sex on him when they met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-4\">\u201cRunnerlOK stated that he wanted to come to Waverly Drive and Key Parkway in Frederick County, Maryland, for the oral sex with the minors, one of whom Deputy Sabol was posing as.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">\u201cRunnerlOK stated that he would know around 14:00 hours if he could meet them. Around 14:00 hours, RunnerlOK stated that he could not meet on 7/10/2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">\u201cOn 7/12/2002 Deputy Sabol once again went online in an undercover capacity, and was contacted by Runner5K.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">\u201cRunner5K engaged in a sexually explicit conversation with Deputy Sabol, who was again posing undercover as a minor on the Internet. Runner5K asked for a detailed description of both of the minors, and stated he wanted to engage in oral sex with both minors, and then to have oral sex performed on him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">\u201cRunner5K stated that he wanted to have sex with both minors at the one minor\u2019s residence located on Waverly Drive and Key Parkway in Frederick County, Maryland. He stated that he would meet the minors at 15:00 hours on 7/12/2002. He stated that he would be operating a black jeep Cherokee, and wearing blue jeans, and a red striped polo shirt. He stated that his name was Rich.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">\u201cYour Honor, they did pull the information from the Internet account, and that Internet account, which Deputy Sabol had been communicating with, did belong to a Richard J. Moore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\">\u201cAt 14:55 hours, members of the Maryland State ICAC taskforce observed a black jeep Cherokee enter the parking space at the pre-determined location. The ICAC members made contact with the operator, identified him through his license as Richard Joseph Moore, the same person whom they had previously identified as having the Internet account with which they were communicating. He was taken into custody, advised of his rights, and agreed to give a written statement to Deputy Sabol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>\u201cMoore then stated that he drove from his work in Reston, Virginia, to Frederick, Maryland, to meet two 14-year-old minors for oral sex and vaginal sex with both girls. He stated that he met them on the Internet, and asked them if he could meet them for sex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-4\">\u201cThat would be the agreed statement of facts, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The Circuit Court, based on the above-quoted agreed statement of facts, denied a motion for judgment of acquittal and found that the defendant Moore was guilty under both count one and count two of the indictment. The court imposed a three-year sentence for the \u201cchild pornography conviction\u201d charged in count one, and suspended the entire sentence except for time served. The court sentenced Moore to time served for the attempted third degree sex offense conviction under count two. Moore appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and, prior to argument in the intermediate appellate court, this Court issued a writ of certiorari. <em>Moore v. State, </em>376 Md. 543, 831 A.2d 3 (2003)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">We shall first address the question of whether \u00a7 11\u2014 207 of the Criminal Law Article, entitled \u201cChild pornography,\u201d covers in subsection (a)(5) the situation presented by the agreed-upon facts of this case. As previously mentioned, the specific issue is whether the statutory provision is limited to the circumstance where the victim is actually a minor, or whether it more broadly covers computer contact with an adult \u201cvictim\u201d posing as a fictitious minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">The State\u2019s argument that \u00a7 ll-207(a)(5) covers computer communications with an adult, whom the defendant believes to be a minor, is essentially based upon the statutory language in the last clause of subsection (a)(5) which prohibits computer communications and other activities <em>\u201cfor the pwrpose </em>of engaging in ... sexual conduct of or with a minor.\u201d (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>added). The State thus argues (brief at 21, emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">\u201cMaryland\u2019s statute criminalizes a defendant\u2019s actions if the <em>purpose, </em>or intent, is to solicit unlawful sexual conduct with a child, even if the person believed to be a child is actually an undercover officer. Here, the agreed statement of facts showed that Moore believed [that] the intended victim was a minor, and he used a computer to transmit and receive statements for the purpose of soliciting unlawful sexual activity with a minor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">According to the State, if a defendant is seeking sexual activity with a person whom the defendant <em>believes </em>is a minor, then the defendant\u2019s <em>purpose, </em>within the meaning of the statute, is to have sexual activity with a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The defendant, in arguing that \u00a7 ll-207(a)(5) only encompasses computer communications with a person who is actually a minor, and does not cover communications with an adult whom the defendant believes to be a minor or with a fictitious person, also relies on the statutory language, as well as on the legislative history of the provision and subsequent actions by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In our view, \u00a7 11-207 in its entirety, including subsection (a)(5), is a statute prohibiting various types of actions and conduct where the victim is an actual minor. It was not intended to prohibit actions or conduct where the \u201cvictim\u201d was an adult or a fictitious person, even if the defendant believed that such person was a minor. Moreover, several attempts in the General Assembly to broaden subsection (a)(5), so as to include an adult whom the defendant <em>believes </em>is a minor, have been unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Section 1-101(g) of the Criminal Law Article states that, \u201cin this article,\u201d the word \u201c \u2018Minor\u2019 means an individual under the age of 18 years.\u201d Accordingly, the final clause of \u00a7 11-207(a)(5), relied on by the State, must be read as prohibiting the use of a computer to communicate, etc., with a person \u201cfor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>the purpose of engaging in ... sexual conduct ... with\u201d \u201can individual under the age of 18 years.\u201d While the State argues that this was the defendant\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d because he believed Deputy Sabol to be under 18, it is equally arguable that the 'defendant\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d was to engage in sexual acts and intercourse with the person with whom he was communicating, <em>i.e., </em>Deputy Sabol, who in fact happened to be over 18. If the last clause of subsection (a)(5) stood alone, it would at the very least be ambiguous. Under this circumstance, the principle would be applicable that \u201c[c]riminal statutes must be strictly construed in favor of the defendant to prevent courts from extending punishment to cases not plainly within the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Farris v. State, </em>351 Md. 24, 29, 716 A.2d 237, 240 (1998). <em>See also, e.g., Tapscott v. State, </em>343 Md. 650, 654, 684 A.2d 439, 441 (1996) (\u201cAs [the petitioner] correctly notes, criminal statutes must be strictly construed in favor of the defendant\u201d); <em>State v. Purcell, </em>342 Md. 214, 229, 674 A.2d 936, 944 (1996) (\u201c \u2018Generally, in construing penal statutes we employ the \u201crule of lenity,\u201d that is, statutes are strictly construed, in favor of the accused,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>320 Md. 749, 754, 580 A.2d 193, 195 (1990)); <em>Jones v. State, </em>304 Md. 216, 220, 498 A.2d 622, 624 (1985) (\u201cPenal statutes, as a general rule, are strictly construed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Moreover, the last clause of \u00a7 ll-207(a)(5) does not stand alone. This Court has often emphasized that \u201c \u2018statutory language is not read in isolation, but in light of the full context in which [it] appearfs],\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Anthony R., </em>362 Md. 51, 57, 763 A.2d 136, 140 (2000), quoting <em>Stanford v. Maryland Police Training &amp; Correctional Comm\u2019n, </em>346 Md. 374, 380, 697 A.2d 424, 427 (1997) (some internal quotation marks omitted). Viewing the word \u201cminor\u201d at the end of subsection (a)(5) in the context of the entire \u00a7 11-207, it seems clear that the Legislature meant an actual person who is under the age of 18 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Even if subsection (a)(5) is read without reference to the rest of \u00a7 11-207, the subsection seems to refer to an actual minor. The activities at which subsection (a)(5) is aimed, listed prior to the clause setting forth the \u201cpurpose\u201d of such activities, include knowing communication or dissemination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>any <em>\u201cminor\u2019s </em>name, telephone number, place of residence, physical characteristics, or other descriptive or identifying information for the purpose of\u201d etc. (Emphasis added). The word \u201cminor\u201d in this context clearly refers to a person under the age of 18, as there is no language in the clause arguably making the word cover an adult whom the defendant believes to be a minor. Consequently, under the State\u2019s argument, the word \u201cminor\u201d used twice in subsection (a)(5) would have two meanings, with the first meaning being limited to a person who is under 18 and the second meaning including an adult believed by the defendant to be under 18. The State\u2019s interpretation of subsection (a)(5) would violate the principle that \u201cthe legislature is presumed to use words consistently throughout a statute.\u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>311 Md. 426, 435, 535 A.2d 485, 489 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">In addition to being used twice in subsection (a)(5), the word \u201cminor\u201d is employed in subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of \u00a7 11-207. As used in all of these subsections, the word clearly means a person under the age of 18. It seems highly unlikely that, in one relatively short section of the Criminal Code, the same word would be used eleven times to signify a real person actually under the age of 18, but used one time to encompass an adult believed to be a minor or a fictitious person, at least in the absence of express language so stating.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Furthermore, examining \u00a7 11-207 as a whole confirms that the word \u201cminor\u201d throughout the statute means a real person actually under the age of 18. Although some parts of the statute may have been enacted at different times, the entire \u00a7 11-207 is an integrated, complete statute designed to protect actual minors. The \u201cprohibited\u201d activities, set forth in five separate paragraphs of subsection (a), are all in the disjunctive. For example, the prohibited activity with respect to a \u201cminor\u201d encompassed by subsection (a)(4) is separated from the prohibited activity with respect to a minor encompassed by subsection (a)(5) by the word \u201cor.\u201d In light of subsection (b), \u00a7 11-207 creates a single felony, which can be committed against a \u201cminor\u201d in numerous alternative ways. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>The victim is always the same, <em>ie., </em>the minor, and the alternative elements concern the different activities or conduct with regard to that victim. Nothing in the wording of the statute suggests that the General Assembly intended that there be alternative classes of victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Subsection (c) of \u00a7 11-207, dealing with evidence and trial procedure where the victim\u2019s identity is unknown or the victim is outside of the State\u2019s jurisdiction, applies to subsection (a)(5) as well as subsections (a)(1) through (a)(4). It is clear, however, that the term \u201cminor\u201d as used in five places in subsection (c) is referring to an actual minor. Subsection (c)(2) goes on to prescribe the different types of evidence which the trier of fact may rely upon in order to determine whether the victim was actually a minor. There would be no reason for making this provision applicable to subsection (a)(5) if the State\u2019s interpretation of that subsection were correct. Subsection (c)(2) underscores the General Assembly\u2019s intent that \u00a7 11-207, in its entirety, was designed to protect real persons who are actual \u201cminors\u201d as defined in the Criminal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">This interpretation of \u00a7 ll-207(a)(5) is confirmed by the legislative history of the subsection. What is now \u00a7 11\u2014 207(a)(5) of the Criminal Law Article, and prior to 2002 was \u00a7 419A(e) of Art. 27, was enacted by Ch. 443 of the Acts of 1996, contained in III <em>Laws of Maryland 1996 </em>at 2749-2751. In addition to adding new subsection (e) to \u00a7 419A, Ch. 443 repealed and reenacted with amendments the entire \u00a7 419A. The title of the enactment began by describing it as \u201cAN ACT concerning <em>Child </em>Pornography \u2014 Computers,\u201d and went on, <em>inter alia, </em>to describe the statute as one \u201cprohibiting a person from using a computer to ... exchange, transmit, [or] disseminate ... certain data <em>relating to minors </em>.... \u201d (emphasis added). The title of Ch. 443 continued by describing it as an act \u201cprohibiting certain computer operated depictions of certain conduct of or with a <em>minor; </em>... and generally relating to computers and <em>child </em>pornography.\u201d (Emphasis added). Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>sequently, the title of Ch. 443 reinforces the view that the Legislature intended to prohibit conduct involving actual minors or children. In numerous cases, this Court has held that the title of an enactment is an important indication of the General Assembly\u2019s intent. <em>See, e.g., Rockville v. Rylyns, </em>372 Md. 514, 555, 814 A.2d 469, 493 (2002) (\u201cIt is \u2018well settled\u2019 that \u2018the title of an act is relevant to ascertainment of its intent and purpose,\u2019 \u201d) quoting <em>MTA v. Balto. Co. Revenue Authority, </em>267 Md. 687, 695-696, 298 A.2d 413, 418 (1973); <em>Board v. Stephans, </em>286 Md. 384, 395, 408 A.2d 1017, 1022 (1979) (The purpose of the title \u201cis to inform the members of the General Assembly and the public of the nature of the proposed legislation\u201d); <em>State Farm v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>283 Md. 663, 674 n. 3, 392 A.2d 1114, 1120 n. 3 (1978) (\u201cThe title of an act is relevant in ascertaining the legislative intent and purpose\u201d); <em>Bd. of Co. Comm\u2019rs v. Colgan, </em>274 Md. 193, 200, 334 A.2d 89, 93 (1975) (\u201cFurther evidence that this section does not [support appellant\u2019s position] is made clear by its title\u201d); <em>City of Gaithersburg v. Mont.

Each of the other subsections of \u00a7 419A were reenacted with amendments, and each contained the word \u201cminor.\u201d It is very clear that the title and body of the statute, as reenacted with amendments and additions by Ch. 443 of the Acts of 1996, were referring to an actual person under the age of 18 and not a fictitious person or an adult believed by the defendant to be under 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Nothing in the several legislative reports concerning the bill which became Ch. 443 of the Acts of 1996 suggests that any part of the statute was intended to apply when the \u201cvictim\u201d was an adult or a fictitious person believed by the defendant to be under the age of 18.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the contrary, such legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>history confirms that the General Assembly in Ch. 443 was referring to an actual minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The bill which became Ch. 443 was House Bill (HB) 305 of the 1996 session. The Bill Analysis report on HB 305 by the House of Delegates\u2019 Judiciary Committee was headed <em>\u201cChild </em>Pornography \u2014 Computers\u201d (emphasis added), and the report consistently referred to the \u201cvictim\u201d as a \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cany minor.\u201d The Bill Analysis report on HB 305, by the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, was similarly headed \u201cChild Pornography \u2014 Computers,\u201d and it also consistently referred to actual \u201cminors.\u201d The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee\u2019s Floor report was to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The Fiscal Note concerning HB 305, prepared by the General Assembly\u2019s Department of Fiscal Services, described the new \u00a7 419A(e) as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">\u201cThe bill also prohibits a person from using a computer to disseminate or receive certain information <em>about a minor </em>for the purpose of engaging, facilitating, encouraging, offering, or soliciting unlawful sexual conduct....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Thus, a \u201cpurpose\u201d of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor was not deemed sufficient. The use of the computer to disseminate or receive information contemplated information \u201cabout a minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>After HB 305 was passed by both the House of Delegates and the Senate, Attorney General Curran on May 3, 1996, signed and sent to the Governor a three-page letter approving the bill for constitutionality. The letter at one point stated (p. 2, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\">\u201cThe majority of the provisions of the bill are clearly constitutional. It is established that the State may prohibit dissemination of material depicting sexual conduct by minors even though the material is not obscene. [Citation omitted]. <em>It is also well established that speech directed at the accomplishment of an illegal act is not protected by the First Amendment. </em>[Citations omitted].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Computer communications with an adult, for the purpose of a sexual liaison with an adult or with a fictitious person, however, are <em>not </em>ordinarily communications \u201cdirected at the accomplishment of an illegal act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In sum, there is no indication or hint in the legislative history of Ch. 443 of the Acts of 1996 supporting the view that the General Assembly contemplated anything broader than conduct aimed at or involving an actual minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">There have been several attempts in the General Assembly to amend former Art. 27, \u00a7 419A, or more recently \u00a7 11-207 of the Criminal Law Article, to prohibit computer communications with \u201csomeone believed to be a minor\u201d for the purpose of engaging in sexual conduct. None of those attempts has been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Thus, House Bill 584 of the 2000 regular session of the General Assembly, introduced by the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and two other delegates, would have, <em>inter alia, </em>added a new subsection (f)(1) to Art. 27, \u00a7 419A, providing as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">\u201cEvery person who, by means of computer, communicates WITH A MINOR <em>OR SOMEONE BELIEVED TO BE A MINOR </em>FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENOAOxlNG IN SEXUALLY EXPLICIT CONVERSATION TO SEDUCE, SOLICIT, LURE, OR ENTICE A MINOR <em>OR SOMEONE BELIEVED </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number><em>TO BE A MINOR </em>TO ENGAGE IN ANY SEXUAL CONDUCT, SEXUAL EXCITEMENT, OR SADOMASOCHISTIC ABUSE AS DEFINED IN \u00a7 416A OF this Article is subject to the penalty provided in subsection (g) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">House Bill 584 had apparently been a departmental bill recommended by the \u201cInternet-Based Crime Committee\u201d of the \u201cMaryland Information Technology Board,\u201d an agency within the Maryland Department of Budget and Management. <em>See </em>the Bill Analysis report on House Bill 584 by the House Judiciary Committee, at 2.

House Bill 202 would also have extended the prohibition in Art. 27, \u00a7 419(e), to a computer communication with \u201csomeone believed to be a minor.\u201d The Bill Analysis report on House Bill 202 by the House Judiciary Committee, at 2, stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-9\">\u201cHouse Bill 202 is a reintroduction of House Bill 584 of 2000 which was recommended by the Maryland Information Technology Board (ITB).

The Internet-Based Crime Committee of the ITB recommended several bills to address computer crimes, including House Bill 584 of 2000. That bill failed in the House Judiciary Committee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-5\">\u201cHouse Bill 202 is nearly identical to House Bill 584 of 2000. The only difference is the addition of the word \u2018unlawful\u2019 modifying the phrase \u2018sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sadomasochistic abuse\u2019 on page 2, in line 16.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The Legislative Committee and the Committee on Criminal Law and Procedure of the Maryland Judicial Conference supported House Bill 202. <em>See </em>Memorandum to the House Judiciary Committee from Elizabeth Buckler Veronis, staff person for the two Judicial Conference Committees, dated February 8, 2001, contained in the Department of Legislative Services\u2019 file on House Bill 202. Nonetheless, like its predecessor at the prior legislative session, House Bill 202 received an unfavorable report by the House Judiciary Committee and was not enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">At the 2002 regular session of the General Assembly, House Bill 99, which was similar to House Bill 584 of the 2000 session and House Bill 201 of the 2001 session, was introduced. This bill, however, was later withdrawn. <em>See </em>the Floor report on Senate Bill 409, 2003 regular session of the General Assembly, by the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Two similar bills were introduced at the 2003 regular session of the General Assembly, one being Senate Bill 409 and the other being House Bill 540. By 2003, former Art. 27, \u00a7 419A, had been recodified as \u00a7 11-207 of the Criminal Law Article. Like the earlier bills discussed above, both bills introduced at the 2003 session would have added a new subsection to the statute (now \u00a7 11-207), extending the prohibition to a person\u2019s computer communications with \u201csomeone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>believed by the person to be a minor for the purpose\u201d of engaging \u201cin unlawful sexual conduct\u201d with \u201csomeone believed by the person to be a minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee\u2019s Floor report on Senate Bill 409 of the 2003 session pointed out that \u201c[t]he existing prohibition against using a computer for illegally \u2018engaging, facilitating, encouraging, offering, or soliciting\u2019 a minor refers only to unlawful sexual conduct ... and does not include circumstances involving \u2018someone believed to be a minor.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 2). The Senate Floor report discussed the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of the charges in <em>State v. Taylor, supra, </em>371 Md. 617, 810 A.2d 964, and stated that \u201cthe dismissal of charges by the circuit court was upheld\u201d by the Court of Appeals. <em>(Id. </em>at 5).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The Department of Legislative Services\u2019 \u201cFiscal and Policy Note\u201d on Senate Bill 409 of the 2003 session was similar to the Floor report, pointing out that the existing prohibition in \u00a7 11-207, as well as the prohibition in \u00a7 3-307, \u201cdoes not include circumstances involving \u2018someone believed to be a minor.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Senate Bill 409 received a favorable report by the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee and was passed by the Senate with a vote of 47 in favor and 0 opposed. Nevertheless, like the previous attempts to broaden the statute\u2019s coverage, both Senate Bill 409 and House Bill 540 of the 2003 session died in the House of Delegates.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>A similar bill, House Bill 1331, was introduced at the 2004 regular session of the General Assembly. It received a \u201cunanimous\u201d unfavorable report by the House Judiciary Committee and was then withdrawn by the sponsor.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Although the failure of a single bill in the General Assembly may be due to many reasons, and thus is not always a good indication of the Legislature\u2019s intent, under some circumstances the failure to enact legislation is persuasive evidence of legislative intent. <em>See, e.g., Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 255-256, 863 A.2d 297, 303-304 (2004); <em>Arundel Coup. v.

State Farm, </em>381 Md. 436, 455, 849 A.2d 539, 550-551 (2004) (\u201cThe refusal of the Legislature to act to change a [statute] ... provides ... support for the Court to exercise restraint and refuse to step in and make the change\u201d); <em>In re Anthony R., supra, </em>362 Md. at 65-67, 763 A.2d at 144-145 (2000); <em>State v.

Bell, </em>351 Md. 709, 723, 720 A.2d 311, 318 (1998) (\u201cTherefore, by declining to adopt the proposed language of the amending bill, the Legislature clearly did not intend\u201d to adopt the result being urged); <em>State v.

Mane, supra, </em>383 Md. at 502-504, 860 A.2d at 894-896; <em>Stearman v. State Farm, supra, </em>381 Md. at 455, 849 A.2d at 551 (\u201cEvery year since 2000, legislators have introduced bills in the General Assembly that would\u201d accomplish what the appellant urges, but \u201c[n]one of these bills were enacted\u201d); <em>Bozman v.

Boblitz, </em>296 Md. 242, 274, 462 A.2d 506, 521 (1983) (The Court will decline to adopt a particular position \u201c \u2018where the Legislature repeatedly had rejected efforts to achieve legislatively that which we were asked to grant judicially\u2019 \u201d); <em>Halliday v. Sturm, </em>368 Md. 186, 209, 792 A.2d 1145, 1159 (2002) (The Court refused to adopt positions \u201cthat have been presented on several occasions to the General Assembly\u201d and \u201c[s]o far, the Legislature has chosen not\u201d to adopt them); <em>Harrison v. Mont. Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 442, 462, 456 A.2d 894, 904 (1983) (\u201cIt is thus important in the present case to note that in the period from 1966 through 1982, the General Assembly considered a total of twenty-one bills seeking [to adopt the appellant\u2019s position],... None of these bills was enacted. Although not conclusive, the legislature\u2019s action in rejecting the proposed change is indicative of [its] intention\u201d); <em>Kline v. Ansell, </em>287 Md. 585, 590, 414 A.2d 929, 932 (1980); <em>Demory Brothers v. Bd. of Public Works, </em>273 Md. 320, 326, 329 A.2d 674, 677 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">As pointed out in the above-cited cases, the General Assembly\u2019s repeated refusal to enact bills, which would have adopted a party\u2019s particular view of the law, is strong evidence of legislative intent. At least six bills filed in the 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 sessions of the General Assembly would have adopted the State\u2019s view of former \u00a7 419A and present \u00a7 11-207. None of these bills was enacted. The State is now asking this Court to adopt a strained interpretation of \u00a7 11-207, thereby accomplishing what the General Assembly has refused to do. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Neither the statutory language, nor the legislative history, nor subsequent legislative actions, support the State\u2019s position that \u00a7 11-207 covers the situation presented by the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">As previously noted, <em>supra </em>n. 2, \u00a7 3-307(a)(4) and (5) of the Criminal Law Article, entitled \u201cSexual offense in the third degree,\u201d prohibits a person who \u201cis at least 21 years old\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>from engaging in a \u201csexual act\u201d or \u201cvaginal intercourse with another if the victim is 14 or 15 years old.... \u201d Count two of the indictment against the defendant Richard Joseph Moore charged that Moore \u201cat Frederick County, Maryland, did unlawfully attempt to commit a sexual offense in the third degree upon a fourteen year old minor.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Paralleling its theory under \u00a7 11-207 of the Criminal Law Article, the State contends that, because Moore\u2019s purpose or intent was \u201cto engage in unlawful sexual conduct with a minor,\u201d and because, according to the State, he \u201ctook a substantial step towards commission of the crime, he can be convicted of attempt, even if the person he thought was a minor was an undercover adult police officer.\u201d (State\u2019s brief at 23, 25-26).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The defendant advances several alternative arguments against this theory, including the contention that a defendant\u2019s knowledge of the \u201cvictim\u2019s\u201d age \u201cis not an element of\u201d the crime charged, that the offense under \u00a7 3-307(a)(4) and (5) is \u201ca strict liability offense\u201d and crimes not involving intent \u201cgenerally fall outside the scope of attempt,\u201d that the agreed statement of facts failed to show \u201ca substantial step that goes beyond preparation and toward completion of the crime,\u201d that the defense of \u201clegal impossibility\u201d is applicable to the charge, that the crime of \u201cattempt\u201d is a lesser included offense of the consummated crime but \u201cthe State\u2019s reasoning would result in a greater or more culpable mental state for the lesser crime of attempt,\u201d etc. (Defendant\u2019s brief at 19-27, reply brief at 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Preliminarily, it is questionable whether count two of the indictment even covered the State\u2019s theory of the case. Count two flatly charged that the defendant, in Frederick County, \u201cdid unlawfully attempt to commit a sexual offense in the third degree <em>upon a fourteen year old mimr.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Under the agreed statement of facts, there was no evidence of a fourteen year old minor present at the location in Frederick County or even a fourteen year old ever involved in the case. The language of count two may simply not cover an adult or fictitious person believed by the defendant to be a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Nevertheless, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that count two is sufficient to embrace the State\u2019s theory, we agree with the defendant that the crime of an attempted third degree sexual offense under the common law and under \u00a7 3 \u2014 307(a)(4) and (5), does not cover the situation presented by this case. In reaching our decision, however, we need not and shall not decide some of the issues raised by the defendant. Specifically, we shall not reach either the defendant\u2019s argument that there was no \u201csubstantial step that goes beyond preparation\u201d or his argument based on \u201clegal impossibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In <em>Walker v. State, </em>363 Md. 253, 256, 261, 768 A.2d 631, 633, 635 (2001), a majority of the Court flatly held that the offense under former Art. 27, \u00a7 464 B(a)(5), now codified as \u00a7 3-307(a)(5) of the Criminal Law Article, was a \u201c \u2018strict\u2019 criminal liability\u201d offense with respect to the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the \u201cvictim\u2019s\u201d age, that the offense had no <em>\u201cmens rea </em>element\u201d in this regard, and that \u201cthe availability of a defense of reasonable mistake of age cannot be read into the carnal knowledge between a fourteen or fifteen year old victim and a defendant who is age twenty-one or older.\u201d Under the <em>Walker </em>opinion, the same holding would apply to the offense under \u00a7 3-307(a)(4) of the Criminal Law Article. <em>See also Owens v.

State, </em>348 Md. 272, 283-284, 703 A.2d 180, 186 (1997), Judge Wilner for the Court reviewed some of the principles underlying the crime of attempt (footnote omitted, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">\u201cBy Maryland common law, the attempt to commit a crime is, itself, a separate crime \u2014 a misdemeanor. As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>pointed out in <em>Cox v. State, </em>311 Md. 326, 330-31, 534 A.2d 1333, 1335 (1988), attempt \u2018is an adjunct crime, it cannot exist by itself, but only in connection with another crime,\u2019 and it thus \u2018expands and contracts and is redefined commensurately with the substantive offense.\u2019 <em>See also Hardy v. State, </em>301 Md. 124, 482 A.2d 474 (1984). Subject to some exceptions, common law attempt has been held applicable to common law crimes and to a number of statutory offenses. <em>Bruce v. State, </em>317 Md. 642, 645, 566 A.2d 103, 104 (1989). <em>There are, however, at least two categories of substantive crimes, to which criminal attempt has been held inapplicable. The first consists of crimes that d,o not require at least a general criminal intent. Cox v. State, supra, </em>311 Md. at 331, 534 A.2d at 1335: \u2018There is an exception, however, to the general rule that attempt applies to all offenses. <em>Crimes that do not involve intent to do a criminal act generally fall outside the scope of the crime of attempt. </em>If there is no intent to do a wrongful act, then usually there is no crime of attempt.\u2019 The second category consists of substantive crimes that are, themselves, in the nature of attempts. Simple assault is often cited as an example. Although we need not decide the matter here, there may be other crimes as well that may not be suitable for serving as the basis of a criminal attempt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-5\"><em>See also, e.g., Bruce v. State, </em>317 Md. 642, 646, 566 A.2d 103, 105 (1989) (\u201cBecause a conviction for felony murder requires no ... intent to kill, it follows that ... attempted felony murder is not a crime in Maryland\u201d); <em>Cox v. State, </em>311 Md. 326, 332, 534 A.2d 1333, 1336 (1988) (\u201c \u2018[S]o long as the crime of attempt is deemed to require an intent-type of mental state, there can be no such thing as an attempt to commit criminal negligence involuntary manslaughter\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Since the offense under \u00a7 3-307(a)(4) and (5) has no intent element or <em>mens rea </em>element with regard to the \u201cvictim\u2019s\u201d age, it follows that, absent a change in the statute, there can be no crime of attempt such as charged in the present indictment. The fact that the defendant in the case actually had an intent to engage in sexual activity with a fourteen year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>old person does not in itself create a crime where there is no such crime of attempted third degree sexual offense under the present statutory scheme and common law principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Other aspects of the common law crime of attempt militate against the State\u2019s theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Prior to 1976, there was a degree of confusion concerning the nature of attempt under Maryland common law. Language in a few of this Court\u2019s earlier opinions indicated that the offense of attempt was entirely distinct from the consummated offense and contained an additional element, namely failure to consummate the crime. Under this view, a defendant could not be convicted of attempt if the evidence disclosed a consummated crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Beginning with <em>Lightfoot v. State, </em>278 Md. 231, 360 A.2d 426 (1976), however, this Court has held, in accordance with the majority of American jurisdictions, that an attempt is a lesser included offense of the consummated crime, that the elements of attempt are contained in the consummated -crime, and that only the consummated crime has an additional or distinct element. <em>See, e.g., Skrivanek v. State, </em>356 Md. 270, 281-283, 739 A.2d 12, 18-19 (1999) (Upon a charge of the consummated offense, a defendant can be convicted of the lesser included offense of attempt, and \u201cthe elements of attempt cannot be considered without considering the elements of the consummated crime\u201d); <em>Grill v. State, </em>337 Md. 91, 94, 651 A.2d 856, 857 (1995); <em>Townes v. State, </em>314 Md. 71, 76, 548 A.2d 832, 834 (1988) (\u201c \u2018[Ajttempt is a lower ... degree of the [consummated] offense because it is a part of it. It is not something separate and distinct\u2019 \u201d); <em>Hardy v. State, </em>301 Md. 124, 139, 482 A.2d 474, 482 (Attempt is a lesser \u201cdegree\u201d offense which \u201cexpands and contracts and is redefined commensurate with the substantive offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The State\u2019s theory in the present case, however, would make attempt a distinct offense, containing an element which is not contained in the consummated offense. Attempt would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>no longer be a lesser included offense. The State would insert a <em>mens rea </em>element into attempted third degree sexual offense under \u00a7 3-807(a)(4) and (5) which is not contained in the statutory consummated offense. That element would be the defendant\u2019s <em>belief </em>that the person with whom the defendant was communicating was fourteen or fifteen years old. Such <em>mens rea </em>is not part of the statute. Under \u00a7 3-307(a)(4) and (5), a defendant may reasonably believe that the person with whom he is engaging in sexual activity is an adult policewoman, but if she turns out to be a fifteen year old student, the defendant will be guilty under the statute. On the other hand, a defendant may believe that the person with whom he is engaging in sexual activity is a fifteen year old student, but if the \u201cvictim\u201d turns out to be an adult, the defendant will not be guilty of violating \u00a7 3-307(a)(4) and (5) regardless of his belief. Belief as to age is simply irrelevant under \u00a7 3-307(a)(4) and (5). The State would, nevertheless, make belief as to age an element of attempt, thereby making attempt a wholly distinct offense. This would be directly contrary to our cases delineating the nature of attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO ENTER JUDGMENTS OF ACQUITTAL.

I feel compelled to write separately because of my dismay at the outcome of this case. The majority is correct in its interpretation of the language of Section 11-207 of the Criminal Law Article to encompass only those acts involving individuals under the age of 18 years, as defined in Section l-101(g) of the Criminal Law Article. Because of the limitation inherent in the language of the statute, law enforcement is deprived of a powerful tool in its fight to protect our children from online predators. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>fore, I would urge the General Assembly to reconsider revising the language of Section 11-207 to include those scenarios where the defendant believed he was communicating identifying information about a minor. A slight change in the provision of the statute could enable law enforcement to prevent future victimization of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Title 18, Section 2422 of the United States Code governing federal law enforcement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">(b) Whoever, using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of 18 years, to engages in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be changed with a criminal offense, <em>or attempts to do so, </em>shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less that 5 years and not more than 30 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) (emphasis added). The phrase \u201cor attempts to do so\u201d has been interpreted by the federal courts as permitting the prosecution of an individual under the statute in situations in which a law enforcement officer \u201cposes\u201d as a minor. <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>1 F.Supp.2d 1419 (N.D.Ala.1998) (holding that the mere fact that the alleged victims were in fact not persons under the age of eighteen did not preclude conviction for the use of means of interstate commerce in attempting sexual contact with minors).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Alternatively, the General Assembly could consider adding language to Section ll-207(a)(5) expanding the scope of the statute to include the use of the Internet to disseminate identifying information for the purpose of engaging in sexual conduct with a minor, <em>or a person believed to be a minor. </em>This is the language contained in the computer pornography and child exploitation statute in Florida, which was determined to be sufficient to permit conviction where a law enforcement officer posed as a minor in an online chat room. <em>See Karwoski v. State, </em>867 So.2d 486 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004) (finding that sufficient evidence supported conviction for com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>puter child exploitation, even though purported victim was actually an undercover police officer).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Therefore, because of the consequences of our decision in the present case, I write separately to urge the General Assembly to act swiftly to enact language permitting law enforcement to deter those who prey upon our children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-15\">. As the majority notes, although the General Assembly has not amended Section 11-207 of the Criminal Law Article to apply to a scenario such as that in the present case, it has enacted Section 3-324 of the Criminal Law Article. See Md. Code (2002, 2005 Cum.Supp.), Sec. 3-324 of the Criminal Law Article. The language of the Section 3-324 does not appear as broad as the federal and Florida statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
