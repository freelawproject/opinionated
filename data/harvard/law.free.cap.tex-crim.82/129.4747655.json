There was no written notice given him prior to the filing of the complaint and information and if any written notice has been served upon him at any time the evidence of it is found in the testimony of Dr. Julian. His testimony as that he never did inspect defendant\u2019s cattle or premises;-never was at his premises before June, 1917 \u201cI don\u2019t know whether defendant\u2019s cattle ever had any fever ticks. \u25a0 I gave him a notice to dip his cattle, horses and mules on that day, June 8, 1917.\u201d If this is sufficient evidence to show he had a notice, it shows that it was given nearly a year after the complaint and information were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-15\">There are other interesting questions in the case but we deem it Unnecessary, in view of this decision, to discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-16\">The judgment will be. reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-17\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
