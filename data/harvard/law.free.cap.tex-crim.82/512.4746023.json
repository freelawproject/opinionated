Appellant claims that he is exempt from the prohibition in article 302 under a provision of article 303, which exempts livery stables. The rule of ejusdem generis could have no application for the reason that that rule is effective only when there are general words following specific words. The general words are held to include things of like or similar kind. Cyc., vol. 36, p. 1119. In the exempting statute there are no general words, thus excluding the. application of this rule. A garage, which is the modern substitute for the livery stable, is defined as a place for the care and storage of motor vehicles and in which such vehicles are kept for hire. Cyc., vol. 28, p. 42. A livery stable is a place where horses are groomed, fed and hired, and vehicles are kept for hire. Cye., vol. 25, p. 1505. If it were conceded that owing to the fact that livery stables have become practically obsolete and garages have supplanted them, that the term garage should be read into the statute in lieu of the term livery stable, it would not follow that the appellant would be exempt under the statute because it is charged that he was a merchant and dealer in wares and merchandise and that he sold engine oil on Sunday. The occupation and acts in which he was engaged are not within the scope of the business of a livery stable keeper, nor the keeper of a garage so far as we have found them legally defined. A keeper of a garage or the keeper of a livery stable might also be engaged in the business of selling merchandise, and as such be liable for violation of the statute in question. It is suggested, however, that the sale in question was necessary and that this fact would constitute an exemption from prosecution. As a general rule, statutes regulating the observance of Sunday make exceptions in favor of works of necessity and charity. Cyc., vol. 37, p. 552. Our statute, art. 299, prohibits labor on Sunday, and article 300 -provides exemptions, among which are the following: \u201cWorks of necessity or charity.\u201d The fact that this exemption is contained in article 300 relating to labor and is not contained in article 303 with reference to selling goods on Sunday is suggestive of the legislative intent to limit the exemption on account of necessity or charity to the things referred to in article 299 relating to working on Sunday and to have embraced in article 303 in a specific way the matters which were intended to be exempt from article 302. If such construction was a matter of doubt, it suffices, so far as the facts of the case in hand are concerned, to say that in our opinion the sale of oil under the circumstances mentioned in the bill of exceptions was not shown to be necessary within the legal sense. Ex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>parte Kennedy, 42 Texas Crim. Rep., 148; Cyc., vol. 37, p. 552; Quarles v. State, 14 L. R. A., 192; Cyc., vol. 37, p. 554, and eases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The law, article 303, expressly exempts from the prohibition, dealers in provisions as to sales made before 9 o\u2019clock a. m. and also exempts drug stores. The emergency described is not shown to have been such as would have prevented the acquisition of oil from one of these sources. A necessity voluntarily brought about which -could have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary discretion is not a defense, even in a case where the statute makes works of necessity a defense. Shipley v. State, 61 Ark., 216, 32 S. W. Rep., 489, 33 S. W. Rep., 107; State v. Stuckey, 98 Mo. App., 664, 73 S. W. Rep., 735; Bucher v. Fitchburg R. Co., 41 Am. Rep., 216. Judge Henderson, in writing the opinion of this court in Ex parte Kennedy, supra, uses the following language: \u201cWe believe that our statutes, in authorizing a work of necessity on Sunday, meant something more than mere convenience. It apprehended that there must be some peculiar exigency which would authorize Sunday labor.\u201d In our opinion appellant\u2019s occupation was not included in any exemptions. From Cyc., vol. 37, p. 548, we quote the following: \u201cWhere the statute contains no exceptions, the nature of the business of defendant is immaterial, and the fact that it is a work of necessity, or charity, or that it is not unlawful in itself, constitutes no defense. In construing the statutory exceptions, the ordinary signification of the words used controls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">In our opinion, the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
