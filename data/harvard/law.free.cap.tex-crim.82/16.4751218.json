Where, upon trial of fornication, the information charged in separate counts each phase of the offense, that is, first, while living together, and second, without living together, and the first count was abandoned, and the second count only was submitted, this was an election by the State of the second count, and the evidence supporting a conviction thereof, there was no reversible error.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b48-8\">2. \u2014Same\u2014Requested Charge\u2014Practice.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b48-9\">Where, upon trial of fornication charging living together in the first count, the same was abandoned and the court submitted only the second count alleging without living together of the parties, there was no error in the court\u2019s failure to submit a charge upon the first count.

An inspection of the recognizance discloses the correctness of this contention, and following previous decisions the motion must he sustained. Martoni v. State, 74 Texas Crim. Rep., 64, 166 S. W.

The first count was abandoned and the second count only was submitted to the jury. The effect of this was to leave the case in the status as though only the second count had been embraced in the information. Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., p. 232; Betts v. State, 57 Texas Crim. Rep., 391. There was direct testimony to acts of intercourse and circumstances to show they were habitual. The parties were unmarried and there was evidence that they were not living together. The evidence, in our judgment, is sufficient to sustain the finding of guilty under the second count of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Appellant, by special charges, sought to have the court define tne term \u201cwhile living together,\u201d and complains of failure to charge upon the first count of the information which contained that term. These criticisms are not well founded for the reason that the first count of the information was abandoned and the State, in effect, elected to prosecute under the second count. Weathersby v. State, 1 Texas Crim. App., 646. The cases cited by appellant\u2014Bird v. State, 27 Texas Crim. App., 635, and Thomas v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 300, 12 S. W. Rep., 1098\u2014are not in opposition to the correctness of the procedure followed. They go to the point that an indictment charging fornication while living together is not sustained by proof of habitual carnal intercourse while not living together. This is a sound proposition hut not applicable to this case. The law was correctly submitted in the court\u2019s charge applicable to the second count. The proof sustains the finding and there are no errors found in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The order dismissing the case is set aside and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
