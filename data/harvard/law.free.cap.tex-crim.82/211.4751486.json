The recognizance fails to set out the amount of the punishment as is required by the statutory form. It recites that appellant was charged with aggravated assault and convicted of simple assault, but does not mention the amount of punishment. The motion will be sustained and the appeal dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-18\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
