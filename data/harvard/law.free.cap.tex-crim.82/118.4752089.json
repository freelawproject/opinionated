C. P., wherein it is provided that cases appealed from inferior courts to the County Court, and the judgment there rendered consisting of a fine of less than one hundred dollars, are not appealable to this court. A number of cases are cited in Vernon\u2019s C. C. P., p. 47, sustaining this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
