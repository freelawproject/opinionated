It is unnecessary to discuss the evidence. A careful review of it, however, convinces ns that relator is entitled to bail, and that the trial court eTred in refusal of it. The judgment, therefore, will be reversed and bail granted in the sum of three thousand dollars. Upon the giving of proper bond, to be approved by the officer who holds relator in custody, he will be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-22\">The judgment is reversed and bail granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-23\">\n<em>Bail granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
