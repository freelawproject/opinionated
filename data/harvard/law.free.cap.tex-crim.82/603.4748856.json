He did not attach thereto the affidavit of the person whose testimony he claimed was newly discovered and his motion on this ground is wholly insufficient under the well established law pertaining thereto. However, the court heard the testimony on this ground and after hearing it overruled the motion. This evidence was attempted to be preserved in both a bill of exceptions and a statement of facts, but both filed in the lower court after the adjournment of the term, hence this question can not be reviewed by this court as has many times been held by it.
