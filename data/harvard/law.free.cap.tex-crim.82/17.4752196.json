The evidence was amply sufficient to sustain the verdict and the court gave a correct charge, submitting every issue raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-14\">There are hut two questions raised: One is his complaint that for the purpose of impeaching his veracity the State was permitted to ask him, and he required to answer, that on April 10, 1912, he had been convicted in the District Court of said' county of forgery under the name of Erank Charles and served a term in, the penitentiary. It has always been held that such evidence of impeachment was admissible in this State. 1 Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., sec. 167, where a large number of cases are collated.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-15\">The other bill shows that he objected to certain leading questions propounded by the State to its witness Jemison. The bill is wholly insufficient to show that the court erred in permitting the leading questions under Carter v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 75, and other cases cited in 1 Branch\u2019s Ann. P. 0., sec. 159. But in this case the court, qualifies his bill by showing that these leading questions were permitted 'to be asked the witness Jemison and his answers given because his testimony was 'in direct impeachment of appellant when he denied making to Jemison the statements which Jemispn said he did make to him, and the court in his charge limited the testimony of said Jemison in answer to said questions for impeachment purposes only. The. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ruling of the court was based upon the rule of law which is well established and accurately stated in 40 Cyc., 2751: \u201cThe usual and most exact method of examining an impeaching witness is to ask the precise question put to the witness sought to be impeached in laying a foundation, and such question is not objectionable because of its leading character.\u201d To the same effect is 5 Jones on Evidence, p. 211. It is unnecessary to cite other authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The judgment is affirmed. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
