In Brewer v. State, 5 Texas Crim. App., 248; Blake v. State, 3 Texas Crim. App., 149; Collins v. State, 5 Texas Crim. App., 37, and McCoy v. State, 43 Texas Crim. Rep., 606, pleading containing the same defect was held so defective as to require the court to sustain the motion in arrest of judgment. The averment leaves the alleged date of the offense uncertain. Complaint is made that the court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment, and following the rule announced in the authorities mentioned this contention must be sustained, this though the information did not carry forward the defect. It could not be thus cured under the decisions of this State. Drummond v. State, 4 Texas Crim. App., 150; Goddard v. State, 14 Texas Crim. App., 566; Huff v. State, 23 Texas Crim.
