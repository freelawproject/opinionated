Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Pursuant to a negotiated disposition, defendant Mark Wayne Allison pled guilty to one count of cultivation of marijuana. Defendant also admitted that he had previously been convicted of four serious or violent felonies within the meaning of section 667, subdivisions (d) and (e), consisting of three counts of assault with a firearm and one count of kidnapping.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> All four priors were charged in a single information and were disposed of in a single proceeding on February 11, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">At sentencing, defendant argued that the four prior felonies should be counted as only a single \u201cstrike\u201d because they were not \u201cbrought and tried separately.\" The trial court rejected this argument, sentencing defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>an indeterminate term of 25 years to life in state prison. (See \u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2)(A)(ii), <em>ante, </em>fn. 2.) Defendant has filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">A. <em>Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress Was Properly </em>Denied<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">B. <em>The Three Strikes Law Treats Each Prior Serious or Violent Felony as a Separate \u201cStrike\u201d Regardless of Whether It Was \u201cBrought and Tried Separately\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Defendant argues that the Three Strikes Law requires that prior serious or violent felonies have been \u201cbrought and tried separately\u201d in order to qualify as multiple \u201cstrikes.\u201d In making this argument, defendant relies on the language of section 667, subdivision (a), which provides that \u201cany person convicted of a serious felony who previously has been convicted of a serious felony in this state or of any offense committed in another jurisdiction which includes all of the elements of any serious felony, shall receive, in addition to the sentence imposed by the court for the present offense, a five-year enhancement for each such prior conviction on charges <em>brought and tried </em>separately.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on section 667, subdivision (a), is misplaced. Section 667, subdivision (a), is an enhancement statute. The Three Strikes Law, by contrast, \u201cis the articulation of a parallel sentencing scheme for specifically described recidivists.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 587, 595 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 474].) Under the Three Strikes Law, the determination of whether a prior felony qualifies as a \u201cstrike\u201d is made under section 667, subdivision (d), which applies \u201c[notwithstanding any other law.\u201d (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 2.) Nothing in section 667, subdivision (d), requires that prior serious or violent felonies have been \u201cbrought and tried separately\u201d in order to qualify as multiple \u201cstrikes.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the Legislature included an analogous requirement for current charges in section 667, subdivision (c)(6), which provides that \u201c[i]f there is a current conviction for more than one felony count <em>not committed on the same occasion, and not arising from the same set of operative facts, </em>the court shall sentence the defendant consecutively on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>each count pursuant to subdivision (e).\u201d (Italics added.) If the Legislature had intended to include a comparable \u201cbrought and tried separately\u201d requirement with respect to prior serious or violent felonies, it would have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">C. <em>Remaining Sentencing Issues</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Strankman, P. J., and Stein, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 21, 1996. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-10\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ahz\">Section 667, subdivisions (d) and (e), provide, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyO\">\u201c(d) Notwithstanding any other law and for the purposes of subdivisions (b) to (i), inclusive, a prior conviction of a felony shall be defined as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayg\">\u201c(1) Any offense defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 as a violent felony or any offense defined in subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7 as a serious felony in this state. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANqi\">\u201c(e) For purposes of subdivisions (b) to (i), inclusive, and in addition to any other enhancement or punishment provisions which may apply, the following shall apply where a defendant has a prior felony conviction:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADV\">\u201c(1) If a defendant has one prior felony conviction that has been pled and proved, the determinate term or minimum term for an indeterminate term shall be twice the term otherwise provided as punishment for the current felony conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYs\">\u201c(2)(A) If a defendant has two or more prior felony convictions as defined in subdivision (d) that have been pled and proved, the term for the current felony conviction shall be an indeterminate term of life imprisonment with a minimum term of the indetermiante sentence calculated as the greater of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAqR\">\u201c(i) Three times the term otherwise provided as punishment for each current felony conviction subsequent to the two or more prior felony conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMV4\">\u201c(ii) Imprisonment in the state prison for 25 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asd7\">\u201c(iii) The term determined by the court pursuant to Section 1170 for the underlying conviction, including any enhancement applicable under Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 1170) of Title 7 of Part 2, or any period prescribed by Section 190 or 3046. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 841.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Defendant relies on a number of general principles of statutory construction to support his contention that the Three Strikes Law includes a \u201cbrought and tried separately\u201d requirement.
