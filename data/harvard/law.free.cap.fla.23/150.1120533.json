Act February 13, 1831, 1 Fla. Laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-5\">Hence judgments as to <em>personal </em>property obtained at the same term to be satisfied according to the statute in attachment must be satisfied according to priority of execution, and without the statute according to common priority of attachment. Drake on Attachment, 269.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-6\">Statute therefore not applicable to <em>personal </em>property, and attachments take precedency and are entitled to priority in order of point of time of service, as at common law. Drake on Attachment, 231 and note 1, 260-1. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-7\">Attachment is here used as an ancillary process and creates a charge on attached property, which continues to attachment creditor to await judgment in <em>real </em>and judgment and <em>execution </em>on <em>personal </em>property. 14 Fla., 187 ; 9 Fla., 61; Foster\u2019s Case, 2 Story, R. 131; Fisher vs. Vose, 3 Rob., (La.) 457; Drake Attach., 36 and 228 ; Bellows vs. Peck, 2 Story, 428; Hale vs. Cummings, 3 Ala., 398.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-8\">The statute not applying, this attachment being first in this case is first in right and is to be satisfied in full. Drake on Attachment, 260-1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-9\">Yet supposing or omitting statute applicable to personal property it can only be applicable so as to mean on judgments obtained at same term as to <em>real </em>property and judgment and <em>execution </em>as to <em>personal </em>property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-10\">And if so, if applicable to personal property, it must be held that the statute puts all attachment liens on an equal footing and allows no priority of attachment; such lien must await judgment in case of <em>reed </em>property, and <em>execution </em>incase <em>o\u00ed personal </em>property to be perfected. 14 Fla., 197-8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>The statute does not attempt to regulate such liens, and judgment and execution liens remain to be acquired as before. Yet we raise the question (if the statute is applicable in any sense to <em>personal </em>property), if it contemplates or includes successive attachments, or <em>anything </em>but attachments simultaneously levied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-5\">Execution is absolutely necessary to perfect even attachment lien, and <em>personal </em>property can only be affected by <em>execution. </em>Drake on Attachment, 262 and 228 ; 23 Pick., 465 ; 46 Mo., 31</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-6\">Lien of attachment is merged in the judgment. Drake Attach., 224.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-7\">Hence in case of attaching creditors, he who by diligence first obtains <em>execution </em>and gets it into the hands of the officer, and even (if both judgments obtained at the same term as to <em>personal </em>property) he is to be satisfied in full and not pro rata.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-8\">Where two judgments or executions have no priority over each other as liens, priority may be gained by activity and diligence, and he who first begins to execute obtains priority over creditors equally meritorious but less diligent. 5 Am.

Drake, 261, 230, and note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-8\">Post vs. Carpenter, 3 Fla., in the light of the foregoing-authorities, does not properly construe the statute, especially in so far as personal property is concerned, for if the statute-be appliccable it must be read * * * \u201c pro rata as to-execution placed in the hands of the officer <em>at the same-</em>term., as <em>executions </em>only so placed are liens, not * * * pro rata as between <em>judgments obtained at same time.\u201d</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-10\"><em>Hartridge $\u25a0 Young </em>for Defendants in Error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b167-11\">Mr. Justice Raney</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">delivered the opinion of the court..</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">This is a controversy as to the manner in which the-proceeds of personal property, levied upon under several writs of attachment against the partnership effects of Dowling &amp; Coxe, should be applied to the payment of judgments recovered against such partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">The attachment writ in the suit of the plaintiffs in error issued from Duval Circuit Court at noon of August 8 thy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>1883, and was levied on certain articles immediately before 2 o\u2019clock P. M. of the same day, it being ancillary to an action of assumpsit in which the summons <em>ad respondendum </em>was issued and served the same day. On the same day but afterwards the Sheriff received another writ of attachment at the suit of Thurber &amp; Co., and on the 9th, one at the \u25a0suit of Chas. E. Powers, and on the 11th one at the suit of Reedy &amp; Son, and one in favor of Williams &amp; Co., and another in favor of McAlpin &amp; Co., and on the 18th one in favor of Allen &amp; Co., and on the 21st one in favor of Kerr &lt;&amp; Co., as well as one in favor of Paret &amp; Co., and one at suit of Meinhardt Bros. &amp; Co., and on the 23d another in -favor of Powers, as well as one in favor of Einstein &amp; Sons, and on the 24th day of the same month one at the suit of Wood, Rittenhouse &amp; Bro, and on August 9th one in favor \u25a0of Wightman &amp; Christopher. All these writs issued from Duval Circuit Court, and each was executed; on the \u25a0day of its issue by levying on the same property which -that in favor of the plaintiffs in error had been levied on, as well as upon other property of the defendants, Dowling A Coxe. The levy of the writ of the plaintiffs in error was afterwards extended to the property which it did not .-at first cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">On the 29th of August orders for the sale of the goods .\u25a0as perishable property were made on application of each \u25a0of the following plaintiffs in their respective suits, viz: Smith, J r., &amp; Co., Thurber &amp; Co., Powers, Williams, Paret \u25a0&amp; Co., Meinhardt Bros. &amp; Co., and Einstein &amp; Sons. The goods were sold accordingly, in September, and those first levied on at the suit of Smith, Jr., &amp; Co., produced $380, \u25a0 and all the goods, including those first referred to, brought .$2,572.04, the expenses being $273.85, and leaving a balance of $2,299.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Plaintiffs in error entered a default and final judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>for $371.19 and costs, against Dowling &amp; Coxe, on 0 ctober 1st of the same year (it being a rule day) in the Circuit Court Clerk\u2019s office, and on the same day several judgments were entered against Dowling &amp; Coxe in other of the attachment suits for sums which in the aggregate,, largely exceed the amount realized from the sale of the property attached. On the 11th day of October execution issued to the Sheriff in the above judgment, the Sheriff being then instructed to levy it on the proceeds of the sale then in his possession, and on the 12th of same month execution in the suit of Kerr &amp; Co. was received by the Sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The plaintiff in error claimed that his execution should be satisfied in full as having priority over the other judgment or execution creditors. \"Whereas the latter contend that as their judgments were rendered on the\" same rule day,, the moneys held by the Sheriff should be applied pro rata, to the several judgments so entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Upon a rule against the Sheriff, Judge Foster of the 7th Circuit acting in the place of Judge Baker of the 4th Circuit, ordered that the moneys, less expenses and com-' missions, be applied pro rata to the \u201cjudgments obtained at the same term of the court,\u201d and plaintiffs in error being-dissatisfied have brought the case here for our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Under the decision of Post vs. Carpenter <em>et </em>al., 3 Fla., 1, there can be no doubt that the moneys in question should be applied pro rata to the judgments in question had they been rendered at any ordinary term (whether regular or special) of the Circuit Court. The fact that the attachment in the case of the plaintiffs in error or in any of the actions, was ancillary to an ordinary suit begun by writ <em>ad respondendum, </em>makes no difference. Though the language of the act is \u201c that a judgment in a suit <em>commenced by attachment </em>shall be satisfied in the same manner as other judgments obtained at the same term of the court are, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\u2022shall be satisfied out of the lauds and tenements, goods and \u2022chattels generally of the defendant in attachment,\u201d we do not think it was the purpose of the law makers to provide that a judgment in an action in which there was also a \u2022service of summons <em>ad respondendum </em>should not be subject to the same rule of satisfaction as one in which there was none. The service of a summons should have such effect \u25a0no more than a voluntary appearance or a plea to the declaration. \u201cWe think,\u201d says the opinion in Post vs. Carpenter, \u201cit was the intention of the Legislature to place judgments obtained at the same term, whether the suits 'in which they were obtained were instituted by attachment \u2022or ordinary summons, upon the same footing.\u201d It was certainly the intention that at least the property attached in \u25a0different suits should be applied pro rata to the judgments rendered in such suits at the same term, whether or not there was service of an ordinary summons .in any or all of them. The provision of the statute quoted steps in and regulates the satisfaction of such judgments, thus qualifying the effect of the provision that the service of the writ shall bind the property attached, which provision, but for the one quoted, would give a plaintiff a lien from the date -of the levy, and consequently one of priority over others subsequently levied, regardless of the date of the rendition \u25a0of the judgment. The provision quoted, we may also remark, anticipates where it applies any contests for priority of lien on the ground of priority in the issue of executions, if this can be at any time a serious question. Zinn, Aldrich &amp; Co. vs. Dzialynski, 14 Fla., 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Prior to the practice act of 1873, (chapter 1938, approved Feb\u2019y 24th,) common law writs issuing from the Circuit Courts were returnable to regular terms of the court and judgments could be rendered in such actions only in term.. By such act, however, the first Monday in each month is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>made or designated a rule day, and \u201con such first Monday of each month the Circuit Court shall be deemed to be <em>opened </em>and <em>in session </em>at each of the Clerk\u2019s offices for the return of writs and process; for the entrj7 of such judgments by default as are provided for by this act, or the rules of the court now existing or which may hereafter be adopted,\u201d and also for disposing of all matters, rules, orders and interlocutory proceedings which parties may apply for, and which by the practice of the court may be entered of course, or which are granted without the special -order of the Judge. All writs are by it made returnable to a rule day, and it declares in what cases defaults and final judgments consequent thereon may be entered, and regulates the entry of the same and provides that writs of execution upon judgments so issued may issue \u201c after the lapse of ten days from entering the same unless otherwise ordered by the court or the Judge thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The case of Burrows vs. Mickler, 22 Fla., and Stribling vs. Hart, 20 Fla., 235, are of some interest as to the effect or nature of judgments under this act, or decrees rendered in vacation. .</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Though there are incidents and characteristics belonging to an ordinary term, whether general or special, which do not attach to a \u201c session \u201d of the court when \u201c opened \u201d under the above statute, yet in so far as the effect or efficiency of a judgment rendered at such a \u201c session \u201d upon the defendants\u2019 property, or in so far as the provisions of the attachment statutes in question, as to the satisfaction of judgments rendered at the same term, we can perceive no difference between such a \u201c session \u201d and an ordinary term of the court. At a term of a court the court is \u201c opened and in session these words, in so far as the power involved is concerned, mean no more nor any less than the words \u201cin term \u201d would mean if they had been used at the same place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>in the same statute. The real purpose of the attachment acts was that judgments rendered at the same session of the court should be satisfied in the same manner, and those rendered on a rule day are as much within this purpose as those rendered at a session which we usually call a regular or special term.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The construction which we place upon the words \u201c same term\u201d used in the order of Judge Foster, is \u201csame rule day,\u201d and as no judgment was rendered at any other <em>term, </em>no other construction is tenable. So construing' his language, the order should be affirmed, and it will be so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
