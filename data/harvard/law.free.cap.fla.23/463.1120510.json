When an article has no market value its value may be shown by proof of facts affecting the question, and naturally calculated to aid the jury in reaching a correct conclusion. The price at which a similar thing may have sold in the same locality, and the opinion of persons properly informed as to the value of things of the same kind, may be proven.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b475-7\">2. A franchise or bare right to do a thing is of no value when considered exclusively of its utility. Its value is dependent upon the practical use to which it can be put, or the profit which, by proper management, can be made out of it.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b475-9\">3. When a franchise is of such a character as to render both an expenditure of money and the application of business judgment and skill in its management necessary to make it useful and profitable, its value must be determined by a consideration of it in connection with such possibilities.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b475-11\">4. When the opinion of a witness as to the value of a franchise granted by a city to build and operate a wharf is based upon his own experience in the construction and successful operation of a wharf under a similar franchise, such opinion is not made inadmissible as evidence by the fact that such witness cannot state what is the value of the former franchise in itself and without reference to the improvement of which it is capable.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b475-13\">5. An opinion of the value of such a franchise, which is based upon the assumption of the profit which could be derived from the operation of a wharf to be constructed under it, is not made inadmissible as evidence by the fact that such witness cannot state the value of it when considered without reference to the ability of the person owning it to build a wharf and make business for it.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b475-15\">6. Where a city has granted a franchise to a person at a certain price, and the grant is assignable by such person, the consideration charged by the city for the franchise is not conclusive upon the question of its value in an action between the original grantee and his vendee growing out of a subsequent sale of such franchise.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b475-17\">7.

The acknowledgment in a deed assigning- a franchise to build and operate a wharf was for \u201cvalue received\u201d of the vendee, and there was no evidence as to what the consideration was, except the testimony of one witness to'the effect that when the deed was delivered by the vendor to the vendee the latter said, \u201c all right, I will give you the loading of one-third of all my ships as long as my firm lasts.\u201d The vendor was a stevedore, and the vendee a consignee of vessels: <em>Held, </em>That the jury were justified in regarding- the promise as the consideration for the deed, and not as a mere gratuitous delaration.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b476-8\">Appeal from the Circuit Court for Escambia county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-9\">The declaration of the plaintiff, Lear, contains two-counts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-10\">The first count alleges that appellants\u2019 testator, D. F. Sullivan, purchased in his lifetime from Lear- a certain franchise and wharf privileges, owned by the latter, and in consideration therefor agreed and promised to give Lear, who, at the time of the sale, and at the commencement of the suit, was a stevedore, the loading of one-third of all vessels consigned to him, Sullivan; but that neither the said Sullivan, nor the defendants, who are the executor and executrix of his last will and testament, have complied with said agreement, nor have th\u00e9y paid for the franchise and privileges, but refuse to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-11\">The second count sets up the purchase of the franchise and wharf privileges, and describes them as being on the extension of Adams street, in the city of Pensacola, and as having been granted to Lear by the City of Pensacola, and alleges that they were reasonably worth $6,000, and have not been paid for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-12\">Damages are laid in each count at five thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>The defendants put in two pleas. The first plea is to the whole declaration, and alleges that the plaintiff, at the time of the transfer and conveyance to Sullivan of the franchise and privileges mentioned, received from Sullivan, the entire consideration therefor. The second plea is confined to the first count, and states that Sullivan did not, as alleged, promise to give to the plaintiff the loading of one-third of the vessels consigned to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\">There was a trial by jury, resulting in a verdict for two thousand dollars, in favor of the plaintiff. The defendants having moved for a new trial on the grounds, 1st, that the verdict was contrary to the charge of the court, and 2d, contrary to the evidence, and the .motion having been overruled, and judgment entered on the verdict, they appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-6\">Upon the trial the plaintiff' introduced as a witness one W. L. Wittich, who testified that he was a timber merchant, doing business at Pensacola, and the owner of a wharf; that he considered the wharf privilege or charter granted to the plaintiff by the City of Pensacola to be worth $5,000, and as valuable as the one that witness himself had obtained from the city, and that he estimated his own as worth from $2,500 to $40,000. Upon cross-examination he testified that his own wharf charter or privilege was obtained from the city for the consideration of his paying $10 rent annually ; that he fixed the value of his wharf charter at $25,000, and plaintiff\u2019s like charter at $5,000 at least, because he, witness,, had, by an expenditure of eight or ten thousand' dollars, made a wharf property which would pay an. interest on $30,000, but he could not, state what was the value of plaintiff\u2019s wharf privilege in itself, and without reference to the improvements of which it was capable. \u2022 \u2018 \u2018</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\"Wittich Menefee, another* witness, testified that he was a timber merchant in Pensacola, and that he considered the wharf charter or privilege granted by the city to the plaintiff as worth $5,000; that he fixed this value upon it because a person who .controlled ballast, by building a wharf under it, could derive a profit which would make the charier or privilege worth $5,000. Upon the cross-examination he said that he could not state \u201c the value of such privilege id itself without reference to the ability of the persons owning it to build a wharf and controlling ballast to make business for itthat there were several such persons, shipping merchants, about one dozen, he thought in Pensacola.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-5\">Defendants\u2019 counsel moved to strike out so much of \"W. L. Wittich\u2019s testimony as stated that he considered the wharf charter or privilege granted to the plaintiff by the city as worth $5,000, because, or upon the ground, that the witness \u201c \"had based his said valuation on the profit of Ms own wharf built under witness\u2019 own privilege, and made profitable by the facilities which he possessed, and because the value of such charter or privilege was fixed by the rental at which it was procured from the city.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-6\">Defendants\u2019 counsel made a similar objection and motion to the testimony of the witness, Menefee, upon the ground that such witness based his valuation of the charter or wharf privilege of the plaintiff upon a value to be bestowed upon it by the capital and business of the party who might \u00a9wn it, and not upon its value as a mere charter or privilege to build a wharf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-7\">Callaghan, a witness for the plaintiff, testified that he knew the place where the plaintiff had obtained a charter \u00a9r privilege from the city of Pensacola to build a wharf ; that he could not state the value of that charter or privilege, but that he had obtained a like charter or privilege to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>build a wharf at the foot of a street east of the street to which plaintiff\u2019s charter applied ; that he had sold it for $1,000, but got really $800, with the reservation of the privilege of the right over the wharf. Upon cross-examination he stated that he had obtained his charter from the city of Pensacola for an annual rent of $10. Defendants\u2019 counsel objected to and moved to strike out so much of testimony of the witness as stated the price at which he had sold his wharf charter or privilege, because it was not admissible testimony of the value of the charter or privilege granted by the city to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-5\">The Circuit Judge denied the above motions to strike out testimony and counsel for defendants excepted to his rulings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-6\">An ordinance of the city of Pensacola, passed January 18, 1882, and approved the next day, authorized Lear, his associates, heirs and assigns to establish and erect a wharf extending into the bay from the termination of Adams street into the channel of the bay. The wharf was to be \u201c commenced\u201d within six months from the passage of the ordinance, and to be of a width not less than twenty feet, nor greater than the width of Adams street, and exclusive wharf privileges on said wharf are given by it to Lear, his associates, heirs and assigns, except that property holders on either side shall not be excluded from said wharf. It also gives Lear, his associates and assigns, full power to demand and receive wharfage from all vessels, barques, flats, lightersand steamboats loading or unloading at or attached to said vvharf, and for all goods deposited on or taken from or over said wharf; no drays, carts, vehicles or pleasure carriages transporting goods or merchandise on or from the wharf are, however, to be charged wharfage on such wharf. Lear, his associates, heirs and assigns are, in consideration of the erection of said wharf to have exclusively the privil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>eges set forth in the ordinance, he or they paying to the city the yearly sum of ten dollars. At the expiration of twenty-five years, the city is to have the privilege of purchasing said wharf at such valuation as may be determined upon by three arbitrators, one to be appointed by the city, one by Lear, his associates, heirs or assigns, and the third to be chosen by the two arbitrators thus appointed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-5\">The deed executed by Lear to D. E. Sullivan bears date January 19, 1882, and \u201c for value received of D. E. Sullivan,\u201d conveys and assigns to the latter, his heirs and assigns, all the right, title and authority granted by said city through or by said ordinance to establish and erecta wharf at the termination of said street, as well as all the other rights, privileges and franchises connected therewith vested and conferred by such ordinance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-6\">The plaintiff had at the outset of the trial testified that he was a stevedore engaged in loading ships in the port of Pensacola, and that there were consigned to E&gt;. E. Sullivan, from 1882 to 1884, annually from 80 to 100 vessels, and that the profit to the stevedores of loading them depended upon their size, but that the lowest rate of net profits for unloading them would be about $200 to the vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-7\">Morton Hart had testified, on the plaintiff\u2019s behalf, that in 1882 he went down to the wharf with John Lear to see D. E. Sullivan, and that they there met Sullivan standing on apile of lumber, and that Lear said to Sullivan : \u201c Here is the deed to that wharf,\u201d and gave it to Sullivan. \u201c He' referred to the wharf at the foot of Adams street, for we had just been talking about his selling that wharf to Mr. Sullivan, and that Sullivan said \u2018 All right, I will give you the loading of one-third of all my ships as long as my firm lasts.\u2019 \u201d Upon cross-examination he said \u201c that he did not see or know the contents of the paper Lear had in his hand; could not say whether it was the deed made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Lear to Sullivan for the property or franchise he had from the city government granting the wharf privilege, but Lear said it was a deed to the wharf. That he had shortly before that got a charter from the city of Pensacola to build a wharf at the foot of Adams street.

Sedg. on Damages, 26 1 Southerland on Damages, 17, 127-8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-6\">The limit of the appellee\u2019s right of recovery was the value of the frauehise as he held it, for that was the extent of his loss at parting with it, 2 Southerland on Dam., 204; and of that value both Wittich and Menefee declare their ignorance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-7\">In the ruling of the Circuit Court the principle of compensation was discarded, and for it was substituted the potential value which might arise from combining with the franchise a large capital and a specific business in the hands of an assignee commanding both such business and capital.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-8\">That ruling was made, too, in the absence of any proof whatever that there had been any such union of capital or business with the franchise in the hands of Sullivan, and hence the jury had before it testimony not of the value of the franchise as held by Lear or by Sullivan, but of a possible value which might have been bestowed'upon it under certain conditions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-9\">III. The testimony of Callaghan, so far as it related to the sale of his own wharf franchise, should have been excluded from the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-10\">The fortuitous sale of his charter, at a price greatly over, its cost, was no test of the value of the plaintiff\u2019s franchise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-11\">This witness, like Wittich and Menefee, could not state the value of the plaintiff\u2019s franchise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-12\">He, however, states, as Wittich had previously done in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>reference to his own, that his franchise was for the consideration of an annual rent to the City of Pensacola of ten dollars, and the plaintiff\u2019s charter shows that his privilege was granted upon a like rent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-5\">Here, then, was a valuation fixed by the official body that granted these franchises:</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-6\">The legal presumption is that such body acted rightly, and exercised a sound judgment in the interest of the public in fixing such valuation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-7\">Having full proof of a valuation fixed by public authority upon such franchises, the Court should have adopted it, and ruled out the proof of the fortunate bargain made by the witness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-8\">IV. The court should have set aside the verdict and granted a new trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-9\">The deed from plaintiff to Sullivan acknowledges that value had been received by the former.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-10\">The court charged the jury that such acknowledgment was conclusive, unless disproved by satisfactory testimony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-11\">There was no such proof submitted to the jury by the appellee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-12\">Hart\u2019s testimony, which was relied upon as having that effect, evidences no such contradiction of the recital of the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-13\">He does not profess to state what was the consideration plaintiff was to receive for the transfer of his franchise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-14\">He merely testifies that he heard Sullivan say to plaintiff, \u201c I will give you the loading of one-third of my ships while my firm lasts.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-15\">\"Whether such declaration was gratuitous on the part of Sullivan, or the consideration for the franchise, the witness does not say, nor does he even testify to any acceptance of Sullivan\u2019s declaration by plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-16\">Again, according to Hart\u2019s testimony, the deed was ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>eeuted before Sullivan\u2019s declaration was made, and hence the declaration cannot be deemed to express the consideration upon which the deed was founded, without some proof touching the transaction antecedent to the meeting of Sullivan, Hart and plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-5\">The charge required the jury to accept the recital of the d eed as establishing payment, and it imposed upon the plaintiff the onus of negativing that payment\".</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-6\">Until so negatived the recital was conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-7\">The fact being established by the deed that value had been received by plaintiff, in the absence of proof as to the actual consideration, it must be presumed that it was one of such a character as could have been received at the time of executing the deed ; for a fact being established no <em>presumption </em>inconsistent with it is allowable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-8\">Hart\u2019s testimony can be accepted as nothing but proof of a gratuitous declaration of Sullivan unless we <em>presume </em>that it declared' the consideration for the transfer of the franchise; but as the receipt of that consideration at the date of the deed was impossible, it must be discarded as a <em>presumption </em>inconsistent with the recital; otherwise a presumption would be substituted for the fact plaintiff was required by the issue to prove\u2014that the consideration was not received.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-9\">\u201c A presumption of' fact is a logical argument from a fact to a fact, or an argument which infers a fact otherwise doubtful from a fact which is proved.\u201d 2 Whart. Ev., see. 1225.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-10\">Value received by plaintiff is a fact established by the deed ; and upon that fact may logically be based the presumption that the nature of the consideration was such as made it capable of being received at the date of the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-11\">It follows, therefore, that as the loading of ships during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the existence of a firm could not be completed at the date of the deed, such could not have been the consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azq\">The argument for appellee is that the loading of ships was the consideration, and as such loading could not have been completed at the execution of the deed, therefore the consideration could not have been received as acknowledged. Here we have a presumption based on a presumption, and neither resting upon an established fact. That the loadiug of the ships was the consideration was a fact to be proved, and, being proved, there would have been \u201c a logical argument from a fact to a fact,\u201d that the acknowledgment of value received had no foundation in fact; but there being no proof as to what was the actual consideration, there is nothing upon which to rest the presumption that value was not received by appellee at the date of the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-6\">This is not a case involving a mere conflict of testimony, as Mayo vs. Hynote, 16 Fla., 673, and Wharton vs. Hammond, 20 Fla., 673, nor one where the only question is as to the preponderance o\u00ed evidence, as in Iiuling vs. Florida Savings Bank, 19 Fla., 695, but one in which on the precise issue of value received by the plaintiff <em>vel non </em>there is clear and pointed affirmative testimony standing ui *'tradicted and unexplained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-7\"><em>W.

The proof of value is generally by the judgment or opinion of witnesses. Sutherland on Damages, vol. 2, p. 375. If the article has no market value its value may be shown by proof of such elements or facts affecting the question as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>may exist. Recourse may be had to the items of cost and its utility and use. The opinions of witnesses properly informed on the subject maj' be given in respect to its value. Ib. 378. Lafayette B. and M. R. R. Co. vs. Winslow, 66 Ill., 219 ; Wemple, <em>et al., </em>vs. Stewart, <em>et al., </em>22 Barbour, 154 ; Kirschman vs. Lediard &amp; Ree, 61 Barbour, 573. A franchise can not be said to have a market value, and when its value is necessary to be proven a resort must be had to the nearest relative facts and circumstances from which such value may be fairly inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The franchise or bare right to do a thing considered with reference to itself alone is of no value. It is only when it is considered relatively and in connection with its <em>use </em>that it can be said to be valuable. The wharf without the right to use it would be of no appreciable value. It is the combination of the two\u2014the wharf and the franchise\u2014 that mutually impart to each other, when combined, an estimable value.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">It is clear that Wittich\u2019s opinion of the value of the franchise sold by the plaintiff to Sullivan is based in some degree upon the success of his own wharf business. He has so managed this business as to derive a revenue from it equal to the amount which $30,000, put at interest at the ordinary rate, would produce, and because he has done so he thinks that the franchise sold by plaintiff to be worth $5,000. The value of anything'js to be guaged with reference to the practical uses to which it can be put, or the profit which by proper management can be made out of it. That the witness could not state what was the value of the charter in itself and without reference to the improvements of which it was capable does not affect the admissibility of his testimony, because no franchise is of any value when considered without reference to its utility, and where it is of such a character as to render both an expenditure of money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>and the application of business judgment and skill in its mangement necessary to make it useful and profitable, its-value must be determined by a consideration of it in connection with such possibilities. As a purchaser, we must' regard Sullivan as a person who would have the means of making the franchise useful, or as desiring to hold it with the expectation of selling to some one who did have suck means or to one who had similar expectations, or we must consider him as one whose interest it was (either to avoid competition or for other purpose) to hold the franchise unimproved ; and in either event the same principles obtain in fixing the value. Whatever effect the poverty or other disabling circumstance of an owner of a franchise or other property may have upon him in fixing the price at which he may have sold, it has no effect upon the principles by which the value of anything sold, without fixing the price,is to be ascertained. Its value, whatever it may be, is to-be ascertained in the same manner and upon the same principles, whatever may be the condition, circumstances or purposes of the buyer. Wittich\u2019s testimony shows him to be a person having such acquaintance with the character of the property in question as to entitle him to give an opinion. It was proper for the defendant to develop on cross-examination the foundation of the opinion, but we see nothing in the development so made which calls for the exclusion of his. testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The testimony of Menefee was likewise admissible. His opinion is based upon the utility of the franchise and his business is such as to make his opinion competent testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Callaghan\u2019s testimony was admissible. The price for which one thing actually sells is certainly some evidence of the value of another thing of the same kind. It is a practical test of what persons dealing estimate things <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>\u2022of the kind as worth, and when a thing has no market value we think it may be proved upon very much the same principle that the price for which an article, having a market value, has been previously sold, may be proved. 2 Sutherland, 375, 376, 378. It is a fact bearing upon the question, and like the price for which the city granted the franchise, is a legitimate aid to the jury in arriving at a correct estimate of the thing\u2019s value. Ueither sale is conclusive upon the jury, who are to form their opinion from all the testimony affecting the question of value; yet we may say that it seems not at all unreasonable that a city government desiring the improvement of its wharves and the consequent development of the public interest would naturally \u2022exact but' a nominal consideration from persons proposing such improvement, whereas the grantee of such privilege would in selling expect full compensation for it as the basis \u2022of a profitable business.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In a case where the subject matter of the sale has no market value, the question of value is peculiarly one for a jury, and whatever fact seems naturally calculated to aid them in reaching a correct conclusion should be submitted for their consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The Circuit Judge charged the jury in effect that if they were satisfied from the evidence that Sullivan received from the plaintiff a transfer of .the charter for or in consideration that the former should give to the latter the loading of one-third of the vessels to be consigned to him, Sullivan, then they must find for the plaintiff and assess his damages at .such a sum as the evidence may show would have been the profit, if any, which would have accrued to the plaintiff by the loading of the vessels consigned to Sullivan in his life \u25a0time. That if they were not satisfied that such a consideration for the transfer was agreed upon, but were satisfied from the evidence that Sullivan purchased from the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>tiff the charter and never paid for the same, they should ' find for the plaintiff and assess his damages at the price, if any, proved by the testimony to have been agreed upon as to be paid for the same, or if there was no price agreed upon they should assess the damages at whatever sum the testimony shows to have been its value at the time of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The judge also charged that where a party conveys property to another, and in the deed of conveyance acknowledges that he makes the conveyance for value received, such acknowledgment is evidence that he has received the value of said property and must be taken as conclusive that he did receive such value, unless it is proved that such value was not actually received; and, therefore, if, in the case at har, the jury was satisfied from the evidence that the plaintiff executed a deed of conveyance of the wharf charter,, and acknowledged in such deed that he had received the value of such charter, and were further satisfied that there was no evidence to prove, notwithstanding such acknowledgment in the deed, that such value was not received, they must find for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">There was no exception to the judge\u2019s charge. Hart\u2019s testimony sustains the inference of the jury that the consideration was at least not an executed consideration. Sullivan\u2019s promise, made under the circumstances related, is inconsistent with the theory that there was nothing more to be done by him in connection with the transaction represented by the deed, or the idea that the deed acknowledges solely an executed consideration. Where a deed acknowledges the receipt of a consideration without specifying what it. is, parol evidence is, we think, admissible to prove its character, upon the principle that the deed is incomplete or does not show the entire transaction. Green-leaf\u2019s Ev.,'sec. 284 <em>a. ' </em>Evidence may be given of a consideration not mentioned in a deed, even where one is-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>\u2022mentioned, if the former be not inconsistent with the latter. Ibid, sec. 285. The only consideration of which we have any testimony of the character of, is the promise of Sullivan. It was made when the deed was delivered, the time when considerations, whether executed or ex-ecutory, are delivered, and there is nothing in the deed from Lear to Sullivan inconsistent with the proof of such \u25a0consideration. Such a promise, made under such circumstances, is to be taken as a consideration for the deed rather than as a gratuitous declaration. No prudent business man would have made it as a mere gratuity under the circumstances, particularly in view of its value, if performed. The evidence sustains the verdict and the motion for a new trial was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
