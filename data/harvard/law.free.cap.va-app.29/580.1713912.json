Rogers contends the trial judge had \u2022 no authority to order him to participate in the program because the trial judge already had revoked part of the suspended sentence. He also contends the trial judge violated Code \u00a7 19.2-303 and Rule 1:1 by improperly modifying a sentence that had become final. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">In 1995, Rogers pled guilty to a felony charge of concealing merchandise in a store with the intent to convert the merchandise to his use without paying the purchase price. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-103 and 18.2-104. A judge of the circuit court sentenced Rogers to two years in prison and suspended all but six months of the sentence on the condition that Rogers be of good behavior for five years following his release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">The proceeding that gives rise to this appeal commenced on December 10,1997, when Rogers appeared in the circuit court to show cause \u201cwhy the sentence previously imposed and suspended should not be revoked, in whole or in part,\u201d because of an allegation that Rogers had violated conditions of his 1995 suspended sentence and probation. During that hearing, Rogers\u2019 probation officer testified concerning acts committed by Rogers that violated conditions of his suspended sentence and probation. The probation officer also testified that she had caused the police to arrest Rogers and that she had placed Rogers into an in-patient program at the Piedmont House for treatment for alcoholism. While on a furlough from Piedmont House, Rogers was arrested for committing an offense in Prince William County and was terminated from the treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>At the conclusion of the testimony, Rogers\u2019 attorney requested the trial judge to \u201corder [Rogers] back into the [Piedmont House] program\u201d and offered in evidence a letter stating that Piedmont House was willing to have Rogers return to the program. Rogers\u2019 attorney also noted that Rogers was required to attend a hearing the following week in Prince William County. Stating'her unfamiliarity with the Piedmont House program, the Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney requested the trial judge to consider the Diversion Center Incarceration Program established by Code \u00a7 19.2-316.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The trial judge \u201c[found] that [Rogers] has violated the terms and conditions of the previously imposed sentence\u201d and then recalled the probation officer to testify concerning the Piedmont House program. During her testimony, the probation officer said she had no dealings with Piedmont House prior to Rogers\u2019 placement. She also noted that Rogers had not been evaluated to determine his eligibility for the Diversion Center Incarceration Program. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-316.3. Following the probation officer\u2019s testimony, the trial judge entered an order containing the following pertinent rulings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">It appearing to the Court that on December 13, 1995, in the Circuit Court of the City of Fredericksburg, Ronnie Lee Rogers was convicted of felony shoplifting. He was sentenced to serve two (2) years in the state penitentiary, and one (1) year and six (6) months of said sentence was suspended on condition that he remain of good behavior for a period of five (5) years, supervised probation and payment of court costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">After hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, the Court finds that [Rogers] is in violation of the terms and conditions of his suspended sentence, and it is ORDERED that he is sentenced to confinement in jail through January 5,1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">It is ORDERED that this case is continued to January 5, 1998 at 9:00 a.m., for final disposition, and it is ORDERED that [Rogers] remain incarcerated until that time. It appearing to the Court that [Rogers] has a charge in the \u201c <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Prince William Circuit Court, and if he is convicted and sentenced to serve an active period of time, the Attorney for [Rogers] is instructed to advise the Court. If no incarceration is imposed by Prince William Circuit Court or if he is released by Prince William, he shall be returned to the Rappahannock Regional Jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">The Department of Probation and Parole shall evaluate [Rogers] for his eligibility for participation in the Men\u2019s Diversion Center Incarceration Program and file their report with the Court and with counsel. In the alternative, [Rogers\u2019] counsel shall inquire of the Piedmont Program to determine [Rogers\u2019] eligibility for said program, and shall advise the Court by January 5,1998.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">On January 5, 1998, the trial judge again heard testimony from the probation officer, who testified that Rogers was eligible for both programs. Noting Rogers\u2019 history of arrests for alcohol-related offenses and the program costs, the probation officer recommended placing Rogers in the Diversion Center Incarceration Program. Rogers\u2019 attorney argued that the Piedmont House program was the appropriate placement and further argued that because at the previous hearing, the trial judge revoked several weeks of the suspended sentence, the trial judge did \u201cnot [now have] an option to send [Rogers] to [the Diversion Center Incarceration] program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The trial judge again ruled that Rogers \u201cis in violation of , the terms and conditions of the previously\u201d suspended sentence and probation. Invoking Code \u00a7 19.2-816.3, the trial judge revoked the \u201cbalance of the entire sentence and resuspended\u201d it on condition that Rogers successfully complete the Diversion Center Incarceration Program. Rogers\u2019 attorney objected and stated that the trial judge\u2019s December 10, 1997 ruling, which incarcerated Rogers until January 5,1998, was a sentence that Rogers had served. The trial judge overruled the objection and explained that Rogers\u2019 incarceration had been \u201ctransition time\u201d for which the trial judge gave Rogers \u201ccredit for the time served while ... waiting to enter\u201d the Diversion Center Incarceration Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 19.2-316.3 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">1. Following ... a finding that the defendant\u2019s probation should be revoked, upon motion of the defendant, <em>the court may order such defendant committed to the Department of Corrections for a period not to exceed forty-five days from the date of commitment for evaluation and diagnosis by the Department to determine suitability for participation in the Diversion Center Incarceration </em>Program----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">2. Upon determination that (i) such commitment is in the best interest of the Commonwealth and the defendant and (ii) facilities are available for the confinement of the defendant, the Department shall recommend to the court in writing that the defendant be committed to the Diversion Center Incarceration Program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">3. Upon receipt of such recommendation and a determination by the court that the defendant will benefit from the program and is capable of returning to society as a productive citizen following successful completion of the program, and if the defendant would otherwise be committed to the Department, <em>the court (i) shall impose sentence, suspend the sentence, and place the defendant on probation pursuant to this section or (ii) following a finding that the defendant has violated the terms and conditions of his probation previously ordered, shall place the defendant on probation pursuant to this section. Such probation shall be conditioned upon the defendant\u2019s entry into and successful completion of the Diversion Center Incarceration Program.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Rogers contends the trial judge had no authority to sentence him pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-316.3 because the trial judge had earlier revoked a part of Rogers\u2019 suspended sentence and sentenced him to a period of incarceration for violating his suspended sentence and probation. The Commonwealth argues that Rogers failed to object at the earlier hearing and thereby sent the unmistakable message that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>trial judge\u2019s proposal was a permissible resolution of the matter. We agree in part with both positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">At the December 1997 hearing, the trial judge ruled \u201cthat [Rogers] has violated the terms and conditions of the previously imposed probation, ... [and] sentencefd] him to serve ... a period of incarceration through January 5, 1998.\u201d Although the trial judge expressly stated that \u201c[t]his is a conditional order,\u201d he also noted that, \u201c[b]y being incarcerated for a period approaching two months, [Rogers] would also have been, in essence, punished for his violation of the terms and conditions of the previously imposed sentence.\u201d It is likely that Rogers did not object at that time because the trial judge made the following oral ruling which left open the possibility of a referral to the Piedmont House program that Rogers sought:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">The Office of Probation and Parole shall evaluate [Rogers] to determine his eligibility for the Men\u2019s Diversion Center Incarceration Program between now and January 5 returning a report to the Court and to all parties in ample time for a hearing on that date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">In the alternative, Counsel for [Rogers], if he is found to be ineligible for the Men\u2019s Diversion Center Incarceration Program, shall inquire of the Piedmont program as to his ability to return and be readmitted into that program effective January 5, 1998, and shall report that fact to the Court at the hearing on January 5th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">That way the Court will be advised as to whether or not both options are still available and will then choose on that date what the Court feels to be an appropriate program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJs\">In any event, Code \u00a7 19.2-316.3 permits the trial judge to cause a defendant such as Rogers to be temporarily incarcerated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">[Fallowing a finding that the defendant\u2019s probation should be revoked, upon motion of the defendant, the court may order such defendant committed to the Department of Corrections for a period not to exceed forty-five days from the date of commitment for evaluation and diagnosis by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Department to determine suitability for participation in the Diversion Center Incarceration Program. The evaluation and diagnosis may be conducted by the Department at any state or local correctional facility, probation and parole office, or other location deemed appropriate by the Department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-316.3(1). Although the trial judge indicated that the temporary detention of Rogers \u201cwould also ... [be], in essence, punish[ment] for his violation of the terms and conditions of the previously [suspended] sentence,\u201d we believe that statement was made within the context of the trial judge\u2019s decision to detain Rogers while the attorneys explored the two program options. Certainly, the act of incarcerating Rogers was permitted by Code \u00a7 19.2-316.3 and the incarceration, if done pursuant to that statute, could have exceeded the period of time Rogers was in fact incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The trial judge stated the order was \u201cconditional\u201d and apparently intended to preserve for Rogers the option of a referral to the Piedmont House program or to the Diversion Center Incarceration Program. Any error the trial judge may have made in stating that the temporary detention would be punishment was harmless. The incarceration exposed Rogers to no greater detriment than he would have experienced had the trial judge followed the precise strictures of Code \u00a7 19.2-316.3 and stated he was incarcerating Rogers for the sole purpose of evaluation and diagnosis. Thus, despite the trial judge\u2019s December 10, 1997 statement that he was incarcerating Rogers as punishment for violating conditions of the suspended sentence, a review of the entire record shows that the trial judge substantially followed Code \u00a7 19.2-316.3. Indeed, as credit to Rogers for the time he was incarcerated pending the suitability evaluation and diagnosis, the trial judge reduced Rogers\u2019 remaining suspended sentence even though Code \u00a7 19.2-316.3 did not require such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">At oral argument before this Court, Rogers\u2019 attorney contended that referral to the Diversion Center Incarceration Program may only occur \u201cupon motion of the defendant.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Code \u00a7 19.2-316.3. She argued that Rogers did not make any such motion. This objection was not made at trial. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18. More significant, however, we believe the record clearly establishes that when Rogers was before the trial judge and in jeopardy of having his sentence revoked for probation violations, Rogers was seeking referral to a treatment program. Although Piedmont House was clearly his preference, Rogers was aware at the December hearing that the trial judge was seeking information regarding referrals for each program. Thus, although the motion from Rogers was not specific as to the Diversion Center Incarceration Program, we conclude that the trial judge\u2019s consideration of both programs upon Rogers\u2019 motion for referral to Piedmont House was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Rogers also contends the trial judge \u201cerred in modifying a sentence imposed at the December 10, 1997 hearing on January 5, 1998 in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-303 and Rule 1:1.\u201d Thus, Rogers argues he should be released because he has served the sentence the trial judge ordered. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-303 pertains to initial sentencing decisions following conviction, not to probation revocation procedures. Code \u00a7 19.2-303 has no applicability to the facts and procedural posture of this case. Furthermore, as we earlier noted, the trial judge was authorized to incarcerate Rogers \u201cfor a period not to exceed forty-five days\u201d pending an evaluation as to suitability for placement in the Diversion Center Incarceration Program. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-316.3. The incarceration did not exceed that limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Rogers correctly notes that Rule 1:1 prohibits \u201c[a]ll final judgments, orders, and decrees\u201d from being modified after twenty-one days. However, the December 10, 1997 order was not a final order under Rule 1:1. The trial judge ruled that he was \u201cconditionally]\u201d ordering Rogers incarcerated until the trial judge had sufficient information to make a determination concerning the alternative programs and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>issue a final order. Code \u00a7 19.2-316.3 permitted that incarceration as an interim measure. Thus, we conclude that the trial judge\u2019s December 10, 1997 order was such an interim decision. At the January 5, 1998 hearing, the trial judge received the evaluation pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-316.3 and entered a sentencing order. That order was the final order, which the trial judge had authority to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
