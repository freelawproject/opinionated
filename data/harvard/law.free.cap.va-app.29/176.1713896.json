Carlton (claimant) for an injury to his foot. On appeal, employer complains that the commission erroneously determined that the accident arose from employment and that the claim was not barred by willful misconduct. We disagree and affirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Upon review, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below, claimant in this instance. <em>See Crisp v. Brown\u2019s Tysons Corner Dodge, Inc., </em>1 Va.App. 503, 504, 339 S.E.2d 916, 916 (1986). Factual findings by the commission that are supported by credible evidence are conclusive and binding upon this Court. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A); <em>Rose v. Red\u2019s Hitch &amp; Trailer Servs., Inc., </em>11 Va.App. 55, 60, 396 S.E.2d 392, 395 (1990). \u201cIn determining whether credible evidence exists, [this Court will] not retry the facts, reweigh the preponderance of the evidence, or make its own determination of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Wagner Enters., Inc. v. Brooks, </em>12 Va.App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991) (citation omitted). \u201cThe fact that there is contrary evidence in the record is of no consequence if there is credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The record discloses that claimant, while operating a tractor trailer for employer and undertaking a right turn, had driven \u201cpartially into the left lane\u201d of the highway, a movement necessary to make a \u201cwide\u201d turn, \u201cin a tight corner.\u201d During the maneuver, claimant observed a motorcycle approaching \u201ca good piece [from] behind\u201d and to the right, which \u201cjust kept speeding up,\u201d and stopped the truck to allow the motorcycle to pass. Once beyond the truck, the driver, William Pettit, \u201cstopped in front ..., got off his motorcycle, [and] came around to [claimant\u2019s] door,\u201d \u201chollering ... \u2018Didn\u2019t you see me?\u2019 \u201d Pettit \u201cpull[ed] up on the truck trying to get in the door[,] ... reached in and grabbed [claimant\u2019s] arm ... [and] started pulling [him].\u201d When claimant \u201cfell out of the truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>on to the ground[,] ... [Pettit] was trying to kick [him] and [they] started tussling.\u201d As claimant attempted \u201cto get up [he] felt the truck roll over [his] foot,\u201d resulting in the subject injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">In awarding the disputed benefits to claimant, the commission found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">the need to occupy part of two lanes to negotiate a turn in a tractor trailer and the difficulty in seeing a small object such as a motorcycle on the right side are all risks peculiar to the claimant\u2019s employment as a truck driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">We also agree that the altercation was business related. It is clear Mr. Pettit was angry because he was almost run over by a truck of which the claimant was the driver. There is no evidence that Pettit and the claimant knew each other or that the incident arose from anything other than a potential collision between a motorcycle and the tractor trailer that the claimant was driving for his employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The commission also concluded \u201cthat the claimant was not the aggressor and therefore not precluded from receiving compensation benefits____ Mr. Pettit precipitated the events that culminated in the actual injury by stopping and approaching the claimant in a very angry manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">\u201cTo qualify for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, an employee\u2019s injuries must result from an event \u2018rising out of and \u2018in the course of the employment.\u201d <em>Pinkerton\u2019s, Inc. v. Helmes, </em>242 Va. 378, 380, 410 S.E.2d 646, 647 (1991); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-101. Employer does not dispute that claimant suffered an injury by accident occurring \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment, but asserts that claimant failed to prove that such injury \u201carose out of\u2019 employment. It is well established that \u201c[w]hether an accident arises out of employment is a mixed question of law and fact and is ... reviewable upon appeal.\u201d <em>Mullins v. Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>10 Va.App. 304, 307, 391 S.E.2d 609, 611 (1990) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>In determining if an accident arises out of the employment, Virginia applies the \u201cactual risk\u201d test, which \u201crequires that the employment subject the employee to the particular danger that brought about his or her injury.\u201d <em>Lipsey v. Case, </em>248 Va. 59, 61, 445 S.E.2d 105, 106 (1994) (citations omitted); see, <em>e.g., Hill City Trucking, Inc. v. Christian, </em>238 Va. 735, 739, 385 S.E.2d 377, 379 (1989); <em>Park Oil Co., Inc. v. Parham, </em>1 Va.App. 166, 169, 336 S.E.2d 531, 533 (1985). \u201cConsequently, an accident arises out of the employment when it is apparent to a rational mind, under all attending circumstances, that a causal connection exists between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.\u201d <em>Lipsey, </em>248 Va. at 61, 445 S.E.2d at 107 (citations omitted); <em>see, e.g., R &amp; T Investments, Ltd. v. Johns, </em>228 Va. 249, 252, 321 S.E.2d 287, 289 (1984); <em>Marketing Profiles, Inc. v. Hill, </em>17 Va.App. 431, 434, 437 S.E.2d 727, 729 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Accordingly, to be entitled to an award arising from an assault, a claimant must establish \u201cthat the assault was directed against him as an employee, or because of his employment.\u201d <em>Continental Life Ins. Co. v. Gough, </em>161 Va. 755, 760, 172 S.E. 264, 266 (1934) (citations omitted); <em>see Reamer v. Nat'l Serv. Indus., </em>237 Va. 466, 470, 377 S.E.2d 627, 629 (1989); <em>Park Oil Co., </em>1 Va.App. at 170, 336 S.E.2d at 533-34. \u201c \u2018[A] showing that the probability of assault was augmented ... because of the peculiar character of the claimant\u2019s job\u2019 \u201d supplies the requisite causal connection. <em>R &amp; T Investments, Ltd., </em>228 Va. at 253, 321 S.E.2d at 289 (citation omitted); <em>Roberson v. Whetsell, </em>21 Va.App. 268, 271, 463 S.E.2d 681, 683 (1995) (citation omitted); <em>see Reamer, </em>237 Va. at 470, 377 S.E.2d at 629 (\u201cA physical assault may constitute an \u2018accident\u2019 ... when it appears that it was a result of an actual risk arising out of employment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Here, Pettit\u2019s furious attack on claimant was triggered by claimant\u2019s \u201cneed to occupy part of two lanes to negotiate a turn in a tractor trailer and the difficulty in seeing a small object such as a motorcycle on the right side,\u201d impersonal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>circumstances directly attributable to the duties of his employment and clearly satisfying the \u201carising out of\u2019 prong of compensability. Employer\u2019s reliance on <em>Hill City </em>and <em>Metcalf v. AM. Exp. Moving Systems, Inc., </em>230 Va. 464, 339 S.E.2d 177 (1986), is misplaced. In contrast to the instant circumstances, claimants in both <em>Hill City </em>and <em>Metcalf </em>failed to establish the requisite nexus between the risks of employment and the assaults there in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Employer next contends that claimant is barred from recovery because his seat belt was unfastened at the time of the injury in violation of employer\u2019s safety rules. Code \u00a7 65.2-306 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">A. No compensation shall be awarded ... for an injury ... caused by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">Hi sj\u00ab H* H* H* H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">(5) The employee\u2019s willful breach of any reasonable rule or regulation adopted by the employer and brought, prior to the accident, to the knowledge of the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">He Hi H&lt; H\u00ab H* He</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">B. The person or entity asserting any of the defenses in this section shall have the burden of proof with respect thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">\u201cAs specified in Code \u00a7 65.2-306(B), employer ha[s] the burden to prove that claimant\u2019s conduct, <em>which caused his injury, </em>was in \u2018willful\u2019 disregard of a reasonable rule established by employer....\u201d <em>Brockway v. Easter, </em>20 Va.App. 268, 271, 456 S.E.2d 159, 161 (1995) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">Whether the rule is reasonable and applies to the situation from which the injury results, and whether the claimant knowingly violated it, is a mixed question of law and fact to be decided by the commission and reviewable by this Court. But the questions of whether an employee is guilty of willful misconduct and whether such misconduct is a proximate cause of the employee\u2019s accident are issues of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>Brockway, </em>20 Va.App. at 271-72, 456 S.E.2d at 161 (citation omitted). Upon review of the record, the commission found that claimant willfully violated employer\u2019s safety rule, but, nevertheless, allowed recovery because employer failed to prove that the violation caused claimant\u2019s injury. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">As the commission noted, \u201cseat belts are designed to lessen or avoid injuries that occur during the operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d Claimant\u2019s injuries arose from a deliberate attack on his person which occurred \u201cafter [he] was out of the truck\u2019s cab,\u201d circumstances totally unrelated to those safety considerations which underpinned employer\u2019s seat belt rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Accordingly, the commission correctly found that claimant\u2019s injury arose from his employment and the attendant award was not barred by willful misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
