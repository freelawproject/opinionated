He contends that the summons he signed was not a public record because it was not issued by a \u201cpublic officer or public employee.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-168. We hold that a \u201cpublic officer\u201d did issue the summons, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">On November 9, 1996, Sergeant Anthony Primus was employed as a security guard assigned to the Huntersville Apartments, a privately owned apartment complex in Norfolk, Virginia. Primus was licensed by the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services to work as a security guard. On this evening, Primus saw defendant trespassing on the grounds of the apartments. When Primus stopped defendant, defendant identified himself as Clyde Washington. Primus issued a summons to defendant which defendant also signed \u201cClyde Washington.\u201d Defendant was later arrested for forging a public document, to wit: the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">At trial, defendant moved to strike the evidence on the ground that Sergeant Primus was not a \u201cpublic officer or public employee.\u201d The trial court ruled that Primus was a \u201cregistered armed security guard\u201d and such guards are public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>officers or employees for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-168, the forgery statute. Defendant was convicted of forgery, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The question before us is whether a security guard registered pursuant to Code \u00a7 9-183.3 is a \u201cpublic officer or public employee\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-168. If so, then we must affirm defendant\u2019s conviction. If Sergeant Primus was not such an officer or employee, we must reverse. The answer to the question requires an examination of the statutory scheme that registers and empowers security guards in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">No person may \u201cbe employed by a licensed private security services business in the Commonwealth as ... [an] armed security officer ... without possessing a valid registration issued by the Department [of Criminal Justice Services].\u201d Code \u00a7 9-183.3. Sergeant Primus testified that he was registered and possessed a license to be a security guard. Security officers must undergo compulsory training and pass a background investigation. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-182, -183.3. They are also subject to investigation and discipline by the Criminal Justice Services Board. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 9-182.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Security officers have several powers normally reserved for police officers. They are exempt from civil liability in connection with the detention of a person suspected of larceny. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-105, -105.1. When a crime is committed in an officer\u2019s presence or probable cause exists to suspect someone of shoplifting, the officer may \u201ceffect an arrest\u201d and is \u201cconsidered an arresting officer.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-183.8. As an arresting officer, a security officer may \u201ctake the name and address of such person and issue a summons or otherwise notify him in writing to appear at a time and place to be specified in such summons or notice.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Through substantial regulation, the General Assembly has clothed registered security officers with many of the powers reserved for public employees or officers. Indeed, in some instances, a security officer is treated exactly like a police officer. We hold that where, as here, a registered security officer is engaged in a duty specifically granted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>statute, that officer is a \u201cpublic officer or public employee\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-168. When defendant forged the summons issued by Sergeant Primus, it was as if defendant had forged a summons issued to him by a police officer, and the same criminal culpability resulted. <em>See Pope v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 130, 449 S.E.2d 269 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">We are careful to limit our holding to the four corners of the case before us. We do not hold that a private security officer is a public officer or public employee for all purposes or even most purposes. The general rule is that he is not. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Francoeur, </em>547 F.2d 891, 893 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 932, 97 S.Ct. 2640, 53 L.Ed.2d 249 (1977) (holding that amusement park security guards are not state actors for Fourth Amendment search and seizure purposes); <em>Mier v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 827, 833, 407 S.E.2d 342, 346 (1991) (holding that security agents are not state actors for Fifth Amendment custodial interrogation purposes). We merely hold that, considering the legislative intent evidenced by the code sections at issue, Sergeant Primus was a \u201cpublic officer\u201d in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
