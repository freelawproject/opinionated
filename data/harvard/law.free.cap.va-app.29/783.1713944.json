On appeal, he contends the trial court erroneously (1) denied his motion for a mistrial when one of the jurors initially was unable to confirm that she supported the guilty verdicts and (2) held the evidence was sufficient to support the assault and battery conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we hold that the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s mistrial motion, we reverse appellant\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Appellant was arrested for assault and battery on a law enforcement officer, and a search incident to that arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>yielded cocaine. Appellant was tried by a jury for both offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">After the jury began its deliberations, the court brought the jury back into the courtroom to tell them that \u201cthe hour is getting late. I don\u2019t know what your problem is and I don\u2019t want to know how much longer you\u2019re going to be. I will just bring you back in the morning.\u201d One juror indicated that they were having difficulty reaching a unanimous decision and voiced a concern about returning the following morning because he was scheduled to have surgery. The judge told the jury they could deliberate until 5:15 p.m. and that he was not \u201cputting [them] on any time limit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">When a juror said they were having \u201cdifferences of opinion on assault and battery,\u201d the trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-6\">There is no difference of opinion on assault. Y\u2019all are not supposed to have a difference of opinion. The law is the law. And, I described to you what it is. You listen to the evidence and find the facts. It\u2019s simple. You either believed the witnesses or you didn\u2019t. You have to believe beyond a reasonable doubt. And, I don\u2019t know what would be the problem unless somebody just wants to be arbitrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agi\">The trial court then re-read the assault and battery instruction to the jury and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-7\">I don\u2019t see how it can be any clearer than that.... I don\u2019t want anybody to give up any conscientious views that you have, but I think you should listen to your fellow jurors ... to see if you can come to a verdict. Some jury is going to come to a verdict in this case. Why do you want to shift your burden? All right. I will let you return [in] a little while.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">Before the jury came back a second time, the court indicated that it would \u201cgrant a mistrial on the assault if they are hung.\u201d Defense counsel stated, \u201cJudge ... I will withdraw it,\u201d implying that he previously had made a mistrial motion, but no prior motion appears in the record. The trial court then questioned the jury about whether they believed they could reach a unanimous verdict. Several jurors indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>that they did not think they could, one indicated that it was possible, and one indicated that he or she did not think appellant was guilty. The trial court then returned them to the jury room and spoke with the juror scheduled for surgery. After confirming that the juror would be able to return to deliberate the day following his surgery, the trial court returned him to the jury room.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Although the court had not instructed the jury to deliberate further after learning that several jurors believed they could not reach a unanimous verdict and that one juror did not think appellant was guilty, when the court brought the jury back a third time, shortly after conferring with the juror scheduled for surgery, the jury had reached a verdict of guilty on both offenses. When the court polled the jury on defendant\u2019s motion to confirm that the guilty verdicts were the verdicts of each juror, each of the first ten jurors responded, \u201cYes,\u201d when the clerk called each of their names. On the eleventh name, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">THE CLERK: Mozelle Barner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-7\">THE COURT: Where is she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-8\">THE SHERIFF: Is that you, ma\u2019am?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-9\">MS. BARNER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-10\">THE SHERIFF: Ma\u2019am\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-11\">MS. BARNER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-12\">THE SHERIFF: Can you speak up, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-13\">MS. BARNER: <em>I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t say it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, I ask the record to reflect the juror responded that she\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-15\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know what she said. You have to\u2014 yes or no, ma\u2019am, that\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-16\">MS. BARNER: (Shakes head yes).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-17\">THE COURT: Yes, or no. That\u2019s all. You have to speak. What is it, yes or no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-18\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, respectfully\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-19\">THE COURT: Just a moment, please. I will do this, [Defense Counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I just have a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-5\">THE COURT: There is one more juror.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-6\">sfc sj: }\u00a3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-7\">THE CLERK: Porter Davis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-8\">sjc sfc <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-9\">THE COURT: All right. Are they your verdicts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-10\">MR. DAVIS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-11\">THE COURT: All right. Thank you, sir. All right, ma\u2019am, you have to answer yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-12\">MS. BARNER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, I am sorry to interrupt. I would ask the Court to declare a mistrial at this point, Judge. I don\u2019t want to put this lady on the spot anymore than she already is. I think it\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable dealing with the guilty plea. I would ask the Court to declare a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-14\">THE COURT: She answers yes or no, either way, that\u2019s her prerogative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: Judge, I thought I heard her say yes. THE COURT: I asked her to answer yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-16\">MS. BARNER: I said yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-17\">THE CLERK: She said yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-18\">THE COURT: Is that what she said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-19\">THE CLERK: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-20\">THE COURT: She said yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-21\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-22\">While the jury was deliberating on the sentence, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-23\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, I would like the record to reflect that the next to the last juror polled took a good amount of time before she said yes to the verdict. She was crying. She was obviously upset. And, I would suggest to the Court that her crying and the amount of time she took indicated that she had some serious, serious reservations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>about whether or not she could do what the rest of the jury did. I ask the Court to note that for the record, please. THE COURT: Very well. She was obviously upset to the Court but the Court did not upset her. The Court just asked her to answer yes or no, which she has done. And, there was no coercion one way or the other for her to answer. And, she answered yes. That\u2019s all that is necessary. ... I don\u2019t know what this lady\u2019s problem was. I am not going to inquire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I didn\u2019t want to indicate that the Court forced her. I just wanted to renew my motion for a mistrial based on \u2014 after she was visibly upset and crying and it took her a long time to finally answer, almost under a whisper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-6\">THE COURT: No question about that. I think she said yes long before but I wasn\u2019t sure. So, that\u2019s the reason I gave her another opportunity. From the jury box to here sometimes it sounds rather soft. But, I think she said yes before. She also \u2014 the record should show she shook her head yes a long time before. She said she just couldn\u2019t say it.... That was new. But, she did that of her own volition and I will let it stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Appellant contends the trial court erroneously denied his mistrial motion, which was based on an alleged lack of unanimity in the jury verdict. He contends that Juror Barner\u2019s initial response to the court\u2019s polling of the jury indicated that the guilty verdicts were not hers, thereby invalidating the verdicts. He also contends the trial court should have declared a mistrial earlier in the proceedings, when a majority of the jurors indicated their belief that they would not be able to reach a unanimous verdict but then reached a verdict shortly after learning they would be required to- return to finish deliberating at a later time. Finally, he contends the jury was prejudiced by comments from the trial court criticizing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>jury for its inability to reach agreement on the assault and battery charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">As a preliminary matter, we note that \u201c[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d Rule 5A:18. Where an accused alleges that the trial court has made improper remarks in the presence of the jury but fails contemporaneously to object, request a cautionary instruction or move for a mistrial, he waives the right to challenge those remarks on appeal. <em>See Knight v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 207, 216, 443 S.E.2d 165, 170 (1994); <em>cf. Cheng v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 38-39, 393 S.E.2d 599, 605-06 (1990) (holding that \u201cerrors assigned because of a prosecutor\u2019s alleged improper comments or conduct during argument will not be considered on appeal unless an accused timely moves for a cautionary instruction or for a mistrial\u201d). \u201cA motion for a mistrial is untimely and properly refused when it is made after the jury has retired.\u201d <em>Cheng, </em>240 Va. at 39, 393 S.E.2d at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">We hold first that appellant properly preserved only a portion of his argument for appeal. Although he timely moved for a mistrial, his mistrial motion related only to Barner\u2019s response to the jury poll. Assuming without deciding that appellant\u2019s mistrial motion would have been timely regarding his other objections, appellant did not raise any other objections in his motion. He did not argue to the trial court that the plan to bring the jury back to deliberate on a later date impermissibly coerced the jury as a whole into a verdict. He also did not object at trial to the court\u2019s comments criticizing the inability of the jury as a whole to reach a verdict on the assault and battery charge. In addition, the alleged errors appellant raises for the first time on appeal do not meet the standards for review under the good cause or ends of justice exception to Rule 5A:18, for they are not \u201cclear, substantial and material.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>App. 126, 132, 380 S.E.2d 8, 11 (1989). Finally, appellant also failed to include these issues in his petition for appeal, which was limited to his allegation that the trial court erred in denying his mistrial motion. Thus, no appeal was granted on these issues, and we do not consider them. <em>See </em>Rule 5A: 12(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">We turn now to whether the trial court erred in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial based on Barner\u2019s response to the jury poll. \u201c \u2018On appeal the denial of a motion for a mistrial will not be overruled unless there exists a manifest probability that the denial of a mistrial was prejudicial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carver v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 7, 10, 434 S.E.2d 916, 917 (1993) (quoting <em>Harward v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 468, 478, 364 S.E.2d 511, 516 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The Constitution of Virginia entitles \u201ca criminal defendant tried by a jury [to] \u2018a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of his vicinage, without whose unanimous consent he cannot be found guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, 434 S.E.2d at 917 (quoting Va. Const, art. 1, \u00a7 8). Once the jury has returned its verdict \u201cin open court,\u201d a defendant has a right to have the jury \u201cpolled individually,\u201d to confirm that each juror joins in the verdict and that it is, in fact, unanimous. <em>See </em>Rule 3A:17(a), (d); <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>135 Va. 490, 498, 115 S.E. 704, 706 (1923), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Chittum v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 12, 174 S.E.2d 779 (1970). The trial court may require each juror to vote yes or no without opportunity for explanation. <em>See Clark, </em>135 Va. at 498-99, 115 S.E. at 707. \u201cThere is no right to a special poll to inquire how or why each juror arrived at the verdict.\u201d <em>Shepperson v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 586, 592, 454 S.E.2d 5, 9 (1995). When a juror expresses confusion in responding to a jury poll, a trial court has \u201cdiscretionary authority to ask appropriate neutral questions to clarify\u201d that juror\u2019s response. <em>Carver, </em>17 Va.App. at 10, 434 S.E.2d at 918. However, when a juror clearly \u201cunderstands the import of the question presented by the court in the polling of the jury\u201d and \u201canswers that his or her belief is contrary to the verdict rendered, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>verdict is not unanimous and cannot be accepted.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 11, 434 S.E.2d at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">We applied these principles in <em>Carver, </em>17 Va.App. 7, 434 S.E.2d 916. In that case, a juror indicated during the jury poll that she did not believe the accused was guilty, and she said she joined in the verdict because the other jurors agreed that he was guilty and said he would only be fined. <em>See id. </em>at 9, 434 S.E.2d at 917. After the juror had already expressed these reservations, the trial court said, \u201cWell, are you in accord with this verdict?\u201d and the juror responded, \u201cYes.\u201d <em>See id. </em>When counsel for the accused moved for a mistrial based on the juror\u2019s response, the juror said that she \u201cwent along\u201d and said yes, and repeated on two more occasions that she agreed with the verdict. <em>See id. </em>We held in <em>Carver </em>that the juror\u2019s response to the trial court was not based on confusion; rather, she indicated clearly \u201cher belief that the [accused] was innocent\u201d and that \u201cthe reason for her vote of guilty was that appellant would \u2018only be fined.\u2019 \u201d <em>See id. </em>Under those circumstances, we said, the juror\u2019s response indicated an improper basis for her vote of guilty and required the conclusion that the trial court erroneously accepted the jury\u2019s verdict as unanimous without requiring further deliberation. <em>See id. </em>at 10-11, 434 S.E.2d at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Appellant contends the circumstances surrounding Barner\u2019s response to the jury poll require the same conclusion here. Based on all the circumstances shown by the record, we agree. Although in this case, unlike in <em>Carver, </em>Bamer did not indicate expressly that the verdict was not her verdict, the trial court\u2019s repeated criticism of the jury during their deliberations makes clear the atmosphere of intimidation that existed by the time it was Bamer\u2019s turn to respond to the jury poll.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>The record demonstrates that, upon recalling the jury late in the day and learning that they were having difficulty reaching a unanimous decision due to \u201cdifferences of opinion on assault and battery,\u201d the trial court said, \u201cTall are not supposed to have a difference of opinion. The law is the law.... I don\u2019t know what would be the problem unless somebody just wants to be arbitrary.\u201d It also observed that \u201c[s]ome jury is going to come to a verdict in this case. Why do you want to shift your burden?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Events immediately following these comments demonstrate their likely coercive effect on Barner. When the court questioned individual jurors regarding their ability to reach a unanimous verdict, several jurors indicated their belief that unanimity was not possible, and one juror indicated spontaneously that he or she did not think appellant was guilty. However, shortly after these exchanges occurred, before the jury had been instructed to deliberate further and after its members learned they would be required to return another day to continue deliberating, they indicated they had reached a unanimous verdict. It was under these circumstances that Barner became upset, began to cry and indicated that she was \u201csorry\u201d and \u201c[could not] say it\u201d when asked if she agreed with the guilty verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Barner never indicated that the verdicts were not hers and, upon the trial court\u2019s facially non-eoercive request to her to give a yes or no answer, she said yes and thrice confirmed her response. Under ordinary circumstances, we would hold that the trial court did not err in failing to inquire into the reasons for Barner\u2019s initial hesitation. However, under the facts of this case, we hold that the totality of the circumstances shows the coercive effect the court\u2019s comments to the jury as a whole had on Barner\u2019s response to the jury poll. Under these circumstances, we hold the trial court erred in concluding the verdict was unanimous and, therefore, in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-8\">. The circumstantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>see Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 523-24, 371 S.E.2d 156, 164-65 (1988), proved that appellant intended to and actually did \"inflict[ ] ... corporal hurt on [Officer McCoy] ... willfully or in anger ... by some means set in motion by him,\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 679, 681-82, 36 S.E.2d 571, 572 (1946); <em>see Seegars v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 641, 644, 445 S.E.2d 720, 722 (1994) (holding that battery does not require infliction of injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">Officer McCoy testified that his upper torso was inside the car as he struggled with appellant\u2019s companion. From this position, McCoy saw appellant reach toward the ignition to start the vehicle. McCoy reached for the ignition and yelled stop. Despite McCoy\u2019s efforts, appellant started the car, grabbed onto his companion, \"stepped on the accelerator,\u201d and moved the car forward, \"knocking and dragging [McCoy] forward ... by the force of the automobile.\u201d The jury was entitled to infer that appellant intended the natural and probable consequences of his actions in ignoring McCoy\u2019s protests and moving the car forward with the knowledge that McCoy was partially inside the car and struggling with appellant\u2019s companion. <em>See Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 476, 484, 405 S.E.2d 1, 4 (1991) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">To the extent that the testimony of Officer McCoy may have conflicted with that of bystander Steve Tanner, the jury, as the finders of fact, was entitled to assess the witnesses' credibility and to accept McCoy\u2019s testimony over Tanner\u2019s to the extent that the testimony conflicted. <em>See Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989). Further, that appellant may have acted with an intent to flee the scene does not preclude a finding that he also acted with an intent to commit assault and battery. <em>See Herrel v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va. App. 579, 588, 507 S.E.2d 633, 637 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\">.
