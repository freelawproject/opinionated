We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">The facts relevant to our review follow. On October 4,1996, Child Protective Services received a confidential referral indicating that A.N., a fifteen-year-old girl, received several bruises as a result of disciplining by her father, S.N. Later that day, Christy Rogers, an investigator, interviewed A.N. She observed several bruises on A.N.\u2019s left wrist and left leg. The child stated that her father, inflicted the bruises with a racket after she refused to go to a family event. Ms. Rogers also interviewed D.N., the child\u2019s mother, who verified that S.N. struck the child with a racket. During a subsequent interview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>with Rogers on October 31, 1996, A.N. disclosed that her father had digitally penetrated her vagina on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">On November 8, 1996, the juvenile and domestic relations district court (\u201cjuvenile court\u201d) issued a petition alleging that A.N. was an abused child pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(1) and entered a Preliminary Protective Order. At a hearing on the merits, A.N. testified regarding the alleged incidents of sexual abuse committed by her father. The juvenile court found A.N. to be an \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 16.1-228(4), which defines \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d as any child \u201c[wjhose parents or other person responsible for his [sic] care commits or allows to be committed any sexual act upon a child in violation of the law----\u201d S.N. subsequently appealed the juvenile court\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court of Fairfax County.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">At the commencement of proceedings in the circuit court, appellant moved for a continuance on the ground that A.N. was not present to testify. The court denied appellant\u2019s motion. Without A.N.\u2019s testimony regarding her father\u2019s alleged sexual abuse, appellant proposed to prove A.N.\u2019s status as an \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014 228(1). Under this subparagraph, an \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d is any child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayg\">[w]hose parents or other person responsible for his [sic] care creates or inflicts, threatens to create or inflict, or allows to be created or inflicted upon such child a physical or mental injury by other than accidental means, or creates substantial risk of death, disfigurement or impairment of bodily or mental functions....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The circuit court found as a matter of law that appellant could not proceed under a subparagraph of Code \u00a7 16.1-228 that had not been previously considered in the juvenile court and limited the presentation of evidence to that which related to whether A.N. was an \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d under Code \u00a7 16.1-228(4), the subparagraph on which the juvenile court based its finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Appellant\u2019s counsel noted his objection to the court\u2019s ruling, stating that he was prepared to present evidence of physical abuse and to proceed under Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1). The court granted S.N. and D.N.\u2019s motion to dismiss the case, entering its order on the same day. Appellant subsequently appealed to this Court, naming both parents as appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We find the trial court erred by limiting appellant\u2019s presentation of the evidence and we reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(1) grants the juvenile court jurisdiction in cases involving the custody, visitation, support, control, or disposition of an allegedly abused or neglected child. Code \u00a7 16.1-228 sets forth five definitions of an \u201cabused or neglected child.\u201d These definitions include any child \u201c[w]hose parent[ ] ... inflicts ... a physical or mental injury by other than accidental means,\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1), and any child \u201c[wjhose parent[ ] ... commits ... any sexual act upon a child____\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-228(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">A party may appeal from any final order or judgment of the juvenile court that affects a party\u2019s rights. Code \u00a7 16.1-296(A). Upon appeal from the juvenile court, the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction is derivative. <em>See Addison v. Salyer, </em>185 Va. 644, 651, 40 S.E.2d 260, 264 (1946) (\u201cThe general rule is that jurisdiction of the circuit ... courts to try cases appealed from a decision of a trial justice is derivative ...\u2014 that is, the jurisdiction of the appellate court in such matters is the same as that of the court in which the action was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>originally instituted.\u201d). \u201cIn all cases on appeal [from the juvenile court], the circuit court in the disposition of such cases shall have all the powers and authority granted [to the juvenile court]____\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-296(1). <em>See Peyton v. French, </em>207 Va. 73, 79, 147 S.E.2d 739, 743 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">In addition, an appeal from the juvenile court must be heard <em>de novo </em>by the circuit court. Code \u00a7 16.1-136. \u201c \u2018A <em>de novo </em>hearing means a <em>trial anew, </em>with the burden of proof remaining upon the party with whom it rested in the juvenile court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parish v. Spaulding, </em>20 Va.App. 130, 132, 455 S.E.2d 728, 729 (1995) (quoting <em>Box v. Talley, </em>1 Va.App. 289, 292, 338 S.E.2d 349, 351 (1986)). A trial <em>de novo </em>in the circuit court \u201cannuls the judgment of the [juvenile court] as completely as if there had been no previous trial ... and ... grants to a litigant every advantage which would have been [available to the litigant] had the case been tried originally in [the circuit] court.\u201d <em>Walker v. Dept. of Public Welfare, </em>223 Va. 557, 563, 290 S.E.2d 887, 890 (1982) (citations omitted), <em>quoted in Parish, </em>20 Va.App. at 132, 455 S.E.2d at 729. \u201c \u2018A court which hears a case <em>de novo, </em>which disregards the judgment of the court below, which hears evidence anew and new evidence, and which makes final disposition of the case, acts not as a court of appeals but as one exercising original jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Addison, </em>185 Va. at 650, 40 S.E.2d at 263 (quoting <em>Gemmell, Inc. v. Svea Fire and Life Insurance, </em>166 Va. 95, 98, 184 S.E. 457, 458 (1936)).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">It follows from these principles that, at a trial <em>de novo </em>in the circuit court, the parties are not restricted to the evidence presented before the juvenile court. The circuit court must consider all relevant evidence, even if such evidence had not been considered by the juvenile court. <em>See Parish, </em>20 Va.App. at 132-33, 455 S.E.2d at 729-30 (holding that the circuit court erred by refusing to consider evidence of events occurring after the juvenile court\u2019s hearing and by failing to consider all relevant information available at the time of trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Here, appellant invoked the jurisdiction of the juvenile court by filing a petition alleging that A.N. was an \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d under Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This provision provides the jurisdictional basis for the adjudication of cases by the juvenile court and it contains within its sweep any child who is alleged to be abused, as defined elsewhere in the Code. The juvenile court thus had the power to find that A.N. was an \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d under any of this term\u2019s five statutory definitions. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1-5). Because the circuit court derived its jurisdiction from the juvenile court and, on appeal, possessed the same \u201cpowers and authority\u201d as the juvenile court, we find the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction was identical to that of the juvenile court. The trial court therefore erred when it limited appellant to presenting evidence which related solely to whether A.N. met the definition of an \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d under Code \u00a7 16.1-228(4), the provision upon which the juvenile court had based its finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Appellees\u2019 reliance on <em>Buck v. City of Danville </em>in support of their position is misplaced. 213 Va. 387, 192 S.E.2d 758 (1972). <em>Buck </em>addressed issues on appeal in the context of double jeopardy concerns.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The constitutional prohibition of double jeopardy consists of three separate guarantees: (1) it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after an acquittal; (2) it protects against a second prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>for the same offense after conviction; and (3) it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 513, 529, 273 S.E.2d 36, 46 (1980). <em>See </em>Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8. Appellees contend the juvenile court, by finding A.N. was an abused child under Code 16.1\u2014 228(4), \u201cruled out\u201d a finding of abuse under any other subparagraph and, therefore, the circuit court properly refused to consider evidence pertaining to those subparagraphs.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The constitutional protections appellees invoke, however, are not applicable. The record fails to support appellees\u2019 contention the juvenile court \u201cruled out\u201d or \u201cacquitted\u201d appellees of the allegation that their daughter was an \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d under the first subparagraph of Code \u00a7 16.1-228, or even considered the issue. On the contrary, the only evidence of abuse before the juvenile court was A.N.\u2019s testimony of her father\u2019s sexual abuse. Thus, the constitutional prohibition against a second prosecution for the same offense after an acquittal affords appellees no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Based on the foregoing, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s petition and remand this case to the circuit court for a trial <em>de novo, </em>consistent with this decision, if the appellant be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-10\">. Appellees contend the issue on appeal is procedurally barred pursuant to Rule 5A:18 on the ground that appellant failed to object to the circuit court\u2019s dismissal and that appellant failed to \u201carticulate why the case should not have been dismissed or proffer what the testimony of the complaining witness would have been.\u2019\u2019 Appellees\u2019 contention is without merit. The subject of this appeal is not the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the petition. Rather, the issue on appeal is the propriety of the circuit court\u2019s ruling limiting the scope of its <em>de novo </em>trial to issues raised under the subparagraph that constituted the basis of the juvenile court\u2019s ruling. Therefore, whether appellant registered an objection to the dismissal of his case is not dispositive. Furthermore, it is evident in the record that appellant properly preserved the issue raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\">. Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(1) gives the juvenile court exclusive original jurisdiction over all cases involving:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">The custody, visitation, support, control, or disposition of a child ... [w]ho is alleged to be abused, neglected, in need of services, in need of supervision, a status offender, or delinquent____</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\">. In <em>Buck, </em>the Court held that a defendant who was tried in a court not of record on a warrant charging him with driving under the influence of alcohol, but who was convicted of the lesser-included offense of impaired driving, could not then be convicted in a <em>de novo </em>trial in the corporation court of driving under the influence of alcohol without violating the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution of Virginia. <em>Id. </em>at 388-89, 192 S.E.2d at 759-60. The Court held the defendant's conviction of a lesser-included offense acquitted him of the driving under the influence charge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
