She argues that the trial court erred in granting the visitation because she had sole custody and objected to it. Concluding that the trial court did not err, we affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">Dotson maintains the trial court erred because it decreed visitation for the grandmother without finding that denying visitation was detrimental to the child. She further asserts that the trial court erred by merely substituting visitation with the grandmother for visitation with the father. Finally, she argues that if the trial court applied the correct standard, it abused its discretion and ruled contrary to the law because the evidence was not sufficient to support a finding that visitation was in the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">Dotson and Jeffery S. Hylton were divorced in November 1995 when their daughter was four years old. Upon decreeing divorce, the court also decreed joint legal custody with physical custody to the mother and granted reasonable visitation to the father. On March 5,1998, the father was sentenced to ten years in the penitentiary. As soon as he was sentenced, the mother moved for sole custody. The father did not object to her obtaining full custody, but he requested reasonable visitation while he remained in the local jail as well as continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>contact with his daughter through letters and telephone calls. He requested visitation for his mother. Dotson objected to visitation during his incarceration or by the grandmother. The trial court permitted the grandmother to intervene and petition for visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">After an <em>ore terms </em>hearing, the trial court granted the mother sole custody of the child. It specifically found that denial of visitation with the father and grandmother would not be in the best interests of the child. The trial court permitted the father visitation outside the jail and by letters and telephone calls after transfer to the penitentiary. It granted the grandmother visitation one Saturday per month, finding by clear and convincing evidence it was in the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The mother argues that under <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>256 Va. 19, 501 S.E.2d 417 (1998), the trial court cannot interfere with her constitutional right to raise her daughter unless the state has a compelling interest. A detriment to the child\u2019s welfare would constitute a compelling interest, but the state cannot intervene unless a detriment exists. Accordingly, she concludes that the trial court could award visitation to the grandmother only after finding that a detriment would arise if visitation was denied. Only after first finding that a detriment would arise, could the trial court determine whether the visitation was in the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">This case is not controlled by <em>Williams, </em>256 Va. 19, 501 S.E.2d 417. In <em>Williams, </em>both parents objected to visitation by the grandparents, and the family was intact. Under those facts, the Supreme Court held the state was required to have \u2022a compelling interest before interfering with parental rights. To grant visitation to the grandparents, over both parents\u2019 objection, the trial court had to find that withholding visitation would be detrimental to the child before it applied the best interests standard. The Court stressed that \u201c[t]he child\u2019s family is intact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 501 S.E.2d at 417. The factual predicate in <em>Williams </em>was a unified family.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>When only one parent objects to a grandparent\u2019s visitation and the other parent requests it, the trial court is not required to follow the standard enumerated in <em>Williams. </em>In this case, the trial court had been determining custody and visitation based on the child\u2019s best interests since the divorce three years earlier. The factual foundation for the <em>Williams </em>decision did not exist. The family was not intact, and only one parent objected to visitation. The trial court properly distinguished the <em>Williams </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The mother and the father were before the court on a custody and visitation dispute, so the grandmother\u2019s petition to intervene was proper. Grandparents are parties with a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and may be awarded visitation as provided by Code \u00a7 20-124.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parent-child relationship has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>primacy, but the trial court may award visitation to a grandparent upon a showing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the best interests of the child would be served. The statutory standard controls this case because <em>Williams </em>does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The trial court heard the evidence <em>ore tenus, </em>and its decision \u201cis entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Venable v. Venable, </em>2 Va.App. 178, 186, 342 S.E.2d 646, 651 (1986). The prevailing party in the trial court is entitled to have the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to it. <em>See Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 328, 387 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">When the couple was married, they lived with the grandmother, and the child spent substantial time with her. After the separation, the child continued to spend time with her grandmother during her father\u2019s visitation. The grandmother lived in a three-bedroom house with her adult son and daughter. The child was familiar with the father\u2019s extended family, and there was no evidence of abuse or that the grandmother\u2019s home was unfit. The mother admitted that the grandmother was mentally, physically and morally fit and able to care for the child. The father had visitation before he was jailed, and the court felt it should continue when he was not in the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The trial court considered the statutory factors set forth in Code \u00a7 20-124.3 when deciding that visitation was in the child\u2019s best interests. The evidence was sufficient to prove by clear and convincing evidence that visitation by the grandmother was in the best interests of the child. The grandmother was a legitimate party in interest and properly before the court as an intervenor. Her visitation privileges were independent of the father\u2019s right to visit his daughter though they coincided with his wishes. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-124.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">Concluding that the trial court did not err, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-6\">. \u00a7 20-124.1. <em>\u201cPerson with a legitimate interest\u201d </em>shall be broadly construed and includes, but is not limited to grandparents, stepparents, former stepparents, blood relatives and family members provided any such party has intervened in the suit or is otherwise properly before the court.
