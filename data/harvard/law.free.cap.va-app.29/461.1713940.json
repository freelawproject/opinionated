He contends the trial court erred when it refused to allow testimony at his DUI trial relating to his alleged physical inability to take a breath test following his DUI arrest. Appellant argues that, under the DUI statutes, his inability to take a breath test required the Commonwealth to provide him a blood test; absent a blood alcohol test, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the case. Appellant also contends that, due to numerous contradictions and discrepancies in the evidence, the evidence was insufficient to prove his guilt. For the reasons that follow, we reverse appellant\u2019s conviction and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">Arlington County Police Officer George Lichtenberg arrested appellant on June 7, 1997, and charged him with driving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>under the influence of alcohol. At the police station, Lichtenberg advised appellant of the implied consent law and about the breath test. The police never obtained breath test results. The police also charged appellant with refusing to take a breath test in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">DUI Trial in District Court</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">On August 7, 1997, the Arlington County General District Court convicted appellant of DUI and sentenced him to sixty days in jail, with fifty-four days suspended. In addition, the court fined him $1,500, with $1,000 suspended, and ordered him to be of good behavior and attend and successfully complete an alcohol safety program. The court suspended his driver\u2019s license for one year and granted him a restricted license, allowing him to travel to and from work during working hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Refusal Trial in District Court</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">On September 11, 1997, the Arlington County General District Court tried appellant on the charge of refusing to submit to a breath test. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-268.3. The district court dismissed the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">DUI Trial <em>De Novo </em>in Circuit Court</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">At appellant\u2019s October 30, 1997 trial <em>de novo </em>before the circuit court on the DUI charge, Officer Lichtenberg testified about the events surrounding the stop, arrest and attempt to administer a breath test to appellant. During cross-examination, defense counsel asked Lichtenberg what happened after he advised appellant of the implied consent law. The Commonwealth objected on the basis of relevance. Defense counsel argued, \u201cI would ask that I be allowed to ask what happened at the booking,\u201d but the trial judge sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">After the Commonwealth rested, appellant testified. When defense counsel asked appellant about \u201cblow[ing] into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>[breathalyzer] machine,\u201d the Commonwealth objected on the basis of relevance. Appellant contended that evidence surrounding the administration of the breath test was necessary so the trial court could determine \u201cwhether or not provisions of 18.2-268 have been violated.\u201d The following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would proffer to the court that the Defendant\u2019s testimony will be that he was asked to take the breath test, and was told to breath [sic] deeply, in preparation for breathing deeply into this machine, that doing so caused him to incur a fit of coughing because of his asthma that he has been suffering from for a number of years. He tried to breath [sic] into the machine a number of times. As a result of the coughing because of the asthma, he was not able to do so. He was taken before the magistrate and he was asked to try the test again. He could not because of his coughing and he was issued a citation for refusal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">THE COURT: That\u2019s not before that [sic] court.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Defense counsel argued that Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 requires that a \u201c \u2018blood test shall be given\u2019 \u201d if \u201c \u2018the breath test is unavailable or the person is physically unable to submit to a breath test.\u2019 \u201d Counsel made the following argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">That\u2019s mandatory. \u201cShall be given.\u201d I will proffer to the Court that not only was it not given, it was not even offered. And that is a violation of 18.2-268.2, and there is a long line of cases that talks about it. He was deprived of his opportunity to produce evidence that would establish his innocence in violation of this code section. We can\u2019t bring that to the Court\u2019s attention without this evidence. If we bring this to the Court\u2019s attention and the Court agrees it\u2019s a violation, the remedy pursuant to the [case law] out of the Court of Appeals is dismissal of the prosecution of the D.W.I. because he was deprived of the statutory right to present evidence in his own defense in as much as 18.2-268.2 says that the blood test shall be given, and it was not even offered in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>If it had been offered and he had refused that, we wouldn\u2019t be standing here, or at least I wouldn\u2019t be making the argument, but the evidence was that it was not even offered, let alone required, that is a violation. And it requires a dismissal of the prosecution as a remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The Commonwealth argued that, because a driver no longer has a choice of tests, such evidence was relevant only to the refusal charge. The trial judge sustained the objection. The prosecution also asserted that trial should proceed and appellant\u2019s guilt should be determined from the other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Defense counsel countered that appellant was deprived of his right to present possibly exculpatory evidence, after which the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">THE COURT: So you\u2019re saying because he started coughing and couldn\u2019t conduct the test that they offered, they should have given him a blood test\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The statute says so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">THE COURT: And because they didn\u2019t give him a blood test, this case should be dismissed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">THE COURT: Your exception is noted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">After refusing appellant\u2019s testimony about the breath test, the trial court allowed defense witness Marietta Warden to testify as an expert about the effect of alcohol on a person\u2019s blood alcohol level, and to render an opinion about appellant\u2019s behavior and blood alcohol level based bn the amount of alcohol appellant told her he had consumed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response to \u2022 the trial court\u2019s questions, Warden said that appellant told her he was an asthmatic and that he had suffered an asthmatic attack the night he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">After the parties rested, defense counsel raised \u201c[o]ne tidy bookkeeping matter.\u201d \u201cIn order for the record to be complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>and to preserve all this,\u201d and \u201cfor purposes of the evidentiary basis for the renewal of the motion to strike,\u201d defense counsel introduced Exhibits 5 and 6. Exhibit 5 is a copy of the summons for the refusal charge from the district court indicating that the refusal charge was dismissed, and Exhibit 6 is entitled \u201cCertificate of Refusal \u2014 Breath/Blood Test.\u201d Exhibit 6 is signed by the magistrate, and under the magistrate\u2019s signature is a handwritten notation regarding the breath test refusal. Defense counsel asked the trial judge \u201cto take them and mark them,\u201d and \u201ctake judicial notice of the Court\u2019s own records.\u201d The following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: For the purpose of the record, I renew the motion to strike that was entered earlier. The Court has probably heard the totality of the argument in addressing the Commonwealth\u2019s objections to the admissibility of that basis evidence. Let me just reiterate so the record is complete, that it\u2019s based on a violation of the [sic] 18.2-268.3B inasmuch as the statute requires that if the breath test is unavailable or the person is physically unable to submit to the breath test, a blood test can be given and that was not done in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">THE COURT: The record will reflect that five and six are admitted for the purposes stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">THE COURT: And your motion to strike is denied and your exception is noted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And we ask the Court to take judicial notice of the Court\u2019s own records, you will see the certified copies of not only the refusal certificate issued by the magistrate, and made a part of the General District Court records with reference to the trial of the charge of refusal itself and the warrant charging Mr. Lamay with refusal. Also, the back side of each of those documents, specifically the refusal wherein the case was tried, and I\u2019m not certain, in a civil case, it says not guilty, it says charge dismissed. It\u2019s not a criminal case, it can\u2019t be guilty or not guilty. It does indicate it was dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>THE COURT: I don\u2019t believe that it is in this file. It has its own file, I think. And that file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: This is a General District Court file from which those were extracted and the clerk certified them on the flip side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">THE COURT: I will take judicial notice. It\u2019s not in this file, you\u2019re aware of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">THE COURT: That will be part of the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Beneath the magistrate\u2019s signature on Exhibit 6 is the following handwritten statement: \u201cAccused gave insufficient sample and would not answer when asked if he wished to <em>try the test again\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">After hearing argument regarding some discrepancies between Liehtenberg\u2019s testimony and the testimony of appellant, the trial court found appellant \u201cnot a credible witness\u201d and found him guilty of DUI. The court sentenced appellant to twelve months in jail with all but ninety days suspended. The court also fined appellant $2,500. On December 12, 1997, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in refusing to allow testimony relating to the failure of the police to comply with the requirement that when a person is physically unable to submit to a breath test, a blood test shall be given.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have not had an opportunity to construe fully the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 since its effective revision date of January 1, 1995. Therefore, this case comes before us as one of first impression and requires us to analyze Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B) in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>situations where at his or her DUI trial an accused DUI driver alleges physical inability to take a breath test. We must determine, under the limited facts of this case, what evidence is admissible, the procedures to follow, and what remedy, if any, should issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">(Implied Consent to Post-Arrest Chemical Test)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 was revised by the legislature in 1994 by \u201cActs 1994, cc. 359 and 363.\u201d It took effect on January 1, 1995. Before the revision, Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B) offered a choice as to which test to take and provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A43\">Any person so arrested for a violation of \u00a7 18.2-266\u00ae or (ii) or both, or \u00a7 18.2-266.1 or of a similar ordinance shall elect to have either a blood or breath sample taken, but not both. If either the blood test or breath test is not available, then the available test shall be taken and it shall not be a matter of defense if the blood test or the breath test is not available. If the accused elects a breath test, he shall be entitled upon request, to observe the process of analysis and to see the blood-alcohol reading on the equipment used to perform the breath test. If the equipment automatically produces a written printout of the breath test result, the printout or a copy, shall be given to the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The current version of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">Any person so arrested for a violation of \u00a7 18.2-266\u00ae or (ii) or both, or \u00a7 18.2-266.1 or of a similar ordinance shall submit to a breath test. If the breath test is unavailable or the person is physically unable to submit to the breath test, a blood test shall be given. The accused shall, prior to administration of the test, be advised by the person administering the test that he has the right to observe the process of analysis and to see the blood-alcohol reading on the equipment used to perform the breath test. If the equip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ment automatically produces a written printout of the breath test result, the printout, or a copy, shall be given to the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In its 1995 revision, the legislature eliminated the driver\u2019s option to elect which test to take and mandated that a driver accused of DUI \u201cshall submit to a breath test.\u201d Only when a breath test is unavailable or the accused is physically unable to take one, is a blood test to be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Under the former statute, the legislature mandated that if one test is unavailable, \u201cthen the available test <em>shall be taken.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The revised statute provides that if the breath test is unavailable or the person is physically unable to take it, \u201ca blood test <em>shall be given.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.3</p>\n<p id=\"AYB\">(The Refusal Statute)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The current version of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.3, the refusal statute, reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">A. If a person, after having been arrested for a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-51.4, 18.2-266 or \u00a7 18.2-266.1 or of a similar ordinance and after having been advised by the arresting officer that a person who operates a motor vehicle upon a public highway in this Commonwealth is deemed thereby, as a condition of such operation, to have consented to have samples of his blood and breath taken for cliemical tests to determine the alcohol or drug content of his blood, and that the unreasonable refusal to do so constitutes grounds for the revocation of the privilege of operating a motor vehicle upon the highways of this Commonwealth, refuses to permit blood or breath or both blood and breath samples to be taken for such tests, the arresting officer shall take the person before a committing magistrate. If he again so refuses after having been further advised by the magistrate of the law requiring blood or breath samples to be taken and the penalty for refusal, and so declares again his refusal in writing upon a form provided by the Supreme Court, or refuses or fails to so declare in writing and such fact is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>certified as prescribed below, then no blood or breath samples shall be taken even though he may later request them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">B. The form shall contain a brief statement of the law requiring the taking of blood or breath samples and the penalty for refusal, a declaration of refusal, and lines for the signature of the person from whom the blood or breath sample is sought, the date, and the signature of a witness to the signing. If the person refuses or fails to execute the declaration, the magistrate shall certify such fact and that the magistrate advised the person that a refusal to permit a blood or breath sample to be taken, if found to be unreasonable, constitutes grounds for revocation of. the person\u2019s privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of this Commonwealth. The magistrate shall promptly issue a warrant or summons charging the person with a violation of \u00a7 18.2-268.2. The warrant or summons shall be executed in the same manner as criminal warrants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">E. The declaration of refusal or certificate of the magistrate shall be prima facie evidence that the defendant refused to allow a blood or breath sample to be taken to determine the alcohol or drug content of his blood. However, this shall not prohibit the defendant from introducing on his behalf evidence of the basis for his refusal. The court shall determine the reasonableness of such refusal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Admissibility of Evidence Describing the Unsuccessful Attempt to Give the Breath Test</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">\u201cThe admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(A), the implied consent law, mandates that any person arrested for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-266 within two hours of such offense \u201cshall be deemed thereby as a condition of such [vehicular] operation, to have consented to have samples of his blood', breath, or both blood and breath taken for a chemical test to determine the\u201d alcohol and/or drug content of his or her blood. Subsection (B) mandates that a \u201cperson so arrested\u201d for such violations \u201cshall submit to a breath test.\u201d The subsection further directs that \u201c[i]f the breath test is unavailable or the person is physically unable to submit to the breath test, a blood test shall be given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In <em>Walton v. City of Roanoke, </em>204 Va. 678, 133 S.E.2d 315 (1963), the defendant alleged that admission of blood alcohol test results violated his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. The Supreme Court rejected that argument, and, in dicta, explained the following about Virginia\u2019s former implied consent statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">The provisions of [the implied consent law] serve a <em>salutary purpose. </em>A chemical analysis of one\u2019s blood provides a scientifically accurate method of determining whether a person is intoxicated, removes the question from the field of speculation and supplies the best evidence for that determination. <em>It protects one who has the odor of alcohol on his breath but has not been drinking to excess, and one whose conduct may create the appearance of intoxication when he is suffering from, some physical condition over which he has no control.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 683,133 S.E.2d at 319 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Although present Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 requires only a breath test, there remain three statutorily defined situations allowing or justifying the administration of a blood test rather than a breath test: (1) unavailability of a breath test; (2) a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2 \u2014 266(iii) or (iv), involving the use of other drugs; and (3) a suspect\u2019s physical inability to take a breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Unavailability-</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Under the former DUI statute that offered drivers the choice of a blood or breath test, the Commonwealth could assert that one of the tests was unavailable when a suspected driver was not provided the test that he or she elected.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In <em>Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 148, 150, 421 S.E.2d 674, 675 (1992), decided under former Code \u00a7 18.2-268(C), we placed the burden on the Commonwealth to establish that a requested test was unavailable. We held that \u201cthe Commonwealth must establish the reasons for the unavailability of one of the tests before denying a driver his or her test of choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150, 421 S.E.2d at 675-76. We explained that \u201c[o]nce the Commonwealth has elected to have a driver take a blood or breath test pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-268, the driver has a right to receive the benefits of the test\u201d and that \u201cthe Commonwealth must establish the reasons for the unavailability of one of the tests before denying a driver his or her test of choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In light of <em>Breeden, </em>we have consistently assigned the Commonwealth the burden to explain the unavailability of a requested test. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Gray, </em>248 Va. 633, 636, 449 S.E.2d 807, 809 (1994) (affirming refusal conviction, holding that when accused chooses particular test, \u201cand that test cannot be administered because it allegedly is unavailable,\u201d the Commonwealth must establish a reasonable basis to support such finding); <em>Herring v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 588, 591, 507 S.E.2d 638, 639 (1998) (holding that the Commonwealth bears the burden of establishing that a breath test was unavailable); ' <em>Walker v. City of Lynchburg, </em>22 Va. App. 197, 198, 468 S.E.2d 164, 165 (1996) (holding that Commonwealth satisfied its burden and \u201cprovided sufficient basis to determine unavailability of the [requested] blood test\u201d under former Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2); <em>Snead v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 372, 374, 437 S.E.2d 239, 241 (1993) (holding that if an election is not honored because of unavailability, the Commonwealth must establish a valid reason for the lack of availability of the test requested); <em>Sullivan v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 376, 378, 437 S.E.2d 242, 243 (1993) (holding that Commonwealth \u201cbears the burden of showing\u201d that unavaila<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>bility of requested tests was reasonable); <em>Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 583, 585, 425 S.E.2d 544, 545 (1993) (holding that \u201c[i]f one of the tests is unavailable the government must provide a reasonable explanation for its unavailability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\u201cFinally, if the unavailability of the test is found to be unreasonable, \u2018[m]ere suppression of the result of the test not requested ... does not cure the deprivation.\u2019 The only appropriate remedy is reversal of the conviction and dismissal of the charges.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>17 Va.App. at 378, 437 S.E.2d at 243 (quoting <em>Breeden, </em>15 Va.App. at 150, 421 S.E.2d at 676).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Physical Inability</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">By revising Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, effective January 1, 1995, the legislature eliminated an accused driver\u2019s choice of tests but added language to accommodate situations where an accused is physically unable to take a breath test. These legislative changes require us to interpret and apply the current statute in order to effect the legislature\u2019s intended purpose. In other words, we must determine how that language comes into play in a DUI case, who has the burden to establish physical inability, and what procedures are to be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Because it is the accused driver whose physical inability is at issue in such situations, logic dictates that the burden should fall on the accused to establish that fact. After an accused presents evidence of his physical inability, the Commonwealth is entitled to present evidence in rebuttal, after which it rests upon the trial court to determine whether the accused satisfied his or her burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Here, the trial court refused to consider evidence relating to administration of the breath test, ostensibly because it was the same evidence presented in the district court trial on the refusal charge and, thus, was not relevant. As discussed below, prior case law under the former DUI statutes supports that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">In <em>Cash v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 46, 466 S.E.2d 736 (1996), the defendant was charged with driving under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>influence and with refusing to submit to a blood or breath test. The district court acquitted her of the DUI charge but convicted her of the refusal charge. <em>See id. </em>at 48, 466 S.E.2d at 737. She appealed the refusal conviction to the circuit court..</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">Pretrial, the circuit court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion to exclude certain evidence proffered by [Cash] on the reasonableness of her refusal to submit to the blood or breath test. The prosecutor asked the court to prohibit, for example, any evidence regarding defendant\u2019s sobriety at the time of arrest and evidence of the outcome of the DUI charge on the ground that such evidence is irrelevant to the charge of unreasonable refusal to submit to such test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgR\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In determining whether the trial court erred in granting the Commonwealth\u2019s motion and excluding such evidence, the Supreme Court pointed out that \u201cthe declaration of refusal or the magistrate\u2019s certificate is prima facie evidence that the defendant refused to submit to testing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49, 466 S.E.2d at 737. \u201c \u2018However, this shall not prohibit the defendant from introducing on his behalf evidence of the basis of his refusal. The court shall determine the reasonableness of such refusal.\u2019 \u201d\u25a0 <em>Id. </em>at 49, 466 S.E.2d at 738 (quoting Code \u00a7 18.2-268.3(E)). The Court then provided the following comments regarding the DUI and refusal statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">[T]his Court has decided that operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs may give rise to two separate and distinct proceedings \u2014 one a criminal action for DUI and the other a civil, administrative proceeding on the refusal charge. \u201cEach action proceeds independently of the other and the outcome of one is of no consequence to the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 49, 466 S.E.2d at 738 (quoting <em>Deaner v. Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 285, 289, 170 S.E.2d 199, 201 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">At her refusal trial, Cash sought to present evidence about the small amount of alcohol she allegedly consumed, witness testimony that she was not under the influence, testimony that her driving was not erratic, testimony about the police officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>abusive conduct, evidence about her satisfactory performance on the field sobriety tests, testimony regarding her requests to consult an attorney, and evidence relating to her expressed concern that she was being framed. <em>See id. </em>at 50-51, 466 S.E.2d at 738-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The Court held that \u201cevidence about defendant\u2019s sobriety, about her driving proficiency, and about her subjective belief that she was not under the influence of alcohol, while admissible in a DUI trial, was utterly inadmissible in the refusal trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51-52, 466 S.E.2d at 739. Moreover, the Court ruled that Cash\u2019s \u201cdesire to consult counsel \u2018to see what she could do to protect her interest from being framed\u2019 furnishes no legal basis for refusal to submit to testing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 466 S.E.2d at 739. In addition to detailing evidence that did not provide a reasonable basis for refusing a test, the Court also explained what type of evidence could provide a basis for refusal when it stated, \u201c[illustrative of a refusal that would be deemed reasonable is when \u2018a person\u2019s health would be endangered by the withdrawal of blood.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 466 S.E.2d at 738 (quoting <em>Deaner, </em>210 Va. at 293, 170 S.E.2d at 204). <em>See also Bailey v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 130, 131, 207 S.E.2d 828, 829 (1974) (holding that there must be some \u201creasonable factual basis for the refusal,\u201d such as, endangerment of the health of the accused by the withdrawal of blood).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s explanation that DUI and refusal cases are separate and distinct, and its consistent pronouncement that evidence on one charge is usually irrelevant and inadmissible in a trial on the other charge, has overshadowed the revised portion of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 anticipating conditions where an accused is physically unable to take a breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">By including physical inability as a condition precluding the administration of the required test intended to benefit an accused driver, the legislature contemplated situations where physical inability would arise and evinced its intention to allow accused drivers to establish that fact. Under Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, if the accused satisfies that burden before the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>court, he or she is entitled to a blood test. Because we hold that, under appropriate circumstances, an accused bears the burden of establishing Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B) physical inability, such evidence must be and is admissible in a DUI trial. In summary, whereas evidence unique to a refusal charge has historically been precluded at a DUI trial, and vice-versa, the changes in Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 require a different evidentiary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in not permitting appellant to elicit testimony relating to his physical inability to take the breath test. On remand, the trial court is directed to permit appellant to present evidence regarding his physical inability to perform the breath test, after which the Commonwealth may present rebuttal evidence. The trial court must then rule whether the accused has sufficiently carried his burden of establishing his physical inability. If the trial court finds that the accused has fulfilled this burden and that a blood test was not offered, then the charge must be dismissed. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-14\">. Warden did not meet with appellant at the time of his June 7, 1997 arrest; instead, she interviewed him on June 25, 1997 and on July 16, 1997, during which time appellant provided background data upon which Warden based her opinions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-12\">. Appellant raises two other issues: whether there was error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to dismiss the case due to the Commonwealth\u2019s alleged failure to follow the statute, and whether there was error in the trial court\u2019s failure to find a reasonable doubt as to appellant\u2019s guilt, given the alleged discrepancies in the evidence presented at trial. Because of our decision to remand based on an evidentiary error, we do not reach either of these issues on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
