On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court erred in: (1) requiring him to divulge privileged information to the Commonwealth; (2) allowing improper impeachment evidence regarding one of appellant\u2019s witnesses; (3) permitting two officers to give opinion testimony; (4) admitting into evidence tape-recorded conversations between appellant and the informant; (5) allowing the Commonwealth to introduce evidence of appellant\u2019s prior criminal conduct; (6) allowing improper lay opinion testimony about appellant\u2019s guilt; (7) incorrectly instructing the jury as to the informant\u2019s immunity from prosecution; and (8) making an improper comment to the jury foreperson during deliberations. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Appellant was charged with selling cocaine to Terry Harber (Harber) on July 9 and July 15, 1996. The Commonwealth\u2019s case was based primarily upon the testimony of Harber, who was acting as an informant for Brian Shoemaker, a Lee County Deputy Sheriff assigned to a multi-jurisdiction \u201cDrug Task Force.\u201d Harber made \u201ccontrolled buys\u201d of cocaine from appellant while wearing a body wire, which transmitted Harber\u2019s conversations to nearby police officers. These radio transmissions were recorded and played for the jury. At trial, appellant contended that Harber was an unreliable informant and that the alleged sales of cocaine had never occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">II. PRIVILEGED INFORMATION</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Prior to trial, appellant filed various motions for discovery and submitted proposed orders to the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney for endorsement. Although the trial court did not enter a formal discovery order, it made several rulings during the discovery hearings. At no time prior to trial did the Commonwealth request reciprocal discovery pursuant to Rule 3A:ll(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>During a recess while <em>voir dire </em>of the jury panel was in progress, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney learned that appellant\u2019s counsel had interviewed Terry Harber. This pretrial interview (the Harber statement) was recorded, a transcript of the interview was prepared, and Harber signed an affidavit regarding his statements made in the interview.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commonwealth requested the trial court to order disclosure of these materials. Appellant argued that: (1) the Harber statement was not discoverable under Rule 3A:11; (2) the Commonwealth had no right to information developed by the defendant in anticipation of trial; and (3) he intended to use the materials only if necessary to impeach Harber\u2019s direct testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Over appellant\u2019s objection, the trial court ordered that copies of the tape, transcript, and affidavit be provided to the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. The trial judge ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with you talking with the witness, but if the witness has made a statement to you, independent of what has been given to you and different from what he has testified to, or different from what he has advised the Commonwealth Attorney, I -think that yes, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>think the Commonwealth Attorney would be entitled to see what that is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Appellant complied with the court\u2019s ruling while maintaining his objection. After the jury selection process concluded, the trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to adjourn until the next morning so the Commonwealth could review the disclosed material.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">On appeal, we decide whether Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1\u2014 which addresses impeachment of witnesses and allows \u201cthe court at any time <em>during the trial </em>to require the production\u201d of \u201cprevious statements made by [a witness] in writing or reduced into writing\u201d \u2014 provides authority for a trial court to order the disclosure of otherwise non-discoverable material. The parties agree that the Harber statement was not discoverable by the Commonwealth under the discovery provisions of Rule 3A:11.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the parties dispute the application of Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The Commonwealth contends that while advance disclosure of the Harber statement was not mandated under Rule 3A:11, Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1 gave the trial court the discretion to require the production of the tape and affidavit for inspection. Under the circumstances of the instant case, we hold that the trial judge erred in requiring appellant to disclose the materials prior to their use or proposed use for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1 specifically addresses the contradiction of witnesses by use of prior inconsistent writings and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADV\">A witness in a criminal case may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into wiiting, relative to the subject matter of the proceeding, without such writing being shown to him; but if it is intended to contradict such witness by the writing, <em>his </em>attention must, before such contradictory proof can be given, be called to the particular occasion on which the writing is supposed to have been made, and <em>he </em>may be asked if he did not make a writing of the purport of the one to be offered to contradict him, and if he denies making it, or does not admit its execution, it shall then be shown to him, and if he admits its genuineness, <em>he </em>shall be allowed to make his own explanation of it; but it shall be competent for the court at any time <em>during the trial </em>to require the production of the writing for its inspection, and the court may thereupon make such use of it for the purpose of the trial as it may think best.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">(Emphasis added). The last provision of the statute grants the trial court broad latitude in ordering the production of a witness\u2019 statement when the statement is used for impeachment purposes. However, in the context of this case, the provision does not allow for pretrial discovery or pre-impeachment use.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1 was not intended by the legislature to be used as an alternate method of discovery. To the contrary, it was specifically placed in Chapter 16 of Title 19.2 entitled, <em>Evidence and Witnesses. </em>\u201cWhile not part of the code section, in the strictest sense, the caption may be considered in construing the statute, as it is \u2018valuable and indicative of legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 693, 701, 467 S.E.2d 289, 293 (1996) (quoting <em>Krummert v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 581, 584, 43 S.E.2d 831, 832 (1947)). Furthermore, the code section is entitled, <em>Contradiction by prior inconsistent writing, </em>and in construing the statute, , we shall look to its title. \u201cA title may be read in an attempt to ascertain an act\u2019s purpose, though it is no part of the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>itself.\u201d <em>Hawkins v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 261, 269, 497 S.E.2d 839, 842 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Considering the chapter caption and title of the statute, we conclude that the authority granted in Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1 was not intended to supplement the discovery provisions of Rule 3A:11. Rather, it was intended to be used as an evidentiary rule by the trial court to order the production, inspection and use of a written statement once a witness has been cross-examined about the existence or contents of a prior statement. Indeed, we have consistently applied Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1 only to cases involving the impeachment of a witness. For example, in <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 594, 453 S.E.2d 572 (1995), we held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a written stipulation of facts to impeach the trial testimony of Williams, the defendant\u2019s primary witness. Addressing the proper use of prior inconsistent written statements, we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">We see no reason why the signed stipulation of facts that accompanied Williams\u2019s plea should be viewed as anything other than Williams\u2019s admission to the events that transpired during the consummated drug sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">Importantly, the trial court is permitted to \u201cmake such use of [the writing] for the purpose of the trial as it may think best.\u201d The record demonstrates that the stipulation of facts was submitted in compliance with Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1. <em>After the stipulation\u2019s submission, appellant\u2019s counsel had the opportunity to elicit Williams\u2019s version of the facts. Thereafter, it was within the province of the jury to determine Williams\u2019s veracity.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 597, 453 S.E.2d at 574 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). Accordingly, we concluded in <em>Smith </em>that \u201cthe stipulation\u2019s introduction for impeachment purposes was not an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598, 453 S.E.2d at 575. <em>See also Spruill v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 475, 485, 271 S.E.2d 419, 425 (1980) (finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s request under Code \u00a7 19.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>268.1 to introduce a medical report where there was \u201cnothing contradictory or inconsistent\u201d in the proffered report).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 568, 454 S.E.2d 1 (1995), we again considered the application of Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1 where the defendant attempted to impeach the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses by questioning them about prior statements made at a preliminary hearing. The Commonwealth argued that the statute applied and the defendant was required to use a transcript when attempting to impeach the two witnesses. <em>See id. </em>at 570, 454 S.E.2d at 2. Although we held that Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1 did not apply in that case, our analysis was based upon evidentiary rules of impeachment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">The court erred in requiring a transcript as the <em>only </em>means of impeaching a witness based on inconsistent statements made at an earlier hearing. Although laying a foundation prior to the introduction of impeachment evidence is a separate and necessary step in the impeachment process, it is not contingent on the existence of a transcript. While using a transcript, if available, is the preferable means of laying an impeachment foundation, it is not the only means. This rule also applies once the initial foundation has been laid. If a witness denies or is unable to recall a prior statement, a party may impeach him by introducing other evidence, such as another witness who heard the inconsistent statement. <em>If a transcript is available, the court may require its production pursuant to the mandate of Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1 even if there are other means of impeachment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 571-72, 454 S.E.2d at 2-3 (second emphasis added). <em>See also Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 507, 511, 425 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1992) (\u201cIf a witness gives testimony that is inconsistent with a prior statement, or testifies that he does not recall making the prior statement, a sufficient foundation for impeachment has been laid, and opposing counsel may cross-examine the witness as to the inconsistency. In addition, all inconsistent portions of that prior written statement are admissible for impeachment purposes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>The case law is well settled as to the proper use of written statements under Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1. That provision applies only to the evidentiary rule of impeachment during trial and provides no authority to order a defendant to disclose a witness\u2019 written statement prior to trial. In the instant case, the trial court ordered appellant to disclose the tape, transcript and affidavit of Harber before opening statements, which allowed the Commonwealth an additional day to review the materials. This requirement was tantamount to ordering the defendant to provide discovery materials that under Rule 3A:11 would not have been discoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Moreover, while the Commonwealth requested disclosure of the Harber statement pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1, it appears from the record that the trial court based its decision solely on discovery rules. The trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">Well I\u2019ve made certain rulings, here, that I have directed that the Commonwealth Attorney make available to defense counsel materials and so forth, and I don\u2019t think this trial is a one-way deal, I think we need to go down the middle of the road. For that reason I suppose [defense counsel] is allowed to listen to any and all tapes which the Commonwealth may have, which the Commonwealth is going to rely upon, and then at the last minute you, as defense counsel, have come up with something different. I don\u2019t think the Commonwealth Attorney should have to wait in anticipation as to whether it\u2019s going to be used or not used. I take it\u2019s going to be used and she should be entitled to see what it is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Nevertheless, the Commonwealth argues that because appellant indicated that the Harber statement might be used for impeachment purposes during trial, the trial court properly exercised its authority under Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1 in requiring production of the written materials at an earlier time. However, as the statute mandates, there is a proper method for impeachment by prior inconsistent writings. As we stated in <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 252, 372 S.E.2d 771 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1095, 109 S.Ct. 2441, 104 L.Ed.2d 997 (1989),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1, in plain language, permits the cross-examination of a witness in a criminal case based on a prior written statement by the witness. This statute provides that if the witness denies making the prior statement, it shall then be shown to him and if he admits its genuineness, he shall be allowed to make his own explanation of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIf\"><em>Id. </em>at 258, 372 S.E.2d at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In the instant case, the Commonwealth put the cart before the horse. Appellant indicated that, if necessary, he would use the interview materials to impeach Harber. However, when the Commonwealth\u2019s request was made during <em>voir dire </em>of the jury, appellant could only speculate as to the substance of Harber\u2019s direct testimony. Indeed, the trial judge recognized that the statement was useful for impeachment purposes <em>only if </em>the witness provided inconsistent testimony on direct examination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If, during the cross-examination of Harber, appellant attempted to impeach the witness, then Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1 would have allowed the trial court to \u201crequire the production of the writing for its inspection\u201d and \u201cthereupon make such use of it for the purpose of the trial as it may think best.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1; <em>see also Edwards, </em>19 Va.App. at 571, 454 S.E.2d at 2 (\u201cAfter the foundation is laid, \u2018[t]he witness may then usually be impeached by the introduction of evidence to prove that the prior inconsistent statement was in fact made.\u2019 Such evidence includes the testimony of another witness who heard the prior inconsistent statement, or the transcript of a prior hearing. <em>If the prior statement was \u2018in writing or reduced to writing,\u2019 such as in the form of a transcript, the court may require the party to produce the writing.\u2019\u2019 </em>(citations omitted) (emphasis added)). Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>we hold the trial court erred in ordering disclosure of the Harber statement prior to the proper foundation for its use and as a substitute for pretrial discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">However, our inquiry does not end there. We must decide whether the error requires reversal. Our determination of whether the error is harmless is guided by familiar principles. Non-constitutional error \u201cis harmless \u2018[w]hen it <em>plainly appears </em>from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-678) (emphasis added in <em>Lavinder </em>). To determine whether an error is harmless, the Court \u201cmust review the record and the evidence and evaluate the effect the error may have had on how the finder of fact resolved the contested issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1007, 407 S.E.2d at 912. \u201cAn error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1005, 407 S.E.2d at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Applying the standard articulated in <em>Lavinder, </em>we conclude that the error was harmless. While the trial court erroneously ordered disclosure of the Harber statement, it plainly appears from the evidence that appellant received \u201ca fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d <em>Lavinder, </em>12 Va.App. at 1005, 407 S.E.2d at 911. Moreover, we cannot unring the bell and restore the status quo. The statement has been disclosed to the Commonwealth and on retrial it would be available for their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Furthermore, the record affirmatively establishes that the verdict was not affected by the trial court\u2019s error. Although the Commonwealth was granted access to the Harber materials at the conclusion of <em>voir dire, </em>the course of trial proceeded as if the tape, transcript and affidavit had not been disclosed to the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. Indeed, the Commonwealth limited its direct examination of Harber to his prior criminal record, the grant of immunity for testifying and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>circumstances involving the controlled buys from appellant. The Commonwealth also played for the jury the tape-recorded conversations between appellant and Harber. The record clearly establishes that the Harber materials were not used to bolster Harber\u2019s credibility on direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">It was not until the cross-examination of Harber that the jury learned about the existence and contents of his tape-recorded interview. Counsel attempted to impeach Harber\u2019s trial testimony that identified appellant as the individual involved in the controlled buys. Only at that point did he use the pretrial statement Harber had given to defense counsel, in which Harber stated he could not remember who sold him the drugs. On redirect, Harber testified that the April 1998 statement was untrue and that he was \u201cpressured\u201d into making it.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In summary, we conclude that the trial court erred in ordering pretrial disclosure of the Harber statement because it was not discoverable under Rule 3A:11 nor was it properly produced under Code \u00a7 19.2-268.1. However, we conclude that this error was harmless because this information would have ultimately been provided to the Commonwealth and its use would have been the same. The course of the trial did not change, and it plainly appears from the record that appellant received a fair trial. <em>See Lavinder, </em>12 Va.App. at 1005, 407 S.E.2d at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">III. IMPEACHMENT OF KEMPTON</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Appellant called as a witness Dale Kempton, a longtime acquaintance of appellant and Harber. Appellant attempted to contradict Harber\u2019s testimony that he was \u201cpressured\u201d into making the statement at defense counsel\u2019s office and later into signing an affidavit memorializing it. During cross-examination of Kempton, the Commonwealth attempted to impeach him with evidence of prior drug use, a misdemeanor conviction for distribution of marijuana, and an assault and battery and malicious wounding charge, neither of which resulted in conviction. Over appellant\u2019s objection, the trial court allowed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>testimony into evidence. Appellant contends on appeal that the Commonwealth\u2019s method of impeaching Dale Kempton was improper. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">On cross-examination by the Commonwealth, Kempton was asked whether he had a history of drug abuse. The witness stated, \u201cNo.\u201d Over appellant\u2019s objection, the trial court allowed the Commonwealth to question whether Kemp-ton had previously been convicted of misdemeanor distribution of marijuana. We hold the trial court erred in allowing this line of questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u201cWhere the purpose of the inquiry is to impeach a witness\u2019 <em>veracity, </em>cross-examination concerning a witness\u2019 pri- or convictions is limited to prior felony convictions and convictions for misdemeanors involving moral turpitude.\u201d <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 36, 41, 486 S.E.2d 120, 122 (1997) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 525, 528, 298 S.E.2d 99, 101 (1982); <em>Chrisman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 89, 93-100, 348 S.E.2d 399, 401-05 (1986)). Misdemeanor crimes of moral turpitude are limited to those crimes involving lying, cheating and stealing, including making a false statement and petit larceny. <em>See Chrisman, </em>3 Va.App. at 99, 348 S.E.2d at 404. <em>See also </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 5-12(a) (4th ed. 1993). However, the misdemeanor crime of distribution of marijuana is not considered a crime of moral turpitude and, therefore, is not an appropriate form of impeachment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>trial court erred in allowing inquiry into whether Kempton had been convicted of misdemeanor distribution of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The trial court also erred in allowing the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney to question Kempton about unadjudicated offenses of assault and battery and malicious wounding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">It is well settled in Virginia that a litigant\u2019s right to impeach the credibility of adverse witnesses by showing their participation in criminal conduct has been confined to questions about a <em>conviction </em>for a felony, penury, and a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude. This limitation upon a defendant\u2019s impeachment rights is a reasonably necessary measure to restrict the scope of a criminal trial.... <em>[AJdmission of unadjudicated crimes for purposes of general impeachment of a witness would \u201clead to confusion in directing the jury\u2019s attention to collateral matters and away from the issues in the case.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\"><em>Ramdass v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 413, 423, 437 S.E.2d 566, 572 (1993) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 787, 790, 120 S.E.2d 270, 273 (1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">In the present case, the trial court erred by allowing the Commonwealth to question Kempton about the unadjudicated charges of assault and battery and malicious wounding. Kempton had not been tried on these offenses and, absent a felony conviction on the charges, they were inadmissible for impeachment purposes. <em>See Banks v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 959, 963, 434 S.E.2d 681, 683 (1993) (holding that evidence of specific acts of misconduct is generally not admissible to impeach a witness\u2019 credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Although we conclude that the Commonwealth\u2019s method of impeaching Kempton was improper, we hold that this error was also harmless. While originally not limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>this line of questioning, the trial court later directed the jury \u201cto disregard any statements [Kempton] made about the misdemeanor- conviction.\u201d The jury is presumed to have followed that curative instruction. <em>See LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 589, 304 S.E.2d 644, 657 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063, 104 S.Ct. 744, 79 L.Ed.2d 202 (1984). Moreover, based upon our review of the record, we cannot say as a matter of law that the evidence of Kempton\u2019s unadjudicated offenses affected the verdict. To the contrary, the evidence established that appellant sold drugs to Harber on July 9 and July 15, 1996. Radio transmissions of these \u201ccontrolled buys\u201d of cocaine were recorded and played for the jury. The Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt apart from the questions Kempton was asked on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">IV. TESTIMONY OF GIVENS AND STALLARD</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Special Agent Robert Givens, one of the officers who arranged and supervised Harber\u2019s controlled buys from appellant, testified on direct examination about the methods of using informants in drug cases. Givens explained at length how a \u201ctypical\u201d informant is recruited and used in \u201ccontrolled buys.\u201d Over appellant\u2019s objection, Givens was allowed to testify that informants are usually threatened or harassed by members of the drug community and that informants typically buy from individuals whom they have known and from whom they have purchased in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">On cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel asked Givens numerous questions regarding the typical informant, including the following: \u201cWould you agree that a typical informant is someone that can\u2019t be trusted?\u201d On redirect, Givens indicated that he had worked with a much worse confidential informant than Harber and had been satisfied with that informant\u2019s results.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Richard Stallard of the Big Stone Gap Police Department was also involved in the investigation of appellant. Stallard, working in an undercover capacity, drove Harber to the bar where Harber purchased cocaine from appellant. Over appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>lant\u2019s objection, Stallard testified that it is \u201ctypical\u201d for cocaine purchases to be short on quantity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in allowing into evidence the opinion testimony of Givens and Stallard, as the prejudice outweighed any probative value. Specifically, he argues that it was improper to allow the witnesses to testify about the \u201ctypical\u201d informant and the \u201ctypical\u201d drug purchase. Having solicited evidence of the same character on cross-examination, appellant is precluded from claiming that it was error for the Commonwealth to have introduced evidence of the same nature. <em>See Hubbard v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 1, 9, 413 S.E.2d 875, 879 (1992). \u201cThe Rule is that \u201cwhere an accused unsuccessfully objects to evidence which he considers improper and then on his own behalf introduces evidence of the same character, he thereby waives his objection, and we cannot reverse for the alleged error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 399, 401, 177 S.E.2d 637, 638 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">This is precisely what occurred here. Appellant attempted on cross-examination to expand what a \u201ctypical informant\u201d might do and to discredit the \u201ctypical informant\u201d by asking Givens about a person\u2019s \u201ctypical\u201d misdeeds and the difficulties officers might encounter working with him or her. Furthermore, appellant sought to impeach Harber by identifying him as \u201ca typical informant.\u201d We hold that appellant\u2019s line of questioning on cross-examination affirmatively waived any objection to the allegedly improper opinion testimony of the officers. <em>Cf. Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 66, 68, 147 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1966) (\u201c[T]he testimony was elicited ... during cross-examination by the defendant and he, therefore, can have no ground for complaint.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">V. BODY-WIRE TRANSMISSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Appellant next contends the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the tape-recorded conversations between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>appellant and Harber. The evidence established that Officer Stallard installed a wire transmitter on Harber to monitor the controlled buy on July 9, 1996. When Harber testified on direct examination and described his first drug transaction with appellant, the trial court allowed the Commonwealth to play the tape recording for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">On appeal, appellant contends that the use of the body-wire transmitter violated the Federal Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 301, and various provisions of Chapter 6 of the Virginia Code, entitled <em>Interception of Wire, Electronic or Oral Communications. </em>Accordingly, he argues, the tape-recorded evidence should have been excluded. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Under the exclusionary rule, \u201cevidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment cannot be used in a criminal proceeding against the victim of the illegal search and seizure.\u201d <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 347, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974). The rule\u2019s primary purpose is \u201cto deter future unlawful police conduct and thereby effectuate the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In Virginia, the rule does not apply for mere statutory violations. <em>See Horne v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 512, 518-19, 339 S.E.2d 186, 191 (1986); <em>Webber v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 549, 561, 496 S.E.2d 83, 88 (1998); <em>Alatishe v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 376, 379, 404 S.E.2d 81, 83 (1991).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">While violations of state procedural statutes are viewed with disfavor, ... neither the Virginia Supreme Court nor the legislature has adopted an exclusionary rule for such violations [ ] ... where no deprivation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights occurred. [Historically, searches or seizures made contrary to provisions contained in Virginia statutes provide no right of suppression unless the statute supplies that right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\"><em>Spivey v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 715, 723-24, 479 S.E.2d 543, 547 (1997) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">In the instant case, appellant does not allege that his constitutional rights were violated by the law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>agency\u2019s use of the body-wire transmitter. Even assuming that either a state or federal statutory violation occurred, which we do not decide, absent an express provision by the legislature that such evidence should be suppressed, the trial court did\u2019 not err in admitting the tape-recorded conversations between appellant and Harber. <em>See United States v. Oriakhi, </em>57 F.3d 1290, 1295 n. 1 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 952, 116 S.Ct. 400, 133 L.Ed.2d 319 (1995) (noting that \u201cit is not clear that the exclusionary rule would apply to a statutory violation if the searches were constitutionally permissible.\u201d); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>13 F.3d 100, 103 (4th Cir.1993) (\u201c[W]e do not think in any event that the appropriate remedy for [the violation of the statute] in this case would be suppression of the evidence obtained or reversal of the conviction.\u201d); <em>Lovelace v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 575, 585, 500 S.E.2d 267, 272 (1998) (holding that \u201cviolation of the statute would not require suppression of evidence obtained in contravention of its terms, absent express provision to the contrary by the legislature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">VI. APPELLANT\u2019S PRIOR CRIMINAL CONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">We reject appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of appellant\u2019s prior drug-related activity. While proof of \u201cother crimes\u201d is inadmissible to show a defendant\u2019s criminal disposition, such evidence is admissible \u201cif it <em>tends to prove </em>any relevant element of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Guill v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 134, 138, 495 S.E.2d 489, 491 (1998) (emphasis in original). \u201c \u2018Such evidence is permissive in cases where the motive, intent, or knowledge of the accused is involved, or where the evidence is <em>connected with </em>or <em>leads up to </em>the offense for which the accused is on trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pavlick v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 219, 226, 497 S.E.2d 920, 923 (1998) <em>(en banc) </em>(emphasis added) (quoting <em>Kirkpatrick v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 269, 272, 176 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1970)). In addressing the admissibility of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence, the court must also balance the probative value of the evidence of the other offenses and determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>whether it exceeds the prejudice to the accused. <em>See Guill, </em>255 Va. at 139, 495 S.E.2d at 491-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In the instant case, Harber testified that on July 9, 1996, the police gave him $165 for the first controlled buy to purchase a gram of cocaine from appellant for $140. When the parties met, appellant claimed Harber owed him $20 for a previous purchase. In describing the second controlled buy, Harber testified that four other individuals were present when appellant pulled out two bags of cocaine, cut the contents of them into four portions and sold one portion to Harber.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Harber\u2019s testimony that appellant insisted Harber owed money to appellant for a previous drug purchase and that other individuals were present at the second controlled buy to make drug purchases constituted evidence \u201cconnected with\u201d the offenses for which appellant was tried. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 519, 323 S.E.2d 572 (1984),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">[wjhere a course of criminal conduct is continuous and interwoven, consisting of a series of related crimes, the perpetrator has no right to have the evidence \u201csanitized\u201d so as to deny the jury knowledge of all but the immediate crime for which he is on trial. The fact-finder is entitled to all of the relevant and connected facts, including those which followed the commission of the crime on trial, as well as those which preceded it; even though they may show the defendant guilty of other offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 526-27, 323 S.E.2d at 577 (citations omitted). Thus, the probative value of the circumstances underlying the two controlled buys outweighed any incidental prejudice to appellant in the form of evidence that appellant may have been involved in other drug distributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">VII. OPINION TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Appellant next argues that \u201cthe trial court improperly allowed Harber to testify that [appellant] should plead guilty.\u201d A review of the trial transcript indicates that during the direct examination of Harber, the Commonwealth made no reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>to Harber\u2019s opinion of appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence. However, on cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel asked Harber the following question: \u201cIs it fair to say that you don\u2019t think that Mr. Newton should go to prison for something that you\u2019re not even sure he did, is that right?\u201d On redirect, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney questioned Harber about the tape-recorded conversation he had with appellant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">Q. Was there or was there not a discussion about the circumstances of the buys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">Q. Can you tell me whether or not you remember the details of the buy at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\"><em>% </em>s\u00a1: #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">Q. What opinion did you express at that time to [appellant\u2019s counsel] about whether or not the defendant was guilty or innocent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-11\">A. My exact reply, and this I can recall, was that I think the best thing that he could do was just plead guilty, because he would probably get less time, because if they found him guilty, they were going to try to put him away.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">Over appellant\u2019s objection, the trial court allowed this testimony into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">Because appellant opened the door to this line of questioning, the trial court did not err in overruling appellant\u2019s objection to Harber\u2019s opinion testimony. <em>See Satcher v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 220, 252, 421 S.E.2d 821, 840 (1992) (allowing the Commonwealth to present contradictory testimony because the defense \u201copened the door\u201d); <em>see also Kirk v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 291, 298, 464 S.E.2d 162, 165-66 (1995) (\u201cJustice does not require exclusion of evidence that is probative of the central issue on trial and that the accused himself chooses to interject.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>VIII. JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Appellant next contends the trial court improperly instructed the jury. We disagree. A reviewing court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is \u201cto see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u201d <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">During cross-examination of Harber, appellant\u2019s counsel established that Harber had used illegal drugs on numerous occasions in the past. Counsel also questioned Harber about immunity from prosecution for these past drug offenses. At that time, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney argued that the law did not grant Harber immunity for all offenses he mentioned on cross-examination and that the trial court should so inform the jury. The trial judge agreed and at the conclusion of the evidence the trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s Instruction No. 11, which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">The Court instructs the jury that the only offenses which Terry Harber is entitled to be immune from prosecution are the drug offenses for which Paul Ed Newton is being prosecuted. Terry Harber is not entitled to immunity for any other drug offenses which he may have testified to on cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">We reject appellant\u2019s argument that this instruction improperly advised the jury of the law. To the contrary, Instruction No. 11 correctly and clearly stated the law regarding Harber\u2019s immunity from prosecution, as codified in Code \u00a7 18.2-262. That section provides in pertinent part that \u201cthe testimony given and evidence so produced by such person on behalf of the Commonwealth ... shall be in no ease used against him nor shall he be prosecuted as to the offense as to which he testifies.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>This statute creates two types of immunity. The first type is so-called \u201cuse\u201d immunity, which applies to all crimes, and stems from the clause, \u201cshall be in no case used against him.\u201d The second type is immunity from prosecution, or so called \u201ctransactional\u201d immunity, which applies only to \u201cthe offense as to which he testifies.\u201d Use immunity prevents a witness\u2019s compelled testimony from being used in any way in a criminal prosecution of the witness, while transactional immunity prevents a witness from being prosecuted for the offense about which he testifies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><em>Caldwell v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 86, 88-89, 379 S.E.2d 368, 369-70 (1989) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In the instant case, Harber was not compelled by the Commonwealth to testify about any other drug offenses he may have committed on previous occasions. Instead, this evidence was established during appellant\u2019s cross-examination of Harber. As we noted in <em>Caldwell, </em>\u201c[i]t is illogical to conclude that the General Assembly intended to provide immunity for any crime about which a person may at any time testify even if he was not compelled to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89, 379 S.E.2d at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">By delineating the offenses for which Harber was entitled to be immune from prosecution, Instruction No. 11 addressed the extent of his <em>transactional immunity. </em>Under Code \u00a7 18.2-262, it is clear that Harber was entitled to immunity from prosecution only on the drug offenses for which appellant was charged and for which Harber testified at the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>wealth\u2019s request. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The second instruction objected to by appellant was Instruction No. 13, which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">The Court instructs the jury that a report of analysis duly attested by the person performing such analysis or examination in any laboratory operated by the Division of Forensic Science shall be prima facie evidence as to the custody of . the material described therein from the time such material is received by an authorized agent of such laboratory until such material is released subsequent to such analysis or examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Appellant contends this instruction \u201csingled out for emphasis one part of the evidence.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u201cWhen a trial judge instructs the jury in the law, he or she may not \u2018single out for emphasis a part of the evidence tending to establish a particular fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Terry v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 167, 170, 360 S.E.2d 880, 882 (1987) (quoting <em>Woods v. Commonwealth, </em>171 Va. 543, 548, 199 S.E. 465, 467 (1938)). \u201cOn the other hand, instructions should relate to the specific evidence of the case; abstract propositions of law do little to help and much to much mystify a jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170-71, 360 S.E.2d at 882 (citing <em>Gordon v. Director General, </em>128 Va. 426, 433, 104 S.E. 796, 798 (1920)).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Here, the Commonwealth presented testimony through lab technicians to show that the powder appellant sold Harber was cocaine. On cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel questioned one of the lab technicians about other individuals in the lab who handled the cocaine but who were not present to testify. Appellant\u2019s counsel questioned another lab technician about who might have had access to the cocaine when it was in his drawer at the lab.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">While Instruction No. 13 referred to certain evidence, it did not suggest that specific evidence compelled any particular finding and it did not comment upon specific facts proven in the case. Rather, the instruction informed the jury of the correct law regarding the chain of custody of evidence submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ted to the Division of Forensic Science. The jury was free to draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence without any undue suggestion in the jury instruction as to the conclusion. <em>See id. </em>at 171, 360 S.E.2d at 882. Therefore, we hold that Instruction No. 13 did not impermissibly highlight a portion of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">IX. TRIAL JUDGE\u2019S COMMENTS TO JURY FOREPERSON</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">During trial, appellant elicited testimony from various Drug Task Force members that appellant had previously provided information about problems in the Lee County Sheriffs Office. This information was contained in a written debrief. Appellant attempted to show that he was targeted by the Lee County Sheriffs Office in retaliation for his statements in the debrief. Although the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney attempted to introduce the entire debrief, the trial court held that other information in the written statement was not relevant to the instant charges and that the information was too prejudicial to appellant. Thus, the debrief was not admitted as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">During jury deliberations, the jury foreperson asked the court for a copy of the written debrief. The trial judge responded, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, tell them that I overruled allowing the introduction of the debrief because I thought it would be too prejudicial to the defendant, and it\u2019s not available.\u201d The juror returned to the jury room and at that time, appellant objected and moved for a mistrial, which was denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">We do not reach the merits of appellant\u2019s argument because the issue is barred by Rule 5A:18. The holding in <em>Quesinberry v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 364, 402 S.E.2d 218, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 834, 112 S.Ct. 113, 116 L.Ed.2d 82 (1991), is dispositive. Addressing a similar scenario, the Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">After the jury had retired to deliberate and fix punishment, the jury returned and requested that the court define <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the following words which appeared in some of the jury instructions: culpable, moral turpitude, quantitatively, and qualitatively. The court, without objection from counsel, read the definitions to the jury. After the jury had returned to the jury room to continue its deliberations, Quesinberry then objected to the definitions given by the court. Quesinberry failed to preserve his objection because he did not object timely and his argument is procedurally barred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI-U\"><em>Id. </em>at 380, 402 S.E.2d at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In the instant case, the trial court, without a contemporaneous objection from counsel, told the jury foreperson that the written debrief was not entered into evidence because of its prejudicial nature. It was not until after the foreperson returned to the jury room to continue deliberations that counsel then objected to the trial court\u2019s statement. Appellant failed to preserve his objection because he did not object timely. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we find no reversible error and affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">. The parties dispute the occurrence of the events that led to Harber\u2019s interview.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney alleged that appellant\u2019s counsel called Harber to ask about certain details of the controlled buys involving appellant. At some point after the telephone conversation, an individual named Dale Kempton contacted Harber and \"applied some pressure on the informant to change his story and say he didn\u2019t remember.\" Thereafter, Kempton brought Harber to counsel\u2019s office where he was interviewed on tape, and Harber was asked to sign the affidavit. Although he was reluctant to do so, Harber eventually signed the document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">According to appellant\u2019s counsel, he called Harber to inquire about the controlled buys. Harber allegedly told counsel that appellant should plead guilty because \u201cit\u2019ll save me from having to go to testify.\u201d Sometime thereafter, Harber appeared in counsel\u2019s office because he had some information that was \"going to be of benefit to [appellant].\u201d Counsel taped the conversation because he did not want to be a witness if the information later turned out to be useful. Harber left the office and later returned to review the tape. At that point, an affidavit was prepared and signed by Harber.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\">. The Commonwealth\u2019s right to discovery is governed by Rule 3A:11(c). That subsection provides that if the court grants discovery to the accused, then upon motion the Commonwealth is entitled to the following: (1) written reports of autopsy examinations, ballistic tests, fingerprint, blood, urine and breath analysis, and other scientific evidence that the accused intends to offer into evidence at trial; (2) a statement indicating whether the accused intends to introduce evidence of an alibi; and (3) if the accused intends to rely upon the defense of insanity or feeblemindedness, written reports of physical or mental examinations of the accused. There is no other provision for discovery by the Commonwealth in a criminal matter.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">Here, counsel for appellant contemplated using the Harber statement during the cross-examination of the witness and this prior inconsistent writing is not covered by Rule 3A:11(c).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b487-6\">. The trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\"><em>I don\u2019t know what this particular witness is going to testify to, </em>but I don\u2019t think anybody should be put in the position where they\u2019re unmindful, or have some idea of what the evidence is going to be. What he told you may be a correct statement of facts, what he has previously said or done, and you taped it, you\u2019ve gotten it, and I think the Commonwealth is entitled to see what it is, and that is my ruling on the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b490-7\">. The Commonwealth mistakenly relies on <em>Johnson, </em>224 Va. 525, 298 S.E.2d 99, for the proposition that the distribution of drugs is a crime of moral turpitude. In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK4\">[Defendant\u2019s] prior convictions involved grand larceny, statutory burglary, distribution of drugs, and possession of drugs with intent to distribute. <em>Not only were they crimes of moral turpitude, </em>but their nature was so similar to the crime about which he testified that the jury might have concluded, if the offenses had been named, that he was especially susceptible to the hope of favor if he cooperated or to the fear of severe punishment as an habitual criminal if he did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah3\"><em>Id. </em>at 529, 298 S.E.2d at 101-02 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">While the Court indicated that the enumerated felonies may involve moral turpitude, it is clear from the language of <em>Johnson </em>that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>pure dictum. The Court was not formally addressing whether the crime of misdemeanor distribution of drugs is a crime of moral turpitude, <em>i.e., </em>one involving lying, cheating or stealing, but rather was discussing prior felonies of the defendant in that case.
