Husband challenges the jurisdiction of the court, arguing that the matters in issue were within the exclusive province of the Chesterfield Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (J <em>&amp; </em>D Court).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree and reverse the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The procedural history of this appeal is substantially uncontroverted. Wife petitioned the J &amp; D Court for an award of support from husband for the parties\u2019 two infant children. Following a hearing, the J &amp; D Court ordered husband to pay $109 per week support and a portion of the children\u2019s medical costs unpaid by insurance. The order, entered October 6, 1993, further provided that husband\u2019s obligations would escalate on November 1, 1993, to $128 per week support and forty percent of the specified medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Husband appealed the J &amp; D Court order to the trial court and a <em>de novo </em>hearing was conducted on February 17, 1994. Husband failed to appear but was represented by counsel. By order entered February 28,1994, the court \u201cdenied\u201d husband\u2019s appeal, ruled that he was \u201cin arrears ... a total ... of $2,951.18\u201d under the award of the J &amp; D Court, and assessed additional attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court further ordered \u201call sums due\u201d payable ten days after service of the order upon husband or \u201ca warrant for [husband\u2019s] arrest shall be issued.\u201d The trial court later revisited the proceeding, <em>sua sponte, </em>by order dated September 29,1994, and \u201cremanded\u201d the cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>the J <em>&amp; </em>D Court, after expressly finding \u201cthe purpose of this matter having been accomplished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The record is thereafter silent until June 2, 1997, when wife filed motions with the trial court to \u201creinstate this matter on the docket\u201d and to modify the earlier support order of the J <em>&amp; </em>D Court. Wife also alleged husband\u2019s noncompliance with the trial court order of February, 1994, and petitioned, <em>inter alia, </em>that he be punished for contempt. In response, the court ordered \u201cthis matter ... reinstated on the active docket\u201d and that husband appear \u201con July 25,1997, to show cause ... why he should not be held in contempt for the alleged failure to comply with [the] ... prior order.\u201d Husband was present, <em>pro se, </em>at the appointed date and hour, evidence was heard <em>ore tenus, </em>and, by order of August 1, 1997, the court adjudicated him in contempt of the February order, required that he pay wife arrearages of $9,306.64 \u201cwithin 180 days,\u201d and sentenced him to twelve months in jail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court also <em>increased </em>husband\u2019s child support and health care obligations and awarded wife attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Thereafter, husband, by counsel, moved to vacate the order, arguing that the court had \u201cterminated [its] ... jurisdiction ... over the ... dispute\u201d upon remand to the J &amp; D Court by order entered September 29, 1994. In denying husband\u2019s motion, the court concluded that, \u201c[a]fter remand[, it] had concurrent jurisdiction with the [J &amp; D Court] to enforce [the] court\u2019s order of February 28, 1994,\u201d thereby providing wife with \u201cthe option to go to either court.\u201d Husband now appeals, pursuing the jurisdictional issue before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A), unless otherwise \u201cprovided,\u201d vests \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction\u201d in the juvenile and domestic relations district courts (J &amp; D courts) \u201cover all cases, matters and proceedings involving: A. The ... support ... of a child: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>... 3.[w]hose ... support is a subject of controversy or requires determination.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3). However, \u201c[i]n such cases[,] jurisdiction shall be concurrent with and not exclusive of courts having equity jurisdiction, <em>except </em>as provided in [Code] \u00a7 16.1-244.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Code \u00a7 16.1-244(A) empowers the circuit court, concurrently with the J &amp; D courts, \u201cto determine the ... support of children when ... incidental to the determination of causes pending in such [circuit] courts.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-244(A). An exception divests J &amp; D courts of jurisdiction if \u201ca suit for divorce has been filed in a circuit court, in which the ... support of children of the parties ... is raised by the pleadings and a hearing is set by the ... court ... on such issue for a date ... within twenty-one days of the filing.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>Code \u00a7 20-79(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u201c[C]ircuit courts may assume jurisdiction [of child support issues] either by an appeal from the [J &amp; D] courts or by the direct filing of an appropriate proceeding in the circuit courts.\u201d <em>Peple v. Peple, </em>5 Va.App. 414, 418, 364 S.E.2d 232, 235 (1988); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-296; Title 20. When, as here, jurisdiction is invoked by appeal from a child support order of the J &amp; D court, the attendant \u201cproceedings in the circuit court shall conform to the equity practice where evidence is heard <em>ore terms,\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-296(F), and \u201cshall be heard <em>de novo </em>[,] ... without formal pleadings in writing.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-136; <em>see Peple, </em>5 Va.App. at 419, 364 S.E.2d at 236 (\u201ccircuit court must conduct a <em>de novo </em>hearing ... on appeal from the [J &amp; D] courts\u201d). Such appeal \u201c \u2018annuls the judgment of the- inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peple, </em>5 Va.App. at 419, 364 S.E.2d at 236 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u201cUpon the rendition of final judgment upon an appeal from the [J &amp; D] court, the circuit court shall cause a copy of its judgment to be filed with the [J <em>&amp; </em>D] court within twenty-one days of entry of its order, which shall thereupon become the judgment of the [J &amp; D] court.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-297. Additionally,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the circuit court may remand [the proceedings] to the jurisdiction of the [J <em>&amp; </em>D] court ..., under the terms of its order or judgment, and thereafter such ... shall be and remain under the jurisdiction of the [J &amp; D] court in the same manner as if such court had rendered the judgment in the first instances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, upon remand of a judgment rendered on appeal, the former jurisdiction of the J &amp; D court over the proceedings is restored, once again subject to the potential exercise of jurisdiction by the circuit court in accordance with Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-241,16.1-244 and 16.1-296.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Similarly, jurisdiction lost by the J &amp; D court to the circuit court \u201c[i]n any suit for divorce\u201d may be resumed by \u201ctransfer to the [J &amp; D] court\u201d by the circuit court for \u201cenforcement of its orders\u201d or \u201c[a]fter the entry of a decree of divorce\u201d for \u201cany other matters pertaining to support\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-79(c). Thereafter, both courts enjoy concurrent jurisdiction to adjudicate such issues, with the circuit court exercising \u201cits continuing jurisdiction\u201d by simply \u201creinstatfing] the case on its docket.\u201d <em>Crabtree v. Crabtree, </em>17 Va.App. 81, 84, 435 S.E.2d 883, 886 (1993); <em>see Romine v. Romine, </em>22 Va.App. 760, 763-64, 473 S.E.2d 99, 101 (1996); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 20-121.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Nevertheless, \u201cthe procedural distinction between an appeal under Code \u00a7 16.1-136 and a divestiture of .further jurisdiction in the [J <em>&amp; </em>D] court by operation of Code \u00a7 16.1-244(A) [(institution of divorce proceedings)] is significant.\u201d <em>Peple, </em>5 Va.App. at 419-20, 364 S.E.2d at 236. A decree or order of the circuit court emanating from a \u201csuit for divorce,\u201d after displacing the jurisdiction of the J <em>&amp; </em>D court, may be transferred to such court for enforcement or related matters, thereby restoring concurrent jurisdiction in both courts, without impairing the properly invoked exercise of jurisdiction by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the circuit court over the transferred issues. In contrast, an order adjudicating an appeal from the J &amp; D court to the circuit court is not entitled to the procedural convenience of transfer provided by Code \u00a7 20-79. Such order, together with the related issues embraced by the appeal, rests within the exclusive jurisdiction of the circuit court pending disposition by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Here, upon resolution of the appeal, the circuit court declared its \u201cpurpose ... accomplished\u201d and \u201cremanded\u201d the \u201cmatter\u201d to the Chesterfield J &amp; D Court, thereby expressly surrendering jurisdiction to the original statutory authority of the J &amp; D Court pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-297. Unaided by Code \u00a7 20-79, such \u201cremand\u201d created no concurrent jurisdiction in the circuit court, save that provided by Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-241,16.1-244, and precluded reinstatement of the cause to the docket of the trial court as a decree or order related to divorce or maintenance in accordance with Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79(c), 20-121.1. Thus, the trial court\u2019s belated attempt to exercise concurrent jurisdiction through the disputed order was without statutory authority and jurisdictionally infirm. <em>See Church v. Church, </em>24 Va.App. 502, 505, 483 S.E.2d 498, 500 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\">.
