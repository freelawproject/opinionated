On appeal, he contends the trial court erroneously (1) denied his motion to suppress the cocaine, altered U.S. banknote, and his statements, (2) admitted the certificate of analysis into evidence in the absence of a sufficient showing of chain of custody and (3), held the evidence, in the absence of the certificate of analysis, was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of cocaine. For the reasons that follow, we hold the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress, and we reverse appellant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">On October 31, 1996, at about 3:45 p.m., Officer R.D. Lowery of the Petersburg Police Department participated in the execution of a search warrant for a residence at 125 McKeever Street in Petersburg, which was described as the right half of a duplex. The warrant described the items to be seized as \u201ccocaine, books, money, records, scales, any other paraphernalia used and/or distribution of cocaine in the support and sale of cocaine.\u201d Lowery confirmed that the target of the search was \u201c[c]ocaine inside the residence.\u201d The warrant did not \u201cidentify the name of any [specific] person to be searched\u201d and did not \u201cmention ... that any persons [in general] [were] to be searched.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The accompanying affidavit indicated that an informant made a controlled purchase of cocaine \u201cfrom the subjects at [the] residence\u201d and that cocaine was \u201cstill present\u201d when the informant left the residence. The affidavit did not indicate when the purchase was made, and it did not describe any of the people present except to say that \u201cone [was] the resident.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lowery did not know who owned the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">When Lowery arrived at the residence with the entry team, appellant was sitting on the porch of the duplex on a couch located directly beside the entrance to number 125 and beneath its front window. Lowery described the porch as running the length of the front of the duplex with a set of steps on either end. Lowery did not know appellant and did not know, other than by appellant\u2019s presence, whether appellant had any connection to the residence to be searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Lowery \u201cordered appellant to the ground at gunpoint ... [and] handcuffed him for safety reasons\u201d until the rest of the entry team could secure the inside of the residence. Lowery had observed appellant as Lowery exited the police van and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>approached the porch and had not seen appellant engage in any suspicious behavior. Lowery testified, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much standard policy when we go into a residence here in the City everybody goes down, everybody gets cuffed and patted down just for weapons for safety reasons.\u201d Lowery further explained that \u201cwhen you\u2019re dealing with a search warrant ..., especially with narcotics, you always have the possibility of guns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">After Lowery handcuffed appellant, he watched the window as the entry team went in and began to secure the inside of the residence. The entry team consisted of \u201capproximately 10 or 11\u201d police officers, with Officer Lowery stationed at the front door, \u201csomebody on the back door,\u201d and the rest of the officers inside to secure the premises and conduct the search. The officers found three people inside the residence. Lowery testified that he did not know for sure when the residence was \u201csecure,\u201d but that with \u201c[t]hat many [officers] on the inside,\u201d he was \u201cpretty sure it was secure\u201d and did not wait for confirmation before he stood appellant up and advised that \u201c[he] was going to pat [appellant] down for weapons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Regarding the pat-down, Lowery first testified, \u201cI hit an item, once. I squeezed it once and I come off of it, it was in my mind to be cocaine. I asked [appellant] what it was, he made no statement.\u201d In clarifying the circumstances surrounding his discovery, Lowery testified that while patting appellant\u2019s shirt pocket with an open palm, he felt \u201ca lump\u201d and \u201csuspected [appellant] had something in his pocket.\u201d Lowery explained further, \u201cI felt something in his pocket, [and] to verify what it was, to make sure I wasn\u2019t missing anything, I squeezed it once and I came right off of it.\u201d Lowery then said, \u201cI came off of it because I knew what it was. It was pretty obvious [that it was cocaine].\u201d Lowery then retrieved the item, which he described as \u201cnine zips of crack cocaine.\u201d Lowery did not testify that he believed the lump could have been a weapon before he squeezed it, and he never clearly testified that he believed the lump to be cocaine before he squeezed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Upon finding the suspected cocaine, Lowery advised appellant he was under arrest and <em>Mirandized </em>him. Appellant said, \u201cit was for personal use, it was for himself, he wasn\u2019t selling it.\u201d In a search incident to arrest, Lowery found a pager and $11, including a dollar bill which someone had altered to look like a five-dollar bill by taping photocopied corners of a five dollar bill onto the four comers of the dollar bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Appellant moved to suppress on the ground that the frisk violated the Fourth Amendment. Appellant contended that the warrant, which was silent regarding the right to search people on the premises, did not authorize Lowery to frisk him and that Lowery had no reasonable, articulable suspicion that he was armed and dangerous in order to justify a frisk. Appellant also contended that even if the frisk for weapons was appropriate, Lowery had no basis for believing he had found a weapon when he felt the lump in appellant\u2019s pocket and, therefore, was not permitted to manipulate the item to determine what it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The trial court said it did not \u201chave any problem\u201d with the \u201cplain feel\u201d seizure of the cocaine, stating that \u201c[t]he officer is trained in this sort of thing, when he feels it and he\u2019s pretty sure what it is, and he squeezed it to confirm it, he had sufficient cause to make that.\u201d However, it stated expressly, \u201cI\u2019m not making a finding at this point\u201d and gave the parties an opportunity to file memoranda on those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">At the time scheduled for sentencing, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">I\u2019m going to overrule the motion [to suppress because] although the [appellant] was not in the house that was scheduled to be searched, he was on the couch on the front porch. He could easily have been a lookout for the people inside. And therefore there\u2019s a threat of a danger that did exist and is sufficient to establish probable cause for a search____ Further[,] danger existed and the probable cause existed because the magistrate had issued the search warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">At a hearing on a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the Commonwealth has the burden of proving that a warrantless search or seizure did not violate the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>See Simmons v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 200, 204, 380 S.E.2d 656, 659 (1989); <em>Alexander v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 671, 674, 454 S.E.2d 39, 41 (1995). On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly dedueible therefrom. See <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). \u201c[W]e are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them[,] and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1659, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). However, we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards such as probable cause and reasonable suspicion to the particular facts of the case. <em>See Shears v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 394, 398, 477 S.E.2d 309, 311 (1996); <em>see also Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 699, 116 S.Ct. at 1659.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Appellant contends Officer Lowery\u2019s detention and search of his person pursuant to the authority of the search warrant for the duplex was unreasonable under the United States and Virginia Constitutions. The Commonwealth argues that the detention was justified as a frisk for safety reasons and that appellant\u2019s presence on the porch of the residence for which other officers were executing a search warrant for narcotics provided reasonable suspicion that appellant was engaged in criminal activity. The trial court ruled that the probable cause which provided the basis ,for issuance of the warrant to search the premises for narcotics and the associated \u201cthreat of ... danger\u201d provided \u201cprobable cause for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>a search\u201d of appellant. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the search was unlawful under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">' A.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">PROBABLE CAUSE TO SEARCH APPELLANT\u2019S PERSON</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">We hold first that neither the issuance of the search warrant nor the risk of danger to the officers during its execution provided Officer Lowery with probable cause to conduct a full search of appellant under the facts of this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are unaware of any controlling precedent which provides that a warrant to search only a specified private residence, and not the people found therein, for narcotics automatically carries with it the blanket authority to conduct full searches of those people present either for narcotics or weapons.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>more, we conclude that such a holding would be contrary to existing constitutional precedent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-7\"><em>See also </em>Va. Const, art. 1, \u00a7 10. Based on these provisions, the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Ybarra v. Illinois, </em>444 U.S. 85, 100 S.Ct. 338, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 (1979), that \u201ca warrant to search a place cannot normally be construed to authorize a search of each individual in that place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92 n. 4, 100 S.Ct. at 342 n. 4 (expressly not considering \u201csituations where the warrant itself authorizes the search of unnamed persons in a place and is supported by probable cause to believe that persons who will be in the place at the time of the search will be in possession of illegal drugs\u201d). <em>Compare Morton v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 946, 434 S.E.2d 890 (1993) (upholding conviction of person searched under warrant for apartment where warrant authorized search of \u201call persons present\u201d and was supported by affidavit regarding drug trans- \u2022 actions from reliable informant, apartment manager, and po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>lice surveillance establishing presence of cocaine, convicted drug dealers and known fugitives in apartment).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Although <em>Ybarra </em>involved a search warrant for a public bar rather than a private residence, we nevertheless find the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ybarra </em>instructive. The Court further observed in <em>Ybarra </em>that \u201ca person\u2019s mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not, without more, give rise to probable cause to search that person.\u201d <em>Ybarra, </em>444 U.S. at 85, 100 S.Ct. at 338.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">Where the standard is probable cause, a search or seizure of a person must be supported by probable cause <em>particularized with respect to that person. </em>This requirement cannot be undercut or avoided by simply pointing to the fact that coincidentally there exists probable cause to search or seize another or to search the premises where the person may happen to be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 91, 100 S.Ct. at 342 (emphasis added). Although one\u2019s presence at a private residence in which drugs have been sold provides a stronger nexus between the person and the premises than does presence in a public bar in which drugs have been sold, <em>see </em>2 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 4.9(e), at 633-34 (3d ed.1996), we do not believe that such a nexus is sufficient, without more, to provide probable cause for personal searches of those present in the absence of a prior judicial determination of probable cause for the search of the people as well as the premises. <em>Cf. Wyoming v. Houghton, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 119 S.Ct. 1297, 1302, 143 L.Ed.2d 408 (1999) (recognizing that \u201ca car passenger ... will often be engaged in a common enterprise with the driver, and have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing\u201d such that officers with probable cause to search a vehicle may search containers therein, even those allegedly belonging to a passenger, which are capable of concealing the items sought, but nevertheless may not conduct body search of passenger).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">\u201cAs a general rule, \u2018subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions,\u2019 warrantless searches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>are presumptively unreasonable\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Farmer v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 111, 115, 462 S.E.2d 564, 565 (1995) (quoting <em>Horton v. California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 133 &amp; n. 4, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 2306 &amp; n. 4, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990)). The most commonly used exception for searching a person without a search warrant is that the search was conducted incident to a lawful custodial arrest, which, of course, must be based on probable cause to believe the individual arrested has committed a crime. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 235-36, 94 S.Ct. 467, 477, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973); <em>see also </em>2 LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.5(e), at 543-44 (noting that \u201c[i]f there is probable cause to believe that a certain individual has on his person the evidence, fruits, or instrumentalities of crime, it would be an unusual case in which there was not also probable cause to believe that this individual was a participant in the criminal activity under investigation\u201d such that \u201cthe more usual procedure is simply to arrest that person and then search him incident to arrest\u201d rather than first obtaining a search warrant for his person). Other exigent \u201ccircumstances that will justify a warrantless search include danger to the officer<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> [and] ... the risk of loss or destruction of evidence.\u201d <em>Helms v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 368, 371, 392 S.E.2d 496, 497 (1990) (footnote added).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In determining whether Officer Lowery had <em>probable cause </em>to believe that one of these exceptions existed, thereby justifying a full search of appellant, we are guided by the holding of this Court in <em>Helms, </em>10 Va.App. 368, 392 S.E.2d 496. In <em>Helms, </em>we held, under similar facts, that officers executing a search warrant for a private residence lacked probable cause to search a container<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> found during a weapons frisk of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>person present at the residence. <em>See id. </em>In that case, a confidential informant told police that PCP was being sold at a particular house and made a controlled purchase of PCP from that address. <em>See id. </em>at 369, 392 S.E.2d at 496. The officers then obtained a warrant which authorized a search of the premises for PCP, but neither Helms nor anyone else was described in the search warrant or supporting affidavit. <em>See id. </em>at 369, 372 &amp; n. 1, 392 S.E.2d at 496, 498 &amp; n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">When police arrived to execute the search warrant and encountered Helms a few feet inside the front door, \u201c[h]e did not act suspicious and was cooperative when confronted, ordered to he down and submit to a personal search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369, 392 S.E.2d at 496. The search yielded a film canister, a small pipe and some keys. <em>See id. </em>The officer seized the items and, suspecting the canister contained PCP or some other illegal drug, he opened the canister and found that it contained what he believed, based on his experience, to be parsley laced with PCP. <em>See id. </em>at 369-70, 392 S.E.2d at 496-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Helms conceded on appeal that safety reasons justified a frisk of his person and even the removal of the items from his pocket, but contended that the officer, who admitted he knew the canister did not contain a weapon, lacked probable cause to arrest Helms or to examine the canister\u2019s contents without a search warrant. <em>See id.; see also id. </em>at 373, 392 S.E.2d at 498-99 (Coleman, J., dissenting) (agreeing that Helms conceded legality of frisk for weapons and \u201cagreeing] with the majority that the question [on appeal] is whether probable cause existed under these circumstances for [officer] reasonably and objectively to believe that the film canister contained PCP or some illicit drug\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">We agreed and reversed Helms\u2019 conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We held that none of the exceptions to the warrant requirement \u2014 \u201cdanger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>to the officer, search incident to a lawful arrest, or the risk of loss or destruction of evidence\u201d \u2014 was present in Helms\u2019 case. <em>See </em>10 Va.App. at 371, 392 S.E.2d at 497. We emphasized that \u201c[Helms] cooperated totally, offering no resistance\u201d and that, \u201c[e]xcept for being on the premises, there [was] no showing of [Helms\u2019] association with any person who was the object of the police investigation, nor was any person named or described in the search warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372, 392 S.E.2d at 498. Under those facts, we held that the record \u201cdisclose[d] no legally cognizable reason for the warrantless search of the film canister\u201d and that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">In appellant\u2019s case, as in <em>Helms, </em>the search warrant was for a private residence in which narcotics were being sold, but neither the warrant nor the accompanying affidavit named or described a person or people to be searched during the search of the premises. Further, here as in <em>Helms, </em>Officer Lowery did not know who appellant was, and no evidence other than appellant\u2019s mere presence on the porch linked him to the premises. Finally, here as in <em>Helms, </em>appellant was cooperative and engaged in no suspicious or furtive behavior giving rise to the belief that he might be attempting to conceal contraband sought in the warrant or reaching for a weapon with which to challenge the officers. Therefore, here as in <em>Helms, </em>the officers lacked the probable cause necessary to conduct a full search of appellant. <em>See generally </em>2 LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.9(c) (discussing factors involved in determining whether person not arrested or described in a premises search warrant may be searched for items described in warrant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>noting that \u201cthe requisite probable cause is most likely to be deemed present if the person lives at the place searched, was implicated by the search warrant affidavit in the crimes under investigation, had engaged in suspicious or incriminating conduct, or was found in immediate proximity to contraband in open view\u201d (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">DETENTION AND FRISK FOR WEAPONS</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">In the absence of probable cause to search appellant incident to execution of the search warrant for the premises, the Commonwealth argues that Officer Lowery\u2019s actions constituted a justifiable detention and frisk for weapons. \u201c[A] warrant for contraband founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.\u201d <em>Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 705, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 2595, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981) (involving warrant to search private residence). We assume without deciding that, pursuant to execution of the search warrant for the premises, Officer Lowery was entitled to conclude that appellant was an occupant subject to detention and to frisk appellant for weapons. Despite these assumptions, we nevertheless conclude that Lowery\u2019s actions exceeded the permissible scope of such a frisk.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized that principles which permit an officer to seize contraband found in plain view under certain circumstances also may permit an officer to seize contraband detected by the sense of touch during a weapons frisk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">If a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect\u2019s outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity <em>immediately apparent, </em>there has been no invasion of the suspect\u2019s privacy beyond that already authorized by the officer\u2019s search for weapons; if the object is contraband, its warrantless seizure would be justified by the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>practical considerations that inhere in the plain view context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 375-76, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 2137, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993) (emphasis added). The Court has made clear, however, that where the character of the item detected is not immediately apparent and the officer makes \u201cno claim that he suspected [the] object to be a weapon,\u201d he may not investigate further. <em>See id. </em>at 377-78, 113 S.Ct. at 2138-39. The officer may not engage in \u201csqueezing,\u201d \u201csliding\u201d or \u201cotherwise manipulating\u201d the item once he has concluded it is not a weapon because such \u201cexploration ... [is] unrelated to \u2018[t]he sole justification of the search [under <em>Terry: </em>] ... the protection of the police officer and others nearby.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378, 113 S.Ct. at 2138-39 (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 29, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1884, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)); <em>see id. </em>at 378, 113 S.Ct. at 2139 (analogizing to plain view case of <em>Arizona v. Hicks, </em>480 U.S. 321, 107 S.Ct. 1149, 94 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987), in which Court held stolen stereo not properly seized under plain view doctrine because officers had to move stereo to see serial numbers which allowed them to conclude item was stolen).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Here, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below, Officer Lowery testified that while patting appellant\u2019s shirt pocket with an open palm, he felt \u201ca lump\u201d and \u201csuspected [appellant] had <em>something </em>in his pocket.\u201d (Emphasis added). Lowery did not testify that he believed the item to be a weapon nor did he testify that the character of the lump was immediately apparent to him after patting it with an open hand. Rather, he testified that he \u201csqueezed\u201d the lump and \u201ccame off of it because [he] knew what it was\u201d <em>after squeezing it. </em>Because the evidence does not support a finding that the character of the item was immediately apparent to Lowery during the permissible scope of the frisk, he was not permitted to investigate further.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we are unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>conclude that the Commonwealth carried its burden of proving the frisk and resulting seizure of the cocaine under the plain feel doctrine did not violate appellant\u2019s rights. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in failing to exclude the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Because Officer Lowery\u2019s discovery of the cocaine led to his arrest of appellant and the incident search revealing the altered one-dollar bill which provided the basis for appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of forged United States currency, both of appellant\u2019s convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-13\">. Because we hold that the cocaine was improperly seized, we do not reach the issues of the admissibility of the certificate of analysis or the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-10\">. On appeal, appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the warrant or affidavit to support the search of the residence itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\">. Had the evidence proven that the search of the residence yielded cocaine and that the police fully searched appellant only afterward, the discovery may have been proper as a search incident to arrest for possession of the contraband found on the premises, regardless of whether the presence of the contraband found on the premises would have been sufficient to support a conviction for its possession. <em>See Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 695 &amp; n. 3, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 2590 &amp; n. 3, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981). In appellant\u2019s case, the Commonwealth did not advance the argument that the search was valid as incident to arrest based on narcotics found in the residence. Further, when appellant attempted to elicit testimony from Officer Lowery regarding what was found in the search of the residence, the trial court ruled that this evidence was irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b695-9\">. The United States Supreme Court has expressly avoided such a question. <em>See Summers, </em>452 U.S. at 695, 705, 101 S.Ct. at 2590, 2595 (holding \"that a warrant to search for contraband founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted\u201d based in part on fact that \"execution of a search warrant for narcotics is the kind of transaction that may give rise to sudden violence or frantic efforts to conceal or destroy evidence\u201d but expressly avoiding \u201cquestion whether a search warrant for [private] premises includes the right to search persons found there\u201d (footnote omitted)); <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 53, 59, 67, 354 S.E.2d 79, 82, 87 (1987) (holding, based on language in <em>Summers </em>regarding connection between narcotics and violence, that officers had reasonable suspicion that Williams was armed and dangerous necessary to justify weapons frisk based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>warrant to search Williams\u2019 residence for narcotics and accompanying affidavit containing specific information that Williams himself was engaged in distributing narcotics from the place to be searched).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\">. In a slightly different context, the United States Supreme Court recently has reaffirmed the \"unique, significantly heightened protection afforded against searches of one's person.\u201d <em>See Wyoming v. Houghton, </em>- U.S. -\u25a0, -, 119 S.Ct. 1297, 1302, 143 L.Ed.2d 408 (1999) (holding that officers, who stopped driver for traffic infraction and received admission that he possessed syringe in plain view for purpose of taking drugs, were allowed, based on probable cause to believe drugs were in the car, to search containers in car, even one allegedly belonging to passenger, but reaffirming holding in <em>United States v. Di Re, </em>332 U.S. 581, 68 S.Ct. 222, 92 L.Ed. 210 (1948), \"that probable cause to search a car did not justify a body search of a passenger\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b698-6\">. We refer here only to danger sufficient to provide probable cause for a full search and not to the lower standard of reasonable suspicion for a weapons frisk under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">. A \u201csearch within small containers, such as wallets, cigarette boxes and the like, which are found in or about [an individual\u2019s] clothing\u201d is \"deemed to be [a search] \u2018of a person.\u2019 \u201d 2 LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.5, at 170.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\">. In so doing, we distinguished <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 355, 388 S.E.2d 280 (1990), in which we had held that officers conducting a vehicle stop had probable cause to conduct a warrantless search of a film canister found in a suspect\u2019s pocket based on the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>testimony of an officer that \"during 'his experience as a police officer he had, on numerous occasions seen film canisters used to transport controlled substances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Helms, </em>10 Va.App. at 371-72, 392 S.E.2d at 498 (emphasis omitted). However, <em>Harris </em>was subsequently reversed on appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court, which held that even the facts in <em>Harris </em>were insufficient to provide probable cause for a search of the canister. <em>See Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 146, 400 S.E.2d 191 (1991). In reversing <em>Harris, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court noted that \"law-abiding citizens, on a daily basis, also use film canisters to store film, which is a legitimate use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154, 400 S.E.2d at 196.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b702-6\">. <em>Although the </em>trial court denied that it was making any findings on this issue during the hearing on the motion to suppress, it observed that \u2018\u2018[t]he officer is trained in this sort of thing, when he feels it and he\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>pretty sure what it is, and he squeezes it to confirm it, he had sufficient cause to make that.\u201d Assuming without deciding that these statements constituted findings of fact by the trial court, they are both unsupported by the evidence and insufficient under the plain feel doctrine to permit the seizure. First, on a factual level, Officer Lowery never testified that he was \"pretty sure\u201d what the item was before he squeezed it. When the prosecutor tried to clarify this point, asking, \"When you felt- the lump, Officer, did you suspect anything at that point?\u201d Lowery responded merely, \"I suspected he had <em>something </em>in his pocket.\u201d (Emphasis added). Second, even assuming Lowery was \u201cpretty sure\u201d the lump was cocaine when he first felt it, he had to squeeze the lump to confirm its identity, which does not translate into the legal conclusion that its \"identity [was] immediately apparent\u201d <em>before </em>the squeeze.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
