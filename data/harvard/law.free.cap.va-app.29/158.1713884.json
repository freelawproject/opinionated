Defendant argues on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to prove he was an habitual offender at the time of the alleged crime. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The judgment of a trial court will be disturbed only if plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See id.; </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">On August 31, 1996, Virginia Beach Police Officer Craig R. Schneider, while on routine patrol, observed a \u201cvehicle ... cross[ ] the center line [of the roadway] ... and hit the center divider.\u201d Schneider activated his emergency lights and siren, and \u201ctried to pull the vehicle over.\u201d However, the driver, later identified as defendant, \u201crefused to stop,\u201d and continued for a distance of a \u201cmile, mile and a half\u2019 before parking in the \u201cfront yard\u201d of a residence. Defendant then alighted from the vehicle and \u201ctried to run,\u201d but was \u201ctackled\u201d and apprehended by Schneider.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Defendant was unable to produce an operator\u2019s license, and the ensuing police investigation disclosed that he had been adjudicated an habitual offender by the Newport News Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Court on November 29, 1984. The attendant order directed that defendant \u201cnot operate a motor vehicle ... for a period of ten (10) years from [such] date ... <em>and </em>until [defendant\u2019s] privilege ... to operate a motor vehicle in this State has been restored by Order of a Court of Record.\u201d (Emphasis added). The evidence further revealed that defendant had four subsequent convictions of operating a vehicle in violation of the revocation order: December 15, 1986, by the Newport News Circuit Court, January 18, 1989, in the Virginia Beach Circuit Court, and November 12,1991, and July 24,1995, respectively, by the Norfolk Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In challenging the sufficiency of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, defendant relies upon Code \u00a7 46.2-356<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to support his contention that the Commonwealth must affirmatively establish, as an element of the offense, that his license had <em>not </em>been restored. However, \u201c[w]hile Code \u00a7 46.1-387.7 (now Code \u00a7 46.2-356) defines the period during which an habitual offender may not be issued a license, it has no bearing on the definition of the felony.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 246, 248, 402 S.E.2d 711, 712 (1991) (footnote omitted). Defendant was indicted and convicted for a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357, which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to drive any motor vehicle ... while the revocation of the person\u2019s driving privilege remains in effect,\u201d together with a penalty for a violation by such persons previously \u201cfound to be an habitual offender.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-357. Thus, the operative statute \u201cdefines the [offense] in terms of the court\u2019s order and prohibits the person who has been declared an habitual offender from driving while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the order remains in effect.\u201d 12 Va.App. at 249, 402 S.E.2d at 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Here, the evidence clearly established that defendant had been adjudicated an habitual offender by order of the Newport News Circuit Court on November 29, 1984, and thereby expressly prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for ten years <em>and </em>until his privileges were \u201crestored by order of a Court of Record.\u201d Thus, the passage of the revocation period, without more, did \u201cnot automatically restore [defendant\u2019s] privilege to drive____\u201d <em>Manning v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va. App. 252, 256, 468 S.E.2d 705, 707 (1996). To the contrary, \u201cunder the terms of the order, the prohibition on driving [remained] in effect,\u201d pending proper restoration. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Nothing in the instant record suggests that \u201ca Court of Record\u201d had restored defendant\u2019s privileges or that he otherwise possessed a valid driver\u2019s license. Under such circumstances, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established a <em>prima facie </em>case that defendant remained under the disability of the order, \u201ccasting upon [him] ... the burden of going forward with evidence raising a reasonable doubt as to the illegality of his [conduct].\u201d <em>Mejia v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 173, 177-78, 474 S.E.2d 866, 868 (1996). <em>See Mayhew v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 484, 492, 458 S.E.2d 305, 309 (1995) (While \u201ccircumstances[ ] within the knowledge of the accused ... may be raised as ... defenses,\u201d they \u201care not negative elements of the offense [which] must be proven by the Commonwealth.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-6\">. No license to drive motor vehicles in Virginia shall be issued to an habitual offender (i) for a period of ten years from the date of any final order of a court entered under this article or if no such order was entered then the notice of the determination by the Commissioner finding the person to be an habitual offender and (ii) until the privilege of the person to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth has been restored by an order of a court entered in a proceeding as provided in this article.</p>\n<p id=\"A0t\">Code \u00a7 46.2-356.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
