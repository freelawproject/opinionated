On appeal, appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike the object sexual penetration charge because the victim\u2019s testimony was legally insufficient to prove penetration. A panel of this Court affirmed the conviction. <em>See Jett v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 759, 501 S.E.2d 457 (1998). We stayed the mandate of that decision and granted a rehearing <em>en banc. </em>Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>see Phillips v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 144, 155, 487 S.E.2d 235, 240-41 (1997), the evidence adduced at trial established that appellant was the nine-year-old victim\u2019s uncle by marriage, and he lived with the victim and her mother. The victim testified that when she was alone with appellant he \u201ctaught [her] to use a hairbrush ... to make [herself] feel good.\u201d She further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">Q: And how did you ... just describe for the ladies and gentlemen of the jmy what you did with that brush.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">A: I would lay it on the outside of my pookie [a term the victim used for her \u201cprivate parts\u201d], and rub it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">Q: Around, back and forth, or what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">A: Back and forth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">The victim also testified that appellant told her to do the same things with her Barbie doll, and when he tucked her in at night he would sometimes use his finger or his tongue and \u201crub my pookie back and forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">During this time period, the victim complained to her mother that her \u201cpookie kept on hurting.\u201d The victim\u2019s mother took her to the doctor because she had \u201cconstant vaginal problems.\u201d The child\u2019s vaginal problems were described as \u201ca nightly routine of screaming and crying, and sitting in sitz baths in the tub because her pookie hurt.\u201d The mother said she examined the area of the \u201cvaginal problems\u201d and \u201cit would be red and rashed. A lot of times, the clitoris would be swollen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">At trial appellant moved to strike the charges and later renewed this motion on the ground that the Commonwealth adduced insufficient evidence of penetration of the labia majora. The trial court denied the motion, finding that \u201cwe\u2019ve got a jury question, and I think we can certainly submit the evidence to the jury, on both charges.\u201d The jury convicted appellant, and he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for each offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Appellant contends the evidence of penetration admitted to prove a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2 was in equipoise and therefore legally insufficient to sustain the conviction of object sexual penetration. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u201cOn review, this Court does not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact. Instead, the jury\u2019s verdict will not be set aside unless it appears that it is plainly wrong or without supporting evidence.\u201d <em>Canipe v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 629, 644, 491 S.E.2d 747, 754 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">An accused shall be guilty of inanimate or animate object sexual penetration if he or she penetrates the labia majora</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">or anus of a complaining witness____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">\u201cPenetration may be proved by circumstantial evidence and is not dependent on direct testimony from the victim that penetration occurred.\u201d <em>Morrison v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 300, 301, 391 S.E.2d 612, 612 (1990) (although twelve-year-old victim was not asked whether penetration occurred, her testimony regarding circumstances surrounding incident and medical evidence of penetration were sufficient to prove rape). \u201c[C]ireumstantial evidence may be more compelling and persuasive than direct evidence, and when convincing, it is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence.\u201d <em>Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 523, 526, 351 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1986). For the purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2, as well as the statutes prohibiting rape and forcible sodomy, penetration \u201c \u2018need be only slight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Horton v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 606, 612, 499 S.E.2d 258, 261 (1998) (citation omitted) (addressing forcible sodomy under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1). <em>See Love v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 84, 89, 441 S.E.2d 709, 712 (1994) (\u201cthe legislature intended to mandate the same degree of penetration for all of these offenses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">The anatomical structure of the female genitalia is significant in relation to the element of penetration of the labia majora at issue in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The female external genitalia, starting with the outermost parts, are: \u201cthe mons pubis, the labia majora et minora pudendi, the clitoris, vestibule, vestibular bulb and the greater vestibular glands. The term \u2018vulva\u2019 ... includes all these parts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"><em>Horton, </em>255 Va. at 612, 499 S.E.2d at 261 (citing Henry Gray, Anatomy, Descriptive and Surgical 1446 (Peter L. Williams et al. eds., 37th ed. 1989)). The Supreme Court has held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201c[Pjenetration of any portion of the vulva, which encompasses the external parts of the female sex organs considered as a whole and includes, beginning with the outermost parts, the labia majora, labia minora, hymen, vaginal opening and vagina ... is sufficient to establish the element of penetration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\"><em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 184, 190, 491 S.E.2d 739, 742 (1997) (quoting <em>Love, </em>18 Va.App. at 88, 441 S.E.2d at 712). \u201cPenetration of the vaginal opening ... clearly [is] not required.\u201d <em>Love, </em>18 Va.App. at 88, 441 S.E.2d at 712. According to the anatomical description, the clitoris lies within the labia majora; therefore, evidence of penetration or stimulation of the clitoris is sufficient to establish penetration of the labia majora under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2. <em>Cf. Horton, </em>255 Va. at 613, 499 S.E.2d at 261-62 (evidence of oral stimulation of the vulva or clitoris constituted penetration for the purpose of proving forcible sodomy under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">In the instant case, although the victim\u2019s testimony that appellant taught her to rub the hairbrush or the Barbie doll \u201con the outside of my pookie\u201d did not establish penetration, the Commonwealth also introduced circumstantial evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude penetration had occurred. The child testified that her \u201cpookie,\u201d described by her mother as her vaginal area, frequently hurt. Her mother testified that the victim\u2019s vaginal area was often red, rashed, and her \u201cclitoris would be very swollen.\u201d On a nightly basis, the child would be \u201cscreaming and crying, and sitting in sitz baths in the tub because her pookie hurt.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>problem was so severe that the victim and her mother sought medical attention \u201cmany times.\u201d The evidence of the victim\u2019s pain and swollen clitoris established by circumstantial evidence the element of penetration. Therefore, we cannot hold that the verdict was unsupported by the evidence or plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Appellant likens the instant facts to those in <em>Moore, </em>where the victim testified that the defendant put his penis \u201con\u201d her vagina, and the Supreme Court overturned the conviction for insufficient evidence of the essential element of penetration. <em>See Moore, </em>254 Va. at 189, 491 S.E.2d at 741 (holding proof of penetration is legally insufficient if the evidence is \u201cin a state of equipoise\u201d based on the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief). Appellant contends that in the absence of medical or forensic evidence the mere complaint of vaginal discomfort by the victim is insufficient to sustain his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Moore </em>is misplaced, because in <em>Moore </em>the victim, <em>who provided the only evidence of penetration, </em>gave \u201ctwo different accounts of the essential facts relating to\u201d penetration. <em>Id. </em>at 189, 491 S.E.2d at 742. She testified that the defendant\u2019s penis had been \u201cin\u201d her vagina interchangeably with her testimony that it had been \u201con\u201d her vagina. <em>Id. </em>at 189, 491 S.E.2d at 741-42. Furthermore, the minor victim in <em>Moore </em>was unaware of the \u201cintricate structure of her sexual organ,\u201d and it was \u201cclear from the evidence that when she referred to her Vagina,\u2019 she was describing the external part of that portion of her anatomy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190, 491 S.E.2d at 742. In light of the victim\u2019s equivocal testimony and in the absence of medical, forensic, or <em>other corroborating evidence </em>to indicate penetration of the victim\u2019s genitalia, the Supreme Court reversed the conviction in <em>Moore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The instant victim\u2019s testimony resembled that of the victim in <em>Moore, </em>because she described the object as being placed \u201con the outside of my pookie.\u201d However, here, unlike <em>Moore, </em>the Commonwealth presented additional evidence of penetration, which was uncontradicted within its case-in-chief. The victim\u2019s testimony describing the use of the hairbrush and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>the doll and her mother\u2019s testimony that the victim required repeated treatment and medical attention for her vaginal pain supported the reasonable inference that penetration had occurred. Testimony from the victim that the hairbrush or doll had penetrated her labia majora was unnecessary in light of her mother\u2019s direct and anatomically specific testimony that the victim\u2019s clitoris was swollen. The combination of direct and indirect evidence of penetration presented here is distinguishable from the equivocal testimony of the child victim in <em>Moore, </em>which was the sole evidence of penetration in that case. The evidence in the instant case was not insufficient as a matter of law, and the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that penetration occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b239-7\">BENTON, Judge, with whom WILLIS and ELDER, JJ.,</author>\n<p id=\"AP2\">join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The indictment charged that \u201cRoger Lee Jett did unlawfully and feloniously penetrate the labia majora, of a female child under the age of thirteen, with an inanimate object, in violation of [Code \u00a7] 18.2-67.2.\u201d I would reverse the conviction because the evidence failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the child was penetrated by an inanimate object.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">The child testified that Jett \u201ctold [her] how to lay [a hairbrush and a Barbie doll] on the outside of [her] pookie ... and rub it.\u201d She further testified that she \u201ccall[ed] ... [her] private parts a pookie.\u201d When the child was asked in court to point to the part of her body to which she referred, the trial judge ruled that \u201cshe is pointing to her crotch area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">\u201cThe fact that the ... [object] is placed <em>on, </em>not <em>in, </em>the woman\u2019s sexual organ is insufficient to establish the element of penetration.\u201d <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 184, 189, 491 S.E.2d 739, 741 (1997). Clearly then, the child\u2019s testimony in this case that she rubbed the objects \u201con the outside\u201d of her \u201ccrotch area\u201d is insufficient to prove the act of penetration as required to sustain a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2. In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>deed, the majority acknowledges that \u201cthe [child\u2019s] testimony that [Jett] taught her to rub the hairbrush or the Barbie doll \u2018on the outside of [her] pookie\u2019 did not establish penetration.\u201d However, the majority concludes that the deficiency in the child\u2019s testimony is overcome by other circumstantial evidence. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">To convict an accused, the Commonwealth must prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Moore, </em>254 Va. at 186, 491 S.E.2d at 740. The Commonwealth fails to meet this burden when the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence creates only a suspicion or probability of guilt as to an essential element. <em>Id. </em>Thus, for circumstantial evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it must be wholly consistent with guilt and wholly inconsistent with innocence. <em>See Bishop v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 164, 169, 313 S.E.2d 390, 393 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">In <em>Moore, </em>where \u201cthe prosecution presented [direct] evidence, <em>as part of its case-in-chief, </em>that the defendant placed [the object] both \u2018in\u2019 and \u2018on\u2019 the victim\u2019s vagina,\u201d the Supreme Court reversed the conviction because \u201c[t]he Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was in a state of equipoise on an essential element of the crime.\u201d 254 Va. at 189, 491 S.E.2d at 741. The Commonwealth\u2019s own evidence in this case likewise is in a state of equipoise. Because the child\u2019s testimony fails to prove an act of penetration, the majority relies upon proof of vaginal irritation as the circumstance that tends to prove penetration. However, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence also proved other events that explained the vaginal discomfort that the child experienced. The child\u2019s irritated vaginal area is equally explained by Jett\u2019s use of his tongue on the child\u2019s vaginal area. However, Jett was convicted of sodomy at trial for that offense. The reasonable inference that the child\u2019s discomfort was caused by Jett\u2019s tongue or finger raises a reasonable doubt whether the child was penetrated by an inanimate object. \u201c \u2018[W]here a fact is equally susceptible of two interpretations one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, [the trier of fact] cannot arbitrarily adopt that interpretation which incriminates [the accused].\u2019 \u201d <em>Corbett v. Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>monwealth, </em>210 Va. 804, 307, 171 S.E.2d 251, 253 (1969) (citation omitted). \u201c[C]ircumstances of suspicion, no matter how grave or strong, are not proof of guilt sufficient to support a verdict of guilty ... [because the] actual commission of the crime by the accused must be shown by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain ... [a] conviction.\u201d <em>Clodfelter v.
