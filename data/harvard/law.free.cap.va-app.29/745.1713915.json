Prior to trial, Powell pled guilty to possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony. The Commonwealth did not consent to entry of a conditional plea. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-254. A jury convicted Powell of the two remaining charges. On this appeal from the convictions of second degree murder and using a firearm in the commission of murder, Powell contends the trial judge erred in (1) denying his motion to dismiss because of a speedy trial violation, (2) denying his motion to suppress his statement to police because of a <em>Miranda </em>violation, (3) admitting into evidence unsigned notes of a deputy sheriff memorializing Powell\u2019s statement, (4) refusing to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>struct the jury that parole has been abolished in Virginia, (5) instructing the jury on the elements of second degree murder, and (6) instructing the jury on the burden to prove self-defense. For the reasons that follow, we hold that Powell was not tried within the time period specified in Code \u00a7 19.2-243, and we reverse both convictions and dismiss the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"AOj\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The record established that officers of the Halifax County Sheriffs Department arrested Louis Jordan Powell, Jr., on January 26, 1996, on four warrants charging Powell with first degree murder of a juvenile, discharging a firearm within a building, using a firearm in the commission of murder, and possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony. On March 19, 1996, a judge of the juvenile and domestic relations district court found probable cause to believe Powell committed the offenses and certified the matters to the grand jury. Powell was taken into custody March 19, 1996, and has remained continuously in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">In May 1996, the grand jury indicted Powell for murder, use of a firearm in the commission of murder, and possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony. The record indicates that the only order entered in the circuit court after the return of the indictments and before trial was an order relieving Powell\u2019s initial trial attorney from his representation and substituting another attorney to represent Powell. On October 8, 1996, Powell\u2019s attorney filed a motion pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-243 \u201cto discharge [Powell] from prosecution for failure to commence trial within five (5) months from the date probable cause was found.\u201d On October 9, immediately prior to the commencement of trial, the trial judge heard evidence on the motion and denied the motion. After considering other motions, the trial judge arraigned Powell. Powell pled guilty to the charge of possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony. He pled not guilty to murder and use of a firearm in the commission of murder. At the conclusion of the evidence, the jury convicted Powell of second degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">As pertinent to this appeal, the statute governing the time limitation for the commencement of felony trials provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">Where a general district court has found that there is probable cause to believe that the accused has committed a felony, the accused, if he is held continuously in custody thereafter, shall be forever discharged from prosecution for such offense if no trial is commenced in the circuit court within five months from the date such probable cause was found by the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-243. \u201cIf [the accused] is not tried within the time specified in Code \u00a7 19.2-243, the burden is on the Commonwealth to explain the delay.\u201d <em>Godfrey v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 460, 463, 317 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1984). To avoid the statutory remedy of discharge from prosecution, \u201c[t]he Commonwealth must prove that the delay was based on \u2018one of the reasons enumerated in [Code \u00a7 19.2-243] or on [the accused\u2019s] waiver, actual or implied, of his right to be tried within the designated period.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baker v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 19, 22, 486 S.E.2d 111, 113, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>26 Va.App. 175, 493 S.E.2d 687 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Powell\u2019s trial was not commenced within five months from the date the judge of the juvenile court found probable cause. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial judge found \u201cthat there was a continuance [and] that it was on the motion of [Powell].\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-243 (exempting \u201csuch period of time as the failure to try the accused was caused ... [b]y continuance granted on the motion of the accused or his counsel\u201d). The record, however, does not support the trial judge\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">At the evidentiary hearing, Tina Englebright, an employee of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office who is not an attorney, testified that she had been given the responsibility of \u201csetting the circuit court docket.\u201d In this capacity, she received a list of available trial dates from the circuit court judge and then contacted the attorneys involved in the cases to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>coordinate their available trial dates. Englebright prepared a spread sheet with the defendant\u2019s name, charge, attorney and a speedy trial date, and she noted on the spread sheet the agreed upon or convenient trial date. After Englebright completed the spread sheet, she delivered it to the clerk\u2019s office. Englebright testified that the clerk prepared the trial docket from Englebright\u2019s spread sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Englebright testified that this procedure was followed for Powell\u2019s case. Her spread sheet indicated that Powell was to be tried by a jury. Over objection, she further testified that Powell\u2019s initial attorney had asked for a continuance because of \u201cextreme docket problems in setting his cases.\u201d She also testified that the circuit judge did not enter either an order setting the case for trial or an order for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Powell\u2019s initial attorney testified that he could not recall requesting a continuance of the case. He also testified that the circuit judge generally enters orders when continuances are granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The Clerk of the Circuit Court identified Englebright\u2019s spread sheet as the document from which the clerk\u2019s office prepared its trial docket. The Clerk testified that the spread sheet was \u201cused in support of the creation of the docket.\u201d The Clerk also testified the spread sheet is not put in an order book and is not stamped or dated as received.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">The record contains no order or docket entry by the judge setting a trial date. We have had other occasions to address the absence of an order setting a criminal trial. We ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-9\">The record contains no orders or docket entries explaining the reason for the delay in beginning the trial or supporting the trial judge\u2019s finding that the ... delay was attributable to [the accused]. No orders were entered granting continuances or showing why the case was not scheduled for trial within five months.... The testimony of witnesses cannot stand in lieu of findings and rulings of the trial judge entered of record. To do so would diminish the sanctity of the court\u2019s records. The record of proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>ings in a court of record cannot be left to the vagaries of a swearing contest between witnesses. Such is an insufficient basis to establish why delay occurred which prevented a criminal defendant from receiving a speedy trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-5\"><em>Adkins v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 519, 522, 414 S.E.2d 188, 189 (1992) (citation omitted). <em>See also Nelms v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 639, 642, 400 S.E.2d 799, 801 (1991) (noting that \u201c[sjince the matter had not been set for trial, neither the accused nor the attorney for the Commonwealth had any reason to move for a continuance\u201d). In an earlier case, we noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">In determining responsibility for the delay of a criminal trial, we must confine our review to the record before us. Because of the fragility of memories \u201cRepresentations of counsel, or even of the trial judge, if not supported by the record, are insufficient.\u201d A trial court\u2019s actions are reflected in the record only through its orders and decrees. Consequently, a trial date scheduled by the court in a criminal case must be documented before we may consider it in evaluating trial delay, and no trial date was scheduled by the court in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-7\">sj\u00ab * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-8\">Only the trial court, not the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, has authority to schedule criminal cases for trial. Code \u00a7 19.2-241 provides that \u201c[t]he judge of each circuit court shall fix a day of his court when the trial of criminal cases will commence, and may make such general or special order in reference thereto.... \u201d This provision contemplates an orderly procedure for setting criminal cases and expressly places the control of that process under the supervision of the trial court, not a party litigant. The policy expressed in this provision recognizes the role of the trial judge in insuring the prompt disposition of criminal cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-9\"><em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 566, 569, 347 S.E.2d 146, 148 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">Not only was no order entered setting an initial trial date for Powell\u2019s jury trial, the record in this case clearly estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>lishes that no order was entered setting a continued trial date. On this record, the Commonwealth has not borne its burden of proving a delay countenanced by Code \u00a7 19.2-243. Because Powell was in custody and was not brought to trial within five months of the finding of probable cause, as statutorily mandated, the trial judge erred in failing to grant Powell\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictments. We, therefore, reverse the convictions for second degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of murder and dismiss the indictments. We need not address the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
