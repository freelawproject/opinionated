On appeal, he contends the administrative suspension of his license pursuant to Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>\u00a7 46.2-391.2 was invalid because he did not refuse to take the breath test but rather was prevented from doing so by his asthma. As a consequence, he contends that the suspension was punitive and that his subsequent DUI conviction violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. For the reasons that follow, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Appellant was arrested on September 10, 1997, for driving while under the influence of alcohol, his second such offense within five years. Because appellant had asthma, he submitted to a blood test rather than a breath test. Based on his inability to take a breath test, the Commonwealth administratively suspended his operator\u2019s license for seven days pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2. Although the Notice of Administrative Suspension issued to appellant indicated he could challenge the suspension by filing a motion for review, the record contains no evidence indicating that appellant filed such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Following appellant\u2019s conviction on the underlying DUI charge in general district court, appellant appealed that conviction and raised a plea of former jeopardy. By written motion, he asserted that, because his asthma prevented him from taking the breath test, the suspension was \u201carbitrarily imposed without a legitimate administrative basis\u201d and, therefore, that \u201cthe suspension clearly rises to the level of a punishment,\u201d rendering any further punishment for the DUI offense a double jeopardy violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">The trial court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-10\">I don\u2019t believe it was the intent of that statute to be thwarted by the fact that someone with legitimate and valid reasons could not present a breath sample and I think the statute is drafted in such a manner that your client did have the opportunity to appeal that administrative revocation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>I\u2019m finding that the revocation was - administrative in nature____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Following the denial of his motion, appellant stipulated that the evidence \u2014 including a certificate of analysis showing a blood alcohol level of 0.17 percent and a prior DUI conviction entered September 25, 1995 \u2014 was sufficient to convict him, and the trial court found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2(A) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-9\">If a breath test is taken pursuant to \u00a7 18.2-268.2 or any similar ordinance of any county, city or town and the results show a blood alcohol content of 0.08 percent or more by weight by volume or 0.08 grams or more per 210 liters of breath, or the person refuses to submit to the breath test in violation of \u00a7 18.2-268.3 or any similar local ordinance, and upon issuance of a petition or summons, or upon issuance of a warrant by the magistrate, for a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-51.4, 18.2-266 or \u00a7 18.2-268.3, or any similar local ordinance, the person\u2019s license shall be suspended immediately for seven days----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2(0 provides that \u201c[a]ny person whose license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle has been suspended under subsection A may, during the period of the suspension, request the general district court ... to review that suspension\u201d and that \u201cthe court shall rescind the suspension\u201d if \u201cthe person proves to the court by a preponderance of the evidence that the arresting officer did not have probable cause for the arrest, that the magistrate did not have probable cause to issue the warrant, or that there was not probable cause for issuance of the petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">We previously have held that an administrative license suspension issued pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 is not \u201cpunishment within the meaning of the double jeopardy clause\u201d; therefore, a DUI prosecution instituted after a license suspen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>sion does not constitute double jeopardy. <em>See Tench v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 200, 208, 462 S.E.2d 922, 925 (1995), <em>cited with approval in Brame v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 122, 130-32, 476 S.E.2d 177, 182-83 (1996). In reaching this conclusion, we relied on the test set out in <em>United States v. Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989), in which the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe labels \u2018civil\u2019 and \u2018criminal\u2019 are not controlling\u201d and that a civil sanction nevertheless may constitute punishment under certain circumstances. <em>Tench, </em>21 Va.App. at 204-05, 462 S.E.2d at 924 (quoting <em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. at 447, 109 S.Ct. at 1901).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In so doing, we noted that \u201cthe purpose of revoking a driver\u2019s license is \u2018not to punish the offender but to remove from the highways an operator who is a potential danger to other users.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, 462 S.E.2d at 924 (quoting <em>Prichard v. Battle, </em>178 Va. 455, 463,17 S.E.2d 393, 396 (1941)). We also examined the legislative history behind the enactment of the suspension statute, which provided that the legislature was \u201cmotivated by its desire to reduce \u2018alcohol-related crashes, fatalities, and injuries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting S.J. Res. 172, 1989 Va. Acts). As a result, we held that the license suspension \u201cis a remedial sanction because its purpose is to protect the public from intoxicated drivers and to reduce alcohol-related accidents\u201d and, therefore, that it \u201cdoes not constitute punishment for purposes of double jeopardy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205-06, 462 S.E.2d at 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">After our ruling in <em>Tench, </em>the United States Supreme Court reconsidered its holding in <em>Halper, </em>upon which our analysis in <em>Tench </em>was based. <em>See Hudson v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 118 S.Ct. 488, 139 L.Ed.2d 450 (1997). In <em>Hudson, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cHalper\u2019s deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill considered,\u201d and it \u201creaffirmed the previously established rule exemplified in <em>United States v. Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 248-49[, 100 S.Ct. 2636, 2640-41, 65 L.Ed.2d 742] (1980).\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 96, 101, 118 S.Ct. at 491, 494. Under the longstanding double jeopardy principles outlined in <em>Ward, </em>determining \u201c[w]hether a particular punishment is criminal or civil is, at least initially, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>a matter of statutory construction,\u201d and \u201c[a] court must first ask whether the legislature \u2018... indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99, 118 S.Ct. at 493 (quoting <em>Ward, </em>448 U.S. at 248, 100 S.Ct. at 2641). Because \u201cthe <em>Halper </em>Court bypassed [this] threshold question,\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 101, 118 S.Ct. at 494, we did not expressly address this issue in <em>Tench. </em>However, our analysis in <em>Tench, </em>as outlined above, makes clear that the administrative license suspension is civil in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Under the traditional double jeopardy analysis re-adopted in <em>Hudson, </em>even where the legislature shows, an intent to create a civil penalty, the court must consider \u201c \u201cwhether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect,\u2019 as to \u2018transform] what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 99, 118 S.Ct. at 493 (citations omitted). Factors which \u201cprovide useful guideposts\u201d in making this determination include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-6\">(1) [w]hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint; (2) whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment; (3) whether it comes into play only on a finding of <em>scienter; </em>(4) whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment \u2014 retribution and deterrence; (5) whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime; (6) whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it; and (7) whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 99-100, 118 S.Ct. at 493 (quoting <em>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 168-69, 83 S.Ct. 554, 567-68, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963)) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Court emphasized, however, \u201c \u2018these factors must be considered in relation to the statute on its face,\u2019 and \u2018only the clearest proof will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 118 S.Ct. at 493 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>As we decided in <em>Tench, </em>the legislature clearly intended for the administrative license suspension to be a civil sanction. We also hold, under the factors outlined above, that the statutory scheme is not so punitive as to transform \u201ca civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\u201d <em>See Powers v. Commonwealth, </em>426 Mass. 534, 694 N.E.2d 324 (1998) (holding that suspension of license following alcohol-related accident under statute permitting suspension based on driver\u2019s \u201cimmediate threat to public safety\u201d is not punishment under <em>Hudson </em>for double jeopardy purposes); <em>Keyes v. State, </em>708 So.2d 540 (Miss.1998) (stating, as alternative ground for affirming conviction, that license suspension for not timely requesting trial after failing breath test does not constitute punishment for double jeopardy purposes under <em>Hudson); State v. Howell, </em>254 Neb. 247, 575 N.W.2d 861 (1998) (applying <em>Hudson </em>to determine that license suspension for refusal to submit to chemical test is not punishment for purposes of double jeopardy); <em>State v. Lomas, </em>114 Nev. 313, 955 P.2d 678 (1998) (applying <em>Hudson </em>to determine that suspension of license based on blood alcohol content exceeding legal limit is not punishment for purposes of double jeopardy); <em>State v. Price, </em>333 S.C. 267, 510 S.E.2d 215 (1998) (applying <em>Hudson </em>to determine that license suspension for refusal to submit to chemical test is not punishment for purposes of double jeopardy).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">First, the seven-day administrative suspension does not involve an affirmative restraint, for it is \u201ccertainly nothing approaching the \u2018infamous punishment\u2019 of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 104, 118 S.Ct. at 496 (quoting <em>Flemming v. Nestor, </em>363 U.S. 603, 617, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 1376, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960)). \u201cIf occupational debarment from the banking industry [in <em>Hudson </em>] cannot be considered an affirmative disability or restraint, then quite obviously the temporary suspension of [one\u2019s] driving privilege also cannot be so considered.\u201d <em>Lomas, </em>955 P.2d at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Second, drivers\u2019 license suspensions historically have not been considered punishment in Virginia. <em>See, e.g., Brame, </em>252 Va. at 130-31, 476 S.E.2d at 181-82. The \u201c \u2018revocation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>privilege voluntarily granted\u2019 \u201d is an act which \u201c \u2018is characteristically free of the punitive criminal element.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 104, 118 S.Ct. at 496 (quoting <em>Helvering v. Mitchell, </em>303 U.S. 391, 399 &amp; n. 2, 58 S.Ct. 630, 633 &amp; n. 2, 82 L.Ed. 917 (1938)); <em>see also Commonwealth v. Ellett, </em>174 Va. 403, 414, 4 S.E.2d 762, 767 (1939) (\u201cThe operation of a motor vehicle ... is a conditional privilege, which may be suspended or revoked under the police power____ [It] is not a contract or property right in a constitutional sense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Third, the administrative license suspension does not come into play \u201conly on a finding of <em>scienter,\u201d </em>although the portion of the statute providing for suspension upon refusal to submit to testing may involve a finding of scienter. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2; <em>see also Price, </em>510 S.E.2d at 219 (under statute provide ing for suspension only for refusal to take test, noting that \u201calthough the sanction ... does come into play only on a finding of scienter, ... no one of the factors alone is dispositive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Fourth, although the statute may \u201cpromote the traditional aims of punishment \u2014 retribution and deterrence,\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 99, 118 S.Ct. at 493, \u201cthis element is present in any loss of license or privilege and is not the primary focus of the statutory scheme,\u201d <em>State v. Strong, </em>158 Vt. 56, 605 A.2d 510, 513 (1992) (decided under <em>Halper), cited with approval in Brame, </em>252 Va. at 131-32, 476 S.E.2d at 182-83. Further, \u201c[although deterrence is a traditional goal of criminal punishment, ... deterrence also may serve civil goals,\u201d such as \u201cdeter[ring] drivers who entertain the idea of driving while intoxicated and ... diseourag[ing] drivers whose licenses have been revoked from engaging in similar misconduct in the future.\u201d <em>Lomas, </em>955 P.2d at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Fifth, although the behavior to which the administrative license suspension applies is already a crime, \u201c[t]his fact is insufficient to render the [sanction] criminally punitive, particularly in the double jeopardy context.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 105, 118 S.Ct. at 496; <em>see United States v. Ursery, </em>518 U.S. 267, 292, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 2149, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996) (\u201c[I]t is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>well settled that \u2018[a legislature] may impose both a criminal and a civil sanction in respect to the same act or omission.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Helvering, </em>303 U.S. at 399, 58 S.Ct. at 633)).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Sixth, the administrative license suspension statute is rationally connected to a purpose other than criminal punishment, for it furthers the government\u2019s remedial goal of maintaining safety on public roads. <em>See Brame, </em>252 Va. at 133, 476 S.E.2d at 183; <em>Tench, </em>21 Va.App. at 205, 462 S.E.2d at 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Seventh, we cannot say the seven-day suspension appears excessive in relation to this remedial purpose. As the Court observed in <em>Brame, </em>\u201cthe length of the period necessary to [accomplish the remedial purpose] is a matter within the sound discretion of the General Assembly,\u201d and \u201c[i]t can hardly be said the discretion has been abused in light of the fact that Virginia\u2019s seven-day period is shorter than any of the periods considered in ... out-of-state cases ... the majority [of which] have suspension periods of ninety days or more____\u201d <em>Brame, </em>252 Va. at 133, 476 S.E.2d at 183; <em>see Lomas, </em>955 P.2d at 681 (holding that ninety-day minimum suspension not excessive); <em>Powers, </em>694 N.E.2d at 326, 328-29 (upholding indefinite administrative suspension).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Therefore, here, like in <em>Hudson, </em>\u201cthere simply is very little showing, to say nothing of the \u2018clearest proof required by <em>Ward,\u201d </em>that the administrative license suspension is criminal in nature. <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 105, 118 S.Ct. at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Indeed, appellant concedes that in light of <em>Hudson </em>a proper administrative license suspension is not punitive in nature such that a subsequent prosecution for driving under the influence arising out of the same incident does not violate the double jeopardy prohibition. He nevertheless contends that the suspension of his license pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2 was unlawful because, due to his asthma, he neither produced a breath test result showing a violation of the DUI statute nor refused to submit to a breath test. Without such a showing, he contends, the administrative suspension was improperly applied and became punitive, even though a suspen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>sion imposed under proper circumstances would not have been punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">We disagree. As the United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Hudson, </em>a court determining whether a supposed civil sanction constitutes punishment for purposes of double jeopardy must \u201cevaluat[e] the \u2018statute on its face,\u2019 \u201d <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 101,118 S.Ct. at 490-91 (quoting <em>Kennedy, </em>372 U.S. at 169, 83 S.Ct. at 567), rather than \u201c \u2018the character of the actual sanctions imposed,\u2019\u201d <em>id. </em>at 101, 118 S.Ct. at 490 (quoting <em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. at 447, 109 S.Ct. at 1901). Therefore, assuming without deciding that appellant\u2019s license was improperly suspended under Code \u00a7 46.2-391.2, we nevertheless conclude, in keeping with the above analysis, that the administrative suspension was not punishment for purposes of double jeopardy. <em>Cf. Robertson v. Commonwealth, </em>181 Va. 520, 537, 25 S.E.2d 352, 358 (1943) (noting that \u201cthe power to decide includes the power to decide wrong[ly] and [that] an erroneous decision is as binding [for purposes of contempt] as one that is correct until set aside or corrected in a manner provided by law\u201d (quoting <em>Freeman on Judgments </em>\u00a7 357, at 744 (5th ed.))). Any deviation from proper procedure does not change the fundamental character of the sanction, which is civil and remedial. Appellant\u2019s remedy was to challenge the suspension as provided in the statute, a remedy he apparently chose to disregard.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">For these reasons, we hold that appellant\u2019s conviction for driving under the influence following the administrative suspension of his license did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause and, therefore, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
