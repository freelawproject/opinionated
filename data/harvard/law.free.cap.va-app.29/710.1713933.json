On appeal, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>argues that the trial court erred in refusing to defer sentencing for a mental examination pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-300 and 19.2-176. We affirm the trial court\u2019s refusal to order a mental examination pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-176; however, we reverse and remand for resentencing after the trial court\u2019s compliance with Code \u00a7 19.2-300.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The victim testified that on April 1, 1997, Simerly attacked her while she was walking on a road near her house. Simerly dragged her 150 to 200 yards into the woods beside the road and then threw her to the ground. When she attempted to get up, Simerly kicked her in the face, pulled off her pants and underwear and raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">On September 23, 1997, Simerly was convicted in a bench trial of rape, abduction with the intent to defile, and malicious wounding. Counsel for Simerly requested preparation of a Presentence Investigation Report. A sentencing hearing was scheduled for November 14, 1997. At the hearing, evidence was introduced that Simerly refused to cooperate with the probation officer in the preparation of the presentence report. The investigation conducted by the probation officer revealed that Simerly had been charged with a crime in 1987, and had sought to plead guilty. With respect to that charge, the court had ordered Simerly to undergo a competency evaluation. Simerly had been found incompetent to stand trial and was committed to a mental facility for restoration. After his restoration to competency, Simerly was tried, convicted and served a five-year sentence. Simerly had not provided any of this information to either of the attorneys representing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">At the sentencing hearing, Simerly\u2019s counsel requested that the court defer sentencing until a mental evaluation of him could be completed, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-300. Simerly\u2019s counsel also requested that the court evaluate Simerly\u2019s mental state prior to sentencing pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-176. The trial court denied both motions. The court sentenced Simerly to life imprisonment for rape, life imprisonment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>abduction with intent to defile, and twenty years imprisonment for malicious wounding.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">II. CODE \u00a7 19.2-300</p>\n<p id=\"A-A\">Code \u00a7 19.2-300 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">In the case of the conviction in any circuit court of any person for any criminal offense which indicates sexual abnormality, the trial judge may on his own initiative, or shall upon application of the attorney for the Commonwealth, the defendant, or counsel for defendant or other person acting for the defendant, defer sentence until the report of a mental examination conducted as provided in \u00a7 19.2-301 of the defendant can be secured to guide the judge in determining what disposition shall be made of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">A criminal defendant is entitled as a matter of law to have a presentence report prepared prior to the imposition of his or her sentence. <em>See Duncan v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 342, 345-46, 343 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1986). At his sentencing hearing, Simerly\u2019s counsel expressed her belief that Simerly\u2019s failure to cooperate with the probation officer deprived the court of a \u201cmeaningful presentence report.\u201d Simerly\u2019s counsel argued that the presentence report failed to inform the court of mitigating factors in his case, and she requested pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-300 that the court order a mental evaluation before imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-300 states that in a case involving \u201csexual abnormality,\u201d a trial judge <em>\u201cmay </em>on his own initiative\u201d or <em>\u201cshall </em>upon application of the ... attorney for the defendant\u201d order a mental examination. (Emphasis added). Whether the crimes with which Simerly was charged constituted offenses involving \u201csexual abnormality,\u201d bringing them under the purview of the statute, is the issue before us on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>The term \u201csexual abnormality\u201d is not defined within Code \u00a7 19.2-300. Certainly, in common parlance it is difficult to imagine anything more sexually \u201cabnormal\u201d than forcible rape. However, the Commonwealth argues that the sexual act itself must be performed in some \u201cabnormal\u201d way before the statute may be invoked. \u201c[L]anguage is ambiguous if it can be understood in more than one way ... [and] divergent interpretations tend to show that a statute\u2019s meaning is difficult to ascertain.\u201d <em>Virginia-Am. Water Co. v. Prince Wm. Serv., </em>246 Va. 509, 514, 436 S.E.2d 618, 621 (1993) (citations omitted). When a statute is ambiguous, a court is permitted to consider extrinsic evidence to determine its meaning, including an analysis of its legislative history. <em>See id. </em>at 514-20, 436 S.E.2d at 620-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-300 was first enacted in 1950. A Commission to Study Sex Offenses prepared a report entitled, \u201cThe Sex Offender and the Criminal Law,\u201d (S. 18 (Va.1951)) which was presented to the Governor and the General Assembly of Virginia in 1951. In its report, the commission stated that its purpose was to \u201cstudy and report upon the statutes of Virginia dealing with sex offenders\u201d and \u201cto consider the nature of the problem, the measures in use in other States, and methods which might be employed in this State.\u201d S. 18 at 3. The commission stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">[t]here are three major elements which usually characterize the acts of the dangerous sex offender toward which preventative efforts should be primarily directed. These are (1) the use of force in the performance of any sexual act against \u2019 the will of one of the participants (2) a prohibited sexual act where there is a great disparity in age between the participants, whether or not the element of force enters, and (3) the repetitive compulsive nature of the act carried out with heedless disregard of consequences to the offender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">S. 18 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">The report uses the term \u201cdangerous sexual offender\u201d interchangeably with the phrase \u201cone who engages in abnormal sexual behavior.\u201d <em>See </em>S. 18. We conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>legislature intended the term \u201csexual abnormality\u201d to include all sex offenses committed against the will of a victim in which the use of force is involved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-300 first appeared in the supplement to the Code of 1950 and was originally codified at \u00a7 53-278.2. The language of the section read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">In the case of the conviction in any court of record of any person for any criminal offense which indicates sexual abnormality, the trial judge may on his own initiative, or on application of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, the defendant, or counsel for defendant or other person acting for the defendant, defer sentence until the report of mental examination of the defendant can be secured to guide the judge in determining what disposition shall be made of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The language of Code \u00a7 53-278.2 remained unchanged until 1970. However, in 1970, Code \u00a7 53-278.2 was amended to read,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">[i]n the case of the conviction in any court of record of any person for any criminal offense which indicates sexual abnormality, the trial judge may on his own initiative, or <em>shall </em>upon application of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, the defendant, or counsel for defendant or any other person acting for the defendant, defer sentence until the report of a mental examination of the defendant can be secured to guide the judge in determining what disposition may be made of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Acts of the General Assembly, 1970, c. 62 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">The 1970 change in the language of Code \u00a7 53-278.2 reflected legislative intent to eliminate the exercise of discretion by the trial judge in ordering a mental examination prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>sentencing when requested by the defense or the Commonwealth. In 1975, Code \u00a7 53-278.2 was repealed and recodified at Code \u00a7 19.2-300. Acts of the General Assembly 1975, c. 495. As recently as 1990, the legislature made modest changes to Code \u00a7 19.2-300, but made no change in the language eliminating the judge\u2019s discretion. Acts of the General Assembly 1990, c. 697. From its inception, the provision has contained no definition of the term \u201csexual abnormality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The concurring opinion attempts to draw a distinction between \u201cforce\u201d and \u201cviolence\u201d in the definition of \u201csexual abnormality.\u201d Unfortunately, such an analysis may shift the focus of the inquiry from the defendant\u2019s conduct to the victim\u2019s conduct as demonstrated in the case of <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 983, 252 S.E.2d 370 (1979), ironically cited in the concurring opinion. In <em>Jones, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court upheld a rape conviction and observed that \u201cthe woman is not required to resist to the utmost of her physical strength, if she reasonably believes resistance would be useless and result in serious bodily injury to her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 986, 252 S.E.2d at 372 (citations omitted). If the question to be answered is whether the defendant\u2019s conduct indicates \u201csexual abnormality,\u201d the answer should never rest upon the victim\u2019s conduct. The victim\u2019s decision to avoid violence does not make the defendant\u2019s conduct any less \u201cabnormal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Additionally, the attempt to draw the distinction between \u201cforce\u201d and \u2018Violence\u201d is not found in the most recent enactments of the General Assembly. The 1999 Session of the General Assembly enacted provisions for the civil commitment of sexually violent predators. S. 845, 1999 Session (Va.1999). Senate Bill 845 was enacted into law on April 7, 1999. In the definitions section, the legislature defines \u201csexually violent offense\u201d to include a \u201cviolation of \u00a7 18.2-61 [rape], \u00a7 18.2-67.1 [forcible sodomy] or \u00a7 18.2-67.2 [object sexual penetration] or subdivision Al of \u00a7 18.2-67.3 [aggravated sexual battery].\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-61 defines rape as an act of sexual intercourse with a complaining witness which is accomplished \u201cby force, threat or intimidation\u201d or \u201cthrough the use of the complaining witness\u2019s mental incapacity or physical helplessness\u201d or \u201cwith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>a child under age thirteen as the victim.\u201d The offenses of forcible sodomy, object sexual penetration and aggravated sexual battery have similar provisions. The legislature has defined these forcible acts as \u201cviolent.\u201d Clearly, when dealing with sexually abnormal behavior, the legislature does not make the distinction between \u201cforce\u201d and \u201cviolence\u201d advanced by the concurring opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">We hold that Simerly was convicted of an offense that \u201cindicates sexual abnormality,\u201d as that terminology is used in Code \u00a7 19.2-300. The record is replete with evidence that Simerly used force to commit the rape. The victim testified that Simerly attacked her, dragged her into the woods, threw her to the ground and kicked her in the face in order to restrain her. The legislature mandated that a person convicted of an offense that \u201cindicates sexual abnormality\u201d be given a mental evaluation upon request of the defense or the Commonwealth to determine whether proper psychiatric treatment could prevent further crimes by the same offender. Because Simerly\u2019s counsel requested that the court defer sentencing until he could be given a mental examination pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-300, we reverse and remand the case for resentencing after the receipt of the report of mental examination. Such a report may or may not have any impact upon the trial judge in a sentencing for such a brutal crime; however, upon timely motion, the statute provides the defendant this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">III. CODE \u00a7 19.2-176</p>\n<p id=\"ARat\">Code \u00a7 19.2-176(A) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">If, after conviction and before sentence of any person, the judge presiding at the trial finds reasonable ground to question such person\u2019s mental state, he may order an evaluation of such person\u2019s mental state by at least one psychiatrist or clinical psychologist who is qualified by training and experience to perform such evaluations. If the judge, based on the evaluation, and after hearing representations of the defendant\u2019s counsel, finds clear and convincing evidence that the defendant (i) is mentally ill, and (ii) requires treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>in a mental hospital rather than the jail, he may order the defendant hospitalized in a facility designated by the Commissioner as appropriate for treatment of persons convicted of crime. The time such person is confined to such hospital shall be deducted from any term for which he may be sentenced to any penal institution, reformatory or elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">At Simerly\u2019s sentencing hearing, his counsel moved to defer sentencing until a mental evaluation could be performed, as authorized by Code \u00a7 19.2-176. The trial court refused to order an examination, stating that nothing had arisen \u201cthat creates reasonable ground to question the defendant\u2019s mental state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The use of the term \u201cmay\u201d in the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-176 renders a mental examination under this section discretionary. Where the language of a statute authorizing the appointment of an expert to render mental examination prior to trial is clearly discretionary, the denial of a motion to appoint an expert will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>See Elkins v. Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 336, 337, 157 S.E.2d 243, 244 (1967). We find nothing in the record to support Simerly\u2019s argument that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to order a mental examination under Code \u00a7 19.2-176.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s refusal to order a mental examination pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-176. We hold, however, that the trial court erred in refusing to order a mental examination pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-300, and reverse for the limited purpose of allowing the court to resentence Simerly after a mental examination pursuant to this section has been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, and reversed in part and remanded for resentencing.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-9\">. There was no objection to the timeliness of the motion; consequently, that issue is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-11\">. The commission\u2019s report to the legislature stated \"the hope ... of reducing the number of serious sex crimes lies in a proper psychiatric screening of the potential criminal at the stage where abnormal behavior first comes to light. The authorities believe that latent sexual deviations can in most cases be alleviated with treatment and prevented from developing into more dangerous anti-social activity.\u201d S. 18 at 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ACB\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">I agree \"with the majority\u2019s holding that the trial judge erred in refusing to order a mental examination of Bobby J. Simerly pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-300. I separately concur, however, because I believe the majority opinion lowers the bar too drastically when it holds that a sexual assault involving the use of force, which need only be slight in certain circumstances, <em>see Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 983, 986, 252 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1979), proves \u201csexual abnormality\u201d sufficient to trigger the application of Code \u00a7 19.2-300. In my view, this offense falls within the ambit of \u201csexual abnormality\u201d because of the nature and degree of violence that Simerly employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">To the extent that the Report of the Commission To Study Sex Offenders (S. 18 1951) is helpful in determining this issue, I believe it primarily focused upon those offenders who \u201care aggressive and carry out their heinous crimes with a complete disregard of the consequences both to the victim and the aggressor.\u201d S. 18 at 1. The report concerned only \u201ca low percentage [of sex offenders] \u2014 three to five percent \u2014 [who] are dangerous,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 4, and it seeks to differentiate between persons who may be described generally as \u201csexual deviates\u201d and persons who are \u201cdangerous sex offenders].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1-2, 4. The report further noted that \u201c[t]hose who are sent to the mental hospitals under the recommendations of this report will have engaged in <em>acts of violence.\u201d Id. </em>at 8 (emphasis added). The report focused its recommendations upon offenders \u201cconvicted of a crime for which the punishment may be death or life imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The evidence proved that Simerly grabbed the victim\u2019s hair, forcibly dragged her into the woods, kicked her in the face, and raped her while she was physically* restrained. By urging a greater limitation than that accepted by the majority, I do not intend to suggest that a forcible sexual assault committed without aggravated violence is less culpable than one committed with aggravated violence. The issue before us is not whether the offense is somehow mitigated on the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>force employed. The issue is merely whether the offender should be subjected to a mental examination before sentencing. I would hold that the violence which accompanied this rape made the \u201coffense [one] which indicates sexual abnormality.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-300.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">For these reasons, I agree with the majority opinion that we should reverse and remand for a mental examination and resentencing pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-300.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
