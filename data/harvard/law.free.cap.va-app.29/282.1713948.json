Appellant also entered a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>to one count of conspiracy to commit robbery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-22. On appeal, he argues that his plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>did not constitute a waiver of his right to appeal the conspiracy charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">On August 18,1997, five felony warrants were issued charging appellant with two counts of robbery, two counts of use of a firearm in the commission of robbery and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery. Appellant waived his right to a preliminary hearing on the charges, and the grand jury returned indictments on each of the five felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The parties entered a stipulation of facts and on November 25, 1997, appellant pled guilty to both robbery counts and one of the firearm charges. He received ten years on each robbery count. The court ordered the terms to be served concurrently. He also received three years on the firearm charge, which was to be served consecutive to the robbery terms. The remaining two charges, conspiracy to commit robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of robbery, were continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">On February 10, 1998, appellant moved to dismiss the conspiracy charge, arguing that Code \u00a7 18.2-23.1<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> bars con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>viction when the accused has been convicted of the substantive offense. By letter opinion dated February 11, 1998, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">On March 2, 1998, pursuant to a plea agreement with the Commonwealth, appellant entered a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>to the conspiracy charge and a plea of guilty to the remaining firearm charge. The agreement, which included appellant\u2019s prior guilty pleas made on November 25, 1997, provided the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">1. That the defendant stands indicted in this Court for the following offenses: Conspiracy to Commit Robbery, Robbery (Two Counts), and Use of Firearm in the Commission of Robbery (Two Counts) in violation of section(s) 18.2-22, 18.2-58, and 18.2-53.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">2.

That the Attorney for the Commonwealth and the <em>Attorney for the defendant agree </em>that the following sentence is the appropriate disposition in this case: The defendant shall be sentenced to serve ten years in the Virginia Department of Corrections on the Conspiracy and Robbery charges. Those sentences shall run concurrently to each other and consecutively to the sentences imposed on the firearm charges. The defendant shall be sentenced to serve three years on the first Use of a Firearm charge, and to serve five years on the second Use of a Firearm charge. Those sentences shall run consecutively to each other and to the sentences on the Robbery and Conspiracy charges____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">4.

Do you fully understand the charges against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">Q.

Yes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Following this colloquy, the trial court convicted appellant of both counts and sentenced appellant in accordance with the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Appellant contends that by entering a plea of <em>nolo contendere, </em>he did not waive his right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motion to dismiss the conspiracy charge. He argues that a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>should be distinguished from a guilty plea for the purpose of determining a waiver of his right to appeal. This argument presents an issue of first impression for this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-254 provides that the accused in a criminal proceeding \u201cmay plead not guilty, guilty, or nolo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>contendere\u201d upon arraignment for the offense \u201con which he will be tried.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-254.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A plea of guilty constitutes a \u201cself-supplied conviction.\u201d <em>Allen v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va. App. 726, 780, 501 S.E.2d 441, 443 (1998). On the other hand, a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>is neither \u201ca confession of guilt\u201d nor a \u201cdeclaration of innocence equivalent to a plea of not guilty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Jackson, </em>255 Va. 552, 555, 499 S.E.2d 276, 278 (1998). \u201cIt allows an accused, thinking it best ... not to submit to trial, but unwilling to confess the truth of the charge, [and] ... plead guilty, to throw[ ] himself on the mercy of the court ... without confessing or denying ... guilt.\u201d <em>Jefferson v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 477, 484-85, 500 S.E.2d 219, 223 (1998) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201cNonetheless, by entering [the] plea ..., the defendant implies a confession ... of the truth of the charge ... [and] agrees that the court may consider him guilty for the purpose of imposing judgment and sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485, 500 S.E.2d at 223 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u201cAlthough it is said that a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>means literally \u2018I do not contest it,\u2019 and \u2018is a mere statement of unwillingness to contest and no more,\u2019 it does admit \u2018every essential element of the offense [that is] well pleaded in the charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lott v. United States, </em>367 U.S. 421, 426, 81 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>1563, 6 L.Ed.2d 940 (1961) (citations omitted). \u201cHence, it is tantamount to \u2018an admission of guilt for the purposes of the case,\u2019 and \u2018nothing is left but to render judgment, for the obvious reason that in the face of the plea no issue of fact exists, and none can be made while the plea remains of record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u201cWhen an accused enters a voluntary and intelligent <em>plea of guilty </em>to an offense, he waives all defenses except those jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Savino v. Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 534, 538, 391 S.E.2d 276, 278 (1990) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">\u201c[A] voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty by an accused is, in reality, a self-supplied conviction authorizing imposition of the punishment fixed by law. It is a waiver of all defenses other than those jurisdictional, effective as such not only in the lower court but as well in this court. Where a conviction is rendered upon such a plea and the punishment fixed by law is in fact imposed in a proceeding free of jurisdictional defect, there is nothing to app\u00e9al. To take any other view would give recognition to an empty right and permit frivolous appeals for the mere sake of delay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 539, 391 S.E.2d at 278 (quoting <em>Peyton v. King, </em>210 Va. 194, 196-97, 169 S.E.2d 569, 571 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Additionally, \u201c[o]ne who voluntarily and intelligently pleads guilty waives important constitutional rights, including his right to trial by jury, his right against self-incrimination, his right to demand that the Commonwealth prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and his right to object to illegally obtained evidence.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>27 Va.App. at 730-31, 501 S.E.2d at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">In the instant case, appellant concedes that when an accused enters a plea of guilty, the accused waives his or her right to appeal non-jurisdictional issues. However, appellant argues that by entering a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>to the conspiracy charge, he effectively preserved his right to appeal the trial court\u2019s decision denying his motion to dismiss. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>We have on prior occasions held that a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>carries with it some of the same consequences as a plea of guilty. In <em>Jefferson, </em>we held that the pleas of guilty and <em>nolo contendere </em>are treated \u201calike in the context of a motion to withdraw\u201d a plea under Code \u00a7 19.2-296. <em>Jefferson, </em>27 Va.App. at 485, 500 S.E.2d at 223. In <em>Allen, </em>we held that \u201cthe plea of <em>nolo contendere, </em>or no contest, [was] equivalent to a plea of guilty\u201d for purposes of determining whether the plea was entered voluntarily, intelligently and knowingly. <em>Allen, </em>27 Va.App. at 729 n. 1, 501 S.E.2d at 443 n. 1. <em>See also Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 357, 363, 499 S.E.2d 11, 14 (1998) (holding that \u201ca trial court may consider a defendant\u2019s lack of remorse at sentencing, even when the defendant has chosen to enter an <em>Alford </em>[or <em>nolo contendere </em>] plea\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">While we have not expressly addressed this precise issue, several of our sister states have found no distinction between a plea of guilty and <em>nolo contendere </em>for the purpose of determining a waiver of the right to appeal. For example, in <em>State v. Arnsberg, </em>27 Ariz.App. 205, 553 P.2d 238 (1976), the Court of Appeals of Arizona held that when a defendant enters a plea of no contest, he or she waives all non-jurisdictional defenses preceding the entry of the plea. <em>See id. </em>at 240. In <em>Amsberg, </em>the defendant pled no contest to one count of possession of marijuana for sale. Prior to entering his plea, the defendant filed a pretrial motion to suppress the evidence, which was denied by the trial court. On appeal, the Court of Appeals considered \u201cwhether a defendant may raise issues concerning a denial of his motion to suppress evidence following a plea of no contest,\u201d and concluded that the trial court\u2019s decision could not be challenged because the defendant had waived his right to appeal by entering a plea of no contest. <em>Id. </em>at 238. The Court of Appeals reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">We think that the consequences of a no contest plea parallel closely the results following a plea of guilty. One of the consequences flowing from a plea of guilty is the foreclosure by the defendant of an argument on appeal that the ruling by the trial court on a motion to suppress was erroneous. Because the consequence of a plea of guilty and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>no contest are the same, does the same principle apply to an attack of the trial judge\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress following a plea of no contest? We believe it does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">We hold, therefore, that when a defendant enters a plea of no contest he waivers, [sic] as is true with respect to a guilty plea, all non-jurisdictional defenses preceding the entry, of the plea, and he may not by express stipulation or otherwise, reserve for appeal non-jurisdictional defects under such a plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 239-40 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Gilnite, </em>202 Conn. 369, 521 A.2d 547 (1987), the Supreme Court of Connecticut held that \u201can unconditional nolo contendere plea, when intelligently and voluntarily made, operates as a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects and bars later challenges to pretrial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550. In <em>Gilnite, </em>the defendant was convicted on a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>of being a \u201cpersistent larceny offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548. On appeal to the appellate court, she argued that the trial court erred in denying her motion to dismiss the charge. The appellate court raised <em>sua sponte </em>the issue of waiver and held that by pleading <em>nolo contendere </em>the defendant waived her right to appeal the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>See id. </em>On appeal from the appellate court, the Supreme Court of Connecticut affirmed and held that \u201c[a] plea of nolo contendere has virtually the same legal effect as a guilty plea; the only practical difference is that a nolo contendere plea may not be used as an admission in a subsequent criminal or civil case. It is clear, however, that a nolo contendere plea also constitutes a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects in the same manner as a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Finally, in <em>Walker v. United States, </em>481 A.2d 1308 (D.CApp. 1984) (per curiam), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that the defendant\u2019s voluntary plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>foreclosed the possibility of seeking appellate review of his convictions. In that case, the defendant challenged the sufficiency of evidence used to convict him of two counts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>robbery. He also argued that the trial court erred in failing to observe the time limitations of the speedy trial statute. <em>See id. </em>at 1309. The Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[a] plea of nolo contendere is an admission of guilt for the purposes of that case and removes from the trial court\u2019s consideration all issues of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court of Appeals held that \u201c[b]y entering a voluntary plea of nolo contendere, [the defendant] foreclosed himself from seeking appellate review of his contentions of evidentiary insufficiency and violation of the Federal Speedy Trial Act.\u201d <em>Id.; see also State v. Hodge, </em>118 N.M. 410, 882 P.2d 1, 5 (1994) (\u201c[A] plea of ... nolo contendere, when voluntarily made after advice of counsel and with full understanding of the consequences, waives objections to prior defects in the proceedings and also operates as a waiver of statutory or constitutional rights, including the right to appeal.\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. Jannetta, </em>413 Pa.Super. 334, 605 A.2d 386, 388 (1992) (\u201cFor purposes of appellate review, this Court treats a plea of nolo contendere the same as a guilty plea.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Other states have simply adopted the general rule that a defendant may not appeal \u201cnon-jurisdictional\u201d issues following a plea of <em>nolo contendere. See, e.g., People v. Arwood, </em>165 Cal.App.3d 167, 211 Cal-Rptr. 307, 309-10 (1985) (\u201cThe merits of the issue of guilt or innocence are not reviewable on appeal of a judgment entered on [a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>]. The only issues cognizable on appeal following entry of ... a nolo contendere plea are those based upon constitutional, jurisdictional, or other grounds going to the legality of the proceedings____\u201d); <em>Hughes v. State, </em>565 So.2d 354, 355 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.1990) (per curiam) (dismissing appeal from plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>because the defendant failed \u201cto present a justiciable issue\u201d); <em>Lill v. State, </em>4 Kan.App.2d 40, 602 P.2d 129, 130-31 (1979) (\u201cA conviction based on a plea of nolo contendere may be collaterally attacked only on \u2018jurisdictional or other grounds going to the legality of the proceedings.... \u2019 \u201d); <em>Stevens v. State, </em>938 S.W.2d 517, 520 (Tex.App.1997) (holding that a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence was a \u201cnon-jurisdictional\u201d issue that could not be appealed because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>defendant entered a plea of <em>nolo </em>contendere); <em>State v. Smith, </em>833 P.2d 371, 372 (Utah App.1992) (\u201cA voluntary plea of guilty or no contest constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal all non-jurisdictional issues, including denial of a motion to suppress.\u201d); <em>Davila v. State, </em>831 P.2d 204, 205 (Wyo.1992) (\u201cA plea of nolo contendere has the same effect in criminal cases as a guilty plea. As a guilty plea waives all non-jurisdictional defenses, so does a plea of nolo contendere.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Wayne R. LaFave <em>&amp; </em>Jerold H. Israel, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 10.2(d), at 787 (1984) (\u201cA plea of guilty \u2018is an admission of guilt and a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects.\u2019 It \u2018represents a break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process,\u2019 and thus once a valid plea is received defendant may not appeal on the ground that his earlier suppression motion was erroneously denied. The same is true for a valid nolo contendere plea.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In Virginia, \u201c[w]hen an accused enters a voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty to an offense, he waives all defenses except those jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Savino, </em>239 Va. at 538, 391 S.E.2d at 278. We hold the same is true when an accused enters a plea of <em>nolo contendere. </em>In the instant case, by entering a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>to the conspiracy charge, appellant foreclosed the opportunity to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motion to dismiss. Accordingly, we dismiss his appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-11\">. Appellant also argues that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to dismiss the conspiracy charge because Code \u00a7 18.2-23.1 bars conviction when the accused has been convicted of the substantive offense. Because of the procedural posture of the case, we do not reach the merits of the second claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"APq\">.

At the March 2, 1998 trial, the parties debated at length the effect of a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>on appellant\u2019s right to appeal, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-19\">[COUNSEL]: [W]e\u2019re pleading no contest on that to preserve our right of appeal.
