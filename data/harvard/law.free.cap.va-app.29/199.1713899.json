On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in: (1) denying his motion to strike three prospective jurors for cause; and (2) denying him the opportunity to question the complaining witness about her testimony in a prior rape case. Because we hold that the trial court erred by both refusing to strike two prospective jurors and in improperly limiting Brown\u2019s cross-examination, we reverse his convictions and remand to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">On May 4, 1997, at approximately 2:00 a.m., the victim, who we shall designate as Jane Doe, exited a parked car and approached a police officer claiming that Ronald Jackson Brown, appellant, had sexually assaulted her. Because Brown has limited his appeal to whether the trial court erred in refusing to strike three jurors and whether the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to cross-examine the complaining witness about her testimony in a prior rape case, our recitation of the relevant facts is confined to these two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">At trial during <em>voir dire, </em>Brown\u2019s attorney moved to strike for cause three prospective jurors. The court denied each motion. In addition, during his cross-examination of Jane Doe, Brown\u2019s attorney attempted to question her about her testimony in a 1989 rape case. Ruling that this question was inadmissible pursuant to the \u201crape shield statute,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7, the court refused to allow it. On September 23, 1997, the jury convicted Brown of attempted rape, forcible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>sodomy, animate object sexual penetration, abduction, robbery and assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\n<em>MOTION TO STRIKE PROSPECTIVE JURORS FOR CAUSE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The right of an accused to a trial by an impartial jury is a constitutional right guaranteed under both the United States Constitution and the Virginia Constitution. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. VI; Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8. The Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia as well as legislative enactments reinforce this guarantee. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-357; 8.01-358; 19.2-260 <em>et seq.; </em>Rule 3A:14(a). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s decision whether to strike a prospective juror for cause is a matter submitted to its sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal unless it appears from the record that the trial court\u2019s action constitutes manifest error.\u201d <em>Stockton v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 192, 200, 402 S.E.2d 196, 200, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 902, 112 S.Ct. 280, 116 L.Ed.2d 231 (1991). The trial court has the \u201copportunity to observe each juror\u2019s demeanor when evaluating the juror\u2019s responses to the questions of counsel and the questions of the trial court.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 200, 402 S.E.2d at 200. \u201cAny reasonable doubt regarding the prospective juror\u2019s ability to give the accused a fair and impartial trial must be resolved in favor of the accused.\u201d <em>Gosling v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 642, 645, 376 S.E.2d 541, 544 (1989) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">It is irrelevant whether counsel uses a peremptory strike to remove a juror who should have been stricken for cause by the court. <em>See Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>1 Va.App. 447, 450, 339 S.E.2d 899, 900 (1986). \u201c[I]t is prejudicial error ... to force a defendant to use the peremptory strike ... to exclude a venireman who is not free from exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451, 339 S.E.2d at 900-01 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">A. <em>PROSPECTIVE JUROR NO. 1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">During <em>voir dire, </em>Brown\u2019s counsel moved to strike Prospective Juror No. 1 for cause. Prospective Juror No. 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>stated that she had been a victim of an attempted abduction and a possible attempted sexual assault and that the suspect in her case was never found. The following exchange then took place between the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney and Prospective Juror No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">[COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Okay. Is there anything about your experience \u2014 some of the charges today, as you\u2019ve heard, are sexual offenses and an abduction \u2014 is there anything about your experiences having been a victim of a similar crime and making a report to the police that would give you a bias in this case either for or against?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0D\">[PROSPECTIVE JUROR NO. 1]: I don\u2019t honestly know. I would hope not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">[COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY]: You would keep an open mind and decide the case based solely on the evidence that you hear today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">[PROSPECTIVE JUROR NO. 1]: We would all try to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">[COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">At the close of the initial <em>voir dire, </em>Brown\u2019s counsel moved to strike Prospective Juror No. 1 for cause. The court then conducted additional <em>voir dire </em>of Prospective Juror No. 1. The following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">THE COURT: Okay. Now, [Prospective Juror No. 1], the way I understand it, you feel like you were the subject of an attempted abduction; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">[PROSPECTIVE JUROR NO. 1]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-12\">THE COURT: Okay. Now, in responding to questions of counsel as to whether or not you would be able to hear this case fairly on the evidence that\u2019s presented and the law that I give you, your answer was that you hope so and that you hope everybody would do the same thing. That\u2019s just not good enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-13\">We need to know either you can or you can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aan\">[PROSPECTIVE JUROR NO. 1]: Well, I\u2019m trying to give you an honest answer, your Honor, because I haven\u2019t served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>in that situation before on a jury. So I can only \u2014 I can only be hypothetical. I think that I would be fair as a juror. That\u2019s the best that I can respond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">THE COURT: But you\u2019re not sure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">[PROSPECTIVE JUROR NO. 1]: I \u2014 I\u2014I don\u2019t see how I could \u2014 I mean I\u2019m not clairvoyant. I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">THE COURT: Well, you know yourself. All I\u2019m trying to find out is if you\u2019re chosen for the jury and you go back in there, are you going to let this business about the abduction come in between you and facts of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">[PROSPECTIVE JUROR NO. 1]: I have no reason to believe it would influence. I\u2019m sure\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney then questioned Prospective Juror No. 1 again and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9o\">[COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Just to clarify, I think the Court\u2019s last question sort of gets to it. You\u2019re going to hear evidence today. You\u2019re going to be instructed as to the law, and then you\u2019re going to go back and deliberate, and in your deliberations of course, you\u2019re instructed to only consider the evidence that\u2019s introduced today at trial, and would you be able to decide this case considering only that evidence and completely putting out of your mind any personal experience you may have had in an attempted abduction or attempted sexual assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfI\">[PROSPECTIVE JUROR NO. 1]: I don\u2019t know how to answer other than I have \u2014 I think that I would. I would do my best to. I mean I\u2019ve never been in that situation before. When it\u2019s a question of unpleasant memories impinging on one\u2019s \u2014 one\u2019s intuitive feelings, there may be feelings there that would not influence me, but there might be feelings there nonetheless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\">I would hope that I would do my duty and really look at the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-11\">[COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Do you feel sitting here right now that the personal experience biases you against the Defendant in this case, that you bring that into the case with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>[PROSPECTIVE JUROR NO. 1]: No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Brown\u2019s counsel then conducted the following inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: [Prospective Juror No. 1] ... [y]ou had said that as a result of your \u2014 as a result of what you experienced that there were some unpleasant memories, and just to clarify, you were concerned that if you heard certain facts in this case \u2014 and of course, you don\u2019t know what they are \u2014 but if you heard certain facts that, for instance, may sound similar to the experience you had, that then those memories could intrude, which would be understandable ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">[PROSPECTIVE JUROR NO. 1]: I would hope that even if there were unpleasant connotations, that that would not interfere with my judgment to go by the evidence. [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">[PROSPECTIVE JUROR NO. 1]: Jury duty is public service. It\u2019s not entertainment. It\u2019s here to do your duty. [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It is, absolutely, and in an attempt to bring it \u2014 to sort of ground it a little bit, having heard all of these charges and all of this talk, can you still look over at Ron Brown and figure there\u2019s an innocent man? Haven\u2019t heard anything from the Commonwealth yet. There sits an innocent man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">[PROSPECTIVE JUROR NO. 1]: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">The court stated that it was satisfied with Prospective Juror No. l\u2019s responses and overruled Brown\u2019s motion to strike her for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">To guarantee compliance with the United States and Virginia Constitutions,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">[a prospective juror] must be able to give [the accused] a fair and impartial trial. Upon this point nothing should be left to inference or doubt. All the tests applied by the courts, all the enquiries made into the state of the juror\u2019s mind, are merely to ascertain whether he comes to the trial free from partiality and prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>If there be a reasonable doubt whether the juror possess these qualifications, that doubt is sufficient to insure his exclusion. For ... it is not only important that justice should be impartially administered, but it should also flow through channels as free from suspicion as possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><em>Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 297, 298, 227 S.E.2d 734, 735 (1976) (citation omitted). In <em>Clements v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 386, 464 S.E.2d 534 (1995), we reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction of attempted forcible sodomy, holding that the trial court erred in refusing to strike for cause a juror whose responses in <em>voir dire </em>revealed \u201creasonable doubt\u201d about his impartiality. <em>Id. </em>at 393, 464 S.E.2d at 537. The prospective juror in <em>Clements </em>admitted that he had heard something about the case \u201ctogether with the fact that a relative had been the victim of a sex crime\u201d which would cause him \u201csome sort of slight predisposition against people who are charged with sexual offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 464 S.E.2d at 537-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In <em>Clements, </em>the prospective juror \u201cthroughout his <em>voir dire, ... </em>spoke honestly, showing no unwillingness to serve. However, those honest answers disclosed his equivocation and revealed doubt that he would be able to render a fair verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 464 S.E.2d at 538. Although the court and the Commonwealth both attempted to rehabilitate the juror, \u201c[i]n our review, we must consider the entire <em>voir dire </em>rather than its isolated parts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392-93, 464 S.E.2d at 537. We held that \u201cthe admissions created a reasonable doubt that [the juror] would come indifferent to the cause,\u201d and we reversed and remanded the case. <em>Id. </em>at 393, 464 S.E.2d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">We reached a similar holding in <em>Moten v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 956, 420 S.E.2d 250 (1992). In <em>Moten, </em>the trial court refused to strike for cause a prospective juror in a trial for multiple indictments of possession and distribution of cocaine. During <em>voir dire, </em>the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney asked whether charges of possession and distribution of cocaine \u201ccaused a problem with anyone.\u201d One prospective juror admitted that her husband was \u201ca recovering drug addict\u201d and that she considered drugs to be a \u201ctouchy\u201d subject. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>957, 420 S.E.2d at 251. Although she then stated that her experiences would not prohibit her from acting impartially in this case, we held that the trial court erred in refusing to strike her for cause. 'We reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions, stating that, although \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s ruling will not be disturbed unless there is a showing of manifest error,\u201d the prospective juror\u2019s responses \u201cclearly indicated to the court that due to her husband\u2019s drug problem, her performance as a juror might be impaired by her personal feelings regarding drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 958, 420 S.E.2d at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Here, Prospective Juror No. 1 expressed numerous reservations about her ability to serve impartially on the jury in light of her personal experiences. Nearly all of Prospective Juror No. l\u2019s responses contained the phrases, \u201cI think,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d and \u201cI would try.\u201d Her responses indicated a great degree of equivocation and created reasonable doubt about her fitness as a juror. Because all doubts about the fitness of a juror to serve must be resolved in favor of the accused, we hold that the court erred in refusing to strike Prospective Juror No. 1 for cause. <em>See Gosling, </em>7 Va.App. at 645, 376 S.E.2d at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">B. <em>PROSPECTIVE JUROR NO. 2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Brown also moved to strike Prospective Juror No. 2 for cause. Prospective Juror No. 2 stated during <em>voir dire </em>that he was Chief Counsel to the United States Secret Service. When Brown\u2019s counsel asked whether any venire member would agree with the statement that, \u201c[a] rape charge wouldn\u2019t be brought by a woman that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Prospective Juror No. 2 stated, \u201cI don\u2019t agree with that statement, but I in honesty should say that my whole career has been in law enforcement. So I do tend to view things from the law enforcement perspective.\u201d He also stated twice that he \u201chad a great deal of faith\u201d in law enforcement officers and prosecutors and that, as a result, he might give more weight to an officer\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Prospective Juror No. 2 asserted that although he did not believe a defendant is always guilty, he admitted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">I think it\u2019s a fair statement, and I do feel that it would be unusual that the police would make an arrest, that there would be an indictment, and that it would get all the way to trial \u2014 the great likelihood, based on my experience, is, yes, the person probably did it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Prospective Juror No. 2 stated, however, that he could \u201clisten to the particular individual trial.\u201d The trial judge denied Brown\u2019s motion to strike Prospective Juror No. 2 for cause, stating that Prospective Juror No. 2 would do \u201cproper service in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">In <em>David v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 77, 493 S.E.2d 379 (1997), we held that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to strike a prospective juror for cause. In <em>David, </em>a prospective juror stated that she had some friends in a local county police department and that she had been the victim of two unrelated crimes. She stated, \u201cI can sit impartially, but I would probably tend to prosecute to the max because of my experiences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, 493 S.E.2d at 380. She then indicated that \u201cas a victim among other things\u201d she would be more likely to listen to the prosecution\u2019s case. The court then conducted an individual colloquy with the prospective juror in an attempt to rehabilitate her as a member of the jury panel. We reversed and remanded for a new trial, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">[t]he true test of impartiality lies in the juror\u2019s mental attitude. Furthermore, proof that she is impartial must come from her uninfluenced by persuasion or coercion. The evidence used to show the requisite qualifications must emanate from the juror herself, unsuggested by leading questions posed to her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 81, 493 S.E.2d at 381 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">In <em>Breeden, </em>217 Va. 297, 227 S.E.2d 734, the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed and remanded the defendant\u2019s conviction of abduction and murder, holding that a prospective juror should have been dismissed for cause from the venire. In <em>Breeden, </em>a prospective juror admitted that she had read about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the crime in the newspaper and was \u201cglad that the person was caught.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299 n. *, 227 S.E.2d at 736 n. *. She also stated that \u201c[i]n my mind there must have been strong evidence to be arrested,\u201d and agreed that \u201cthe fact that [the defendant] is here is strong indication that he is guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>She asserted her belief that the defendant would have to prove his innocence, rather than requiring the Commonwealth to prove his guilt. <em>See id. </em>Although the prospective juror stated that she could follow the judge\u2019s instructions in applying the facts to the law, the Supreme Court held that it was error for the trial court to have refused to strike her for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Here, Prospective Juror No. 2\u2019s position as Chief Counsel to the United States Secret Service does not alone disqualify him from jury service. <em>See Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 338, 356 S.E.2d 157, 171 (1987) (association with law enforcement personnel is alone insufficient to strike a prospective juror for cause). However, his admission that he usually \u201cview[ed] things from a law enforcement perspective,\u201d and his belief that it was unlikely that a case would go to trial if the accused was not guilty created a reasonable doubt about his ability to sit impartially on a jury. All reasonable doubts must be resolved in favor of the accused. See <em>Gosling, 7 </em>Va.App. at 645, 376 S.E.2d at 544. The trial court, therefore, erred in refusing to strike for cause Prospective Juror No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">C. <em>PROSPECTIVE JUROR NO. 3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Brown moved to strike Prospective Juror No. 3 for cause. The trial judge asked whether any of the jurors knew Brown or either counsel. Prospective Juror No. 3 stated that she knew the appellant \u201cfrom the area,\u201d but not as a friend, acquaintance, or relation. She stated that her knowledge of Brown would not interfere with her ability to give him and the Commonwealth a fair trial. Brown\u2019s counsel moved to strike Prospective Juror No. 3 for cause on the ground that because she knew Brown \u201cfrom the area\u201d and \u201che has a very long criminal record ... she would be introducing that to the jury room.\u201d The court, however, denied the motion to strike for cause. On appeal, Brown\u2019s counsel objects both to the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>refusal to strike Prospective Juror No. 3 for cause and the court\u2019s failure to conduct any <em>voir dire </em>to ascertain Prospective Juror No. 3\u2019s level of knowledge about Brown\u2019s past. Brown also argues that the court\u2019s error was not cured by the Commonwealth\u2019s removal of Prospective Juror No. 3 with its fourth peremptory strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In a prior case, we held that a trial court did not err as a matter of law in refusing to strike two prospective jurors who stated during <em>voir dire </em>that they had read in the newspaper about the defendant\u2019s prior trial. <em>See Foster v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 313, 369 S.E.2d 688 (1988). In <em>Foster, </em>two of the prospective jurors remembered details from a previous trial involving the defendant taking pictures of nude children. We held that because the jurors stated they did not know the outcome of the first trial and could \u201cset aside their knowledge and decide the case on the evidence presented at trial\u201d the court was not plainly wrong in refusing to strike either juror for cause. <em>Id. </em>at 330-31, 369 S.E.2d at 699. Rather, we held that the trial court\u2019s finding is \u201centitled to great weight and should be set aside only for plain error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330, 369 S.E.2d at 698 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Here, Prospective Juror No. 3 did not state that she had any knowledge of Brown\u2019s alleged criminal history, nor did she state that she had heard rumors about him in the neighborhood. Prospective Juror No. 3\u2019s admission that she knew Brown \u201cfrom the area\u201d is not alone sufficient to disqualify her from jury service. Prospective Juror No. 3 stated that her knowledge of Brown would not prohibit her from giving him a fair trial, and any speculation concerning what she knew about Brown is not supported by Prospective Juror No. 3\u2019s answers. Her knowledge of Brown, as revealed in <em>voir dire, </em>falls far short of the information disclosed by the prospective jurors in <em>Foster, </em>in which we upheld the court\u2019s refusal to strike for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Brown also argues that the court erred when it failed to conduct additional <em>voir dire </em>of Prospective Juror No. 3 to determine the extent of her knowledge of Brown\u2019s criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>history or rumors of criminal activity. However, Brown\u2019s counsel neither asked these questions nor requested that the court do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Brown correctly asserts that the Commonwealth\u2019s use of its fourth peremptory strike to remove Prospective Juror No. 3 does not cure any prejudice caused to him. A Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge to remove a prospective juror who should have been stricken for cause will not cure any possible prejudice caused to an accused. <em>See Brooks v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 523, 530-31, 484 S.E.2d 127, 130 (1997); <em>DeHart v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 213, 216, 456 S.E.2d 133, 134 (1995). \u201c[A] defendant [is] entitled to a jury panel free from exception.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>24 Va.App. at 530, 484 S.E.2d at 130. If a venireman who should have been removed for cause is allowed to remain on the jury panel, the accused is \u201cdenied the opportunity of having another impartial person on his jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 484 S.E.2d at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge to remove Prospective Juror No. 3 would not have cured any prejudice to Brown if the juror should have been stricken for cause. On this record, we find that the trial court did not err in refusing to strike Prospective Juror No. 3 for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\n<em>\u201cRAPE SHIELD\u201d STATUTE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Brown argues that the trial court improperly limited his cross-examination of Jane Doe. Brown argues that Doe\u2019s statements to the police officer and her testimony at trial were very similar to testimony she gave in an unrelated rape trial in 1989, reported in <em>Glymph v. Commonwealth, </em>Record No. 1435-89-4 (Va. Ct.App. June 18, 1991). Brown sought to question Doe about her testimony in <em>Glymph. </em>The Commonwealth argued that this type of questioning was prohibited on the basis of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7 (\u201crape shield\u201d law). The trial court agreed and refused to allow Brown\u2019s counsel to question her about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">\u201cIn criminal prosecutions a man hath a right ... to call for evidence in his favor.\u201d Va. Const, art.

Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 316, 322, 469 S.E.2d 90, 93 (1996) (citation omitted). \u201cCombined, the rights to compulsory process, confrontation and due process give the defendant a constitutional right to present evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322, 469 S.E.2d at 93 (citing <em>Neeley v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 349, 356, 437 S.E.2d 721, 725 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7, referred to as the \u201crape shield\u201d law, excludes evidence in sexual assault cases,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACp\">of the \u201cgeneral reputation ... of the complaining witness\u2019s unchaste character or prior sexual conduct\u201d ... [which is] defined as \u201cany sexual conduct on the part of the complaining witness which took place before the conclusion of the trial, excluding the conduct involved in the offense alleged under this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-6\"><em>Clinebell v. Commonwealth, </em>235 Va. 319, 322, 368 S.E.2d 263, 264 (1988). The \u201crape shield\u201d law requires a defendant seeking to introduce evidence of a victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct to request an evidentiary hearing before such evidence can be elicited at trial. Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7(C). The Commonwealth contends that any testimony given by Jane Doe in a prior reported rape case necessarily constitutes evidence of \u201cprior sexual conduct.\u201d On the ground that Brown failed to request an evidentiary hearing prior to trial to determine admissibility of Doe\u2019s prior testimony, the Commonwealth also argues that the trial court properly refused to allow such questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In <em>Clinebell, </em>the defendant was convicted of five counts of sexual misconduct involving his daughter. He appealed, arguing that under the \u201crape shield\u201d law the court had improperly excluded evidence of certain prior statements made by his daughter. The daughter\u2019s statements included various references she made to a classmate that she was pregnant, that her father and her uncle had raped her, that another boy had impregnated her, and that her paternal grandfather had mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>lested her. <em>See id. </em>at 321-22, 368 S.E.2d at 264. The defendant argued that by introducing her statements, he was not attempting to prove that his daughter \u201chas engaged in \u2018prior sexual conduct\u2019 or that she has unchaste character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322, 368 S.E.2d at 264. Reversing the convictions, the Supreme Court of Virginia stated: \u201cHe seeks to prove for impeachment purposes that his daughter makes false statements concerning sexual behavior. We conclude that such statements are not \u2018conduct\u2019 within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322, 368 S.E.2d at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Brown also cites <em>State v. Lampley, </em>859 S.W.2d 909 (Mo.Ct. App.1993), in which the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions for two counts of sodomy involving his stepdaughter, holding that the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to cross-examine her about a previous complaint of sexual abuse by another person. Missouri has enacted a statute, codified at Mo. Rev. Stat \u00a7 491.015 (1986), which is intended to protect a victim in a rape prosecution from being questioned about prior sexual conduct. Brown argues that the legislative intent and the language of the Missouri statute are substantially similar to Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7, and, therefore, that Missouri law is instructive in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In <em>Lampley, </em>the defendant argued that the stepdaughter\u2019s previous complaint of sexual abuse was relevant to show \u201cprevious knowledge of sexual matters and how she benefited [sic] from the prior complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 910. The evidence showed that the prior abuse complaint resulted in removal of the subject of the complaint from the stepdaughter\u2019s house. <em>See id. </em>at 911. The defendant argued that the stepdaughter did not like him and \u201caccusing him of sexual molestation was a way of getting him out of her home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>defendant argued that he should have been allowed to question his stepdaughter about the prior complaint to determine if she had any possible motive to fabricate the complaint against him. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The Missouri Court of Appeals reversed his convictions, holding that the defendant \u201cnever indicated an intention to go into prior sexual conduct ... [and it was] not the stated subject of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held that a limited inquiry about the prior complaint would have been permissible if it was confined to \u201cshow motive to fabricate and never implicate [the statute].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 912. Therefore, \u201cthe trial court view that reference to the prior incident is \u2018totally irrelevant\u2019 is patently wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Evidence which \u201ctends to cast any light upon the subject of inquiry is relevant.\u201d <em>Rader v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 325, 331, 423 S.E.2d 207, 211 (1992) (citations omitted). \u201cRelevant evidence \u2018which has the tendency to add force and effect to a party\u2019s defense is admissible, unless excluded by a specific rule or policy consideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Evans v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 118, 122, 415 S.E.2d 851, 853-54 (1992) (citations omitted). In <em>Evans, </em>we held that the trial court erred in excluding evidence that the complaining witness had contracted a venereal disease and that she had knowledge of the disease. In reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction for rape, we held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7 ... does not exclude the type of evidence which Evans offered. Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7 narrowly limits the admissibility of relevant \u201cevidence of specific instances of [the complaining witness\u2019s] prior sexual conduct\u201d to very carefully delineated situations. Consequently, where relevant evidence of the complaining witness\u2019s prior sexual conduct does not fit within the specific exceptions set forth in the statute, it is not admissible. However, where relevant evidence is not of prior sexual \u201cconduct,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7 does not apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 122-23, 415 S.E.2d at 854 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Jane Doe\u2019s testimony in this case bore many striking similarities to her earlier testimony in <em>Glymph. </em>In both cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Doe claimed that she did not know her attacker prior to the day of each incident. In both cases, Doe drove each man around in her own automobile and admittedly spent time talking with each. She also testified that she voluntarily consumed alcoholic beverages and socialized with each man prior to the alleged attacks. In each case, Doe stated that she requested and was permitted to go to the bathroom after each man had started to molest her. Such substantial similarities may suggest fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">We hold that the evidence of Doe\u2019s testimony in <em>Glymph </em>does not fall within the definition of \u201cprior sexual conduct\u201d set out in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7. Brown did not seek to introduce evidence of any sexual acts in which Doe was involved. Neither did Brown seek to introduce a prior false statement made by Doe regarding previous sexual behavior. <em>See Clinebell, </em>235 Va. 319, 368 S.E.2d 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Brown\u2019s counsel sought to question Doe about prior testimony, not her prior conduct. Furthermore, the testimony sought was not about sexual conduct. Brown\u2019s counsel asked Doe questions relating to what allegedly occurred between Brown and Doe prior to .any possible sexual conduct. After Doe responded to these questions, Brown\u2019s counsel attempted to ask Doe if what she described constituted \u201ca strikingly] similar story to the story you told in a rape case in 1989 \u2014 .\u201d The Commonwealth objected to this question, citing the \u201crape shield\u201d law. The court sustained the objection. The similarities between Doe\u2019s prior testimony and her testimony in this case could have affected her credibility and evidenced possible fabrication of her testimony in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Evidence of prior testimony in an unrelated rape prosecution, when offered to show its substantial similarity for the purpose of testing the credibility of the witness, does not fall within the scope of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7. Therefore, the trial court erred in refusing to allow Brown to question Doe about her prior testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>For the reasons stated herein, we reverse and remand the case for retrial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-6\">.
