Pearce (Pearce) appeals the decision of the circuit court denying her motion to reinstate and for entry of a proposed qualified domestic relations order (\u201cQDRO\u201d) awarding her $84,000 from the retirement plan of Franklin W. Hoy, Jr. (Hoy). Pearce contends that, because the judgment was for unpaid spousal support, she was entitled under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>to seek a QDRO allowing her to recover her judgment from Hoy\u2019s pension plan. Upon reviewing the record and briefs of the parties, we conclude that this appeal is without merit. Accordingly, we summarily affirm the decision of the trial court. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:27.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Under the provisions of ERISA, \u201cbenefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1). Certain limited exceptions are carved to the anti-alienation provisions for a \u201cqualified domestic relations order.\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(A). Among the requirements for a QDRO are that the order be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">(ii) ... any judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-13\">(I) relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>(II) is <em>made pursuant to a State domestic relations law </em>(including a community property law).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The parties were divorced in 1973, prior to the adoption of Code \u00a7 20-107.3. In the final decree of divorce, Pearce was awarded $600 in monthly spousal support. Pearce was not awarded any interest in Hoy\u2019s retirement plan, which the record indicates did not exist at the time of the divorce. In 1985, Pearce received a judgment in the amount of $84,000 for spousal support arrearages. In 1997, Pearce filed a motion seeking to reinstate the matter for entry of a QDRO allowing garnishment of Hoy\u2019s pension plan as a source for payment of the spousal support arrearages judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Pearce\u2019s motion for entry of a QDRO to allow her to have an interest in Hoy\u2019s pension is an attempt to reopen and modify the court\u2019s final decree of divorce. That is not allowed under Virginia law. <em>See, e.g., Wilson v. Wilson, </em>25 Va.App. 752, 757, 492 S.E.2d 495, 497 (1997). Rule 1:1 prohibits modification of \u201call final judgments, orders, and decrees\u201d twenty-one days after the date of entry. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(4) grants the court continuing jurisdiction to make \u201cany additional orders necessary to effectuate and enforce any order entered pursuant to this section,\u201d and allows courts to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">[mjodify any order entered in a case filed on or after July 1, 1982, intended to affect or divide any pension, profit-sharing or deferred compensation plan ... only for the purpose of establishing or maintaining the order as a qualified domestic relations order or to revise or conform its terms so as to effectuate the expressed intent of the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(4). However, the parties\u2019 final decree of divorce was entered prior to the effective date of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E). By its express terms, the section does not apply to orders entered prior to July 1,1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Moreover, \u201cCode \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(4) does not empower trial courts to make substantive modifications ... in the final divorce decree____\u201d <em>Caudle v. Caudle, </em>18 Va.App. 795, 796, 447 S.E.2d 247, 248-49 (1994). When entering a QDRO, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>court may not \u201cmodify a final divorce decree simply to adjust its terms in light of the parties\u2019 changed circumstances\u201d; the QDRO must be \u201cconsistent with the substantive provisions of the original decree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 798, 447 S.E.2d at 249. <em>See also Fahey v. Fahey, </em>24 Va.App. 254, 256-57, 481 S.E.2d 496, 497 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201c[Ejntry of an order purporting to \u2018change the substance of the original order or provide an interest in a pension that was not provided in the order\u2019 would contravene the intent of the legislature in enacting this code section.\u201d <em>Newsome v. Newsome, </em>18 Va.App. 22, 26, 441 S.E.2d 346, 348 (1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Under Virginia domestic relations law, Pearce may not recast her claim as a judgment creditor, albeit one that seeks recovery of unpaid spousal support, into a QDRO which substantively modifies the terms of a final divorce decree. Therefore, under ERISA, the proposed order does not qualify as a QDRO. The cases appellant cites arise from other jurisdictions and have limited persuasive authority in interpreting Virginia statutory law.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is summarily affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
