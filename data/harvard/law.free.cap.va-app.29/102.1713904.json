Finding no error, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">On January 3, 1997 at approximately 9:15 p.m., Alexandria Police Officer Diane Gittins was working in a concealed location watching for drug violations, a practice known as \u201cspotting.\u201d Gittins had approximately 2,000 hours of past experience in \u201cspotting\u201d and had seen crack cocaine on at least 500 prior occasions. The area she had chosen was known for high incidence of drug possession and distribution and was well illuminated by streetlights. Using 20x80 binoculars located 25 to 50 feet above street level and from a distance of less than 100 feet, Gittins observed Armstrong walking down the street followed by two women.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">Without obstruction and with the aid of visual enhancement, Gittins saw Armstrong lift his right hand in front of his body and open his palm, exposing a \u201csmall, unpackaged, off-white, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>rock-like object\u201d smaller than a pencil eraser which she believed to be a rock of crack cocaine. Gittins testified that Armstrong looked at the rock of crack cocaine for several seconds then closed his hand and \u201cbrought it back down to his right side\u201d and proceeded to a vehicle with the two women.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Gittins then called for back-up officers to arrest Armstrong. She watched him enter a brown station wagon and observed the vehicle until it moved out of her view. She testified that several minutes later she saw the brown station wagon on the 200 block of North Payne Street. She called back-up officers to the location and gave them the same description of Armstrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Officer Chris Wimple testified that he responded to the radio call from Officer Gittins, arrested Armstrong and searched him incident to arrest. No contraband was recovered from his person. A female officer searched the two women who were with Armstrong, and no contraband was recovered from them. After all of the parties were searched, Wimple looked inside the station wagon and saw a small \u201coff-white, irregularly shaped, rock-like object\u201d on the floorboard on the passenger side. He believed it to be a rock of crack cocaine. A laboratory analysis later revealed it to be .15 grams of cocaine. Wimple testified that there were no other small, white, rock-like objects recovered from the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Wimple transported Armstrong to the police station, where Armstrong admitted that he was a drug user and was in the neighborhood to buy crack cocaine. He said that the two women had just purchased crack cocaine and he was intending to get a piece of crack cocaine from them for his own use but the police stopped him before he was able to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Prior to trial Armstrong moved to suppress the cocaine. The court denied his motion to suppress. At the conclusion of the evidence at trial, Armstrong moved to strike the evidence as being insufficient for conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">\u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u2018[t]he burden is upon [the defendant] to show that th[e] ruling, when the evidence is considered most favorably to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted). While we are bound to review <em>de novo </em>the ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause, we \u201creview findings of historical fact only for clear error<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and ... give due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996) (footnote added).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Armstrong argues that police did not have probable cause to arrest him.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">Probable cause is a flexible, common-sense standard, merely requiring that the facts available to the officer would warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that certain items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime; it does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxX\"><em>Texas v. Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 742, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983) (citations omitted). We have stated that experienced police officers \u201cmay be able to perceive and articulate meaning in given conduct which would be wholly innocent to the untrained observer.\u201d <em>Richards v. Commonwealth, 8 </em>Va. App. 612, 616, 383 S.E.2d 268, 270-71 (1989). \u201cIf an officer has reason to believe that a person is committing a felony in his [or her] presence by possessing contraband or a controlled substance, the officer has probable cause to arrest the individual without a warrant.\u201d <em>Buck v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 298, 304, 456 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Officer Gittins observed Armstrong in an area known for drug trafficking and possession, holding up for observation an \u201cunpackaged, off-white, rock-like object.\u201d Presumably, the object had value because Armstrong closed his fist to maintain control over it and proceeded to a parked car with his two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>female companions. Based upon her training and experience and the totality of the circumstances, Officer Gittins believed it was crack cocaine. Surely, had the officer been standing immediately adjacent to Armstrong and made these observations there would be no question about probable cause for arrest. Here, she was aided by enhanced vision to achieve the functional equivalent of standing immediately adjacent to Armstrong. The trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">This is a very simple matter. Either you believe or you do not believe that the officer is an expert in the identification of crack cocaine. The officer said that the individual involved was within 100 feet. The officer was using 20-power binoculars, which puts that person within the parameters of 5 to less feet from the officer at the time that the officer view[ed] the individual and his hand. The officer has seen crack cocaine hundreds if not thousands of times before. What difference does it make if it happens to be imitation crack cocaine. He is not required or she is not required to be absolutely right, but merely to have probable cause to believe that a crime is being committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Armstrong argues that Officer Gittins\u2019 observations may not be bolstered by the fact that the activities took place in a \u201chigh volume drug area.\u201d He cites <em>Riley v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 494, 412 S.E.2d 724 (1992), in which we stated that an officer may not use the \u201creputation of an area for proving \u2018guilt by association.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 412 S.E.2d at 726. In <em>Riley, </em>the officer \u201chad no prior knowledge of Riley or his possible involvement in any criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497, 412 S.E.2d at 726. The arresting officer testified that he had seen Riley \u201cin a high crime area late at night\u201d and that \u201c[w]hen Riley exited his vehicle and saw [the officer], Riley turned to face his own vehicle, made a motion toward the front of his waistband, and closed the door to his vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497, 412 S.E.2d at 726. We reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of cocaine holding that \u201c[the officer] had no particularized knowledge of [his] involvement in any criminal activity\u201d and that his \u201cobservations and suspicions were insufficient to justify an investigatory stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 412 S.E.2d at 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>In the case now before us, the question is not whether Officer Gittins had reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop Armstrong, but whether the officer had probable cause to arrest him for possession of cocaine. The officer did not rely upon the mere presence of Armstrong in a high drug area to create probable cause. Officer Gittins observed Armstrong with what she believed was a piece of crack cocaine in his hand. Therefore, Officer Gittins had reason to believe that a felony was being committed in her presence. \u201cIf an officer has reason to believe that a person is committing a felony in his [or her] presence by possessing contraband or a controlled substance, the officer has probable cause to arrest the individual without a warrant.\u201d <em>Buck, </em>20 Va.App. at 304, 456 S.E.2d at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Armstrong cites <em>Goodwin v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 363, 398 S.E.2d 690 (1990), in support of his argument that the conduct observed by Officer Gittins, \u201cwithout evidence of a transaction or even a conversation with a suspected drug dealer, constitutes innocent behavior.\u201d In <em>Goodwin, </em>the defendant entered a conditional guilty plea to possession of cocaine and possession of a concealed weapon, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress on the ground that the evidence was the product of an illegal search. Two police officers testified that they observed Goodwin in a \u201chigh crime area,\u201d and stated that when Goodwin saw them, he \u201c \u2018jammed\u2019 his hand into his coat pocket.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364-65, 398 S.E.2d at 691. The officers \u201cdid not see any item or article in Goodwin\u2019s hand or coat pocket.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365, 398 S.E.2d at 691. We reversed his convictions, holding that upon these grounds, \u201cthe police lacked adequate grounds to stop Goodwin, and ... the stop was illegal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 398 S.E.2d at 692. <em>Goodwin </em>is distinguished from the case before us in one very important respect. Officer Gittins observed Armstrong with what she believed was a piece of crack cocaine in his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Armstrong also argues that <em>Moss v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 305, 373 S.E.2d 170 (1988), supports his argument that Officer Gittins lacked probable cause to arrest Arm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>strong. In <em>Moss, </em>we reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of cocaine, holding that the police lacked probable cause or reasonable suspicion to detain him. The officer observed Moss standing on an intersection with \u201chis arms extended in front of him ... making a twisting motion with something between his fingers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306, 373 S.E.2d at 171. The officer admitted that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t make out what was in\u201d the defendant\u2019s hand. <em>Id. </em>at 308, 373 S.E.2d at 172. We held that because the officer\u2019s observations did not create an adequate basis upon which to stop Moss, \u201cthe stop was illegal and the cocaine seized as a result thereof was improperly admitted into evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308-09, 373 S.E.2d at 172. <em>Moss </em>is distinguished from the case before us in one very important respect. Officer Gittins observed Armstrong with what she believed was a piece of crack coc\u00e1ine in his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Armstrong also cites <em>DePriest v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 577, 359 S.E.2d 540 (1987), to support his argument that a finding of probable cause requires more than an officer\u2019s observation of a suspicious act. In <em>DePriest, </em>an experienced police officer observed a sequence of events which the Commonwealth argued was typical of a common form of narcotics transaction. However, the officer \u201cdid not observe suspected narcotics change hands, nor did he observe the exchange of any object which in his experience suggested narcotics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585, 359 S.E.2d at 544. In affirming DePriest\u2019s convictions, we held that although the officer\u2019s \u201cobservations and experience alone\u201d were insufficient to establish probable cause, they did amount to reasonable, articulable suspicion and the subsequent arrest of DePriest was not illegal. <em>Id. </em>at 584, 585-86, 359 S.E.2d at 543, 544. Unlike the facts in <em>DePriest, </em>however, here Officer Gittins saw the object in question and, based upon her training and experience and upon the totality of the circumstances, she did have probable cause to believe that the object was crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Armstrong maintains that the passage of five minutes between the direction to arrest him and the actual arrest undermines the probable cause determination. He argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>that \u201cthe test of constitutional validity is whether at the moment of arrest the arresting officer had knowledge of sufficient facts and circumstances to warrant a reasonable man in believing that an offense has been committed.\u201d <em>Bryson v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 85, 86-87, 175 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1970). In <em>Bryson, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia held that a police officer who observed a person on the street with a piece of paper under a rubber band on his finger did not have probable cause to arrest him for operation of a lottery under Code \u00a7 18.1-340 (repealed 1975), and reversed his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Armstrong contends that after Officer Gittins first observed him, he drove out of her sight and that when she next saw him, the officer did not see any objects in his hand, nor did she see him talk with anyone or buy anything. Based upon her testimony, Armstrong argues \u201c[a]t the moment just prior to arrest, when she called Officer Wimple to arrest Mr. Armstrong, Officer Gittins had no current knowledge of facts or circumstances to warrant any reasonable person to believe that Mr. Armstrong was committing a felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Armstrong\u2019s argument has no legal foundation. He seeks to impose a severe time limitation on the duration of probable cause by arguing that probable cause to arrest exists <em>only at the very moment </em>that the officer observes the occurrence of the criminal activity, and disappears immediately unless the arrest is effectuated at exactly that moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">At the moment that Officer Gittins called for Armstrong\u2019s arrest, her observations had created probable cause for Officer Wimple to arrest him. \u201cIf an officer has reason to believe that a person is committing a felony in his [or her] presence by possessing contraband or a controlled substance, the officer has probable cause to arrest the individual without a warrant.\u201d <em>Buck, </em>20 Va.App. at 304, 456 S.E.2d at 537. The passage of five minutes before the arrest was accomplished is of no legal significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The search of Armstrong\u2019s vehicle constituted a search incident to a lawful arrest. \u201cThe only prerequisites to a search of an automobile incident to arrest are that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>search is contemporaneous with the arrest and the arrestee\u2019s recent occupancy of the vehicle.\u201d <em>Glasco v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 763, 773, 497 S.E.2d 150, 154 (1998). Because Armstrong was in the vehicle when Officer Wimple arrested him and the search of the vehicle was immediate, the search of the vehicle was properly conducted incident to his arrest. In addition, \u201cif a car is readily mobile and probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment ... permits police to search the vehicle without more.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Labron &amp; Kilgore, </em>518 U.S. 938, 940, 116 S.Ct. 2485, 135 L.Ed.2d 1031 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Even if probable cause did not exist, Armstrong concedes that \u201cthe facts in the case at bar provide grounds for reasonable suspicion, at best\u201d for Wimple to conduct a <em>\u201cTerry </em>\u201d stop. Pursuant to a valid stop, the officer may ask the occupants of the vehicle to exit the vehicle. <em>See Hatcher v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 487, 419 S.E.2d 256 (1992). After Armstrong exited the car, the officer saw the crack cocaine in plain view on the passenger floorboard. Evidence may be seized when the officer is lawfully in a position to view the item and the illegal character of the object is immediately apparent to the officer. <em>See Conway v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 711, 718, 407 S.E.2d 310, 314 (1991) (era banc). For any one of the reasons above the motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Armstrong also challenges on appeal the sufficiency of the evidence. When the sufficiency of the evidence is an issue on appeal, an appellate court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>See Cheng v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 42, 393 S.E.2d 599, 608 (1990). On appeal, the decision of a trial court sitting without a jury is afforded the same weight as a jury\u2019s verdict and will not be disturbed unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See King v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 601, 604, 231 S.E.2d 312, 315 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u201cThe Commonwealth may prove possession of a controlled substance by showing either actual or constructive possession.\u201d <em>Barlow v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 421, 429, 494 S.E.2d 901, 904 (1998).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">To establish \u201cpossession\u201d in the legal sense, it is not sufficient to simply show actual or constructive possession of the drug by the defendant. The Commonwealth must also establish that the defendant intentionally and consciously possessed it with knowledge of its nature and character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQu\"><em>Burton v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 711, 713, 213 S.E.2d 757, 758-59 (1975) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\u201cKnowledge of the presence and character of the controlled substance may be shown by evidence of the acts, statements or conduct of the accused.\u201d <em>Eckhart v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 447, 450, 281 S.E.2d 853, 855 (1981).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">To support a conviction based on constructive possession, the Commonwealth must point to evidence of acts, statements, or conduct of the accused or other facts or circumstances which tend to show that the defendant was aware of both the presence and character of the substance and that it was subject to his dominion and control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-8\"><em>Glasco, </em>26 Va.App. at 774, 497 S.E.2d at 155 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">The trial court found that Armstrong had actual possession of the crack cocaine in his hand and constructive possession five minutes later when the cocaine was found on the floorboard of Armstrong\u2019s car near where his right foot had been located. Armstrong admitted that he was a crack cocaine user, and it can be inferred that he is familiar with its appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Considering the totality of the evidence and any reasonable hypothesis of innocence, the trial judge stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">Somehow or another between the five minute lapse, you want me to speculate that one of those ladies got themselves a piece of crack cocaine, put it on the floor, and that the piece that was in [the defendant\u2019s] hands has since been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>smoked, drunk, or otherwise disposed of, and that the piece that we find on the floor is one of these lady\u2019s. And you want me to believe that because [the defendant], in trying to talk his way out of getting arrested by the police, says it is not me, it is these two girls that are with me. Now you know, when we use common sense and you try to come to a reasonable conclusion based on the facts that are put in front of you and somebody tells you they saw a guy with a piece of crack cocaine in his hand and five minutes later they stop the car and there is crack lying on the floor and there isn\u2019t any crack on anybody else \u2014 the car is searched and the man is searched \u2014 and I am supposed to dream up an extra piece of crack cocaine to find a reasonable doubt? No, thank you. I find [Armstrong] guilty as charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">We do as well.
