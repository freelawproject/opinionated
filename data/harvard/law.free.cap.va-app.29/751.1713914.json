On appeal, defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions. Because we find that the evidence established the felony but failed to prove the misdemeanor, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we examine the record in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). \u201cAn appellate court must discard all evidence of the accused that conflicts with that of the Commonwealth ----\u201d <em>Lea v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 300, 303, 429 S.E.2d 477, 479 (1993) (citation omitted). The credibility of witnesses, the weight accorded testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters to be determined by the fact finder. <em>See Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989). The judgment of a trial court will be disturbed on appeal only if plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">In November 1996, V.S.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was experiencing difficulties with her daughter, E.A., then 16. The teenager \u201cwas having problems\u201d with \u201canxiety attacks,\u201d school attendance, drugs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>\u201csexual promiscuity,\u201d and had attempted suicide. Previous counseling had not been helpful, and V.S., on the advice of a friend, contacted defendant, then age 46 and a reputed \u201cpsychologist.\u201d Defendant assured V.S. that \u201che was licensed, had been to school,\u201d and, after a brief conversation, agreed to be \u201c[E.A.\u2019s] counselor, ... her psychologist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">V.S. immediately brought E.A. to defendant\u2019s home for an initial conference, but E.A. \u201cinstantly realized that she was there for counseling[,] ... made a scene\u201d and vowed that she \u201cwas not coming back.\u201d \u201c[Distraught,\u201d V.S. ended the meeting but, later, telephoned defendant for further guidance. Defendant commented that he found E.A. \u201cvery bright, very intelligent[,] ... a beautiful child[,] ... a gorgeous child,\u201d and proposed that he \u201ctake and counsel her through modeling, ... then she would not realize that she was being counseled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">After a few days, V.S. and E.A. returned to defendant\u2019s residence, V.S. intending to pursue defendant\u2019s novel approach to counseling E.A. Defendant advised V.S. that \u201c[h]e wanted complete control of [E.A.].... [V.S.] was never to question [E.A.] ... as to their sessions, that if [she] had any questions, [she] was to go to him, that he needed [E.A.\u2019s] complete confidence in him ... [s]o that he could counsel her and try to help her through this time in her life.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counseling services would be without charge, provided he was reimbursed photography expenses and assured a percentage of E.A.\u2019s subsequent earnings as a model. V.S. accepted defendant\u2019s terms, the two agreed that defendant and E.A. would regularly meet, alone, in V.S.\u2019s home, and the sessions began in late 1996. At defendant\u2019s suggestion, V.S. removed E.A. from public school and undertook home schooling.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">During the ensuing months, V.S. spoke with defendant after each meeting with E.A. and was assured by him that E.A. \u201cwas doing wonderful.\u201d When V.S. voiced concern to defendant that E.A. \u201cwas staying in bed,\u201d neglecting her \u201chome study course,\u201d \u201cnot going out, ... wasn\u2019t going anywhere\u201d and \u201cgetting progressively worse in her depression,\u201d he \u201ckind of brushed [these issues] off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>E.A. testified that she first thought that defendant was \u201cjust a photographer\u201d but learned, \u201cwhile he was taking pictures,\u201d that defendant was also her counselor. She acknowledged that she \u201cwas in a rough state at the time\u201d and agreed to participate only after V.S. \u201cpushed it on [her].\u201d E.A. recalled that defendant selected and arranged her clothing and pose for each photograph and promised that the \u201cangle\u201d would reveal no nudity. When E.A. asked \u201cwhy he took so many slutty shots,\u201d defendant answered, \u201csex sells.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">In the Spring of 1997, E.A. disappeared for several days, and, on the floor of her room, V.S. discovered numerous photographs of E.A., which depicted her sexual and genital areas, inside a \u201cnotebook\u201d that belonged to defendant. V.S. immediately terminated all contact between defendant and E.A. and alerted local police to the situation. During the resulting investigation, defendant admitted that he had taken photographs of E.A. which revealed her sexual and genital parts. Meanwhile, E.A. returned to public school and soon evidenced much improved academic performance, motivation, ambition, and otherwise constructive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Defendant testified that his relationship with V.S. and E.A. began when V.S. contacted him and described E.A.\u2019s \u201cproblems.\u201d During their initial conversation, he \u201cascertained that [E.A.] was interested in modeling,\u201d and volunteered to V.S., \u201cI do photography work.\u201d After further discussion with V.S., defendant admitted that he agreed to prepare a photographic \u201cportfolio\u201d of E.A. to advance her modeling career, but denied any attendant counseling responsibilities. He also denied photographing E.A.\u2019s sexual or genital parts, although on cross-examination he identified several photos of E.A., taken by him, which depicted her exposed breasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Defendant first argues that the evidence failed to establish the existence of a custodial or supervisory relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>ship between E.A. and himself, an indispensable element to a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 provides, in pertinent part, that [a]ny person eighteen years of age or older who maintains a custodial or supervisory relationship over a child under the age of eighteen, including but not limited to the parent, step-parent, grandparent, step-grandparent, or who stands in loco parentis with respect to such child and is not legally married to such child, and who, with lascivious intent, knowingly and intentionally ... (iv) proposes that any such child expose his or her sexual or genital parts to such person ... shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">\u201c[T]he Supreme Court has rejected limiting the definition of \u2018custody\u2019 to legal custody,\u201d \u201cdefined generally as \u2018[t]he care and control of a thing or person.\u2019\u201d <em>Krampen v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 163, 167-68, 510 S.E.2d 276, 278 (1999) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>384 (6th ed.1990)); <em>see Lovisi v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 848, 850, 188 S.E.2d 206, 208 (1972). Thus, the \u201ccustodial or supervisory relationship\u201d contemplated by the statute \u201cis not limited to those situations where legal custody exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168, 510 S.E.2d at 278. \u201cThe term also includes those individuals eighteen years or older who have a temporary, custodial relationship with a child, such as, \u2018teachers, athletic instructors and baby-sitters.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lovisi, </em>212 Va. at 850, 188 S.E.2d at 208).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Here, the evidence clearly established that V.S. entrusted E.A. to the care, custody, and control of defendant for purposes of professional counseling. At defendant\u2019s suggestion, V.S. agreed to the photography and modeling ruse to bring needed help to E.A., without encountering her resistance. Defendant demanded \u201ccomplete control\u201d of E.A., without question or interference from V.S. During the sessions, he was alone with the child and directed the style and arrangement of her clothing, the pose and setting for each photograph. Both V.S. and E.A. \u2022 complied with defendant\u2019s instructions until V.S. discovered his misdeeds. Under such circumstances, defendant and V.S. created a temporary custo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>dial relationship between defendant and E.A. for the duration of each session, thereby submitting E.A. to his control within the purview of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Defendant next contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish that his conduct \u201ccaused [E.A.] to be in need of services,\u201d the element of Code \u00a7 18.2-371 expressly charged in the subject indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-371 provides, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">[a]ny person eighteen years of age or older, including the parent of any child, who (i) willfully contributes to, encourages, or causes any act, omission, or condition which renders a child ..., in need of services, ... as defined in \u00a7 16.1-228, ... shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-371.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 16.1-228 defines a \u201cchild in need of services\u201d as \u201ca child whose behavior, conduct or condition presents or results in a serious threat to the well-being and physical safety of the child.\u201d Provided,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-10\">[hjowever, to find that a child falls within these provisions, (i) the conduct complained of must present a clear and substantial danger to the child\u2019s life or health or (ii) the child or his family is in need of treatment, rehabilitation or services not presently being received, and (iii) the intervention of the court is essential to provide the treatment, rehabilitation or services needed by the child or his family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQ9\">Code \u00a7 16.1-228. Thus, for a child to be \u201cin need of services\u201d as an element of Code \u00a7 18.2-371, circumstances specified in either Code \u00a7 16.1-228\u00ae <em>or </em>(ii) must have rendered court \u201cintervention ... essential\u201d to resolve the difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">Here, defendant\u2019s felonious conduct clearly endangered E.A.\u2019s \u201clife or health.\u201d When Y.S. surrendered temporary custody of E.A. to defendant, he was aware that she was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>emotionally troubled teenager, with a history of attempted suicide, entrusted to him for purposes of professional counseling. However, callous of the child\u2019s psychological fragility, defendant criminally violated the custodial relationship and exacerbated E.A.\u2019s symptoms. The resulting circumstances presented a clear and present danger to E.A.\u2019s life and health.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">However, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence must also establish that judicial intervention was \u201cessential\u201d to relieve the child\u2019s plight, a proof belied by the instant record. Fortunately, Y.S. uncovered defendant\u2019s crime before further harm came to the child and resolved the immediate threat by removing her from defendant\u2019s control. Subsequently, <em>without </em>the necessity of court intervention, E.A.\u2019s situation quickly improved. Thus, the evidence established that E.A. was not a child in need of services contemplated by Code \u00a7 18.2-371.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">We, therefore, find that the record sufficiently supported the conviction of defendant for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1, but failed to prove a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-371. Accordingly, we affirm the felony conviction but reverse the misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-12\">. To avoid unnecessary embarrassment to the victim and her mother, we use pseudonyms for each.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-12\">. Although Code \u00a7 18.2-371 proscribes conduct which visits any one among several adverse circumstances upon a child, only rendering a child \"in need of services\u201d is before us on the instant record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
