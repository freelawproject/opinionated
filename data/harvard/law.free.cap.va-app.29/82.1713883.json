Wells (wife) appeals the trial court\u2019s order denying her motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Because this order is interlocutory in nature and did not adjudicate the principles of the cause, we dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">On February 20, 1997, wife filed a Petition for Dissolution of Marriage in the Circuit Court of Hendry County, Florida, seeking a divorce, child custody, spousal and child support, and attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Billy R. Wells (husband), a resident of Virginia, filed a motion to dismiss the Florida action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The parties\u2019 four minor children have lived with wife for various time periods in North Carolina and Florida; however, the children currently reside in Virginia with husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">On March 27, 1997, husband filed a Bill of Complaint in Wise County Circuit Court, Virginia, seeking a divorce and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>child custody. Wife entered a special appearance and moved to dismiss that bill of complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following a hearing, the trial court denied wife\u2019s motion. The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">The Court having considered the arguments of Counsel and documents filed hereby finds ... that the [husband] is in the proper jurisdiction to bring a divorce action and has filed a divorce action in Wise County which is proper jurisdiction; ... that the children are presently living in Virginia and have lived in North Carolina and Florida.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">THEREFORE, the Court doth ADJUDGE, ORDER and DECREE that the Motion of the [wife] be and is hereby denied and the Court retains the jurisdiction of the above-styled cause in Wise County, State of Virginia. The Court doth further ADJUDGE, ORDER AND DECREE that the Florida orders are not determinative of child custody. The Court also doth ADJUDGE, ORDER AND DECREE that the Court not only retains jurisdiction over the divorce case in Wise County, Virginia, but also claims jurisdiction over child custody and visitation in Wise County, Virginia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">This cause is retained upon the docket for further proceedings in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Wife noted her appeal to this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">This Court has appellate jurisdiction over final decrees of a circuit court in domestic relations matters arising under Titles 16.1 or 20, and any interlocutory decree or order involving the granting, dissolving, or denying of an injunction or \u201cadjudicating the principles of a cause.\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-405(3)(f) and (4), recodifying Code \u00a7 17 \u2014 116.05(3)(f) and (4). A final decree is one \u201cwhich disposes of the whole subject, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>gives all the relief that is contemplated, and leaves nothing to be done by the court.\u201d <em>Erikson v. Erikson, </em>19 Va.App. 389, 390, 451 S.E.2d 711, 712 (1994) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The parties agree that the trial court\u2019s order denying wife\u2019s objection to jurisdiction is a non-final, interlocutory order. Therefore, unless it constitutes an interlocutory order that \u201cadjudicates the principles of the cause,\u201d we do not have jurisdiction to consider an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">An interlocutory decree adjudicates the principles of a cause where \u201c \u2018the rules or methods by which the rights of the parties are to be finally worked out have been so far determined that it is only necessary to apply those rules or methods to the facts of the case in order to ascertain the relative rights of the parties, with regard to the subject matter of the suit.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\"><em>Moreno v. Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. 227, 231, 481 S.E.2d 482, 485 (1997) (quoting <em>Pinkard v. Pinkard, </em>12 Va.App. 848, 851, 407 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1991) (quoting <em>Lee v. Lee, </em>142 Va. 244, 252-53, 128 S.E. 524, 527 (1925))). An interlocutory decree that adjudicates the principles of a cause is one which must \u201cdetermine the rights of the parties\u201d and \u201cwould of necessity affect the final order in the case.\u201d <em>Erikson, </em>19 Va.App. at 391, 451 S.E.2d at 713. \u201c[T]he mere possibility that an interlocutory decree may affect the final decision in the trial does not necessitate an immediate appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">An interlocutory order that adjudicates the principles of a domestic relations dispute \u201cmust respond to the chief object of the suit,\u201d <em>id., </em>which is to determine the status of the parties\u2019 marriage and the custody of the parties\u2019 children, and, if appropriate, to award spousal and child support. <em>See id. </em>(child support modification); <em>Nenninger v. Nenninger, </em>19 Va.App. 696, 697, 454 S.E.2d 45, 45 (1995) (divorce decree and equitable distribution).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">In the present case, the trial court\u2019s order, which denied wife\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, fulfilled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>neither requirement. No final custody determination or decree of divorce has been entered. The specific language of the trial court\u2019s order establishes the need for further hearings to resolve these issues. Accordingly, we are without jurisdiction to consider the appeal. <em>See Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund v. Harper, </em>26 Va.App. 522, 527-28, 495 S.E.2d 540, 543 (1998) (holding that the commission\u2019s determination of jurisdiction does not constitute a final order appealable to this Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Our holding is consistent with the holdings of many of our sister states who have held that a trial court\u2019s decision on a challenge to jurisdiction is a non-appealable interlocutory order. <em>See Atlanta Hanggliders &amp; Ultralights, Inc. v. Rountree, </em>169 Ga.App. 647, 314 S.E.2d 679, 680 (Ga.Ct.App.1984) (holding that an \u201corder of the trial court denying [a] motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction ... is an interlocutory order which is not appealable without a certificate of immediate review\u201d); <em>Duke Univ. v. Bryant-Durham Elec. Co., </em>66 N.C.App. 726, 311 S.E.2d 638, 639 (N.C.Ct.App.1984) (\u201cA trial judge\u2019s order denying a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is interlocutory and not immediately appealable.\u201d); <em>Burry v. Raisbeck, </em>159 Misc.2d 488, 605 N.Y.S.2d 204, 204 (N.Y.Fam.Ct.1993) (dismissing an appeal from an interlocutory order denying motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction); <em>Ratz v. Ratz, </em>359 Pa.Super. 8, 518 A.2d 317, 319 (Pa.Super.Ct.1986) (\u201c[A] party challenging an order sustaining subject matter jurisdiction may not appeal the interlocutory order as a matter of right.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In those states where courts have allowed an appeal from an interlocutory order denying an objection to jurisdiction, a state statute or court rule specifically grants such a right of appeal. <em>See, e.g., Parrish v. AmSouth Bank, N.A, </em>657 So.2d 1189, 1190 n. 1 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1995) (court rule authorizing \u201ca non-final appeal from an order relating to jurisdiction over the person\u201d); <em>Torborg v. Fort Wayne Cardiology, Inc., </em>671 N.E.2d 947, 948 (Ind.Ct.App.1996) (court rule allowing an appeal from interlocutory order addressing personal jurisdiction over the parties); <em>County of Bexar v. Garcia, </em>974 S.W.2d 107, 108 (Tex.App.1998) (state statute authorizing an \u201cappeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>from an interlocutory order that grants or denies governmental unit\u2019s plea to jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Neither Code \u00a7 17.1-405, recodifying Code \u00a7 17-116.05, nor any Rule of the Supreme Court authorizes an appeal here. Rather, the code limits our appellate jurisdiction to final decrees in domestic relations matters arising under Titles 16.1 or 20, or interlocutory decrees or orders \u201cadjudicating the principles of a cause.\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1^f05(3)(f) and (4), recodifying Code \u00a7 17 \u2014 116.05(3)(f) and (4). No other statutory provisions authorize an immediate right of appeal from a trial court\u2019s order on a jurisdictional challenge. Consequently, we are without jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-13\">. On appeal, wife argues that the court erred: (1) in exercising jurisdiction over the divorce and the child custody proceedings and (2) in failing to afford the Florida orders full faith and credit under Virginia\u2019s provisions of the U.C.C.J.A., Code \u00a7 20-136. Because of the procedural posture of the case, we do not reach the merits of the second claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-14\">. The record before us provides no testimony regarding the underlying dispute between the parties. Rather, the parties have included only pleadings and orders of the trial court and the Florida court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b127-11\">. In the trial court, wife filed a pleading entitled, \u201cSpecial Appearance, Motion to Rehear, Motion to Dismiss Divorce, Objection to Jurisdiction over Child Custody and Visitation, and Motion to Grant Full Faith and Credit to Florida Orders.\u201d The trial court addressed each of wife\u2019s objections in its order dated April 3, 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
