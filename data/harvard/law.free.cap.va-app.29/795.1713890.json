Defendant complains on appeal that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence of prior offenses and related misconduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree and reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>In accordance with well established principles, we review the record on appeal in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>See Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Defendant and his wife, Anita Boney, were married in 1989, and four children were born to their union. In October, 1996, Mrs. Boney separated from defendant, relocating with the children to a rental house in Emporia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although defendant remained in the former marital home, Mrs. Boney \u201csaw him all the time, just about every day.\u201d Defendant \u201cwould come to any window at the house that he could look into to see what [she] was doing,\u201d \u201ccome by and see the children,\u201d and sometimes \u201cpark his car outside [Mrs. Boney\u2019s house] and sleep in the car.\u201d During the week preceding the instant offenses, defendant asked Mrs. Boney \u201cwhat James Ricks [the murder victim] was doing at [her] house,\u201d and threatened, \u201cdon\u2019t ever let me catch James at your house or I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">In the late evening of December 21, 1996, Mrs. Boney arrived home from work and \u201csaw [defendant] pulling away from [her] driveway.\u201d Defendant soon returned, however, \u201cknocked on the door,\u201d and was told by Mrs. Boney that \u201che could [not] come in.\u201d Defendant inquired, \u201cwhere was the children?\u201d Mrs. Boney answered that \u201cthey were at [her] mother\u2019s house,\u201d and he drove away. Within minutes, defendant appeared at Mrs. Boney\u2019s bedroom window, again questioned her about the children, and, once more, left the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Shortly after midnight, defendant returned to the window and observed Mrs. Boney in bed with a man, later identified as Ricks, apparently \u201cmaking love.\u201d Defendant recalled that he immediately entered the house through the rear door, \u201cseen two peoples jump off the bed, no clothes or nothing\u201d but, \u201cthat\u2019s all [he] remember[ed] right there.\u201d Mrs. Boney testified that she and Ricks \u201cwere talking\u201d in the bed, following sexual intercourse, and \u201cheard ... the screen door crack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>... [and] a very loud, kicking, banging noise\u201d as defendant \u201cbroke through the door.\u201d The couple \u201cjump[ed] out of bed,\u201d naked, and Ricks fled through the living room and \u201cout the front door\u201d with defendant in pursuit, shouting \u201cgo ahead you m\u2014 f\u2014 and run, I\u2019m going to get you.\u201d Mrs. Boney \u201cheard some shots,\u201d and Ricks was found nearby, dead from gunshot wounds inflicted by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Moments later, Mrs. Boney saw defendant approaching the kitchen window. Fearful, she began \u201cpushing the back door,\u201d previously damaged by defendant, \u201cto keep him from coming into the house.\u201d However, defendant soon overpowered Mrs. Boney and entered the home, holding a gun \u201cin an upward motion.\u201d Once inside, defendant turned toward Mrs. Boney, declared, \u201cI told you if ... I ever saw you with anybody else I would get you too,\u201d and shot her. Defendant watched Mrs. Boney \u201cfall down between the kitchen table and the back door [and] walked away.\u201d Wounded, Mrs. Boney \u201ccrept out of the back door ... to [her] neighbor\u2019s house,\u201d summoned police, and defendant was arrested at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">During a hearing on several pretrial motions, the Commonwealth urged the court to permit evidence at trial of defendant\u2019s \u201cprior bad acts and conduct relating to\u201d Mrs. Boney, \u201cto prove his motive, ... intent and ... conduct and feeling\u201d toward her. Despite repeated references by the prosecutor to \u201cassaults,\u201d \u201csimilar incident[s],\u201d and \u201cother threats,\u201d crimes and prior bad acts of the defendant \u201cinvolving\u201d Mrs. Boney, dating to 1986, the hearing record provides few details of such misconduct: Nevertheless, over defendant\u2019s objection, the court ruled that \u201cin light of ... the history between the parties,\u201d it would allow evidence of assaults by defendant that resulted from \u201cincidents\u201d in 1992 and 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">At trial, Mrs. Boney initially testified that \u201cquite a few times\u201d she had been \u201cin a situation with [defendant] and a gun,\u201d later recalling an \u201cincident\u201d in 1993 which \u201cinvolved\u201d defendant, a man identified only as Larry Fields, and \u201ca gun.\u201d She was unsure of any offenses committed by defendant, but \u201ckn[ew] that he stayed in jail for awhile.\u201d After defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>stipulated \u201cthat he was convicted of an assault and battery on Larry Fields,\u201d the court noted that, \u201c[t]he fact that there was a conviction is in evidence.\u201d Mrs. Boney also vaguely alluded to an \u201cincident\u201d in 1992 between defendant and herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The court instructed the jury, \u201cYou may consider evidence that the defendant committed offenses other than the offense for which he is on trial only as evidence of the defendant\u2019s motive and intent in connection with the offense for which he is on trial and for no other purpose.\u201d The court also instructed the jury on both first and second-degree murder, but denied defendant jury instructions on manslaughter and unlawful wounding. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, malicious wounding, breaking and entering with the intent to commit a felony while armed with a deadly weapon, and related firearm offenses, the subject crimes. He now appeals, arguing that the court erroneously admitted evidence of the prior misconduct and assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">It is well established that evidence tending to show that defendant committed a prior crime is generally inadmissible. <em>See, e.g., Kirkpatrick v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 269, 272, 176 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1970); <em>Burley v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 140, 144, 510 S.E.2d 265, 267 (1999). Such evidence invites confusion of the issues and unfair surprise and suggests criminal propensity, circumstances that compromise the fact-finding process and the presumption of innocence, to the distinct prejudice of an accused. <em>See Wilkins v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 293, 297, 443 S.E.2d 440, 443 (1994) <em>(en </em>banc); <em>see also Guill v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 134, 138, 495 S.E.2d 489, 491 (1998). However, \u201cthe \u2018general rule ... must sometimes yield to society\u2019s interest in ... truth-finding ... and numerous exceptions allow evidence of prior misconduct \u2018[wjhenever the legitimate probative value outweighs the incidental prejudice to the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilkins, </em>18 Va.App. at 297, 443 S.E.2d at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-8\">[e]vidence that tends to establish a fact at issue is relevant and material and, therefore, admissible, if its probative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>value is not outweighed by any prejudicial effect. Despite the prejudice \u201cinherent\u201d in proof that the accused has committed other crimes, this rule is no different when such evidence is offered to establish knowledge or intent, provided there exists a \u201crelation or connection\u201d between the prior misconduct and the facts in issue which sufficiently establishes relevancy and materiality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 297-98, 443 S.E.2d at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Accordingly, \u201c[ejvidence of \u2018other crimes\u2019 is relevant and admissible if it <em>tends to prove </em>any element of the offense charged,\u201d including the intent of the accused. <em>Guilt, </em>255 Va. at 138, 495 S.E.2d at 491 (citation omitted). However, the admissibility of evidence to establish intent requires \u201c \u2018a causal relation or logical or natural connection between the two acts, or they ... form parts of one transaction,\u2019 \u201d with sufficient probative value to overcome the incidental prejudice to the accused. <em>Id. </em>at 139 \u2014 40, 495 S.E.2d at 491-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Here, the evidence before the jury through Mrs. Boney\u2019s testimony disclosed only that defendant had been convicted in 1993 for an assault upon Larry Fields, a man unrelated to the instant prosecution, which involved \u201ca gun.\u201d Nothing in the trial record established any nexus between Fields, defendant, Mrs. Boney, or the murder victim, Ricks. Similarly, Mrs. Boney was permitted to mention an unexplained \u201cincident\u201d between defendant and herself in 1992. Clearly, absent evidence that established a rational relationship between such conduct and the instant offenses, Mrs. Boney\u2019s testimony was not probative of defendant\u2019s motive or intent in shooting either Ricks or herself and, therefore, was without proper evidentiary value. Nevertheless, the testimony suggested that defendant had previously been \u201cinvolved\u201d with guns, an unrelated violent encounter with another man, and other \u201csituations\u201d with Mrs. Boney, all irrelevant to the instant prosecution but highly prejudicial to defendant. Thus, the court erroneously admitted the testimony into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, the court\u2019s instruction that the jury consider other \u201coffenses ... only as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>evidence of ... defendant\u2019s motive and intent in connection with the offense ... on trial\u201d does not cure the error. The jury was exposed to inadmissible evidence, unworthy of consideration in any issue at trial. The instruction limiting the utility of such evidence expressly approved improper consideration by the jury, albeit for a restricted purpose. A jury cannot be presumed at once to follow a direction to consider improper evidence and remain unaffected by its content.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">We likewise find no merit in the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the error was harmless. \u201c[U]nless \u2018it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that\u2019 the error did not affect the verdict,\u201d we must reverse the conviction. <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en banc) </em>(citing Code \u00a7 8.01-678). \u201cAn error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe effect of an error on a verdict varies widely [and] ... [e]ach case must, therefore, be analyzed individually....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1009, 407 S.E.2d at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The jury convicted defendant of first-degree murder and malicious wounding, offenses that require proof of malice beyond a reasonable doubt, and recommended sentences of life and fifteen years, respectively. Mrs. Boney was permitted to improperly reference prior \u201cincidents\u201d involving defendant and \u201cguns,\u201d including a specific conviction for assault arising from an unrelated encounter years earlier. Under such circumstances, we are unable to conclude that the record \u201cplainly\u201d demonstrates convictions and sentences free from the influence of inadmissible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the convictions and remand the matters to the trial court for a new trial, consistent with this opinion, if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-15\">. Because we reverse on this issue, we decline to address the remaining assignments of error raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b840-8\">. Mrs. Boney was the sole tenant on the lease agreement, and the landlord stipulated that defendant did not reside with her.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
