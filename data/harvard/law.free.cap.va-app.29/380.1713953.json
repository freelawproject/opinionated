The sole issue, presented is whether the evidence was sufficient to find him guilty of that offense. Finding the evidence sufficient, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The judgment of a trial court will be disturbed only if plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See id. </em>The inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters solely for the fact finder\u2019s determination. <em>See Hancock v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 774, 782, 407 S.E.2d 301, 306 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>- Viewed accordingly, the record discloses that on May 30, 1997, Richard Lafarr observed appellant enter the grocery store where Lafarr worked. Appellant proceeded down an aisle in the store and looked around nervously. Lafarr, who was watching appellant via a closed circuit television monitor, saw appellant pick up an item and place it in his left pants pocket. Lafarr saw the item slide down appellant\u2019s pants leg to his ankle. Appellant repeated this action with a second item, and again Lafarr saw it fall down to the bottom of appellant\u2019s pants leg, without falling to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Store employees subsequently took appellant into custody and recovered two six-inch by three-inch boxes of Nicorette gum from appellant\u2019s pants leg. The gum was valued at $110. Appellant had no identification and no means to pay for the gum. He was wearing baggy camouflage pants, and Lafarr noted that appellant\u2019s left pants pocket was slit, allowing items to fall through the pocket into the pants leg, all the way to his ankle. The pants had drawstrings at the cuff's that prevented the items from falling out of the pants and onto the floor. Appellant presented no evidence in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The Commonwealth charged appellant with violating Code \u00a7 18.2-94 by possessing \u201ccertain tools, implements, or outfit with the intent to utilize them to commit burglary, robbery, or larceny.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-94 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">If any person have in his possession any tools, implements or outfit, with intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny, upon conviction thereof, he shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony. The possession of such burglarious tools, implements or outfit by any person other than a licensed dealer, shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The Commonwealth contends that the baggy pants with the slit pocket and drawstring at appellant\u2019s ankle area permitted the fact finder to reasonably infer that the pants were prepared and worn into the store for the intended purpose to commit larceny and, as such, constituted an \u201coutfit\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-94. Appellant contends that because pants are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>not commonly used to break into a structure, they were not intended by the legislature to constitute an \u201coutfit.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The term \u201coutfit\u201d is not defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-94 or elsewhere in the Code. \u201cGenerally, the words and phrases used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usually accepted meaning unless a different intention is fairly manifest.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994). The commonly accepted definitions for the word \u201coutfit\u201d include (1) the act or process of fitting out or equipping, (2) materials, tools, or implements comprising the equipment necessary for carrying out a particular project, and (3) wearing apparel designed to be worn on a special occasion or in a particular situation. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1601 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The judgment of a trial court will be disturbed only if plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See Martin, 4 </em>Va.App. at 443, 358 S.E.2d at 418. The inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters solely for the fact finder\u2019s determination. <em>See Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">In <em>Moss v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 1, 509 S.E.2d 510 (1999), we rejected the defendant\u2019s assertion that Code \u00a7 18.2-94 only' proscribed the possession of tools or implements used to commit burglary, noting that the statute \u201ccriminalizes possession of \u2018tools, implements, or outfit\u2019 with the intent to commit any one of three offenses, burglary, robbery or larceny.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 3 n. 1, 509 S.E.2d at 511 n. 1 (quoting Code \u00a7 18.2-94). \u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-94 requires proof that the offending tools, implements or outfit were intrinsically \u2018burglarious\u2019 only when the Commonwealth relies upon the statutory presumption to establish the requisite criminal intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-5, 509 S.E.2d at 512. A defendant is still subject to conviction under the statute if the Commonwealth can prove, independent of the statutory presumption, that the defendant possessed a non-burglarious tool, implement, or outfit with the intent to commit larceny. <em>See id. </em>at 4, 509 S.E.2d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>An item of clothing that is altered to facilitate shoplifting can reasonably be considered wearing apparel designed to be worn in a particular situation. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>at 1601. We hold, therefore, that a pair of pants can constitute an \u201coutfit\u201d as that term is used in Code \u00a7 18.2-94. A pair of pants is not necessarily \u201cburglarious,\u201d that is, it is not an item commonly used to break into a structure. For that reason, to convict appellant under Code \u00a7 18.2-94, the Commonwealth was required to prove that appellant possessed these pants with the intent to use them to commit larceny. <em>See Moss, </em>29 Va.App. at 4, 509 S.E.2d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u201cBecause direct proof of intent is often impossible, it must be shown by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 524, 371 S.E.2d 156, 165 (1988). \u201cCircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided it is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 53, 307 S.E.2d 864, 876 (1983). But \u201c[t]he Commonwealth need only exclude reasonable hypotheses of innocence that flow from the evidence, not those that spring from the imagination of the defendant.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 751, 755, 433 S.E.2d 27, 29 (1993). \u201cWhether a hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Herrel v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 579, 587, 507 S.E.2d 633, 637 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">All the tools, implements or outfits included in Code \u00a7 18.2-94 may be, and usually are, designed and manufactured for a lawful purpose. Mere possession thereof is not a crime. <em>Burnette v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 785, 790, 75 S.E.2d 482, 485-86 (1953). It has been held, and Code \u00a7 18.2-94 provides, that possession \u201cshall be prima facie evidence of an intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny.\u201d <em>Nance v. Commonwealth, </em>203 Va. 428, 429, 124 S.E.2d 900, 901 (1962) (citation omitted). .</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">When viewed in its entirety, the record here discloses sufficient evidence to support the finding that appellant wore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the baggy pants with the slit pocket and tied-off cuffs to facilitate his attempted shoplifting. The record shows that appellant entered the grocery store with no money or other means on his person to pay for the gum and that he looked about in a suspicious manner. He then placed two packs of Nicorette gum, valued at $110, into the specially prepared pocket, which allowed the gum packages to drop through the pocket down to the tied-off cuff of his pants, but not onto the floor. From the foregoing facts, the record supports the trial court\u2019s judgment that the baggy pants with the slit pocket and tied-off cuffs constituted an \u201coutfit\u201d that was possessed by appellant with the intent to be used to commit larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
