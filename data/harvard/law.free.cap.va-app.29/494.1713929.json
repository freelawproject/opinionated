He complains on appeal that the trial court erroneously admitted into evidence \u25a0 a prior consistent statement given to police by a Commonwealth witness. Finding no error, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">On the morning of September 9, 1996, James Elkins, an employee of Hallmark Communications (Hallmark), discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>evidence of forced entry into the business location in Isle of Wight County and \u201cstuff missing.\u201d Elkins notified the local sheriff, and Lieutenant Tom Gibbons was assigned to investigate. Gibbons proceeded to the scene, inspected the building, and observed that \u201cthe entire place had been ransacked,\u201d with damage to both rear entry and interior doors. A subsequent inventory confirmed that numerous items had been stolen, including a \u201cconsole ... T.V.\u201d and nine pagers.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Shortly after Gibbons\u2019 arrival, Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Willard \u201cshowed up\u201d and provided Gibbons with particulars relative to a suspicious vehicle he had observed in the area at \u201cabout 4:30 [that] morning.\u201d Gibbons ascertained that the vehicle was registered to a Virginia Beach address and immediately contacted that city\u2019s police, requesting assistance in locating the car. Within hours, Virginia Beach police stopped the vehicle, recovered the stolen TV and pagers, and arrested the driver, Eric Landers, and his passenger, Kevin (Greg) Baucom, for \u201cpossession of stolen articles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Gibbons learned immediately of the arrests, proceeded directly to Virginia Beach, arriving within an hour, questioned Landers, and obtained the following signed statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">I, Eric Joseph Landers, left my house on the night of September 8th with my two friends [defendant and Baueom]. We went and picked up my car from Newport News. Then we went to [defendant\u2019s] house and dropped his car off. We started driving to one of our friend\u2019s house just to say hey and see what he was doing. But on the way there we had seen the store and they (Derek [defendant] and Greg [Baucom]) were like, hey, let\u2019s hit this place. So after we visited our friend for a little while we headed back towards where we came from. They had told me to let them out and go pick them up in twenty minutes. I drove around and they ... told me to drive down the dirt road so they could put the things in the car. So like an idiot, I did. I was sitting in the car telling them to leave because what they were doing was stupid. I never set one foot inside that building. That is the honest truth. All I did was get out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the car and walk where they could hear me and tell them I was leaving so they had better come on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">I am so sorry for even driving around. Even though I didn\u2019t take anything I still should have not ever drove around for them. I was scared and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m not used to being scared so I just went along and drove around. I\u2019ve never been more scared than I am right now. One of them has said (pretty much said) if someone rats them out they\u2019re dead, so I don\u2019t know what to do, but I am telling the truth and I will cooperate with you one hundred percent. I just want to go to college and make something of myself. I just hope that I haven\u2019t already ruined that chance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Landers\u2019 trial testimony, as a Commonwealth witness, was substantially consistent with his earlier statement to Gibbons, and the Commonwealth attempted to introduce it into evidence. Defendant, however, objected, arguing that the Commonwealth was attempting to improperly \u201cbolster\u201d Landers\u2019 testimony. In sustaining the objection, the trial court concluded that the evidence was inadmissible \u201cuntil [defense counsel] attacks [Landers\u2019] credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Defendant concedes on brief that counsel subsequently \u201ccross-examined Mr. Landers in an attempt to impeach his testimony and challenge his credibility.\u201d In response to such questioning, Landers acknowledged that the Virginia Beach charge had been \u201cdropped\u201d following his arrest in Isle of Wight on September 12,1996 for the instant offenses and that trial in Isle of Wight had been delayed until he testified in the subject prosecution. Landers admitted \u201chope\u201d that \u201csomething good\u201d would result from his testimony but steadfastly denied that anyone promised \u201canything\u201d in return. Defendant did not explore Landers\u2019 motives in making the earlier statement to Gibbons.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">. The Commonwealth recalled Gibbons on rebuttal and offered Landers\u2019 statement \u201cto refute the notion that\u2019s been put forward by the defense that he\u2019s fabricated [a story] ... to benefit himself.\u201d Defense counsel objected, again arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>that the statement would improperly bolster Landers\u2019 credibility. The trial court, however, concluded that the statement was then admissible as \u201cone of the exceptions to the hearsay rule\u201d against prior consistent statements and permitted Gibbons to relate it to the jury. The disputed convictions followed and defendant, on appeal, challenges the admissibility of the prior statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, a prior consistent statement of a witness is inadmissible hearsay.\u201d <em>Faison v. Hudson, </em>243 Va. 397, 404, 417 S.E.2d 305, 309 (1992) (citations omitted). However, the Supreme Court of Virginia has approved \u201ca few narrowly circumscribed exceptions,\u201d <em>id.,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW5\">when the opposing party: (1) suggests that the declarant had a motive to falsify his testimony and the consistent statement was made prior to the existence of that motive, (2) alleges that the declarant, due to his relationship to the matter or to an involved party, had a design to misrepresent his testimony and the prior consistent statement was made before the existence of that relationship, (3) alleges that the declarant\u2019s testimony is a fabrication of recent date and the prior consistent statement was made at a time when its ultimate effect could not have been foreseen, or (4) impeaches the declarant with a prior inconsistent statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaW\"><em>Mitchell v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 81, 84-85, 486 S.E.2d 551, 552-53 (1997) (citing <em>Faison, </em>243 Va. at 404-05, 417 S.E.2d at 309-10); <em>see also </em>1 Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 4-12 (4th ed. 1993 &amp; Cum.Supp. 1998). Manifestly, such exceptions are intended to permit a party to \u201crepel ... an imputation\u201d that a witness testified untruthfully by \u201cshow[ing] that the witness made a similar statement at a time when the supposed motive [to fabricate] did not exist.\u201d <em>Repass v. Richmond, </em>99 Va. 508, 515, 39 S.E. 160, 163 (1901).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Thus, once defendant tainted Landers\u2019 trial testimony with evidence suggesting that self-interests had compromised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>his veracity, Landers\u2019 prior consistent statement to Gibbons was admissible to repair his credibility, <em>provided </em>the statement was made before Landers had reason or design to falsify. In seeking to escape the rule in this instance, defendant maintains that \u201cbias, interest or corruption\u201d inhered in Landers\u2019 post-arrest statement to Gibbons. He reasons that Landers then had a \u201cmotive to lie\u201d and \u201cshift the blame from himself to another in an attempt to get favorable treatment,\u201d although the record does not disclose evidence of promise, expectation or other incentive to fabricate at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In support of his contention that Landers\u2019 post-arrest custodial status, without more, infected his statement with self-interest, defendant relies upon <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 243, 389 S.E.2d 871 (1990). In <em>Smith, </em>the accused had brutally murdered a police officer, following earlier threats to \u201cshoot the first [police officer] that arrive[d].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 389 S.E.2d at 874. Subsequent to arrest, Smith explained to police that he fired his weapon in self-defense after an assailant first shot him in the foot, a clearly exculpatory statement reflective of a \u201cmotive to lie,\u201d together with \u201csufficient time to fabricate a story.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 389 S.E.2d at 880. In concluding that Smith\u2019s statement was inadmissible as a prior consistent statement, the court looked beyond Smith\u2019s mere status as an arrestee and considered the content of the statement, together with attendant circumstances, to find that it was fraught with self-serving motive, corrosive of truth. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Henderson, </em>717 F.2d 135 (4th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1009, 104 S.Ct. 1006, 79 L.Ed.2d 238 (1984) (arrest alone does not establish a motive to fabricate).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In contrast, Landers\u2019 prior statement was clearly inculpatory, a confession not simply to possession of stolen goods, the Virginia Beach offense for which he was then in custody, but, additionally, a ready admission to participation in the then uncharged burglary and larceny in Isle of Wight. Unlike <em>Smith, </em>Landers further implicated rather than exonerated himself. Thus, the content of Landers\u2019 statement, an appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>priate consideration to our analysis, countered any attribution of taint arising solely from the attendant circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Moreover, the record offers no support to defendant\u2019s claim that Landers\u2019 statement was otherwise prompted by unspoken coercion, anticipation of leniency or favor, or improper , motive. No evidence suggests a scheme to mislead through the statement, prior knowledge of its consequences or the existence of inconsistent statements. During cross-examination of Landers, defendant probed only his reasons for <em>testifying at trial, </em>with no inquiry into considerations that induced Landers to speak with Gibbons months previously. He now relies on a silent record to discredit Landers\u2019 statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">It is well established that \u201c[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988) (citation omitted). \u201cThus, we should reverse only upon \u2018clear evidence that [the decision] was not judicially sound\u2019 and not simply to substitute our \u2018discretion for that rendered below.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jefferson v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 477, 488, 500 S.E.2d 219, 225 (1998) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Under the instant circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion in the admission of Landers\u2019 prior consistent statement into evidence and, accordingly, affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b542-9\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ac7\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">By well established \u201cgeneral rule, a prior consistent statement of a witness is inadmissible hearsay.\u201d <em>Faison v. Hudson, </em>243 Va. 397, 404, 417 S.E.2d 305, 309 (1992). <em>See also Howard v. Commonwealth, </em>81 Va. 488, 490 (1886). As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Faison, </em>\u201c[t]o allow such a statement to corroborate and buttress a witness\u2019s testimony would be an unsafe practice, one which not only would be subject to all the objections that exist against the admission of hearsay in general but also would tend to foster fraud and the fabrication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>of testimony.\u201d 243 Va. at 404, 417 S.E.2d at 309. The rule is subject only to \u201ca few narrowly circumscribed exceptions.\u201d <em>Id. See also Gallion v. Winfree, </em>129 Va. 122, 127, 105 S.E. 539, 540 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Pertinent to this appeal, the Supreme Court has described one of the narrow exceptions by \u201cstat[ing] that, when a witness is impeached by \u2018a charge of bias, or interest, or corruption,\u2019 a prior consistent statement made by the witness is admissible <em>if it was made \u2018before the time when the supposed bias, or interest, or corruption could have existed.\u2019 \u201d Faison, </em>243 Va. at 404, 417 S.E.2d at 309 (quoting <em>Gallion, </em>129 Va. at 127, 105 S.E. at 540) (emphasis added). I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Eric Landers\u2019 statement qualified under this exception. The evidence clearly proved that Landers\u2019 statement was not made <em>before </em>the time when his bias, interest, and corruption could have existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Landers made his statement after the police arrested him. When Landers was stopped and arrested by the police, Landers was driving a vehicle containing some of the stolen property. Indeed, he possessed the only parcels of stolen property that have been recovered \u2014 a large television and eight pagers. After Landers was arrested in the City of Virginia Beach for possession of the stolen property in his vehicle, he was arrested in Isle of Wight County for breaking and entering.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Landers was interrogated after his first arrest and made the statements at issue. When Landers was arrested for possessing the stolen property and charged with a felony, those events became the occasion that spawned the motive to exonerate himself. At that time, he was not free from any desire, motive, or impulse he may have had to mitigate the very apparent appearance of his own culpability. As the Court noted in <em>Gallion, </em>\u201c[t]he [contact] between the parties [in the criminal event] was made before the [statement] introduced in evidence was had, and the interest of [Landers] was the same at the date of the [statement] as at the time of the trial. So that the [statement] was not admissible under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>exception to the rule.\u201d 129 Va. at 127, 105 S.E. at 540. Simply stated, the evidence does not establish that when Landers made the confession he was free of motivation to mitigate the obvious appearance of his culpability by spreading the blame and overstating Derek Wayne Gurganus\u2019 involvement. Indeed, Landers\u2019 statement implicates Gurganus as the primary criminal actor and mitigates Landers\u2019 participation through a self-serving description of Landers as an unsuspecting companion who was \u201ctelling them to leave because what they were doing was stupid.\u201d In a further attempt to exonerate himself and promote his interest, Landers\u2019 statement contains an offer to \u201ccooperate with [the police] one hundred percent\u201d and expresses a desire \u201cto go to college and make something of [him]self ... hop[ing] that [he has not] already ruined that chance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">At the time Landers made these revelations, he had been arrested for possession of the stolen goods. \u201cHence, he had a clear motive to lie about who [committed the burglary], and he had sufficient time [between his arrest and later interrogation] to fabricate a story.\u201d <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 243, 261, 389 S.E.2d 871, 880 (1990). Furthermore, the evidence proved that after Landers made his statement, the felony charge was dismissed in the City of Virginia Beach.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In affirming the trial judge\u2019s admission of the prior consistent statement, the majority creates a new evidentiary standard. The majority looks to the \u201cinculpatory\u201d nature of Landers\u2019 statement and concludes that it outweighs the \u201ctaint.\u201d In this respect, the majority confuses the prior consistent statement exception to the hearsay rule with the declaration against penal interest exception. Furthermore, the majority\u2019s analysis fails to address the \u201cnarrowly circumscribed exceptions\u201d to the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d barring admission of the prior consistent hearsay statement. <em>Faison, </em>243 Va. at 404, 417 S.E.2d at 309. I can find no case decision holding that a prior consistent statement may be admitted under an exception to the hearsay rule if the statement is proved to be inculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>For these reasons, I would hold that the trial judge erred, reverse the convictions, and remand for retrial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
