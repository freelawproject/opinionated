Upon notification of the order, Wallace petitioned the trial court pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-352(B), seeking a \u201cjudicial hearing and determination ... that [he] is not an habitual offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Following an <em>ore terms </em>hearing, the court found that one among the three predicate convictions necessary to Wallace\u2019s habitual offender determination \u201carose out of a suspension for nonpayment of costs and fines\u201d and that \u201cpayment had been made.\u201d Relying upon Code \u00a7 46.2-355(iii), the court concluded that Wallace was \u201cnot an habitual offender\u201d and restored his privileges. DMV appeals, arguing that Code \u00a7 46.2-855(iii) permits such relief only when <em>\u201call </em>of the convictions ... used as \u2018qualifying offenses\u2019 to determine the individual an habitual offender\u201d are exempted from consideration by the statute. We agree and reverse the disputed order of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">It is uncontroverted that Wallace had previously been convicted of three separate offenses which, together, facially identified him as an habitual offender in accordance with Code \u00a7 46.2-351.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result, Code \u00a7 46.2-352 directed the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>missioner to \u201ccause the [DMV] records to indicate that [Wallace had] been determined to be an habitual offender and ... revoke [his] driver\u2019s license for the period of time specified in \u00a7 46.2-356.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-352(A). In further compliance with the statute, the Commissioner was required to \u201cimmediately notify [Wallace] of the revocation and of his right to file a petition and request a hearing\u201d before \u201cthe circuit court ... for ... determination by the court that [Wallace] is not an habitual offender.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-352.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Wallace elected to pursue judicial review and initiated the instant proceeding by petition in the trial court. Evidence at the related hearing disclosed a conviction in the New Kent County General District Court for \u201cDriving Under Revocation Or Suspension,\u201d a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-395, as one of the three offenses indispensable to the Commissioner\u2019s determination that Wallace was an habitual offender. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-351(l)(c). The evidence further established that the New Kent County conviction was \u201cbased on a suspension that occurred for failing to pay fines and costs, ... now paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Relying upon Code \u00a7 46.2 \u2014 355(iii), <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wallace argued before the trial court that a person is not an habitual offender if <em>one </em>of the \u201cqualifying offenses\u201d specified by Code \u00a7 46.2 \u2014 351(l)(c) was predicated upon a conviction which arose from a suspension or revocation exempted by statute. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>agreed, finding Code \u00a7 46.2 \u2014 355(iii) \u201cambiguous as to whether [it] applied to all qualifying offenses or any one of the qualifying offenses,\u201d and restored Wallace\u2019s privilege to drive as a result of the single New Kent County conviction. On appeal, DMV asserts that Code \u00a7 46.2-355(iii) clearly provides relief from an habitual offender determination only when <em>all </em>\u201cqualifying offenses\u201d were convictions dependent upon those suspensions or revocations specifically embraced by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Assuming, without deciding, that Code \u00a7 46.2-355(iii) is ambiguous, the basic tenets of statutory construction require us to \u201cascertain and give effect to legislative intent.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992) (citations omitted). A statute must be construed \u201cto give reasonable effect to the words used\u201d and to further its remedial purposes. <em>Mayhew v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 484, 489, 458 S.E.2d 305, 307 (1995) (citation omitted). Proper construction seeks to harmonize the provisions of a statute both internally, <em>see Mejia v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va. App. 173, 176-77, 474 S.E.2d 866, 868 (1996) <em>(en </em>banc), and in relation to other statutes. <em>See Newton v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 86, 90, 462 S.E.2d 117, 119 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">We recognize that, \u201c[although [an habitual offender determination] is a civil proceeding, its effect is to impose a forfeiture ... [and,] [therefore, the operative statute must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Hoye v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 587, 589, 405 S.E.2d 628, 629 (1991). However, strict construction cannot thwart clear legislative intent or justify an absurd result. <em>See Gwaltney v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 468, 475, 452 S.E.2d 687, 691 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The words chosen by the legislature in drafting a statute derive meaning from both definition and context and, therefore, we divine legislative intent by construing an enactment as a whole, together with companion statutes, if any. The legal maxim, <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>instructs that \u201ca word takes color and expression from the purport of the entire phrase of which it is a part, and ... must be read in harmony with its context.\u201d <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 460, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>309 S.E.2d 337, 339 (1983). Similarly, legislative purpose can best be \u201c \u2018ascertained from the act itself when read in the light of other statutes relating to the same subject matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moreno v. Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. 190, 197, 480 S.E.2d 792, 796 (1997) (citation omitted). The doctrine of <em>pari materia </em>teaches that \u201c \u2018statutes are not to be considered as isolated fragments of law, but as a whole, or as parts of a great, connected homogenous system, or a simple and complete statutory arrangement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 480 S.E.2d at 796 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Code \u00a7 46.2-355 is an integral component to a legislative scheme intended</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">to provide maximum safety for all persons using the highways; to deny the privilege of operating motor vehicles to persons who by their record have demonstrated their indifference to the safety of others and their disrespect for the laws of the state and the orders of its courts; to discourage repetition of criminal acts by individuals; and to impose increased and added deprivation of the privilege to operate motor vehicles upon habitual offenders who have been convicted repeatedly of violations of traffic laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\"><em>Whorley v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 740, 745-46, 214 S.E.2d 447, 451 (1975). Code \u00a7 46.2-351 identifies those convictions arising from unlawful conduct deemed inconsistent with this legislative purpose. Thus, Code \u00a7 46.2-355 is properly read only when juxtaposed with Code \u00a7 46.2-351 and companion enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Accordingly, the parties acknowledge that the \u201cqualifying offenses\u201d contemplated by Code \u00a7 46.2-355(iii) are those violations specified in Code \u00a7 46.2-351 which define the putative habitual offender then before the court. By describing such \u201cqualifying offenses\u201d plurally, the legislature clearly intended to include <em>all </em>predicate offenses which brought the person within the purview of Code \u00a7 46.2-351. In this context, we consider the entire statutory phrase, \u201chas qualifying offenses based <em>solely </em>upon convictions as set out in subdivision 1 c of \u00a7 46.2-351 resulting from a suspension or revocation ordered pursuant to \u00a7 46.2-395 for failure to pay fines and costs.... \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Code \u00a7 46.2 \u2014 355(iii) (emphasis added). Thus, properly construed, the statute provides that no person may be declared an habitual offender when <em>all </em>\u201cqualifying offenses\u201d resulted from convictions specified in Code \u00a7 46.2-351(l)(c), provided the underlying suspension or revocation in each instance resulted from nonpayment of fines and costs, now fully satisfied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">This construction of Code \u00a7 46.2 \u2014 355(iii) is made more apparent by Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B), a companion statute which provides that \u201c[a]ny person who has been found to be an habitual offender ... based <em>entirely </em>upon convictions as set out in [Code \u00a7 46.2-351(l)(c) ], may, after payment in full of all outstanding fines [and] costs relating to his determination, ... petition the court\u201d for restoration of privileges. Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B) (emphasis added). In contrast, \u201c[a]ny person who has been found ... an habitual offender ... based <em>in part </em>and dependent on a conviction as set out in [Code \u00a7 46.2-351(l)(c) ]\u201d may not petition for restoration for three years from the final order. Code \u00a7 46.2-361(A) (emphasis added); <em>see Commonwealth v. Lynn, </em>29 Va.App. 151, 154, 510 S.E.2d 270, 272 (1999); <em>Commonwealth v. Brown, </em>28 Va.App. 781, 787, 508 S.E.2d 916, 919 (1999). Thus, consonant with Code \u00a7 46.2 \u2014 355(iii), Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B) provides a procedure to immediately restore the privileges of any person already declared an habitual offender whenever <em>all </em>\u201cqualifying convictions\u201d resulted from a failure to pay fines and costs and such obligations are subsequently paid and satisfied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The trial court, therefore, erroneously determined that Wallace, a person with only one \u201cqualifying offense\u201d contemplated by Code \u00a7 46.2 \u2014 355(iii), was not an habitual offender. Accordingly, we reverse the order and remand the proceedings to the trial court for disposition consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-9\">. In pertinent part. Code \u00a7 46.2-351 defines an habitual offender as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">any resident or nonresident person whose record ... shows that he has accumulated ... convictions ... for separate offenses, committed within a ten-year period, ... as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>1.

Under Wallace\u2019s construction of Code \u00a7 46.2 \u2014 355(iii), Code \u00a7 46.2-361(A) would require a person wrongfully determined an habitual offender to wait three years for restoration, an absurd result.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
