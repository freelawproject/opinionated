Slawski appeals from the decision of the circuit court registering for enforcement a foreign order, a 1980 New Jersey divorce decree, under which he was obligated to pay child support for his son and spousal support for his former wife, Patricia Sheehan. Virginia\u2019s Department of Social Services, Division of Child Support Enforcement (the Department), initially sought to register the order on Sheehan\u2019s behalf in the juvenile and domestic relations district court pursuant to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIF-SA). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-88.32 to 20-88.82. On appeal to this Court, Slawski contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that the circuit court, on its <em>de novo </em>review, erroneously registered the order pursuant to UIFSA because various defenses barred registration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Department moved to dismiss this appeal on the ground that the circuit court order appealed from was not final because the juvenile and domestic relations district court had neither determined the amount of the support arrearages nor ruled on an accompanying show cause action. We hold that the circuit court erred in failing to determine the support arrearage. Because the circuit court failed to determine the support arrearage, which determination is essential to appellate review, it did not properly confirm the registration of the foreign support order. Therefore, we remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Under UIFSA, a foreign order is registered when it and other specified documents are filed with the registering tribunal. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-88.32 (defining \u201cregister\u201d), 20-88.67, 20-88.68(A). The juvenile and domestic relations district court serves as a registering tribunal in Virginia. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-88.33. A registered foreign order is enforceable only after it has been confirmed. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-88.68. An order is confirmed after the court has issued notice to the non-registering party of the registration and the amount of the alleged arrearages, if any, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 20-88.70(A), and has provided the non-registering party with an opportunity for a hearing to contest the registration and amount of arrearages. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-88.70(B), 20-88.73.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">If the non-registering party does not timely contest the registration, both the registered order and the certified statement of arrearages required to be filed with the order are confirmed by operation of law. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-88.67(A)(3), 20-88.70(B), 20-88.71(B), 20-88.73. If the non-registering party timely contests the registration, the court must either vacate or confirm the registration or grant other appropriate relief. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-88.71, 20-88.72. When registration is contested, UIFSA\u2019s provisions require concomitant consideration of the defenses that are raised, including challenges to the validity of the order, enforcement, and calculation of arrearages. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-88.71, 20-88.72, 20-88.73; <em>see also Cowan v. Moreno, </em>903 S.W.2d 119, 124 n. 12 (Tex.App. 1995) (citing UIFSA as adopted by Texas legislature). Thus, confirmation of the registration necessarily includes a determination of the amount of the arrearage, if any. <em>See also </em>UIFSA \u00a7 608 cmt. (amended 1996), 9 U.L.A. 322, 395 (Supp. 1998) (noting that confirmation \u201cvalidates both the terms of the order and the asserted arrearages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Although the circuit court ruled on Slawski\u2019s claimed defenses to registration and ordered the foreign decree \u201cregistered for enforcement,\u201d it did not calculate the arrearage or enter an order confirming the registration, as required under the statutory scheme. By failing to calculate the arrearage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>and remanding that determination to the juvenile and domestic relations district court, the circuit court deprived the parties of the right on <em>de novo </em>appeal to have that determination made by the circuit court. When a <em>de novo </em>appeal is taken to the circuit court, the parties are entitled to have the case tried \u201cas if it had been originally instituted in that court.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tuttle, </em>208 Va. 28, 33, 155 S.E.2d 358, 361 (1967). Instead, the circuit court ordered the matter remanded to the district court for calculation of the arrearages, which deprived Slawski of his right to <em>de novo </em>review in the circuit court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-113.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">For these reasons, we hold that this matter is not fully reviewable, and we remand to the circuit court for entry of an order of confirmation, which necessarily includes a determination of the amount of any arrearages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-9\">. Slawski also contests the \"appeal bond\u201d of $300,000 ordered by the circuit court. Because the circuit court did not calculate the arrearages, if any, due under the foreign order, we conclude that no supersedeas bond is necessary and that Slawski\u2019s filing of a $500 bond \u201cfor costs alone\u201d is sufficient to permit our review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-15\">. No issue was raised by the Department in the circuit court or in this Court challenging the <em>de novo </em>appeal from the district court to the circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b766-16\">. We do not consider any other issues raised by appellant in this appeal. Therefore, such issues remain fully reviewable in any subsequent appeal pursuant to the rules of this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
