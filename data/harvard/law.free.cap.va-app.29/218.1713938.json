Employer also appeals the commission\u2019s finding that claimant proved a loss of function in his left leg for purposes of determining permanent partial disability benefits. For the following reasons, we affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">On August 31, 1995, claimant suffered a compensable injury to his back. Pursuant to a memorandum of agreement signed by the parties, the commission entered an award on November 16, 1995, providing for temporary total disability benefits beginning September 21, 1995, based upon an average weekly wage of $512.99.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">At the time of his injury, claimant worked as a paramedic, or emergency medical technician (EMT), for Mercy Tidewater. As an EMT, he provided advanced and basic life support care to patients being transported in an ambulance. Claimant described his job duties as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>As a paramedic working for Mercy we were to provide care regardless of what scale it was. We worked accidents, heart attacks, strokes, that type of thing. We would start IV\u2019s, start oxygen therapy, patient assessments. We would give medications as dictated in the field under ... protocols and most of the time we didn\u2019t even have to contact a physician. We would draw blood, we analyze like blood sugars, bandage wounds, gunshots....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Both claimant and his partner also drove the ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">During this same time period, claimant also worked as an unlicensed clinician<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at Children\u2019s Hospital of the King\u2019s Daughters (Children\u2019s Hospital). As a clinician in the emergency room, claimant\u2019s duties included: weighing patients; taking vital signs, including pulse, respiration and blood pressure; drawing blood samples; starting IVs; administering respiratory treatments; assisting with heart monitors; and performing nasal washings and urine catheterizations. Claimant testified that his duties at Children\u2019s Hospital were the same as those at Mercy Tidewater. \u201cThe only difference was, the patients were smaller [at Children\u2019s Hospital] and they were in a hospital setting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">At the time claimant executed the memorandum of agreement, he was unaware that his job at Children\u2019s Hospital could be considered as similar employment in computing his average weekly wage. Accordingly, on August 21, 1997, claimant filed an application requesting that the commission retroactively modify his average weekly wage to include his wages from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Children\u2019s Hospital. Claimant also sought an award of permanent partial disability benefits based upon a five percent rating to his lower left extremity.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">In its opinion, the commission found \u201csubstantial overlap in the specific duties and skills required of both jobs. The claimant\u2019s primary mission for both employers was emergency medical services.\u201d As a result, the commission found substantial similarity between the two jobs for the purpose of computing claimant\u2019s average weekly wage. Additionally, claimant provided a valid explanation for his delay in seeking a modification of the award and employer failed to show any prejudice. Therefore, applying the doctrine of imposition, the commission retroactively modified claimant\u2019s average weekly wage to include his employment at Children\u2019s Hospital and changed the amount from $512.99 to $820.31 per week. Finally, the commission found that claimant sufficiently established a loss of function in his left leg.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">In the case at bar, Dr. Kemer reported deficits in the claimant\u2019s range of motion, and paresthesias. He also referred to a functional limitation caused by the claimant\u2019s leg problem. The claimant testified to \u201cextreme pain and numbness down the left leg,\u201d and stated that the leg \u201ckind of goes out from under me if I don\u2019t watch it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Although the commission concluded that claimant had proved a loss of function in his left leg, it denied permanent partial disability benefits because claimant failed to prove that he had reached maximum medical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">II. CLAIMANT\u2019S AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">On appeal, employer first argues that the commission erred in finding that claimant\u2019s two employments were substantially similar. Employer contends that while the positions at Mercy Tidewater and Children\u2019s Hospital were \u201cmedically related,\u201d the duties of each job were different and, therefore, claimant\u2019s wages at Children\u2019s Hospital should not be included when computing his average weekly wage. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">The findings of the commission, if based upon credible evidence, are conclusive and binding upon this Court. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Code \u00a7 65.2-706; <em>Falls Church Constr. Co. v. Laidler, </em>254 Va. 474, 478-79, 498 S.E.2d 521, 524 (1997); <em>Southern Express v. Green, </em>26 Va.App. 439, 445, 495 S.E.2d 500, 503 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The commission computes workers\u2019 compensation benefits on the basis of the employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When an injured employee is disabled from performing his employment duties, the employee\u2019s earnings include the earnings from two or more jobs that are \u201csubstantially similar.\u201d <em>Frederick Fire and Rescue v. Dodson, </em>20 Va.App. 440, 443, 457 S.E.2d 783, 784 (1995). \u201cVirginia follows the majority rule that when an employee is injured on one job while in concurrent employment, the average weekly wage compensated is based on the combined earnings of both jobs if, but only if, the employments are related or similar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>First Virginia Banks, Inc. v. McNeil, </em>8 Va.App. 342, 343, 381 S.E.2d 357, 358 (1989)). This rule, also termed the dissimilar employment rule, \u201cis alive and well in workers\u2019 compensation law.\u201d <em>Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund v. Thrush, </em>255 Va. 14, 21, 496 S.E.2d 57, 60 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The term \u201csimilar\u201d in this context may relate to the similarity of: (1) the work, (2) the industry in which the work is performed, or (3) the degree of hazard to which the employee is exposed. <em>See generally </em>5 A. Larson, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 60.31 (1997). In determining whether two jobs are \u201csubstantially similar,\u201d we look to the following: (1) \u201cthe duties and skills\u201d of each job, and (2) \u201cthe primary mission\u201d of the employee on each job. <em>Dodson, </em>20 Va.App. at 444-45, 457 S.E.2d at 785. \u201cIn every situation where the commission is asked to determine whether two or more jobs are substantially similar, the commission must consider not only the particular duties of each job, but also the general nature or type of employment of the two jobs.\u201d <em>Creedle Sales Co. v. Edmonds, </em>24 Va.App. 24, 28, 480 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>In the instant case, the commission found that claimant\u2019s jobs at Mercy Tidewater and Children\u2019s Hospital had \u201ca substantial overlap in the specific duties and skills____\u201d Claimant testified that he provided \u201cadvance life support and basic life support care to patients\u201d at Mercy Tidewater. As a paramedic, he performed patient assessments, started IVs, started oxygen therapy, administered medications according to protocol, drew blood, and bandaged wounds. At Children\u2019s Hospital, claimant worked as an unlicensed clinician in the emergency room, taking vital signs, weighing patients, administering oxygen, drawing blood, starting IVs, giving respiratory care, and performing nasal washings and catheterizations. Claimant testified that his duties at Children\u2019s Hospital were the same as those at Mercy Tidewater.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe only difference was, the patients were smaller [at Children\u2019s Hospital] and they were in a hospital setting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Moreover, the commission specifically found that \u201cclaimant\u2019s primary mission for both employers was <em>emergency care services.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Although the jobs were performed in different settings (ie., an ambulance versus an emergency room), the employments were of the same general class. Both positions focused on providing emergency care services to patients. <em>Cf. Dodson, </em>20 Va.App. at 445, 457 S.E.2d at 785 (finding that emergency medical technician and firefighter-paramedic were of the same general class of \u201cemergency/rescue\u201d); <em>Edmonds, </em>24 Va.App. at 28-29, 480 S.E.2d at 125 (finding that plumbing/pipe-fitting and mechanic work were of the same \u201cprimary mission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s employment at Children\u2019s Hospital was substantially similar to his employment at Mercy Tidewater. Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant\u2019s two employments were substantially similar for purposes of computing claimant\u2019s average weekly wage. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-706; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>Laidler, </em>254 Va. at 478-79, 493 S.E.2d at 524; <em>Green, </em>26 Va.App. at 445, 495 S.E.2d at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Next, we address employer\u2019s argument that the commission erred in modifying claimant\u2019s average weekly wage using the doctrine of imposition. Employer contends that the evidence failed to establish that claimant was \u201cthe victim of an imposition of any kind\u201d and, therefore, should not be entitled to a modification of his average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">It is well settled that an employee\u2019s average weekly wage, even after being agreed to by the parties and set forth in an award of the commission, is subject to modification upon the grounds of fraud, misrepresentation, mistake or imposition. <em>See John Driggs Co. v. Somers, </em>228 Va. 729, 734, 324 S.E.2d 694, 697 (1985); <em>Collins v. Dept. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>21 Va.App. 671, 679-80, 467 S.E.2d 279, 283, <em>affd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>22 Va.App. 625, 472 S.E.2d 287 (1996). It is immaterial whether the mistake of fact is mutual or unilateral. <em>See Collins, </em>21 Va.App. at 680, 467 S.E.2d at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">We need not decide whether the commission erroneously applied the doctrine of imposition. It is clear on this record that the commission correctly modified claimant\u2019s average weekly wage. Thus, even if the commission incorrectly applied the doctrine of imposition, it reached the right result. <em>See Granados v. Windson Dev. Corp., </em>257 Va. 103, 109, 509 S.E.2d 290, 293 (1999) (\u201cSince the Commission reached the correct conclusion in denying benefits to [claimant], although it gave the wrong reason, we sustain that conclusion and assign the right ground set forth above.\u201d); <em>Robbins v. Grimes, </em>211 Va. 97, 100, 175 S.E.2d 246, 248 (1970) (\u2018We do not hesitate, in a proper case, where the correct conclusion has been reached but the wrong reason given, to sustain the result and assign the right ground.\u201d); <em>Beverly Health and Rehab. Serv., Inc. v. Metcalf, </em>24 Va.App. 584, 596, 484 S.E.2d 156, 162 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The commission held that claimant sufficiently explained his delay in requesting a modification. Claimant testified that at the time he executed the memorandum of agreement, he was unaware that his job at Children\u2019s Hospital could be consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ered as similar employment for purposes of computing his average weekly wage. We hold that under these circumstances, there was a mutual mistake of fact as to claimant\u2019s average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u201cIn determining whether a mutual mistake of fact existed at the time of the agreement, the inquiry is not, ... who initially made the mistake, but rather, whether each party held the same mistaken belief with respect to a material fact at the time the agreement was executed.\u201d <em>Collins, </em>21 Va.App. at 681, 467 S.E.2d at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In the instant case, the parties initially agreed to an average weekly wage of $512.99. At the time the parties entered the memorandum of agreement, employer was unaware of claimant\u2019s job with Children\u2019s Hospital. Similarly, claimant was unaware that his concurrent employment could be used in calculating his average weekly wage. In essence, both employer and claimant \u201cheld the same mistaken belief\u2019 that the average weekly wage figure of $512.99 correctly approximated the economic loss suffered by claimant. <em>Collins, </em>21 Va.App. at 681, 467 S.E.2d at 283. Had employer been aware that claimant held concurrent employment with Children\u2019s Hospital,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or had claimant known that his concurrent employment could be used in computing his average weekly wage, the parties may have taken different positions on the question of claimant\u2019s average weekly wage. Because a mutual mistake of fact existed at the time the parties entered into the memorandum of agreement, we affirm the commission\u2019s modification of claimant\u2019s average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">III. PERMANENT PARTIAL DISABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Employer next argues that the commission erred in finding that claimant sufficiently established a loss of func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>tion to his left leg, even though it denied benefits because claimant failed to establish that he reached maximum medical improvement. We hold that because claimant failed to show that he had reached maximum medical improvement, the commission was precluded from determining claimant\u2019s permanent loss of function. <em>See Rusty\u2019s Welding Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 510 S.E.2d 255 (1999) (en banc). \u201cUntil the deputy or commission received medical evidence that the injured employee attained maximum medical improvement, the deputy was without authority to make an award for permanent injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>County of Spotsylvania v. Hart, </em>218 Va. 565, 568, 238 S.E.2d 813, 815 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In the present case, claimant failed to establish both prongs necessary for an award of permanent partial disability benefits <em>(i.e., </em>a ratable loss of function <em>and </em>that he had reached maximum medical improvement). Thus, while the issue of permanent partial disability was addressed by the commission, any actual finding of permanent impairment or functional loss was premature. Accordingly, we vacate the commission\u2019s finding, and the issue is left open for future determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, vacated in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-7\">. According to claimant, a \"licensed clinician\u201d is a licensed practical nurse, and an \"unlicensed clinician\u201d is a paramedic. However, both positions carry out the same duties. Claimant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASx\">Q. Do the [licensed practical nurses] and the paramedics, who worked as clinicians at Children's Hospital, perform the same job duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">A. Yes, they did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">Q. And were they supervised by nurses and doctors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">A. Nurses and doctors, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">Q. And they perform all those job duties in the emergency department, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-6\">. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act defines average weekly wage as \u201d[t]he earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury....\u201d Code\u00a7 65.2-101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\">. Claimant's testimony about his duties at Children\u2019s Hospital is further bolstered by the \"Job Description\u201d of the unlicensed clinician, which was in the record before the commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b269-8\">. The fact that employer might initially have contested use of wages earned at Children\u2019s Hospital does not establish the absence of mistake on employer\u2019s part. The \"mistake of fact\u201d on employer\u2019s part was its lack of knowledge of a relevant fact or consideration affecting calculation of claimant\u2019s average weekly wage, not the position it would assert when that fact became known.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
