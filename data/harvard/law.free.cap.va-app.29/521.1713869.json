Shifflett (\u201cappellant\u201d) was convicted by jury trial of the first degree murder of Patricia E. Smith and sentenced to life imprisonment. In this appeal, appellant contends the trial court erred by: (1) admitting the testimony of Diane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Kruger concerning appellant\u2019s commission of a prior crime; and (2) admitting irrelevant testimony of John Howard. We disagree and affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The facts stated in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party, establish that on the night of October 29, 1978, Smith met a group of Mends at a restaurant. Appellant joined the group later that evening. In the early morning of October 30, the group decided to relocate to a local hotel to listen to a band. Appellant gave Smith a ride in his car. Before leaving for the hotel, Emilio Hernandez pulled his car up to appellant\u2019s car to confirm Smith\u2019s plans. Smith told Hernandez that she would see him at the hotel and asked him to order drinks for appellant and her. Neither appellant nor Smith arrived at the hotel that night. On October 31, 1978, appellant told Hernandez that he parted company with Smith when she drove off with a man in a gray Cadillac.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">On November 20, 1978, Smith\u2019s body was found lying face down on the ground in Loudoun County, Virginia. With the exception of socks on her feet, Smith\u2019s body was nude from the waist down with a blue jean jacket tied around her neck. The cause of Smith\u2019s death was determined to be \u201cstrangulation by ligature.\u201d No evidence of sexual assault was found on Smith\u2019s body. David R. Simpson, an evidence technician for the Loudoun County Sheriffs Department at that time, noticed lividity marks on Smith\u2019s back, which indicated to him that she had died while lying on her back and had subsequently been flipped over. Simpson also noticed animal markings on the decomposing body.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">On October 15, 1996, a grand jury charged appellant with the murder of Smith. On March 6, 1997, the Commonwealth filed a \u201cNotice of Intention to Offer Evidence of Other Crimes.\u201d The notice indicated the Commonwealth\u2019s intent to introduce evidence of appellant\u2019s assault on Diane Kruger as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>evidence of his guilt in the current prosecution. By order of August 4,1997, the court ruled that evidence regarding crimes committed by appellant against Kruger \u201cmay be admitted to show malice, premeditation, intent, motive, conduct or feelings\u201d of appellant towards Smith, but not to show identity. The court noted appellant\u2019s objection in its order and his renewed objection made immediately before Kruger\u2019s testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">A. BREW\u2019S TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">At trial, Donald Brew testified about the content of multiple conversations he had with appellant while the two men were confined within the Prince William County Adult Detention Center. Appellant told Brew that in August 1978 he met Kruger in a bar and offered to help her repair a problem with her vehicle. After appellant and Kruger left the bar and took the vehicle for a test-drive, appellant attacked her with a knife. Appellant stuffed a roll of toilet paper in Kruger\u2019s mouth and blocked her nose, intending not to kill her immediately. Appellant stated he \u201cjust wanted her to get the feeling of death.\u201d Appellant repeatedly blocked Kruger\u2019s airways and then relented, stating that he enjoyed the power he exercised over Kruger by bringing her close to death. During the attack, appellant forced Kruger to perform oral sex on him but could not sustain an erection long enough to rape her. Appellant told Brew he became fully aroused only when he had blocked Kruger\u2019s air passages with the toilet paper. Appellant acknowledged stabbing Kruger numerous times before she was able to escape by striking appellant\u2019s head with a bottle and fleeing the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Brew also testified that appellant admitted killing Smith in 1978 while he was free on bond for the charge of attacking Kruger. According to Brew, appellant met Smith around Halloween when she came to the service station where he worked. One evening, appellant met Smith again at a bar and arranged to give her a ride home. While sitting in appellant\u2019s car, Smith saw a Cadillac salesman she knew, went over to his vehicle for several minutes, and returned to appellant\u2019s vehi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>cle. According to Brew, appellant drove Smith to a location near Leesburg, knowing even before he left the bar\u2019s parking lot that he was going to kill her. After parking beside a road, appellant forced Smith to perform oral sex on him and strangled her to death by wrapping her jacket around her neck. Appellant told Brew that, while he was forcing Smith to perform oral sex on him, he could only become fully aroused \u201cwhen he was strangling her with the fatigue jacket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Appellant put Smith\u2019s body in his trunk and drove to a site where he had previously delivered heavy equipment with his brother-in-law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant abandoned his plan to bury the body there when he saw lights that he had not previously noticed during his earlier daytime visit. Brew also described appellant\u2019s efforts to conceal his involvement in Smith\u2019s murder, indicating that he cleaned his car twice and attempted to divert police attention to the Cadillac salesman who Smith encountered on the night of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Brew also testified that \u201ca couple of weeks later\u201d appellant returned to the site where he had left the body to ensure that the body was still covered. At that time, appellant noticed that \u201canimals had been at the body.\u201d Brew recalled appellant referring to both Kruger and Smith as \u201cbitch[es],\u201d \u201cslut[s],\u201d and \u201cwhore[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">B. KRUGER\u2019S TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The Commonwealth subsequently called Diane Kruger as a witness. Kruger testified that appellant approached her in a bar on August 1, 1978 and offered to help fix some problems she had with her car and which she had discussed with him at their first meeting several days earlier. Appellant convinced Kruger to permit him to take the car for a test-drive. Entering the passenger side of Kruger\u2019s vehicle, appellant instructed Kruger to follow a car which he claimed contained some friends on their way to a party. Appellant told Kruger to pull <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>off the road and turn off the car while they waited to meet some of his friends. When Kruger reached to start her car again, appellant produced a knife and threatened Kruger with it. After forcing her to perform oral sex on him, appellant tied Kruger\u2019s hands and began stuffing toilet paper in her mouth. Kruger recalled that appellant repeatedly stuffed the paper into her mouth, nearly blocking her air passage, and then released the pressure. Kruger also testified that appellant was unable to maintain an erection during this two-hour assault. Once she covertly freed her hands, Kruger escaped from the car by striking appellant in the head with a bottle. While in the process of fleeing, Kruger sustained multiple stab wounds in her abdomen and in the area of her heart, lung, and side. Appellant\u2019s objection to Kruger\u2019s testimony was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">C. HOWARD\u2019S TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"AlQ\">John Howard testified that he was at his parents\u2019 house in early November 1978. The Howards\u2019 residence is approximately two-tenths of a mile from the spot where Smith\u2019s body was found. Howard recalled a round-faced white man in his mid-to-late twenties with reddish brown hair, large ears, and freckles coming to the door. Howard described the man as resembling \u201cAlfred E. Newman,\u201d a character of MAD magazine. The man asked Howard \u201cwhat Die] thought of the body down at the bottom of the hill ... down near the culvert ... right off the road in plain view for everyone to see.\u201d When Howard replied that he knew nothing about the body, the visitor told Howard that it was laying face down and that it was only a mannequin with a blond wig that local children had placed there as a Halloween prank. The man told Howard one could not \u201ctell that it wasn\u2019t a woman until you rolled the body over.\u201d The visitor continued, saying that people had already reported seeing the body to the police and that \u201cthe police didn\u2019t even respond anymore.\u201d Approximately two weeks later, Smith\u2019s body was found in the vicinity of the Howard residence. Appellant objected to this evidence after Howard testified. The court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">ADMISSION OF KRUGER\u2019S TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Under settled Virginia law, evidence of other crimes or bad acts is inadmissible to prove the accused is guilty of the crime charged. <em>See Guill v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 134, 138, 495 S.E.2d 489, 491 (1998). \u201cSuch evidence implicating an accused in other crimes unrelated to the charged offense is inadmissible because it may confuse the issues being tried and cause undue prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">As an exception to the general rule of exclusion, however, evidence of other crimes or bad acts is admissible \u201cif relevant to a material issue or element of consequence in the-case.\u201d <em>Foster v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 316, 319, 362 S.E.2d 745, 747 (1987). Among the permissible uses of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence, such evidence may be admitted: (1) to prove any element of the offense charged, (2) to show the motive, intent, or knowledge of the accused, (3) to show the conduct and feeling of the accused toward his or her victim, or (4) to show premeditation or malice. <em>See Satcher v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 220, 230, 421 S.E.2d 821, 828 (1992); <em>Cheng v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 34, 393 S.E.2d 599, 603 (1990). Such evidence is also admissible to establish the perpetrator\u2019s identity when \u201csome aspects of the prior crime are so distinctive or idiosyncratic that the fact finder reasonably could infer that the same person committed both crimes.\u201d <em>Guill, </em>255 Va. at 138-39, 495 S.E.2d at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Before \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence will be admitted, however, the prior crime or bad act must be shown to have a causal relation or logical and natural connection with the crime charged or, alternately, the two acts must form parts of the same transaction. <em>See id. </em>at 140, 495 S.E.2d at 492-93. Furthermore, evidence whose prejudicial impact outweighs its probative value will not be admitted. <em>See Woodfin v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 89, 95, 372 S.E.2d 377, 381 (1988). The trial court is charged with balancing prejudicial impact and probative value and the court\u2019s decision is subject to reversal only for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Pavlick v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number><em>wealth, </em>27 Va.App. 219, 226, 497 S.E.2d 920, 923-24 (1998) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Appellant contends Kruger\u2019s testimony had no causal relationship to or logical connection with the crime charged and was, therefore, not admissible under any exception to the general rule against admitting \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. We disagree. The logical connection which exists between the two incidents is provided by the idiosyncratic characteristics they manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Generally referred to as evidence of <em>modus operands, </em>under the holding of <em>Spencer v. Commonwealth, </em>the test for the admission of such evidence is satisfied \u201cwhere the other incidents are \u2018sufficiently idiosyncratic to permit an inference of pattern for purposes of proof.\u2019 \u201d 240 Va. 78, 90, 393 S.E.2d 609, 616 (1990) (quoting <em>United States v. Hudson, </em>884 F.2d 1016, 1021 (7th Cir.1989) (citation omitted)). The crimes need not be so similar as to constitute a signature or carbon copy of the case on trial. <em>See Spencer, </em>240 Va. at 89-90, 393 S.E.2d at 616. \u201cRather, it is sufficient if the [evidence of] other crimes bear \u2018a singular strong resemblance to the pattern of the offense charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 393 S.E.2d at 616 (quoting <em>Hudson, </em>884 F.2d at 1021).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Although the admissibility of evidence showing <em>modus operandi </em>has generally been viewed as a means of proving the identity of a crime\u2019s perpetrator, <em>see Chichester v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 311, 326-28, 448 S.E.2d 638, 648-49 (1994); <em>Foster, </em>5 Va.App. at 320, 362 S.E.2d at 747, the evidence challenged in this case was not admitted to establish identity, and the jury was instructed that they could not consider the evidence on that issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We see no reason, however, to limit the admissibility of evidence showing <em>modus operandi </em>to the purpose of proving identity. When evidence of idiosyncratic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>similarities in an accused\u2019s mode of attack exists and constitutes a logical connection with the crime charged, such evidence may be admitted for the purpose of establishing, by inference, the accused\u2019s intent, motive, malice, premeditation, or the accused\u2019s feelings toward the victim, as well as the perpetrator\u2019s identity. <em>See Lafon v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 411, 418-19, 438 S.E.2d 279, 284 (1993) (affirming the trial court\u2019s admission of <em>modus operandi </em>evidence, which consisted of prior bad acts and planning, for the purpose of proving the accused\u2019s intent and premeditation during the crime charged); <em>Witt v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 215, 219, 422 S.E.2d 465, 468 (1992) (affirming the admission of evidence that an accused committed prior burglaries in a manner similar to the crime charged for the purpose of proving, <em>inter alia, </em>the accused\u2019s knowledge and intent). <em>See also Guill, </em>255 Va. at 141, 495 S.E.2d at 493 (assuming without deciding that the test of <em>Spencer, </em>which permits the admission of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence on the issue of identity when the prior crimes manifest idiosyncratic similarities with the crime charged, may support the admission of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence even when the identity of the perpetrator of the crime charged is known).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Assuming without deciding that <em>modus operandi </em>evidence must meet the test of admissibility established in <em>Spencer </em>irrespective of the purpose for which it is admitted, we find that the similarities between appellant\u2019s assault on Kruger and the instant offense are sufficiently idiosyncratic to justify admission of the challenged \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. The similarities include the following: 1) each victim was a white woman in her twenties; 2) each victim encountered appellant in a bar and had been drinking; 3) each victim left with appellant in a car; 4) appellant exploited the car problems experienced by each victim; 5) appellant referred to each victim as a \u201cslut,\u201d a \u201cbitch,\u201d and a \u201cwhore\u201d; 6) Kruger was almost asphyxiated with toilet paper crammed in her mouth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>while Smith was murdered by strangulation; 7) appellant forced each victim to perform oral sex; and 8) in each case appellant said he could not reach full sexual arousal until he prevented his victim from breathing. We also note that the offenses occurred within ninety days of each other, a time interval of sufficient duration to withstand appellant\u2019s challenge on the ground of remoteness. <em>See Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 72, 77, 278 S.E.2d 822, 825 (1981); <em>Lafon, </em>17 Va.App. at 419-20, 438 S.E.2d at 284-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Given the striking similarities between appellant\u2019s attack on Kruger and the evidence inculpating appellant in the instant offense, we find that Kruger\u2019s testimony bears a logical connection to the crime charged, as required in <em>Guill, </em>and provides a sound basis from which the trier of fact could infer motive, criminal intent, premeditation, malice, and the feelings of appellant toward the victim, which were at issue in the prosecution of the crime charged. As such, the evidence was relevant and properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">We further believe that the probative value of Kruger\u2019s testimony was not outweighed by its incidental prejudicial impact on the accused. <em>See Woodfin, </em>236 Va. at 95, 372 S.E.2d at 381. The probative value of this evidence tends to establish not only appellant\u2019s intent to sexually assault and then maim or murder Smith but also his commission of Smith\u2019s murder with premeditation and malice, as evidenced by the methods of attack and control appellant used to overcome the victim. Further, Kruger\u2019s testimony establishes the animus appellant felt toward his victim in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">In short, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in balancing the probative value of Kruger\u2019s testimony relative to any prejudicial impact on appellant and will not disturb its admission of this \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">ADMISSION OF HOWARD\u2019S TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Appellant next contends that the testimony provided by John Howard was irrelevant and thus improperly admitted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>He argues that because Howard could not identify appellant as the naan who appeared at his door a few weeks after the murder, his testimony was collateral to the issues being tried. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\u201cEvidence is admissible if it is both relevant and material.\u201d <em>Evans-Smith v. Commonwealth, 5 </em>Va.App. 188, 196, 361 S.E.2d 436, 441 (1987). \u201c \u2018Evidence is relevant if it has any logical tendency, however slight, to establish a fact at issue in the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Braxton v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 176, 186, 493 S.E.2d 688, 692 (1997) (quoting <em>Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 913, 918, 434 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In this case, the identity of Smith\u2019s murderer was a fact at issue. Evidence tending to show appellant\u2019s presence near Smith\u2019s body in November 1978 was probative on the issue of the perpetrator\u2019s identity and corroborated the testimony of Brew, who testified that appellant murdered Smith, dumped her body near Howard\u2019s house, and later returned to the site to cover up the body. At trial, Howard gave a detailed description of the man who appeared at his door in November 1978 but could not identify appellant as that individual. As the trier of fact, the jury was entitled to weigh Howard\u2019s testimony in light of its own observations of the physical characteristics of appellant, taking into consideration Howard\u2019s inability to identify the appellant, and to draw reasonable inferences regarding the identity of the man who came to Howard\u2019s door to inquire about a woman\u2019s body that was lying in a nearby culvert. <em>See Peterson v. Commonwealth, 225 </em>Va. 289, 295, 302 S.E.2d 520, 524 (1983) (stating that the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given identification testimony is a matter for the jury). <em>See also McDonnough v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 120, 132, 486 S.E.2d 570, 576 (1997) (finding that a witness\u2019 description of the perpetrator of the crime charged was probative identification evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-9\">. Appellant\u2019s brother-in-law worked for a company that moved construction equipment between job sites.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\">. The trial court instructed the jury that it could \"consider evidence that the defendant committed offenses other than the offense for which he is on trial only to show malice, premeditation, intent, motive, or conduct and feeling of the defendant towards the victim in connection with the offense for which he\u2019s on trial and for no other purpose.\u201d The jury is presumed to have followed the court\u2019s instruction of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number><em>LeVasseur v.
