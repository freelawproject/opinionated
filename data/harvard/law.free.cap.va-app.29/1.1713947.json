On appeal, defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to prove the offense. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, we view the record \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and give it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). The conviction will be affirmed unless \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-15\">Defendant was employed by Nickel Vending Company (Nickel), a business which operated \u201cdrink and snack machines\u201d throughout the Richmond area. Company owner Greg Nuckols suspected that money was being stolen from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Nickel\u2019s machines and contacted Henrico County Police for assistance. During the ensuing investigation, defendant, a former employee of Nickel, was questioned by police and admitted taking \u201cthe machine keys off a desk\u201d at Nickel, later using them \u201cto go in ... drink machines\u201d to steal money.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Nuckols testified that the \u201ckey ring\u201d stolen by defendant held \u201cthree or four keys\u201d that opened \u201call the machines [he] had,\u201d including a single \u201cmaster key\u201d which unlocked \u201cabout two hundred machines.\u201d Similar keys were provided to Nickel employees on \u201cindividual routes\u201d to permit access to the machines for restocking and collection of money from prior sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-94 makes it unlawful for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">any person [to] have in his possession any tools, implements, or outfit, with intent to commit burglary, robbery, or larceny____ The possession of such burglarious tools, implements, or outfit by any person other than a licensed dealer, shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to commit burglary, robbery, or larceny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Thus, the mere possession of \u201cany tools, implements, or outfit\u201d is not prohibited by the statute. Such articles \u201cmay be, and usually are, designed and manufactured for lawful purposes.\u201d <em>Burnette v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 785, 790, 75 S.E.2d 482, 486 (1958). The gravamen of the offense arises from the possessor\u2019s \u201cintent to use\u201d these \u201ccommon, ordinary\u201d objects for a criminal purpose specified by statute, <em>burglary, robbery or larceny.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">By including the second sentence in Code \u00a7 18.2-94, the legislature recognized the \u201cnatural and rational evidentiary relationship],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 790, 75 S.E.2d at 485, between the proscribed intent and possession of <em>\u201cburglarious </em>tools, implements, or outfit\u201d and \u201cadoptfed] a rule of evidence making possession ... <em>prima facie </em>evidence\u201d of such intent. <em>Id. </em>at</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>789, 75 S.E.2d at 485 (referring to former Code \u00a7 18-159). This presumption, however, does not attach to all \u201ctools; implements, or outfit[s]\u201d embraced by the statute, but only to such offending articles innately <em>burglarious </em>in character, those \u201ccommonly used by burglars in house breaking and safe cracking,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 792, 75 S.E.2d at 487, particularly \u201csuitable and appropriate to accomplish the destruction of any ordinary hindrance of access to any building, ... vault or safe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790, 75 S.E.2d at 486.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, to convict an accused for possession of \u201cany tools, implements, or outfit\u201d not inherently burglarious, like the subject keys, the Commonwealth must establish the requisite intent without benefit of the statutory presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Here, defendant argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove that the stolen keys were both \u201cburglarious\u201d and \u201ctools or implements\u201d contemplated by the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In support of his first contention, defendant reasons that the offending keys \u201copen[ed] ... vending machines[,] ... clearly ... not subject to being burglarized\u201d and, therefore, not \u201cburglarious.\u201d To place the keys beyond the reach of Code \u00a7 18.2-94, defendant relies upon a dictionary definition of tool, \u201csomething (as an instrument or apparatus) used in performing an operation or necessary in the practice of a vocation or profession,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>1243 (1985), and of implement, \u201cthings as are used or employed for a trade, or furniture of a house. Particularly applied to tools, utensils, instruments of labor; as the implements of trade or of farming.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>754 (deluxe 6th ed.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Defendant\u2019s arguments, however, misconstrue both the statute and the evidence. Code \u00a7 18.2-94 requires proof that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>the offending tools, implements or outfit were intrinsically \u201cburglarious\u201d only when the Commonwealth relies upon the statutory presumption to establish the requisite criminal intent. Here, unaided by the presumption and guided by the dictionary definition cited by defendant, we find that the vending machine keys were tools, \u201csomething (as an instrument or apparatus) ... necessary in the practice of a vocation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Manifestly, keys to unlock Nickel\u2019s vending machines were indispensable to the business.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Defendant admitted that he wrongfully gained possession of the keys and thereafter employed them to open several vending machines and steal coins. Under such circumstances, he clearly possessed and used the keys, tools embraced by Code \u00a7 18.2-94, with an intent to commit larceny, a violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-11\">. Violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-94 are sometimes referenced generally as \"possession of burglary tools.\u201d However, the statute criminalizes possession of \"tools, implements, or outfit\u201d with the intent to commit any one of three offenses, burglary, robbery or larceny. Code \u00a7 18.2-94.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b47-16\">. \u201cGenerally, the words and phrases used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usually accepted meaning unless a different intention is fairly manifest.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b47-17\">.

Use of the \"descriptive and relative\u201d word \"such\u201d preceding \"burglarious\u201d in creating the presumption was an \"obviously inadvertent\u201d legislative oversight which occurred during an amendment of the statute and must be \"ignored or deleted.\u201d <em>Burnette, </em>194 Va. at 788, 75 S.E.2d at 484.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b46-9\">.
