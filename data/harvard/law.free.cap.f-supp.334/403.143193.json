Plaintiff sues by her father and next friend under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the Fourteenth Amendment and the Social Security Act to have certain regulations of the State of New Hampshire, Department of Health and Welfare, declared invalid and their enforcement enjoined. Since a declaratory judgment and an injunction are sought, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 2202, and other necessary conditions are met, a three-judge court has been convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281, 2282 and 2284. Jurisdiction is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) and (4). All relevant facts have been stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-20\">Plaintiff is a thirty-nine year old woman who has suffered from a severe form of mental retardation since infancy. Since her mental capacity is that of only a seven year old child, she has never been able to engage in any sort of gainful occupation. During the past year, plaintiff was admitted to the Sacred Heart Hospital in Manchester, New Hampshire and had all of her teeth extracted. Part of her resulting dental and hospitalization expenses were covered by insurance. The balance, amounting to approximately $342.00, was billed to and was subsequently paid by plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>tiff\u2019s parents, who live in modest, though not impoverished, circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">On September 25, 1970, plaintiff\u2019s father applied to the New Hampshire Division of Welfare on behalf of plaintiff for medical assistance for the expenses incurred by her for dental work in excess of that covered by insurance. Because plaintiff did not fit within the Division\u2019s conditions of eligibility for medical assistance \u2014 which limit aid to those persons who suffer from a disabling <em>physical </em>impairment \u2014 the application was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"pA5j\">Plaintiff challenges this action on the part of the New Hampshire Division of Welfare on two grounds: first, she contends that New Hampshire\u2019s Welfare Regulations 7555 and 7560.1, specifying conditions of eligibility for the New Hampshire Medical Assistance (Medicaid) Program, are invalid because inconsistent with certain provisions of the Social Security Act and, second, she argues that said regulations unconstitutionally deny her both due process and equal protection of the laws. The defendants are officials employed by the New Hampshire Department of Welfare.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The defendants have urged that plaintiff\u2019s complaint presents an apt case for abstention, citing the line of cases beginning with Railroad Comm\u2019n v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941). We have seriously considered this issue. Were the New Hampshire statute phrased solely in terms of making medical assistance available to those who are \u201cpermanently and totally\u201d disabled, recourse to the state courts for interpretation might well be indicated. A federal constitutional issue might be avoided thereby and state policy declared by the courts best equipped to interpret that policy. But further analysis of the New Hampshire statutory scheme reveals that abstention here would be based solely on the expediency of asking another court to do our work.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">In prescribing conditions of eligibility for New Hampshire\u2019s Medical Assistance Program, the director and the commissioner of the New Hampshire Division of Welfare are guided by New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated [hereinafter referred to as \u201cRSA\u201d] Chapters 167:6, 161:2 and 167:5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> RSA Chapter 167:6 provides in relevant part that medical assistance shall be made available to anyone \u201cwho is a recipient of categorical assistance or a medically needy person as defined by the director of welfare * * <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To receive categorical assistance, an applicant must be both \u201cpermanently and totally disabled\u201d and must meet certain need criteria set by the director and the commissioner. Neither \u201cpermanently and totally disa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>bled\u201d, as used in the categorical assistance portion of the New Hampshire enabling statute, nor \u201cmedically needy\u201d, as used in the medical assistance portion, are statutorily defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">It has been conceded that plaintiff in the instant case does not qualify for categorical assistance because she does not meet the relevant need criteria. The only question remaining under New Hampshire law, then, is whether she is a \u201cmedically needy\u201d person. For purposes of this inquiry, whatever limitations are implicit in the phrase \u201cpermanently and totally disabled\u201d, as used to determine eligibility for categorical assistance, are irrelevant. There is simply no indication on the face of the New Hampshire enabling statute that would allow a state court to rule that \u201cmedically needy\u201d and \u201cpermanently and totally disabled\u201d were meant by the New Hampshire legislature to be mere shorthand references for each other. Indeed, the consistent separate use of the two phrases in referring to the categorical and medical assistance programs indicates, if anything, that the two were not intended to be equivalents.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">This is not to say, however, that the director and the commissioner have been given unbridled discretion in defining \u201cmedically needy\u201d. The New Hampshire enabling statute contains limitations of two sorts: first, a procedural limitation that flows from the command that regulations . proposed by the director be approved by the commissioner before they are promulgated and, second, substantive limitations indicated by the order in RSA 161:2, subd. VIII that the director \u201c[c]o-operate with the federal government in carrying out the purposes of the Federal Social Security Act * * and, more importantly, in RSA 167:5 that he shall meet \u201cother requirements\u201d as are \u201cnecessary to qualify for grants-in-aid from the federal government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">There is no allegation in the instant case that the director and the commissioner have failed to follow the statutorily prescribed procedures in promulgating the eligibility limitations in question. If we were to abstain, then, the state court inquiry would necessarily focus on whatever substantive limitations on the definition of \u201cmedically needy\u201d are inherent in the requirements that the director \u201cco-operate\u201d with the federal government and that he must do everything necessary to ensure that the New Hampshire program \u201cqualifies\u201d for federal assistance. A state court faced with this task of statutory construction could adopt one of two approaches. Since the New Hampshire medical assistance program \u201cqualifies\u201d at the present time for federal assistance because of the approval by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) of New Hampshire\u2019s definition of \u201cmedically needy\u201d, the state court may well regard its review foreclosed beyond this point. It might wish to avoid putting itself in the awkward position of reviewing and disagreeing with the federal agency, HEW, which has formally approved New Hampshire\u2019s plan. In this event, abstention would have been a futile gesture. Alternatively, the state court could go further and attempt to determine whether the New Hampshire definition of \u201cmedically needy\u201d comports with the \u201cpurposes of the Federal Social Security Act\u201d and whether medical assistance is so administered as to fulfill all federal requirements. In this event, abstention would have achieved the bizarre result of shifting to a state court the sole task of construing federal statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Unlike the enabling statute involved in the present case, the Texas statute at issue in Railroad Comm\u2019n v. Pullman, <em>supra, </em>contained a specific substantive standard against which Commission orders could be measured. This standard was in no way limited by or dependent on federal statutory or constitutional guarantees. The Texas statute provided in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">\u201c[p]ower and authority are hereby conferred upon the Railroad Commission of Texas over all railroads, [etc.], and it is hereby made the duty of the said Commission * * * to prevent any and all * * * abuses in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>conduct of their business and to do and perform such other duties and details in connection therewith as may be provided by law.\u201d Vernon\u2019s Anno. Texas Civil Statutes, Article 6445.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anf\">Since it seemed probable to the Court that the actions complained of in <em>Pullman </em>(requiring a conductor \u2014 always white \u2014 to be in attendance on every Pullman) would be found by a state court to be unauthorized under the applicable state statutory standard, abstention seemed justified as a way to \u201cavoid the waste of a tentative decision as well as the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500, 61 S.Ct. at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The New Hampshire enabling statute at issue here contains no standard whatsoever for determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion by state welfare administrators in defining \u201cmedically needy\u201d apart from the federal standards. Therefore, neither <em>Pullman </em>nor other cases which say that abstention is proper where the challenged state statute or regulation is \u201cfairly open to interpretation\u201d are relevant. <em>See, e. g., </em>Harrison v. N.A.A.C.P., 360 U.S. 167, 79 S.Ct. 1025, 3 L.Ed.2d 1152 (1959). The only thing fairly open to interpretation here is how far afield the New Hampshire welfare officials may range in defining \u201cmedically needy\u201d before running up against federal statutory and constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The question in the instant case, therefore, is whether a federal court is justified in abstaining if the dispositive issue is one of federal law and there is no alternative state standard on which the decision can be based. The answer to the question thus posed is clearly \u201cno\u201d. Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 248, 88 S.Ct. 391, 19 L.Ed.2d 444 (1967); Harmon v. Forssenius, 380 U.S. 528, 535, 85 S.Ct. 1177, 14 L.Ed.2d 50 (1965); McNeese v. Board of Education, 373 U.S. 668, 673-674, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 10 L.Ed.2d 622 (1963); and cases cited in 1 Barron &amp; Holtzoff \u00a7 64 n. 59 (Wright ed. 1971).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">The structure of federal-state participation in providing medical assistance payments to needy individuals was significantly changed in 1965 with the addition of Title XIX (the so-called \u201cMedicaid\u201d program) to the Social Security Act of 1935.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Prior to that time, federal monies were available to defray the costs of state medical assistance programs only insofar as the state programs were limited to helping persons who already qualified for maintenance benefits under one of the categorical assistance portions of the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because of the episodic, though often severe, nature of many medical expenses, however, the federal experience with administering medical assistance as an adjunct to other federal assistance programs did not prove to be entirely satisfactory. Many persons who did not qualify for maintenance payments because their income and resources were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>sufficient to meet their ordinary living expenses were nevertheless left in extreme hardship when forced to shoulder extraordinary medical expenses without public assistance. Title XIX was enacted to fill this gap. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 (effective January 1, 1966); 1965 United States Code Congressional and Administrative News at p. 1943 <em>et </em>seq.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Since the intent of Congress in enacting Title XIX was to extend rather than to cut back on the availability of medical assistance to needy persons, the federal statute requires at a minimum that states receiving matching federal grants under Title XIX make medical assistance available to any individual receiving aid under one of the approved categorical assistance programs and that such assistance be in amount, duration and scope at least as great as such persons could have received under such program. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a) (10) (A). States are given the option of also granting medical assistance benefits to a broad range of additional persons who lack the resources to pay for needed medical services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a) (10) (B). The federal regulations promulgated under Title XIX refer to the required recipients of medical assistance as \u201ccategorically needy\u201d persons, and to the optional group as \u201cmedically needy\u201d. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 248.10(a) (l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The New Hampshire legislature has chosen to participate in both the mandatory and optional aspects of Title XIX. RSA Chapter 167:6 gives effect to this decision by providing that \u201c[f]or the purposes hereof a person shall be eligible for medical assistance who is a recipient of categorical assistance or a medically needy person as defined by the director of welfare * * In defining \u201cmedically needy\u201d, the director, with the approval of the commissioner and HEW, has promulgated rules which require a showing both of \u201cpermanent and total disability\u201d and of insufficient resources to meet the costs of medical care. New Hampshire Department of Health and Welfare, Medical Assistance Manual \u00a7 7550.10 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cManual\u201d). A person who is \u201cpermanently and totally disabled\u201d is defined for these purposes as someone \u201cwho has some permanent <em>physical </em>impairment that \u2018substantially precludes\u2019 him from engaging in useful occupations * * Manual \u00a7\u00a7 7555, 7560.1. Plaintiff contends that this attempt to limit the class of persons qualifying for medical assistance as \u201cmedically needy\u201d to those with a physical impairment is invalid because inconsistent with certain provisions of the federal statute and the regulations issued thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">In assessing this claim, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a, setting out certain requirements for all states wishing to participate in the federal medical assistance program, is a useful starting point. Section 1396a(a) (10) (B) (i) provides that if a state accepts the federal invitation to provide medical assistance to persons (the so-called \u201cmedically needy\u201d) in addition to those who are already receiving categorical assistance under another state plan, it must make such assistance available \u201cto all individuals who would, if needy, be eligible for aid or assistance under any such State plan * * *.\u201d The regulations adopted by HEW restate this section of the federal statute to require states which include the \u201cmedically needy\u201d in their medical assistance programs to extend aid uniformly to all \u201cneedy groups that correspond to the covered categorically needy groups.\u201d C.F.R. \u00a7 248.10(b) (3).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>The defendants apparently recognize this connection between Title XIX, providing for medical assistance, and Title XIV, providing for \u201caid to the permanently and totally disabled\u201d, and are therefore willing to concede plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to medical assistance <em>if </em>she is found to be a required recipient of categorical assistance under Title XIV with the exception of the applicable need requirements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Manual \u00a7 6010.2. Although Congress did not specifically define \u201cpermanently and totally disabled\u201d in connection with either of the two categorical assistance programs to which such definition would be relevant (Titles XIV and XVI), the definition adopted by HEW is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">\u201c(a) <em>State plan requirements. A </em>State plan under title XIV or XVI of the Social Security Act <em>must:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">(1) Contain a definition of permanently and totally disabled, showing that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">(i) \u2018Permanently\u2019 is related to the duration of the impairment or combination of impairments; and (ii) \u2018Totally\u2019 is related to the degree of disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">The following definition is <em>recommended:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-14\">\u2018Permanently and totally disabled\u2019 means that the individual has - some permanent physical or mental impairment, disease, or loss, or combination thereof, that substantially precludes him from engaging in useful occupations within his competence, such as holding a job.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.] 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.80(a) (1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">Instead of attempting to find justification for its \u201csource\u201d limitations \u2014 that is, limitations of eligibility which derive from a distinction between sources or types of disability \u2014 within the terms of this definition, the defendants attempt an end-run around the entire definition by arguing that it is \u201cmerely recommended\u201d rather than mandatory.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While we can agree with the defendants that the states are given some latitude in promulgating a definition of \u201cpermanently and totally disabled\u201d that establishes with clarity which groups are in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>eluded and which are excluded under the assistance plans to which such definition is relevant, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 248.10(c) (2), and that the actual text of the HEW definition is \u201cmerely recommended\u201d, we can not agree with the contention that the elements of an acceptable definition under Titles XIV, XVI and XIX are similarly left to the states\u2019 discretion. The applicable HEW regulation clearly states that an acceptable state plan under Titles XIV, XVI and XIX <em>must </em>contain a definition of \u201cpermanently and totally disabled\u201d showing that \u201cpermanently\u201d relates to the duration of the impairment or combination of impairments and that \u201ctotally\u201d relates to the degree of the disability. Nowhere in the federal statute, in the applicable regulations, or in the legislative history is there any indication that participating states may specify elements of permanent and total disability that do not relate either to the duration or the degree of the impairment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, even in the absence of any regulations in point, the plain meaning of \u201cpermanently and totally\u201d as used in the statute to refer to the intended beneficiaries of federally-subsidized assistance negates the permissibility of source limitations such as those employed by New Hampshire. <em>See </em>King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 330, 88 S. Ct. 2128, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1968); Stoddard v. Fisher, 330 F.Supp. 566 (July 20, 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Since 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.80(a) (1) (i)-(ii), consistently with our interpretation of the plain meaning of the federal statute, is phrased in obligatory rather than in permissive terms, and since the defendants do not contend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s impairment though mental rather than physical is not as \u201ctotal\u201d and \u201cpermanent\u201d as are the impairments of other persons to whom it extends categorical assistance under Titles XIV, XVI and XIX,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we hold that plaintiff is entitled to receive medical care as a \u201cmedically needy\u201d person under Title XIX of the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because our holding is based on statutory grounds, we do not reach plaintiff\u2019s constitutional arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Judgment will be entered for the plaintiff declaring that sections 7555 and 7560.1 of the regulations of the State of New Hampshire, Department of Health and Welfare, found in the New Hampshire Medical Assistance Manual, are inconsistent with Title XIX of the Social Security Act and the HEW regulations adopted thereunder, and are consequently void and unenforceable.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-8\">. Plaintiff lias waived all of her claims against the State of New Hampshire as well as her claim for damages against the individual defendants in both their personal and representative capacities. Defendants have agreed in their representative capacities to reimburse plaintiff for the amount spent by her for dental work ($342.00) in the event this court determines that such benefits have been illegally withheld.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b477-9\">. To qualify for the matching federal grants for medical assistance which are available to the states under Title XIX of the Social Security Act of 1935, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396g, each state legislature is required to enact an enabling statute, a so-called \u201cstate plan\u201d, which meets certain federal requirements. New Hampshire has voluntarily chosen to participate in Title XIX and has enacted a state plan which vests initial authority to promulgate rules and regulations in the director of its Division of Welfare. Once the director has proposed a rule or regulation, it must then be forwarded to the state welfare commissioner before it can be promulgated.

After 1962 federally-subsidized medical assistance was also made available to a new category of aged, blind and disabled persons, the so-called \u201cmedically indigent\u201d, whose incomes were above state eligibility levels for categorical assistance but were not high enough to meet their medical bills. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et seq.

For example, persons who are needy and 18 years of age or older and permanently and totally disabled under the Federal definition of permanent and total disability, but who are excluded under tlie State\u2019s more restricted definition of disability; or persons who would be eligible for AFDC if the State\u2019s program covered families with children deprived of parental support or care to the full extent permitted under title IV-A of the Act, including AFDC for families with unemployed fathers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">This exceptionally labyrinthine regulation must, of course, be read in the light of both the federal statute and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.80(a) (1), which requires a state disability definition to be linked to duration and degree. So read, its reference to \u201cmore stringent\u201d eligibility conditions relates to permissible marginal variations in definitions of \u201ctotal\u201d or \u201cpermanent\u201d and to statutorily permitted exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">For example, the recommended federal definition provides that a person\u2019s \u201cability to keep house or to care for others would be the appropriate test for (and only for) individuals, such as housewives, who were engaged in this occupation prior to the disability and do not have a history of gainful employment. * * * \u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 248.80(a) (1). <em>See also </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.80(a) (1). We interpret this statement as a recommendation only and would regard as consistent with the federal statute and the regulations a state definition of \u201cpermanently and totally disabled\u201d which defined \u201ctotally\u201d so as to exclude any person with the capacity to perform household chores regardless of whether such person became disabled before any sort of gainful employment became possible (e. g., an impairment present since birth) or whether the person was at one time engaged in a gainful occupation but whose present disability makes her unfit to perform other than household chores.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">Similarly, state plans under Title XIX may include children of unemployed fathers who would qualify for categorical assistance if the state AFDC plan included families with unemployed fathers. This inclusion is expressly a matter of state option. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 607. The regulation discussed in this footnote gives the state a further option: a state which does not give AFDC benefits to families with unemployed fathers may nevertheless give Title XIX medical assistance to such families.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b483-14\">. In affirming the decision of the New Hampshire Bureau of Medical Service that plaintiff did not qualify for assistance as \u201cpermanently and totally disabled\u201d, the New Hampshire Welfare Appeals Board stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae7\">\u201c[e]veryone recognizes that her need is as great as that of a physically handicapped person, but the State Funds needed to cover all disabled would be enormous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-15\">\u201cThe Board reluctantly agrees that our Aid to Permanently and Totally Disabled program does not cover cases like [plaintiff\u2019s].\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b483-28\">. Since we hold that New Hampshire\u2019s exclusion of persons with totally and permanently disabling mental impairments as beneficiaries of medical assistance is inconsistent with the federal statute and with the regulations promulgated thereunder, we regard the HEW Regional Commissioner\u2019s approval of such exclusion as having no effect.
