On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court (1) improperly held a hearing in damages in view of his operative answer and four special defenses and (2) denied him the right to due process because the court did not adjudicate fully his timely filed answer and four special defenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following procedural history. In April, 2016, the plaintiff served the defendant with a four count complaint alleging breach of contract, anticipatory breach of contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment. The plaintiff alleged in part that she is the owner of property at 100 Stone Ridge Way in Fairfield and that she had leased the premises to the defendant pursuant to a written agreement from August 1, 2012 through July 31, 2016. She also alleged that the defendant was to pay her rent of $3400 per month, but\n   he failed to pay rent for the months of August, 2015 through April, 2016. The plaintiff evicted the defendant from the premises. The plaintiff further alleged that she incurred expenses related to the eviction and will continue to incur expenses as a result of the defendant's default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The complaint was returnable to court on May 24, 2016. Counsel for the defendant filed an appearance on the return day. On June 24, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion for default for failure to plead. On July 5, 2016, the court,\n   <em>\n    Bellis, J.\n   </em>\n   , transferred the case from the Fairfield civil docket to the Bridgeport housing docket. On July 22, 2015, the plaintiff filed a second motion for default for failure to plead claiming that more than thirty days had passed since the complaint was filed and the defendant had not filed a responsive pleading. On August 18, 2016, the defendant filed an answer,\n   <em>\n    twelve\n   </em>\n   special defenses and right of recoupment. On August 22, 2016, the plaintiff filed a request to revise asking the defendant to revise\n   <em>\n    eight\n   </em>\n   of his special defenses and right of recoupment. On September 22, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion for default claiming that thirty days had passed since she filed a request to revise and that the defendant had not responded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 3, 2014, the court,\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted the motion for default for failure to plead. On October 25, 2016, the plaintiff filed a certificate of closed pleadings and claimed the matter for a hearing in damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 17, 2016, the defendant filed a motion to set aside the default.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On that same day, the defendant\n   also filed a request to amend his special defenses, and revised and amended special defenses and recoupment. On November 23, 2016, the\n   plaintiff filed objections to the defendant's request to amend and his motion to open the default. She also filed a motion for a continuance to enable the court to rule on the defendant's pending motion to open the default. Judge Rodriguez granted the plaintiff's request for a continuance on November 28, 2016. On December 29, 2016, the court denied the defendant's motion to open the default and sustained the plaintiff's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 4, 2017, the plaintiff filed a motion for continuance because her counsel was unavailable until February 10, 2017. The court granted the motion for continuance. On January 31, 2017, the defendant filed a motion to strike the matter from the hearing in damages list. In the motion to strike, the defendant represented that he had filed an answer, twelve special defenses, and right of recoupment on August 18, 2016, and that the plaintiff had filed requests to revise eight of his special defenses and right of recoupment. The defendant specifically pointed out that the plaintiff had not filed a request to revise the answer or his first, second, tenth or twelfth special defenses. He argued that the default affected only the eight special defenses and right of recoupment which he did not revise. In support of his motion to strike, the defendant cited\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    St. John\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5544898\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/80/767/\">\n    80 Conn.

Id., at 775,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=837%20A.2d%20841\">\n    837 A.2d 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff filed an objection to the motion to strike on February 2, 2017, and attempted to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co.\n   </em>\n   procedurally because the\n   request to revise in that case was directed to a counterclaim, not special defenses, which are part of an answer. The plaintiff, however, stated that if the court agreed with the defendant's argument pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co.\n   </em>\n   , it should nonetheless find the defendant in default on those portions of his answer that he did not revise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties appeared in court on February 15, 2017. The court heard argument on the defendant's motion to strike the case from the hearing in damages list. The court denied the motion to strike, held a hearing in damages, and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $43,696.30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant appealed and filed a motion for articulation. See Practice Book \u00a7 66-5. The defendant asked the court to articulate the reason it denied his motion to strike the case from the hearing in damages list. The trial court denied the motion for articulation, and the defendant filed a motion for review in this court. See Practice Book \u00a7 66-7. This court granted the motion for review, but denied the relief requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly denied his motion to strike the case from the hearing in damages list because he timely filed an answer and his first, second, tenth, and twelfth special defenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant claims\n   that the court, by denying his motion to strike, deprived him of the opportunity\n   to contest liability that timely was put in issue by virtue of his answer and special defenses. The defendant also argues that Practice Book \u00a7 10-37 (a) contains no provision for granting a default or nonsuit for failure to comply with a request to revise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff counters the defendant's claim on the basis of Practice Book \u00a7 10-6 (5), arguing that special defenses are part of an answer and therefore the defendant was in default on the entire complaint for failing to revise eight of his special defenses and recoupment. She also argues that the defendant's motion to strike merely was a second bite at the apple after the court denied the defendant's motion to set aside the default. In his reply brief, the defendant disagrees that he was seeking a second bite at the apple. He states that the relief he was seeking from his motion to set aside the default was resurrection of eight of his special defenses. The relief he sought in his motion to strike the case from the hearing in damages list was a trial on the merits of the case in view of his answer and four special defenses that the plaintiff did not request that he revise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Our statutes and rules of practice provide penalties for failing to comply with the timely pleading requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 10-8. \" General Statutes \u00a7 52-119 provides that [p]arties failing to plead according to the rules and orders of the court\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be ... defaulted .... Section 10-18 of our rules of practice essentially mirrors that language. We read the plain and unambiguous language of both \u00a7 52-119 and Practice Book \u00a7 10-18 as empowering the court with the discretionary authority to impose a default as a penalty whenever a defendant has failed to comply with our rules regarding\n   pleadings, including the timely advancement of such pleadings. Such authority is in accord with the court's broad, general authority to act to maintain the orderly procedure of the court docket, and to prevent any interference with the fair administration of justice.\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    People's United Bank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bok\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415777\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/143/263/#p268\">\n    143 Conn.

Practice Book \u00a7 10-8, titled \"Time to Plead,\" provides in relevant part: \"Commencing on the return day of the writ, summons and complaint in civil actions, pleadings ... shall advance within thirty days from the return day, and any subsequent pleadings ... shall advance at least one step within each successive period of thirty days from the preceding pleading ....\" The steps referred to in \u00a7 10-8 are set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 10-6, titled \"Pleadings Allowed and Their Order,\" which provides in relevant part: \"The order of pleading shall be as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"(1) The plaintiff's complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"(2) The defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"(3) The defendant's request to revise the complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"(4) The defendant's motion to strike the complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"(5) The defendant's answer (including any special defenses) to the complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"(6) The plaintiff's request to revise the defendant's answer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"(7) The plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"(8) The plaintiff's reply to any special defenses.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiff relies on the language of Practice Book \u00a7 10-6 (5) to support her contention that special defenses are defined as part of an answer. We do not construe \u00a7 10-6 (5) as defining a special defense as part of an answer. Section 10-6 (5) does no more than state that when a defendant responds to a complaint, the answer and special defenses are to be filed at the same time in the order of pleadings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   An answer and a special\n   defense have legally distinct functions as other rules of practice make clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 10-46 titled \"The Answer; General and Special Denial,\" prescribes the manner in which a defendant shall answer the allegations of a complaint and provides in relevant part: \"The defendant in an answer shall specially deny such allegations of the complaint as the defendant intends to controvert, admitting the truth of the other allegations ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 10-50 defines the purpose of a special defense. That section, titled, \"Denials; Special Defenses,\" provides in relevant part: \"No facts may be proved under either a general or special denial except such as show that the plaintiff's statement of facts are untrue. Facts which are consistent with such statements but show, notwithstanding, that the plaintiff has no cause of action, must be specially alleged.\" Practice Book \u00a7 10-50. \"Where\n   several matters of defense are pleaded, each must refer to the cause of action which it is intended to answer, and be separately stated and designated as a separate defense .... Where the complaint or counterclaim is for more than one cause of action, set forth in several counts, each separate matter of defense should be preceded by a designation of the cause of action which it is designed to meet ....\" Practice Book \u00a7 10-51. Section 10-50 highlights the interrelationship between a cause of action and a special defense. In that regard, it is important to point out that a plaintiff bears the burden of proof on his or her complaint; see\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Meriden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2219072\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/72/766/#p772\">\n    72 Conn.

We do not agree. Although this court agreed that the trial court in\n   <em>\n    Connecticut National Bank\n   </em>\n   properly nonsuited the defendant on his special defenses and counterclaim, it did not conclude that the defendant was in in default on his answer. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Connecticut National Bank\n   </em>\n   filed a motion to strike the case from the trial list, which the trial court denied and this court affirmed. The important distinction between\n   <em>\n    Connecticut National Bank\n   </em>\n   and the present case is that in\n   <em>\n    Connecticut National Bank\n   </em>\n   the defendant had filed a timely answer, but was nonsuited for failure to revise his special defenses and counterclaim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=701%20A.2d%20328\">\n    Id., at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=696%20A.2d%20374\">\n    696 A.2d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the defendant was not defaulted, the case was claimed to the\n   <em>\n    trial list,\n   </em>\n   not the hearing in damages list. In the present case, the defendant, despite having filed a timely answer and four special defenses, was defaulted and his liability was conclusively determined. See\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    St. John\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5544898\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/80/767/\">\n    80 Conn.

The case was placed on the hearing in damages list where only the amount of money the defendant allegedly owed the plaintiff was to be decided. In fact, a close reading\n   of\n   <em>\n    Connecticut National Bank\n   </em>\n   demonstrates support for the defendant's position that the court improperly denied his motion to strike the case from the hearing in damages list and thus denied him the opportunity to contest liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Regardless of whether special defenses are an intricate part of an answer, this case turns not on the technical definitions of an answer but on what the sound principles of procedure require. At various times in the trial court and on appeal, each of the parties suggested an alternative to the defendant's default, i.e., that the defendant should not be permitted to rely on the special defenses that he did not revise, but that the case proceed to trial on his answer and four remaining special defenses. There is legal precedent for such a solution.

The mere statement of this proposition is enough to suggest that the action of the trial court was wrong. It is axiomatic in modern pleading that, because a plaintiff cannot substantiate a separable part of the claim in his complaint, he is not to be barred of recovery as regards that portion of it he can establish. Where the\n   failure to file a bill of particulars as ordered goes to the entire cause of action, a judgment of nonsuit may be proper. ... Even when the failure to file the bill goes only to a part of the cause of action, it may be that the circumstances would justify such an order. ... In the situation before us, the proper remedy of the defendant was not a motion for a nonsuit but one to expunge from the complaint the general allegations as to which specific statements as ordered by the court were not filed, or objection at the trial to any evidence offered in support of those allegations.\" (Citations omitted.)
