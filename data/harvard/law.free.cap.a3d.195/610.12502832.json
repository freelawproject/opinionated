Following a careful review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The learned trial court summarized the relevant facts and procedural history according to the Commonwealth as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 2, 2011, at 7:39 p.m., Mr. Todd Bachman placed a 9-1-1 call to Monroe County Control Center reporting the discovery of the body of Kristin Wagner (\"Victim\"), hanging from an electrical heating wire tied to a refrigeration unit that was located in a trailer at 860 Crowe Road, Stroud Township. The trailer was located in a scrap yard operated by Christian Containers, LLC, a company owned by [Appellee]. Within minutes of the 9-1-1 call, members of the Stroud Area Regional Police Department and emergency medical service personnel arrived and observed the scene and body.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The Victim's body presented with signs of\n   <em>\n    livor mortis\n   </em>\n   , a condition indicative that death had occurred several hours prior to its discovery. The condition had not yet set, thus narrowing the time of death to not more than a few hours prior to discovery. The position of the Victim's body was such that the Victim's feet were resting on the floor with her knees bent and her hands free at her side. Heating wire was looped around the Victim's neck, but was not fashioned into a noose or otherwise twisted around her neck. The ligature had caused a well-defined furrow around the frontal and upper areas of the Victim's neck. The ligature did not appear to cause any abrasions or otherwise indicate that a struggle or involuntary movements had occurred prior to death. The Victim's face was not swollen or discolored, as is commonly seen in victims of hanging or ligature strangulation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Alongside the body was a metallic box upon which, in the dust, prints from a work boot were identified. The pattern of the work boot prints were not made by the footwear of the Victim. There was also a coating of white substance, which was later identified as paint, visible on the Victim's right shoulder and both arms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A cursory autopsy revealed there was no evidence of injury to the internal structures of the Victim's neck, no petechial hemorrhaging, and no discoloration of the face above the ligature. While the responding paramedics viewed the death as suspicious, the original investigators and the coroner concluded that the Victim committed suicide by hanging.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 5, 2014, Richard Gerber contacted the authorities and advised them that [Appellee] admitted to him that he had killed the Victim in the office trailer of the Crowe Street container yard by \"choking her out\" and thereafter hung her body in a refrigerated trailer to make it appear as though she had committed suicide. Based on Mr. Gerber's information, police initiated an investigation into the Victim's death. The investigation revealed that [Appellee] was never sought for questioning by the original investigators despite his owning the business where the Victim's body was discovered, engaging in an extra-marital affair with the Victim, and being the last person to see the Victim alive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [Appellee] and the Victim were engaged in a sexual relationship beginning in May 2010. The relationship included [Appellee] supplying the Victim with quantities of methamphetamine and Percocet pills. During the fall of 2010, the Victim provided members of the Pocono Mountain Regional Police Department and Pennsylvania State Police with information about [Appellee] trafficking in large quantities of methamphetamine. Soon thereafter, acting in part upon the information supplied by the Victim, [Appellee] was subject to a traffic stop in\n   which a quantity of methamphetamine was located. [Appellee] suspected that the Victim informed the police about his drug trafficking and expressed his suspicion to his wife, Jennifer Bidwell. Less than a week after the Victim's death, [Appellee] was arrested for drug trafficking, based in part on the information previously supplied by the Victim.\n   <sup>\n    1\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 2, 2011, the day of the Victim's death, Veronica Murray, owner of the Cinder Inn, a bar located on Crowe Road, saw the Victim and [Appellee] at the bar from approximately 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. The Victim and [Appellee] consumed alcohol and acted in a sexual manner toward one another. During this time, the Victim placed a phone call to her father, Donald Wagner, Sr. Cellular telephone records show that the phone call began at 3:55 p.m., lasted 20 minutes, and ended at approximately 4:15 p.m. [Appellee's] cellular telephone records show that he remained in the immediate vicinity of Crowe Road until approximately 5:09 p.m. on the day of the Victim's death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   At approximately 5:20 p.m. [Appellee] telephoned Jennifer Bidwell. The call lasted for approximately 9 minutes. During the call, [Appellee] was crying and said things such as \"she's hanging\" \"she killed herself\" and she \"died.\" [Appellee] clarified that he was referring to the Victim. [Appellee] then called Donald Wagner at 7:28 p.m. This call lasted approximately 10 minutes, during which [Appellee] informed Mr. Wagner that the Victim was dead. The Victim's body was discovered by Mr. Bachman at 7:39 p.m., who called 9-1-1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   After discovering the Victim's body and calling 9-1-1, Mr. Bachman called his immediate supervisor, James Smith, to report the death and Mr. Smith called [Appellee] at 7:41 p.m. After being told by Mr. Smith that the Victim's body had been discovered at his Crowe Road container yard, [Appellee] claimed to be in Philadelphia and unable to return to the scene.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [Appellee] has made several contradictory statements regarding the circumstances of the Victim's death and his whereabouts at that time. [Appellee] claimed to employees and associates that he was in Philadelphia at the time of the death; that he left the Victim for a period of time and returned to find her dead; that the Victim left a suicide note; and implied that the Victim's 3:55 p.m. conversation with her father motivated her to commit suicide. Additionally, [Appellee] relayed to Jennifer Bidwell that the Victim needed money, so he agreed to allow her to paint his office trailer. [Appellee] stated to Mrs. Bidwell that while the Victim was painting the trailer he told the Victim he was reconciling with his wife and could not be there for her anymore but that God would be there. [Appellee] relayed that the Victim stated \"f*** God\" and had an evil look in her eye and that this was the last time he saw the Victim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Victim's family and friends maintain that she would not have committed suicide. The Victim's calendar for May and June 2011 contained multiple entries for events involving her children and other planned events. The Victim did not display any signs of depression at the time. On June 2, 2011, Ms. Murray, owner of the Cinder Inn, observed the Victim as appearing happy and outgoing, speaking of her children, and sharing photographs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 26, 2016, the Seventh Monroe County Investigating Grand Jury issued a Presentment at Investigation No. 6-2014 that recommended [Appellee] be arrested for violating Section 2501 of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code and additional\n   sections of the Crimes Code. By Order date July 28, 2016, this [c]ourt, as Supervising Judge of the Investigating Grand Jury, accepted the Presentment and referred the matter to the Attorney for the Commonwealth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Appellee] was charged by Criminal Information on November 14, 2016, with Criminal Homicide.\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n   On November 15, 2016, the Commonwealth filed a Motion for Status Conference. On November 17, 2016, we scheduled a status conference with Counsel. On November 21, 2016, the Commonwealth filed a Motion to Continue Scheduling Conference, which was granted. The status conference was rescheduled to November 29, 2016. At the status conference both parties were directed to file all pretrial motions on or before July 21, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The Commonwealth filed the present Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   on July 12, 2017. [Appellee] filed an Answer to the Commonwealth's Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   on August 15, 2017, and a Supplemental Memorandum of Law on October 10, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A hearing on the Commonwealth's motions was held on September 15, 2017, wherein the Commonwealth introduced a compact disc containing the following evidence:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1.

Following a review of the evidence submitted at the hearing, the record, the parties' briefs, and the oral arguments of counsel, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the Commonwealth's Motion.

Does the denial of the Commonwealth's Motion in Limine constitute reversible error, where, the lower court's reasoning rests upon basic mistake, including a misunderstanding of the nature of the wounds observed on the victim's body at autopsy; where that mistake was the basis of the lower court's conclusion that the circumstances of [Appellee's] other acts of violence toward women are not sufficiently similar or logically connected to the victim for proof of motive, intent, method, and to rebut the defense of suicide?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   2. Did the lower court err by ruling that evidence of [Appellee's] drug use and its effect on him is barred as irrelevant where: a) the record shows that [Appellee] and victim frequently ingested drugs together; (b) appeared under the influence of drugs and alcohol on the day of the murder; (c) [Appellee] was under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol during his prior assaults on the victim and other women, and; (d) [Appellee] would become paranoid while under the influence of drugs and alcohol; all as relevant to show possible motive and intent for the murder and give context into the relationship between [Appellant] and victim, as part of the chain or sequence of events that form the history of the case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Commonwealth's Brief at 4. In considering these claims, we are mindful of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Thus, we must not forget that the rule being applied is that other-acts evidence is by default inadmissible\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   a Rule 404(b)(2) category or similar justification applies,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the probative value of that evidence outweighs its\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   for prejudice. The burden is on the party seeking admission to demonstrate the applicability of the exception to the general rule; in this case, that burden fell on the Commonwealth. There is no presumption of admissibility of other-acts evidence merely because it is somewhat relevant for a non-propensity purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    [\n    <em>\n     Com. v.

Her proposed testimony\n   <sup>\n    9\n   </sup>\n   references an abusive relationship from the time they were teenagers continuing until after their divorce, when [Appellee] would force her to have sex with him in exchange for child support. Denise Bidwell's testimony specifically chronicled one incident where she alleges [Appellee] grabbed her by the throat and pushed her against a wall in their home. Her head hit the wall knocking a picture to the floor. Due to [Appellee] chocking [sic] her, Denise Bidwell stated \"I would have been dead, 'cause I saw it and I was fading out and I saw it in his eyes, he wanted me dead. He was drunk....\" [Appellee] only stopped chocking [sic] her when their children came out of their rooms. Denise Bidwell left the home with their children as [Appellee] attempted to apologize for his actions.

The memo details how Ms. Sickle responded to an ad on Craig's List for a receptionist job at [Appellee's] business. Ms. Sickle states she arrived for an interview with [Appellee] and was lead into his office. At some point during the interview, Adam Campbell walked into the office and he and [Appellee] did a line of Meth on the desk. Mr. Campbell then left the office. [Appellee] then moved around the desk next to Ms. Sickle and grabbed her by the arm explaining how he gets prostitutes from Craig's List and brings them back to his office for sex. Ms. Sickle reports that she kept telling [Appellee] \"no,\" but he kept trying to pin her to the couch. At one point [Appellee] hit her in the temple which caused her to go \"loopy.\" Ms. Sickle stated [Appellee] was trying to rape her and he tore her cloths [sic] and began chocking [sic] her first using one hand, then using both hands. Ms. Sickle kept fighting with [Appellee] as he was trying to turn her around and was able to get away. She ran into the junk yard where she saw her car blocked in. Ms. Sickle also saw Mr. Campbell, who took her to his residence where they spent two days and two nights together. Ms. Sickle then returned to [Appellee's] property in order to get her car, but it was locked behind the gate. She called Stroud Area Regional Police in an attempt to get the car back. A police report was submitted by the Commonwealth verifying a call concerning ownership of the car. Com. Ex. 1, Transcript of Sickle, pp. 1-2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, the Commonwealth submitted a transcript of Alyssa Benek's Grand Jury testimony as an Offer of Proof of her alleged abuse. Ms. Benek was originally in a consensual sexual relationship with [Appellee]. A point repeatedly clarified by Detective Serfass who initially asked if Benek's sexual relationship with Defendant was mutual, to which she replied \"Yep.\" Com.

The questioning went on:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Detective Serfass: You - you were willing -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Ms. Benek: Yep.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Detective Serfass: -- like you would willingly have -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Ms. Benek: Yep.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Detective Serfass: -- Intercourse with him -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Ms. Benek: Yep.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Detective Serfass: -- or have -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Ms. Benek: Yep.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Detective Serfass: -- relationship with him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Ms. Benek: Yep.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 35-36.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Ms. Benek would go on to explain her relationship with [Appellee] became nonconsensual after she heard a rumor that he attempted to shoot someone. However it does not appear from the transcript that Ms. Benek ever expressed her desire to change the parameters of her\n   relationship with [Appellee]. Rather, she states she just continued to comply and have sex with [Appellee] because she felt it was inevitable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 50. Detective Serfass then asks: \"When-when he would sexually assault you, was there ever any - was he physically violent? How - how did he act towards you? Ms. Benek responds: \"No, it - and it almost became that I was just like, there's no way, you know what I mean?\" Detective Serfass then asked if [Appellee] ever choked her to which Ms. Benek replied no. Detective Serfass then asks if [Appellee] ever threatened to kill her to which Ms. Benek says \"Yeah and my whole family.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Comparing the proposed testimonies of Alyssa Benek, Danielle Sickle, Denise Bidwell, and Jennifer Bidwell they have basic commonalities but also stark differences.

However, in comparing the said proffered testimonies within the context of the factors outlined in\n   <em>\n    Weakley\n   </em>\n   , the proposed testimony is inadmissible. These Weakley factors, which this [c]ourt must consider when comparing the facts and circumstances of the crimes or acts, include: (1) the manner in which the crimes were committed; (2) weapons used; (3) ostensible purpose of the crime; (4) location; and (5) type of victims.\n   <em>\n    Weakley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7298844\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/972/1182/#p1189\">\n    972 A.2d at 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ex. 1. The fourth incident involved repeated nonviolent sexual abuse. This stands in glaring contrast to the Commonwealth's theories in the present case. As described above our reading of the Commonwealth's argument is that the Commonwealth has alleged two theories for why [Appellee] might have murdered the Victim, both of which involve premeditation rather than a sudden violent outburst: (1) retaliation for the Victim providing incriminating evidence concerning [Appellee's] alleged drug trafficking to the police and/or (2) because she was his mistress and he was attempting to reconcile with his wife.

The theory passes muster if the inferential path between the item of evidence and a fact of consequence in the case does not require any inferences as to the defendant's personal, subjective character. [T]he proponent does not offer the evidence of the uncharged misconduct to establish an intermediate inference as to the defendant's personal, subjective bad character.

As the trial court found, while there were some similarities between the prior bad acts testimony the Commonwealth seeks to present at trial and Appellee's behavior toward the Victim, the proffered testimony does not establish a motive for the murder of the Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Commonwealth's evidence failed to show that each woman was assaulted in the same manner or had been involved in a sexual relationship with Appellee or that Appellee was under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the encounters with the women. To the contrary, the women's testimony establishes, at most, the commission of crimes or conduct in the past \"of the same general class,\" namely physical and/or sexual assaults. Their testimony does not evidence any particular distinctive pattern of behavior by Appellee in that Appellee's allegedly abusive behavior appears to have been triggered in each incident by different causes. For instance, it is alleged that Appellant assaulted his wives during the course of their marriages, but he spontaneously attacked Ms. Sickle whom he had just met while she interviewed for a job. Ms. Benek indicated Appellee did not physically accost her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In addition, the trial court found that the prior bad acts testimony was not admissible to prove a \"common scheme, plan or design.\" Under Pennsylvania law, evidence of prior bad acts is admissible to prove \"a common scheme, plan or design where the crimes are so related that proof of one tends to prove the others.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Instead, the prior bad acts testimony demonstrates that Appellee was a domestic abuser of women, some of whom he was involved in on-going romantic relationships in the past, but it does not show a unique \"signature\"\n   <em>\n    modus operandi\n   </em>\n   relevant to the Victim's murder.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ross\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7309306\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/57/85/#p100\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7309306\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/57/85/#p100\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7309306\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/57/85/#p100\">\n    at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ross\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court emphasized,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   The purpose of Rule 404(b)(1) is to prohibit the admission of evidence of prior bad acts to prove \"the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\" Pa.R.E. 404(b)(1). While Rule 404(b)(1) gives way to recognized exceptions, the exceptions cannot be stretched in ways that effectively eradicate the rule. With a modicum of effort, in most cases it is possible to note some similarities between the accused's prior bad conduct and that alleged in a current case. To preserve the purpose of Rule 404(b)(1), more must be required to establish an exception to the rule-namely a close factual nexus sufficient to demonstrate the connective relevance of the prior bad acts to the crime in question. No such close factual nexus exists in this case, and this Court has warned that prior bad acts may not be admitted for the purpose of inviting the jury to conclude that the defendant is a person \"of unsavory character\" and thus inclined to have committed the crimes with which he/she is charged.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Commonwealth v.

Based upon our review of the record, we must conclude that the testimony of Berardinelli, Maloney, and Levine was used to establish that Ross was an abusive man who in the past was physically and sexually abusive to his romantic partners so that the improper inference could be drawn that he was capable of, and had the propensity for, committing the types of grotesque acts of physical and sexual abuse inflicted upon Miller resulting in her death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Commonwealth's Brief at 31, 37. Because we find no error in the trial court's determination that prior bad acts evidence in the form of proposed testimony of the four women was insufficient to establish a common plan or scheme under Pa.R.E. 404(b), we cannot find the court abused its discretion in denying the Commonwealth's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The Commonwealth next challenges the trial court's refusal to permit evidence of\n   Appellee's habitual drug use. The Commonwealth maintains the evidence of Appellee's drug use and its effect upon him along with his use of alcohol was relevant to show his \"state of mind, intent, lifestyle with the victim, and to reconstruct the murder and its aftermath.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Motion\n   <em>\n    In Limine\n   </em>\n   , filed 7/12/17, at 14; Commonwealth's Brief at 41-42. The Commonwealth asserts the fact that Appellee's relationship with the Victim was \"centered around drugs is part of the natural development and history of the case\" as is the fact that he provided the Victim and other women drugs at times prior to the murder.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . at 41-42, 44. The Commonwealth further baldly states the fact that Appellee and the Victim were together in a bar in the hours prior to the murder and drugs were found in the Victim's system at the autopsy serves as evidence \"connecting [Appellee] to drug and alcohol abuse\" and \"allows for the inference, the probative value (however slight) that [Appellee] too had taken drugs and alcohol.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . at 44-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The trial court found evidence of Appellee's use of alcohol and drugs in general to be irrelevant and inadmissible, but, importantly, \"reserve[d] further decision on this issue to the time of trial.\" In doing so, the trial court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   The Commonwealth alleges that [Appellee] was a frequent user of methamphetamine and that his use of same would result in his \"stay[ing] awake for hours or days on end and [craving] sexual gratification to the point where he identifies himself .. as a sex addict.\" Com.'s Mot., \u00b6 19. Beyond [Appellee's] use of the same drug as the Victim and his trafficking in same, the Commonwealth has proffered little to show the relevance of [Appellee's] use of this illegal substance in the alleged murder of the Victim. Indeed, the Commonwealth seems to treat [Appellee's] alleged involvement in drug trafficking as interchangeable with his substance abuse. Com.'s Memo, pp. 14-15. We, however, view each separately and find, based on the Commonwealth's proffer and for the reasons stated below, that evidence of [Appellee's] drug use is irrelevant and, thus, inadmissible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   The charge at issue here is Criminal Homicide. Our reading of the Commonwealth's offer of proof presently before the [c]ourt is that the Commonwealth has alleged two theories for why [Appellee] might have murdered the Victim: (1) retaliation for the Victim providing incriminating evidence concerning [Appellee's] alleged drug trafficking to the police and/or (2) because she was his mistress. Com.'s Mot., \u00b6\u00b6 11, 17-18. Only one of those theories has to do with drugs, and even that theory has no bearing on [Appellee's] own drug use. While we recognize that \"[e]vidence to prove motive is generally admissible,\" we fail to see how the Commonwealth intends to connect [Appellee's] drug use with either of its proffered motives for the Victim's murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Philistin\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4209206\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/617/358/\">\n    617 Pa. 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ],\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310849,4209206\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/53/1/\">\n    53 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16-17 (Pa. 2012).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   For example, the Commonwealth has failed to present evidence that would show how [Appellee's] drug use played a role in his alleged motive to kill the Victim because of her incriminating statements to police. Indeed, the evidence presented by the Commonwealth tends to show that [Appellee] was angry because the Victim spoke to the police about his alleged drug\n   <em>\n    trafficking\n   </em>\n   , not his drug\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Com.'s Ex. 1, Recorded Statement of Jennifer Bidwell, p. 5-6. Drug trafficking does not necessarily involve drug use by the trafficker. Furthermore, the Commonwealth has not alleged, nor does the evidence before us\n   reflect, that [Appellee] killed the Victim in a rage induced by methamphetamine or lack of sleep. Indeed, there is no evidence before us that [Appellee] was using any illegal substance on the day of the Victim's death. Similarly, the Commonwealth has not posited a theory of sexual violence by [Appellee] toward the Victim on the day of her death, as might be expected from a man who uses methamphetamine and then \"crave[s] sexual gratification to the point where he identifies himself .. as a sex addict.\" Com.'s Mot., \u00b6 19.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   Based upon the Commonwealth's offer of proof and the evidence currently before the [c]ourt, we can find no relevance in the evidence regarding [Appellee's] drug use. Accordingly, at this time, we find this evidence to be irrelevant and inadmissible and the Commonwealth's Motion to admit such evidence is DENIED and we reserve further decision on this issue to the time of trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Trial Court Opinion, filed 12-15/17, at 20-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   In light of the foregoing, the Commonwealth is mistaken when it argues the \"lower court abused its discretion by creating an unrealistic standard for determining relevancy on this point; namely, that the Commonwealth must show by specific and direct evidence that [Appellee] ingested [methamphetamine]. This would exclude all circumstantial evidence on that point.\" Commonwealth's Brief at 45. The trial court created no such standard, for a plain reading of its decision reveals it has left the door open for the Commonwealth to present testimonial, circumstantial, or other relevant evidence to establish that Appellee was under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or both at the time of the murder. This is clarified in the trial court's Rule 1925(a) Opinion where it indicated that at this juncture it \"simply has no evidence before [it] that shows [Appellee] was under the influence of any substance at the time [the Victim] was murdered.\" The trial court also emphasized that the Commonwealth had presented this argument for the first time on appeal as a way to connect his drug use with the Victim's death through the use of his prior bad acts against other women in the context of Pa.R.E. 404(b). Trial Court Opinion, filed 2/16/18, at 6-7. The court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   Indeed, based on the Commonwealth's offer of proof in connection with their Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   , we determined [Appellee's] drug use was irrelevant but reserved further decision on the issue to the time of trial, should the Commonwealth present further evidence that [Appellee's] drug use was relevant to the Criminal Homicide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion, 12/15/17, pp. 19-22.
