We shall hold that there may be circumstances when a trial judge in the exercise of his\n   or her discretion may allow the State to reopen its case-in-chief after the prosecutor has rested. In the present case, however, the trial judge abused that discretion. The trial judge impermissibly weighed the nature of the charges pending against Respondent Brandon Payton (\"Mr. Payton\" or \"Respondent\") as a factor in his decision to permit the reopening of the State's case-in-chief. In addition, the judge impermissibly exceeded the bounds of judicial impartiality when he instructed the State to clarify a gap that the trial judge perceived in the State's case. Finally, pursuant to this Court's established guidelines, it was inappropriate for the trial judge to exercise his discretion to allow the State to reopen its case-in-chief, rather than rule on Respondent's motion for judgment of acquittal, where the trial judge had determined that there was insufficient relevant evidence presented to sustain a conviction. The trial judge's decision compromised Respondent's right to a fair trial. Therefore, we conclude that Respondent is entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Payton was tried for murder and related charges before a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City in September 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The charges resulted from an incident on June 12, 2015, during which the victim died from multiple gunshot wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A witness to the shooting, Christopher Brinker, testified that he believed that the shooter's hand touched the hood of his vehicle when the shooter passed by in pursuit of the victim. The handprint became a key part of the State's case against Mr. Payton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Also among the State's witnesses was Sean Dorr, a certified latent print examiner employed by the Baltimore City Police Department, who testified as an expert witness. Mr. Dorr explained that there were three lift cards of the alleged\n   shooter's latent print\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   taken from the hood of Mr. Brinker's car. One lift card was suitable for comparison. Mr. Dorr scanned this lift card into the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (\"AFIS\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The AFIS compared the lift card to its database and produced a candidate list.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr.\n   Dorr manually compared the candidates' prints to the unknown latent print to determine if one was an exact match. Ultimately, Mr. Dorr testified that he identified the latent print \"as an impression of the left palm of Brandon Payton, State Identification Number (\"SID number\") 2476078.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Dorr also stated that on August 9, 2016 he took Mr. Payton's fingerprints and made fingerprint cards. Mr. Dorr testified that he did not compare the August 9 prints to the prints from the AFIS; however, he verified that the August 9 prints were associated with Mr. Payton's SID number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At this point, defense counsel objected. Outside the presence of the jury, defense counsel and the trial judge told the prosecutor that they were confused. The judge assumed that the State was trying connect the August 9 print to the print pulled from the AFIS, and connect the print from the AFIS to the unknown latent print. The judge, however, noted the gap in this logic, stating, \"that's not what [Mr. Dorr] testified to.\" The trial judge instructed the prosecutor to \"go back\" and \"be as clear as you possibly can as to what [was] compared.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Subsequently, the prosecutor continued questioning Mr. Dorr. Mr. Dorr explained that he had \"known prints\" from the AFIS, which were for SID number 2476078. Mr. Dorr said that he established that the prints he took from Mr. Payton on August 9 were for SID number 2476078.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the State rested its case, Mr. Payton's counsel moved for judgment of acquittal without particularizing how the State had not proven its case. The trial judge asked the State when, if ever, it connected the unknown latent print to Mr. Payton. The State offered an explanation, and portions of Mr. Dorr's testimony were replayed. The trial judge remained unpersuaded that the State had connected the unknown latent print to Mr. Payton and, therefore, was convinced that the State had failed to place Mr. Payton at the scene of the crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial judge explained, \"if I am confused ... are [the members of the jury] confused? I mean, right now I have to get past this for my own satisfaction to rule in your favor ... but I'm just totally at sea as to what [the State had] proven in this case.\" He went on to say:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: I am more than frustrated. Right this minute I don't think you've made your case. So my question is, do I\n   simply grant the motion to dismiss which I could easily do based on what I have heard of this testimony, because you have not convinced me that [Mr. Payton], that you have put this man at the scene of this crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Now, if you want me to allow you to reopen your case to call your expert\n   back in - and [Mr. Payton's counsel] I'm sure is going to object to that - and ask that question, in your judgment, to a reasonable degree of certainty, is the print that was taken off of that car Mr. Brandon Payton's print, if you want to call your witness back for five minutes of testimony with whatever cross-examination, I am going to permit that, because I think justice needs to be done and I - generally speaking, I am generally speaking, not inclined to punish clients - in your case, the public is your client - for something that a lawyer may or may not have done. But I don't think you've made your case at this moment. I'm going to permit you to do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   And [Mr. Payton's counsel], you're going to object, I'm assuming?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Payton's counsel said she was \"absolutely\" objecting. The court \"d[idn't] blame\" Mr. Payton's counsel for challenging the reopening, but the court persisted, explaining to the State:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: I'm going to let you reopen your case Friday morning for brief testimony to fill in the gap in your case -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE STATE: Yes, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE COURT: Because I think you intended to do it and I don't think you did it, and the fact that you can't point me to right now - I mean, I've listened to what you're talking about here and it is not convincing me at all. I think you got lost in the weeds, quite frankly. And so, I'm going to let you do it, but you know, right this minute, I'm not seeing it. You're not convincing me that you've made your case because you haven't put this man on the scene of the crime. And -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE STATE: Yes, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE COURT: Again, if you can't do it on Friday, that's fine, then I will grant the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE STATE: Yes, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE COURT: So you have, you have - and I don't want to go on for an hour and a half of testimony on Friday. You've already laid the groundwork. You just simply didn't ask the punch line question which to me was, is this the print of this man [Mr. Payton].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Again, Mr. Payton's counsel objected. Counsel reasoned that recalling Mr. Dorr would be the last thing the jury heard, and it would be in isolation to other evidence presented. The trial court responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE COURT: I understand your point, but I - you know, and I'm not crazy about the notion, but as I said, if this were a lesser crime than a murder, I might not be so generous. It is a murder and I think Mr. Payton is - deserves a fair trial and I've tried to do it and the State deserves a fair trial and I'm trying to do that. So I'm trying to balance these competing needs. And it may very well be that if he's convicted, you'll have grounds for appeal. I don't know. But at this point, I'm going to let this - I'm going to let you re-call your witness for a very brief period of time for that one purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Two days later, Mr. Payton's counsel objected again to Mr. Dorr re-testifying. Mr. Payton's counsel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   MR. PAYTON'S COUNSEL: I'm objecting to this entire testimony with [Mr.] Dorr being allowed to come back and testify. This is extremely prejudicial. This - we took a break yesterday .... This, this rings loud and clear. This is the crucial key piece of evidence. This is the only evidence linking Mr. Payton and this is the last thing and ... in isolation that the jury's [going to] hear, and this is extremely prejudicial. It's unfair, and I'm asking the Court not to allow the State to reopen its case and\n   have [Mr.] Dorr re-testify to this prejudicial piece of evidence at this point, the way it's presented right now in isolation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The trial court, however, overruled the objection:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   THE COURT: I think I have made clear that if this were a simple drug possession case, I might, in fact, not be allowing\n   this. But this is a murder case. It's an execution-style murder case. I think there is a strong public interest in having definitive resolution of cases involving crimes as serious as this one. And there - although there may very well be some prejudice, I'm not sure, about doing this in isolation or not, but I understand the point [Mr. Payton's counsel is] making. I feel in this case though that the public interest is sufficiently strong and the possible prejudice is sufficiently speculative that I think it's - I'm going to permit it. But - I'm going to permit it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The State recalled Mr. Dorr to the witness stand and sought to assuage the trial judge's confusion by connecting the fingerprint evidence to Respondent's SID number. Mr. Dorr testified that the unknown lift card was identified as the left palm of Mr. Payton, SID number 2476078. He also testified that he took Mr. Payton's fingerprints on August 9, 2016, and he ascertained that the SID number associated with Mr. Payton is 2476078. Mr. Dorr went on to explain that matching prints are designated to have the same SID number, but each print has a different transaction number. The State of Maryland's AFIS only knows Mr. Payton as having one SID number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After Mr. Payton's attorney cross-examined Mr. Dorr, the State again rested its case. Mr. Payton moved for judgment of acquittal, which the trial judge denied. Without offering any evidence, Mr. Payton rested his case. Then, Mr. Payton renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal. The trial court denied the renewed motion. The case proceeded to closing arguments, after which the trial judge sent the case to the jury for deliberations. The jury convicted Mr. Payton.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mr. Payton appealed his conviction to the Court of Special Appeals.\n   <em>\n    Payton v.

Reframed for clarity, the issue presented in this case is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it reopened the State's case to hear additional testimony, before ruling on the Defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal?\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Parties' Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   First, Petitioner argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that Respondent's claim of lack of judicial impartiality was preserved for appellate review. Petitioner posits that the issue was not plainly raised before the trial court. Next, Petitioner claims that, even if the issue were preserved for appeal, the trial court's decision to allow the State to reopen its case-in-chief fell within the trial court's broad discretion. Lastly, Petitioner contends that any evidence received on reopening was cumulative. As such, Petitioner claims that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Respondent asserts that his claim of lack of judicial impartiality was preserved for appeal because Respondent objected to the trial judge's entire procedure of permitting the State's to reopen its case. Even if the issue were not preserved, Respondent argues that this Court should exercise its discretion to review Respondent's claim of lack of judicial impartiality. Furthermore, Respondent maintains that trial courts do not have discretion to act on their own initiative to allow reopening of the State's case. If trial courts do have such discretion, Respondent argues that the trial court, in this case, abused that discretion. Finally, Respondent argues that when a trial judge departs from a position of neutrality, such an\n   error can never be considered harmless. Alternatively, Respondent contends that if this Court utilizes the harmless error framework, the error here cannot be harmless because the trial court, at a minimum, unfairly permitted the State to reopen its case to emphasize certain evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Preservation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Before we reach the merits of the case, we first address the preservation issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Petitioner preemptively argues that Respondent's claim of lack of judicial impartiality was not preserved for appellate review.

Further, Petitioner contends that, because Respondent voiced such specific objections to the State's case being reopened, the objections did not alert the trial judge that his impartiality was at issue. Respondent counters that he effectively objected to the trial court's procedure. Alternatively, if the matter were not preserved, Respondent contends that this Court should exercise its discretion to review Respondent's claim of lack of judicial impartiality. The Court of Special Appeals concluded that Respondent's argument was preserved for appellate review.\n   <em>\n    Payton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492436\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/178/633/\">\n    235 Md.

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Maryland Rule 8-131(a) governs preservation. It provides that, ordinarily, an appellate court will not review an \"issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\" In the present case, the objection plainly appeared in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Diggs\n   </em>\n   , the defense attorneys, on behalf of their clients, claimed that the trial judge was impartial, even though, \"[i]n nearly every instance of alleged judicial misconduct, neither [defense attorney] objected.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3681043\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/409/260/\">\n    409 Md. at 283-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3681043\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/409/260/\">\n    973 A.2d at 809-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (invoking the \"plain error\" doctrine to reach the defendants' claims of lack of judicial impartiality).

Respondent objected when the trial judge initially instructed the State to reopen its case and also two days later, just before Mr. Dorr testified for the second time. Respondent pointed out that the trial judge's decision was \"unfair\" and \"extremely prejudicial.\" Urging the court to reconsider its decision, Respondent clearly asked the court \"not to allow the State to reopen its case and have [Mr.] Dorr re-testify.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Perhaps most telling, the trial court recognized the ramifications of its decision. Specifically, the trial judge invited Respondent to object and \"d[idn't] blame\" Respondent for challenging the reopening.

Although the aforementioned cases are factually distinguishable from the present case, the underlying principle is instructive. Trial judges have an abundance of discretion. Yet, the manner in which a trial judge exercises that discretion must be impartial. To determine whether a judge has abdicated his or her neutrality, in contravention to a criminal defendant's right to a fair trial, we review whether a reasonable person could question the judge's impartiality.\n   <em>\n    Archer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1314373\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/383/329/#p335\">\n    383 Md. at 356-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1314373\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/383/329/#p335\">\n    859 A.2d at 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Before allowing the reopening of the State's case-in-chief, the judge considered the prejudice to both parties, noting that this case involves \"a murder and I think Mr. Payton is - deserves a fair trial and I've tried to do it and the State deserves a fair trial and I'm trying to do that. So I'm trying to balance these competing needs.\" The irony is that until this point, neither party had reason to complain about the trial's fairness. Only\n   by acting outside the scope of his discretion did the trial judge create the problem raised in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Nonetheless, we cannot escape the fact that the trial judge gave consideration to the nature of the charges brought against Mr. Payton in assessing whether to allow the reopening of the State's case. After instructing the State that it could reopen its case, the trial judge stated that \"if this were a lesser crime than a murder, I might not be so generous.\" Two days later, just before Mr. Dorr re-testified, the trial judge reiterated his justification:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   I think I have made clear that if this were a simple drug possession case, I might, in fact, not be allowing this. But this is a murder case. It's an execution-style murder case. I think there is a strong public interest in having definitive resolution of cases involving crimes as serious as this one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The trial judge's comments indicate that he impermissibly based his decision on the severity of the crimes charged. Neither ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal nor deciding whether to reopen the State's case requires weighing the nature of the crimes charged. Whether a defendant is charged with murder or \"simple drug possession,\" it is his or her right to have a trial conducted by a judge whose inquiries are dispassionate and neutral. An impartial judge must extract a \"definitive resolution\" from a cold review of the evidence, not define a proper resolution based on the charges brought. Thus, a reasonable person would be justified in questioning the judge's impartiality in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In deciding whether to allow the State to reopen its case, the trial judge exceeded\n   the bounds of judicial impartiality and essentially acted as a prosecutor. After the defense moved for judgment of acquittal, without articulating a particular basis for the motion, the trial judge interjected his doubt as to the sufficiency of the State's evidence. He questioned the State on the crux of its case - how the fingerprint evidence connected Mr. Payton to the scene of the crime. The State rendered an explanation and replayed portions of Mr. Dorr's testimony for the court. The trial judge continued to express doubt about\n   the State's proof stating, \"if I am confused... are [the members of the jury] confused? I mean, right now I have to get past this for my own satisfaction to rule in your favor... but I'm just totally at sea as to what you have proven in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   At this point, the trial judge could have ruled on the motion or sought additional assistance from the parties to understand the evidence. Instead, the trial judge essentially gave the State an ultimatum: recall Mr. Dorr and elicit additional testimony or suffer the consequences of the court ruling on the motion. The trial judge posited, \"do I simply grant the motion to dismiss which I could easily do based on what I have heard of this testimony[;]\" or \"if you want to call [Mr. Dorr] back ... I am going to permit that.\" Furthermore, the trial judge advised the State on how it could fill the gap that the trial judge perceived in the case before him. The trial judge stated that the prosecutor \"simply didn't ask the punch line question which to me was, is this the print of [Mr. Payton].\" In addition, the trial judge specified that the State could recall Mr. Dorr to ask, \"in your judgment, to a reasonable degree of certainty, is the print that was taken off of that car Mr. Brandon Payton's print.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Clearly, it was the trial judge's duty to try to understand the evidence that the State had presented and rule on the motion for judgment of acquittal. He had the benefit of Mr. Dorr's initial testimony, portions of which were replayed outside the presence of the jury. In addition, the trial judge had the benefit of the prosecutor's explanation of what the prosecutor believed had been proven. Despite the State's efforts to persuade the judge it had proven its case, the judge was still not convinced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Nothing happened prior to the State resting its case that prevented the trial judge from taking a recess to review again the evidence in the case and then rule on the motion for judgment of acquittal. Once the State rested, and Respondent moved for judgment of acquittal, the trial judge's responsibility was to rule on the motion. Instead, the court sought further clarification of the evidence before it by permitting the State\n   to recall Mr. Dorr. In doing so, the trial judge provided the State with an unfair opportunity to clarify a gap that the judge perceived in the evidence. Under the circumstances, it was fundamentally unfair to Respondent for the court to permit the State to recall a witness in order to persuade the trial judge and eventually the jury that the evidence in the case was legally sufficient to sustain a conviction. For us to condone such a procedure would result in two grave consequences: 1) there would be no finality when a prosecutor closes his or her case and 2) a trial judge would be able to take over the prosecution of a criminal case without violating the defendant's right to a fair and impartial trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   At worst, the trial judge exhibited bias against Mr. Payton and that was the very reason the State overcame the motion for judgment of acquittal and secured a guilty verdict. At best, the trial judge gave the appearance of helping the State meet its burden of proof and emphasized or highlighted an important aspect of its evidence. In either instance, the trial judge relinquished\n   his role as an impartial and disinterested arbiter when he decided to permit the State to reopen its case instead of ruling on Respondent's motion for judgment of acquittal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brooks v.

Although the factors stated in\n   <em>\n    Booze\n   </em>\n   are not exhaustive, they help in weighing the impact that reopening will have on the defendant's right to receive a fair trial.

Here, the trial judge had before him Respondent's motion for judgment of acquittal. In accordance with this Court's jurisprudence, the trial judge should have evaluated the legal sufficiency of the State's evidence and then ruled on the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brooks v.

Instead, the judge neither granted nor denied the motion; he signaled the reopening of the State's case and allowed the prosecutor to recall Mr. Dorr. Although the trial judge acknowledged that reopening \"may very well [cause] some prejudice,\" he determined that \"the public interest [was] sufficiently strong and the possible prejudice [was] sufficiently speculative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Given that we cannot know how the jury would have understood Mr. Dorr's initial testimony or weighed his credibility, we also cannot know precisely how recalling Mr. Dorr impacted the jury. What is abundantly clear, however, and of particular concern, is that the trial judge's decision gave the State an unfair second chance to present the crux of its case to Respondent's disadvantage. The State purported to use Mr. Dorr's testimony to connect Mr. Payton to the crime scene and eventually to the crimes alleged. At the close of the State's evidence, however, the trial judge was unpersuaded that the State had connected\n   Mr. Payton to the crimes alleged. The judge was on the brink of acquitting Mr. Payton. By reopening the State's case to recall Mr. Dorr, instead of ruling\n   on Respondent's motion, the trial judge permitted the State to present the crux of its case to the jury for a second time. The prejudicial impact of this doubling down on one piece of evidence is exacerbated by the fact that Mr. Dorr's testimony on reopening was elicited two days after the State rested and in isolation to other evidence in the case. Mr. Dorr was the only witness to testify twice, and his testimony was the last evidence the jury heard before convening. Thus, the trial judge's decision to reopen the State's case critically affected Respondent's right to receive a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Petitioner contends that Mr. Payton could not be prejudiced by the trial court's decision to permit the State to reopen its case because the trial court misperceived a defect in the prosecutor's case. According to Petitioner, this Court must consider whether the perceived defect constituted an actual defect in the evidence, and the Court of Special Appeals erred in failing to do so. Finally, Petitioner contends that any error under a\n   <em>\n    Booze\n   </em>\n   analysis should be subject to harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   We know of no instances when the appellate courts undertake a review of whether \"the trial court could have\n   <em>\n    reasonably\n   </em>\n   granted [a] motion for judgment of acquittal,\" as Petitioner urges us to do. Moreover, if the trial court had granted Mr. Payton's motion, its decision to acquit Mr. Payton would have been subject to double jeopardy - regardless of whether the perceived defect was an actual defect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pugh v.

Under these circumstances, the trial judge's decision impaired Mr. Payton's right to a fair trial to such an extent that, as a matter of law, the error was unduly prejudicial. Had the trial judge denied Mr. Payton's motion and sent the case to the jury, the jury may have concluded that the State failed to connect Mr. Payton to the crime with the handprint evidence, just as the trial judge initially concluded before settling on the reopening of the State's case. Thus, the jury may have returned a not guilty verdict. It is also reasonable to conclude that recalling Mr. Dorr bolstered his prior testimony. At a minimum, we know Mr. Dorr's testimony on reopening reemphasized the State's evidence. Where we have determined, as a matter of law, that an error committed by the trial judge is prejudicial, it is unnecessary to invoke a harmless error analysis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Diggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3681043\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/409/260/\">\n    409 Md. at 294-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3681043\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/409/260/\">\n    973 A.2d at 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that the trial judge's \"egregious and repeated behavior reflecting partiality and bias... denied [the defendants] the right to fair and impartial trials, to which a harmless error review is unavailing.\");\n   <em>\n    Booze\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2025940\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/334/64/\">\n    334 Md. at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2025940\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/334/64/\">\n    637 A.2d at 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that reopening the State's case to present clarifying evidence was \"prejudicial as a matter of law\"). Moreover, where a trial judge\n   abdicates his or her responsibilities, thereby causing prejudice to the trial, the abandonment of judicial impartiality undermines the public's trust and confidence in our courts. It casts doubt upon whether, in a particular case, justice has been done. We, therefore, conclude that the trial judge's errors in this case were prejudicial as a matter of law.

The prosecutor argued that the SID number is the control; verifying that the prints are associated with the same SID number was an identification of Mr. Payton. The trial court's understanding was that \"the same SID number doesn't matter\" because it is just an identifier that is associated with a print.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Specifically, the jury convicted Mr. Payton of first-degree murder, second-degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence.

Where Payton made specific objections to reopening the State's case for more fingerprint-expert testimony only on the grounds that the additional fingerprint testimony would be the last thing that the jury would hear and that it would be presented in isolation, were defense counsel's claims that reopening would be \"unfair\" and \"extremely prejudicial,\" or the trial court's statement that the reopening could \"very well ... be grounds for appeal\" sufficient to preserve a judicial-partiality claim?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n    2.

Where the reopening of the State's case was based on the trial court's incorrect assumption that there had been no testimony linking Payton to the handprint, when in fact three State's witnesses had already testified that the handprint had been linked to Payton, was any error [ ] harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the testimony was cumulative of the testimony of three prior witnesses linking Payton to the handprint?\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12496944,12496942\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/459/170/\">\n     459 Md. 170\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12496944,12496945,12496942,12496943\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/185/63/\">\n     185 A.3d 63\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Given our conclusion that the claim of judicial impartiality was preserved, we need not and do not decide whether the \"plain error\" doctrine applies in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
