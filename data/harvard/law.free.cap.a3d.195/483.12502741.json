Mr. Dickerson contends in his cross-appeal that the Superior Court erred by declining to make additional awards of front pay based on the Grade 15 position and compensatory damages for emotional distress. For the reasons that follow, we reverse as to the disparate treatment and hostile work environment judgments, affirm in part as to the attorney's-fee sanction (on the basis of the delay in effecting remedial relief as to Mr. Dickerson's successful claim of retaliation), and remand for a determination of the relevant fee amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case has had a lengthy procedural history. In September 2004, OHR began investigating, pursuant to the District of Columbia Human Rights Act (\"DCHRA\"), a complaint of discrimination made by Mr. Dickerson, who at the time was a DPW Management and Program Analyst. In asserting his membership in a protected class, Mr. Dickerson explained that he was the only white employee among 338 DPW Parking Services Administration employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In an August 18, 2005, Letter of Determination (\"LOD\"), OHR addressed Mr. Dickerson's three claims: disparate treatment because of race, a racially hostile work environment, and retaliation. The LOD found probable cause as to Mr. Dickerson's hostile work environment and retaliation claims. Regarding Mr. Dickerson's disparate treatment claim, however, the LOD concluded that Mr. Dickerson had not alleged an \"adverse action\" such as is required for a successful disparate treatment claim. (The LOD did not reach the issue of whether a substantial factor in the complained-of actions was Mr. Dickerson's membership in a protected class.) Mr. Dickerson sought reconsideration of the no-probable-cause finding as to his disparate treatment claim, arguing that in the LOD, OHR misapplied the law by applying an overly narrow interpretation of what constitutes an \"adverse action.\" On reconsideration, OHR adhered to its conclusions in the LOD, adding that the particular alleged conduct by DPW that Mr. Dickerson had cited as examples of adverse action - \"provid[ing] ... negative information in [Mr. Dickerson's] performance evaluation\" and \"conduct that had a limiting effect on [Mr. Dickerson's] employment opportunities\" - was \"only in retaliation for his protected activity\" of filing a complaint with DPW's Equal Employment Opportunity (\"EEO\") Officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After efforts to conciliate the matter were unsuccessful, Mr. Dickerson chose to have OHR issue a \"summary determination on the merits of [his] complaint based solely upon information in the complaint\n   file.\" 4 DCMR \u00a7 109.1 (2006).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In May 2009, the administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") \"assigned to issue [the] [s]ummary [d]etermination\" reached the same conclusions as were reached in the LOD,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as did a \"Hearing Examiner\" in a December 22, 2010, \"Proposed Summary Determination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   OHR's July 5, 2011, Final Summary Determination and Order concluded, however, that while Mr. Dickerson demonstrated that DPW lowered his (July 2, 2004) performance evaluation as retaliation for his having engaged in protected activity, he had not shown that his \"lack of advancement was a result of ... retaliatory action.\" OHR also concluded in the Final Summary Determination and Order that Mr. Dickerson failed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of a race-related hostile work environment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   OHR noted that a hostile work environment claim requires a \"linkage between the hostile behavior and the plaintiff's membership in a protected class\" and found that Mr. Dickerson had \"not demonstrated that all of the [unwelcome] behaviors [he alleged] were associated with his race.\" OHR also found that the comments of which Mr. Dickerson complained, if they were made, were \"mere offensive utterances, little else.\" As relief, OHR ordered only that Mr. Dickerson's retaliatory performance evaluation be expunged from DPW and District of Columbia Department of Human Resources (\"DHR\") records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 14, 2011, Mr. Dickerson petitioned the Superior Court for review of the Final Summary Determination and Order's no-hostile-work-environment finding and the limited remedial relief it ordered for retaliation, as well as for review of the LOD finding as to no probable cause of disparate treatment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Dickerson named OHR as the respondent. On June 22, 2012, DPW gave notice of its intent to intervene, but the Superior Court (the Honorable Michael Rankin) initially denied intervention, on the ground that DPW's notice was untimely. The court later allowed\n   DPW to intervene as to the issue of relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In a ruling issued on May 3, 2013, Judge Rankin found that Mr. Dickerson had established probable cause that he was subjected to disparate treatment on the basis of race and that he was subjected to a hostile work environment on the basis of race. Judge Rankin reasoned\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   that OHR \"applied the incorrect standard in analyzing probable cause, confusing probable cause with the petitioner's ... ultimate burden of proof\"; that OHR applied too-narrow an interpretation of \"adverse action\" for purposes of the disparate treatment claim; and that Mr. Dickerson's \"sheer number of reassignments\" and his treatment after he complained of suspected race discrimination sufficed to show adverse action. Judge Rankin noted that OHR had pointed to no evidence that \"any other employee situated similarly to Dickerson received the kind of treatment\" Mr. Dickerson received. He found that OHR's conclusions on both disparate treatment and hostile work environment went \"against the great weight of the evidence\" and were not supported by substantial evidence in the record, and that \"the record evidence clearly establishe[d] a pattern of conduct within DPW's [Parking Services Administration (\"PSA\") ] by Mr. Dickerson's supervisors and coworkers that can only be seen as unlawful disparate treatment based solely on race and the creation of a hostile work environment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a subsequent order, Judge Rankin remanded the matter to OHR \"to determine the amount of monetary damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 5, 2013, OHR issued a Determination on Remand, finding, \"[p]ursuant to the directive of the Superior Court,\" probable cause on the hostile work environment and disparate treatment claims and ordering the parties to submit briefs on proposed remedies. After briefing by the parties, OHR issued a Determination on Damages on August 16, 2013. OHR ordered that Mr. Dickerson be \"ranked as a Grade 14, Step 8, and that [G]rade 14 step increases be awarded to him retroactively\" and that Mr. Dickerson be compensated for lost overtime. OHR found that Mr. Dickerson had not demonstrated that but for discrimination, he would have been promoted to a Grade 15 managerial/deputy director position. OHR also found that Mr. Dickerson was not entitled to compensatory damages, the monetary value of leave he used because of his claimed emotional distress, or attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In an October 9, 2013, Determination on the Parties' Request for Reconsideration on Damages, OHR found it had miscalculated the back pay award and corrected its calculation. OHR also found that Mr. Dickerson was entitled to an additional amount for lost overtime, additional retirement savings contributions based on the back pay award, and prejudgment interest. Additionally, OHR ordered that Mr. Dickerson be allowed to attend training of his choosing and that DPW managers be required to attend sensitivity training.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Dickerson filed a supplemental petition for review by the Superior Court, arguing that OHR's determination on damages was arbitrary and capricious, legally erroneous, and in derogation of OHR's statutory responsibility. DPW also petitioned for review, challenging OHR's determinations with respect to back pay and\n   a retroactive promotion. After a hearing on January 31, 2014, Judge Rankin found the remedies awarded by OHR to be inadequate, reasoning that \"but for\" the racial discrimination, Mr. Dickerson would have received a Grade 15 position advertised in June 2004. Judge Rankin again remanded the case to OHR, this time for OHR \"to provide monetary compensation for the retroactive promotion at the GS-15 level Mr. Dickerson would have received but for DPW's discriminatory conduct, beginning in June of 2004.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On remand, OHR calculated back pay from August 2005 (subsequently explaining that Judge Rankin, in remarks from the bench at the January 31, 2014, hearing, had directed the agency \"to review the Grade 15 level compensation that was in effect in August of 2005\"). The parties again sought review by the Superior Court. In a June 10, 2015, \"Order of Monetary Relief Including Attorney's Fees,\" Judge Rankin found that a remand back to OHR would be \"futile\" because OHR had \"failed to award adequate relief - ignoring the record, applicable law, and th[e] court's findings.\" Judge Rankin awarded Mr. Dickerson back pay at the Grade 15, Step 5 level as from June 1, 2004 (plus associated benefits) and affirmed the OHR order of expungement of Mr. Dickerson's negative performance evaluation. Judge Rankin reasoned, however, that an award of front pay - \"the difference in [Mr. Dickerson's] actual salary and a Grade 15, Step 5 salary from June 1, 2015 until October 2020, the normal date of retirement, plus a 5% pension contribution\" - \"[wa]s speculative in nature and exceed[ed] the scope of the court's ruling.\" Judge Rankin further found that the agencies had acted in \"bad faith\" (or, in the alternative, had violated Super. Ct. Civ. R. 11 for filing pleadings not well grounded in law and fact) and on that basis awarded Mr. Dickerson attorney's fees in the amount of $66,696.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   These appeals followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

To take the approach Mr. Dickerson urges would be to deprive DPW of the opportunity to seek review of the Superior Court's May 3, 2013, ruling (which was a non-final and non-appealable order until followed by the Superior Court's June 10, 2015, \"Order of Monetary Relief Including Attorney's Fees\") and to bind OHR by rulings on remand that it was constrained to make by the Superior Court's remand orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

They further argue that even if a probable-cause finding as to adverse action was required at that stage, the Superior Court erred by adjudicating Mr. Dickerson's probable-cause claim on the merits rather than remanding for OHR to make a merits determination in the first instance.

But the consultant study also stated that PSA had \"only one professional analyst among its non-managerial ranks\" to work on matters such as \"improving business processes,\" and as shown on Mr. Dickerson's performance evaluation for the year ending March 31, 2003, he had had some previous responsibility for technology and program improvements for the Abandoned and Junk Vehicle Program. Thus, the record did not require OHR to conclude that Mr. Dickerson's analytic skills would go unused or atrophy in his assignment to work on the Abandoned and Junk Vehicle Program. Indeed, the LOD states that during an interview with Mr. Dickerson, \"he stated [that] being assigned to Blue Plains was not a problem considering the amount of operational problems that existed at that location and the branch's need for additional staffing assistance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Moreover, Mr. Dickerson submitted to OHR copies of emails containing weekly reports he sent to his supervisor Adams describing what appears to be analytical work on the Abandoned and Junk Vehicle Program, as well as emails from Adams describing some of Mr. Dickerson's analytical assignments relating to that program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Mr. Dickerson told OHR that in September 2003, after his transfer to that program, he was the only representative from DPW on official business in Philadelphia \"to review a private auction related to the District's temporary tag and abandoned auto problems.\" In the face of those descriptions and representations - which described work that seems comparable to the \"process improvement[ ]\" work described in Mr. Dickerson's performance evaluation for the year ending March 31, 2003 - OHR was not compelled to find that Mr. Dickerson was \"removed from meaningful work,\" as he asserted, when he was reassigned by Adams; or that he had significantly different responsibilities after the reassignment; or that his assignment to work primarily on the Abandoned Auto\n   and Junk Vehicles Program instead of the Centralized Towing Program \"constitute[d] qualitatively inferior work requiring any less skill or knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    Baloch\n   </em>\n   , 550 F.3d at 1197.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The information before OHR was also that while DPW's EEO Officer was conducting an investigation into Mr. Dickerson's complaints of discrimination, Mr. Dickerson was temporarily reassigned to work at the DPW Office of Information Technology Services located at DPW's 14th Street office (where,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Dickerson was assigned to \"assess and enhance\" certain business processes). Mr. Dickerson told OHR that he had \"no issue\" with reassignment during the investigation. Mr. Dickerson further told OHR that after he returned to work under PSA Administrator Adams for six days in late July 2004,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   he was assigned to work in the DPW Director's Office.

Mr. Dickerson told OHR that his work in the DPW Director's Office beginning in August 2004 entailed work on \"Special Projects.\" DPW likewise explained to OHR that after Ms. Adams's arrival, Mr. Dickerson \"was not assigned to a specific program but, instead, carried out various management analyses and special projects.\" Especially given Mr. Dickerson's acknowledgment that his prior work at PSA, too, involved \"special topical studies,\" we cannot say that OHR was required to find that Mr. Dickerson's reassignment to the DPW Director's Office and associated supervisor changes rendered his job responsibilities \"significantly different\" from what they had been before.\n   <em>\n    Douglas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7329734,5659055\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/559/549/\">\n    559 F.3d at 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Even with the benefit of hindsight, we cannot impugn OHR's finding, in the LOD, that with respect to Mr. Dickerson's disparate treatment claim, there was no probable cause to find that he had suffered adverse action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We conclude for the foregoing reasons that substantial evidence supported the LOD determination that Mr. Dickerson's allegations did not make out a claim of adverse action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we affirm OHR's no-probable-cause ruling as to Mr. Dickerson's disparate treatment claim and reverse the award of back pay.

For example, DPW explained that Ms. Adams required Mr. Dickerson but not others to file weekly reports because he performed his work duties, which DPW termed \"unique\" (Mr. Dickerson was the only PSA analyst), away from the PSA central office, and Adams needed to understand what he was working on. Mr. Dickerson complained that DPW caused employees attending a mandatory work event to sing \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" a song \"known as the 'Negro National Anthem.' \" DPW explained that the only verse of the song sung at the PSA work event \"contain[ed] a message of hope\" about \"a new day begun,\" which was a theme of the new PSA administration, not a \"veiled reference to slavery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   OHR also had before it explanations from DPW regarding Mr. Dickerson's complaints that his supervisor Adams made race-based comments, including that \"[w]hites are handing blacks flawed programs to run,\" and also stated on different occasions, \"That white boy isn't going to do that to me\" and \"White boys are doing bad things to me.\" OHR was informed that the context of the \"flawed program\" statement was that the agency had put together a \"think tank\" design team to design a new parking program; that the design team had all white members, including Mr. Dickerson; and that African-American employees, including PSA Administrator Adams, who would have to implement the new program, were concerned that they \"would be criticized for flaws that were inherent in the programs [they] did not help to create.\" (OHR understood Mr. Dickerson to say that the implication of Ms. Adams's comment was an accusation that Mr. Dickerson had racial animus, i.e., \"chose to assign flawed programs to others on the basis of race.\"). Regarding the \"white boy\" comment (according to Mr. Dickerson, a reference to a Mr. Belak, who is Caucasian), which Ms. Adams denied making, DPW explained that Ms. Adams \"had raised questions and complaints about the quality of technical support provided by Mr. Belak's office to her operations\n   staff.\" DPW also asserted that past behavior by those who reported the alleged comment, including Mr. Belak and a former PSA employee, \"casts doubt on [their] motive and credibility.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   OHR reasoned in its Final Summary Determination and Order that Mr. Dickerson's complaints about comments made or repeated by his supervisor or co-workers were about \"isolated comments\" that, although \"race-based\" in some instances, were \"not sufficient to establish that [Mr. Dickerson] was subjected to an abusive environment in violation of the DCHRA.\" OHR's reasoning about insufficient evidence of an \"abusive environment\" is supported in part by the undisputed fact that during much of the 2003-04 period that was the subject of his complaints, Mr. Dickerson was assigned to the Blue Plains or 14th Street locations, and thus did not have daily interaction with the accused supervisor. In other words, the record did not show that Mr. Dickerson was subjected to \"a steady barrage of opprobrious racial comments,\"\n   <em>\n    Bolden v. PRC Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307453\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/43/545/#p551\">\n    43 F.3d 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 551 (10th Cir. 1994), that permeated his work environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Further, DPW's explanations about the context of the statements Ms. Adams acknowledged having made (or having repeated) were a substantial basis upon which DPW could determine that the comments did not reveal or stem from racial animus or race-based hostility toward Mr. Dickerson. For example, DPW explained that the comment \"[w]e ain't on no plantation no more,\" one of the comments about which Mr. Dickerson complained and which Ms. Adams recalled was made by a union supervisor, referred to a perception that, under a previous (African-American) administrator, employees had not been treated with respect and had not been expected to take responsibility for the quality of work done by the PSA, circumstances that the new administration sought to change. DPW explained that Ms. Adams's comment that Mr. Dickerson needed \"to take a cultural awareness class because he [did not] know how to talk to blacks\" followed complaints that Mr. Dickerson had treated white customers at the District's vehicle impoundment facility better than he treated African-American customers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Importantly, the various race-related comments about which Mr. Dickerson complained were not unambiguously racial epithets or slurs. We do not doubt Mr. Dickerson's claim that the race-related comments were offensive to him (and we likewise find them offensive). But though the comments were perhaps insensitive and the supervisor would have done better not to make or relay them, we cannot say on the record that OHR was compelled to find that they amounted to severe and pervasive race-based harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The record regarding Mr. Dickerson's other complaints - about his transfer to Blue Plains, the \"mistaken\" announcement about elimination of his job, his exclusion from projects about which he had expertise, colleagues regarding him as \"radioactive,\" his transfer back to the PSA central\n   office for an unwelcoming (six-day) period of supervision under Adams - also did not compel OHR to find a race-based hostile work environment. Nothing about Mr. Dickerson's initial transfer to Blue Plains compelled a finding that the transfer was race-based. Mr. Dickerson was not the only employee detailed to Blue Plains under the new administrator, and, as DPW pointed out to OHR, the pre-EEO-complaint relationship between Ms. Adams and Mr. Dickerson seemed cordial, collegial, and encouraging: Adams thanked Dickerson for \"all that [he did] to facilitate PSA [t]eamwork,\" praised his \"great work,\" called him \"Mr. Efficiency,\" and invited him to lunch. As to the later actions of which Mr. Dickerson complained, OHR had reasonably found in its LOD Reconsideration Decision that, rather than being race-based, the conduct was the result of (was \"only in retaliation for\") Mr. Dickerson's \"protected activity\" of \"fil[ing] a complaint with [DPW's] EEO Officer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we uphold OHR's summary determination rejecting Mr. Dickerson's hostile work environment claim and reverse the Superior Court's contrary judgment. We also reject Mr. Dickerson's claim on cross-appeal that OHR (and the Superior Court) erred by failing to order restoration of the leave he \"was required to take for his emotional distress\" on account of the alleged hostile work environment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Attorney's Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In ordering DPW [and OHR] to pay Mr. Dickerson's attorney's fees, Judge Rankin cited the fact that the Final Summary Determination and Order \"makes no explanation why it reversed the LOD and the Proposed Summary Determination\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   OHR's having ignored the court's order to calculate back pay at the Grade 15, Step 5 level \"beginning in June of 2004\"; the \"failure to effectuate ... expungement of [Mr. Dickerson's] negative performance review,\" which \"came to light only through counsel for Mr. Dickerson and her diligent efforts on his behalf\"; DPW's \"repeated [and \"well out of time\"] motions to intervene,\" \"completely unfounded\" motion to dismiss Mr. Dickerson's appeal, and appeal of a non-final, non-appealable order; and \"counsel's contradictory misrepresentations concerning the existence, or non-existence, of the witness statements and investigatory notes\" in DPW or OHR files. Judge Rankin premised the award of attorney's fees on both the bad faith exception to the so-called American rule on attorney's fees and the \"court's inherent power to 'vindicate judicial authority' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Jung v. Jung\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9271890\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/844/1099/#p1107\">\n    844 A.2d 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1107 (D.C. 2004) ) (internal alterations omitted), and, as an alternative, on Super. Ct. Civ. R. 11. OHR and DPW argue that the Superior Court erred in awarding Mr. Dickerson attorney's fees because DPW and OHR did not \"engage[ ] in bad faith conduct warranting a fee award\" and because the fee award was not authorized as a Rule 11 sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For a variety of reasons, the fee award cannot stand undisturbed. The first is that, under our ruling today, Mr. Dickerson is\n   the \"prevailing party\" only as to his efforts to obtain expungement of the negative performance evaluation as a remedy for retaliation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second is that, in making the fee award as a Rule 11 sanction, the trial court did not adhere to the requirements of Rule 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, with regard to the court's invocation of its inherent authority to impose a sanction to vindicate its authority, we are not persuaded that most of the conduct the court cited entailed an affront to the court's authority, evidenced abuse of the litigation process, or otherwise showed bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Judge Rankin's oral and written rulings arguably set June 2004 (\"the date that the [Grade 15] job was advertised\") as the earliest date for back pay calculations at the GS-15 level. But at the January 31, 2014, hearing, Mr. Dickerson's counsel confirmed that she had stipulated that \"August 2005\" was the \"point at which there should have been a promotion.\" Accordingly, we are not persuaded that OHR deliberately defied the court's order when it calculated the back pay the court had mandated based on the August 2005 date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Further, the court was correct to observe that DPW filed a premature appeal from Judge Rankin's January 31, 2014, oral ruling and February 11, 2014, written order that remanded the case to OHR to award monetary compensation to Mr. Dickerson for a retroactive promotion at the GS-15 level. However, although this court dismissed the appeal as taken from a non-final order, the remand was at least arguably appealable since (it appeared at the time) all that remained was for OHR to perform a ministerial calculation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to OHR's motion to dismiss Mr. Dickerson's petition for review by the Superior Court\n   as untimely, the record shows that the agency later withdrew its motion after discovering that the Final Summary Determination and Order had not been served on Mr. Dickerson until sometime after July 5, 2011. \"[A] party is not to be penalized for maintaining an aggressive litigation posture.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9271890\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/844/1099/#p1107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Judge Rankin criticized the Final Summary Determination and Order for \"mak[ing] no explanation why it reversed the LOD and the Proposed Summary Determination.\" This court, however, has noted, without criticism, the fact that OHR sometimes, without expanding the record, makes a summary determination that incorporates the findings of fact set out in a LOD but concludes, contrary to the LOD, that a complainant has failed to establish discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vogel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8384171\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/944/456/\">\n    944 A.2d at 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although DPW argues that it \"reasonably sought to comply with, and enforce, the expungement order,\" we are satisfied that Judge Rankin did not abuse his discretion in finding that DPW acted at least wantonly\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   in failing to take adequate steps to ensure that the District's personnel agency had expunged Mr. Dickerson's negative performance evaluation. An Assistant Attorney General representing DPW asked DHR to search Mr. Dickerson's records, remove the negative performance evaluation, and send the expunged material to her. The DHR General Counsel responded that the document had been expunged, but we see no evidence that he complied with the request that the document be sent to DPW counsel, or that DPW followed up on its counsel's request. When Mr. Dickerson reviewed his employment file at DHR in May 6, 2014 - almost three years after the OHR order, and after Judge Rankin had underscored that expungement was the very least that was required after Mr.\n   Dickerson's several years of seeking relief - Mr. Dickerson found the negative review still in his record. We conclude that Judge Rankin acted within his discretion in ordering that the District pay Mr. Dickerson's attorney's fees related to counsel's efforts to have the negative performance evaluation expunged. As the record does not disclose how much of the $66,696 attorney's fee award related to that work, we are constrained to remand the case to the Superior Court for the fee award amount to be redetermined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In summary, for the foregoing reasons, we reverse the order of the Superior Court finding that appellee/cross-appellant Mr. Dickerson was entitled to remedial relief on his claims of disparate treatment and hostile work environment. We also reverse the court's judgment awarding Super. Ct. Civ. R. 11 sanctions.
