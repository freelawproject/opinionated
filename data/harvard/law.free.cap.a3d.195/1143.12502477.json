On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the court erred in concluding that (1) the defendant's construction of a 1500 square foot service access structure within a 6900 square foot easement area did not materially interfere with the plaintiffs' reasonable use and enjoyment of the easement area, and (2) the defendant had the unilateral right to determine the method, timing, and location by which the plaintiffs might use the easement area. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as set forth in the court's memorandum of decision or otherwise in the record and undisputed, and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. In a complaint dated January 11, 2016, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendant materially and substantially had interfered with their use and enjoyment of an easement, titled \"Easement A\" (easement).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs sought both compensatory damages and injunctive relief. The easement is \"contained in the recorded documents [declaration] establishing the entity known as the Broad Summer Condominium [condominium] located in downtown Stamford .... The [c]ondominium is described as an 'air rights condominium,' and consists of six units. Unit 1 contains what is described as an almost forty year old, 30,000 square foot three story building with full basement fronting on Broad Street .... The building has been vacant for several years. Unit 1 is jointly owned by the plaintiffs .... Unit 2 ... is the beneficiary of most of the air rights and the present site of a recently constructed [twenty-one] story residential apartment\n   building that includes four parking levels, owned by the defendant and known as Summer House....\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The area of [u]nit 2, which has an undivided interest in the [c]ondominium of 25.97 percent, includes an easement area ... for the benefit of [u]nits 1, 3 and 4.... The [easement] area consists of a little less than 6900 square feet....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The [d]eclarant of the [c]ondominium is Tolari, LLC [Tolari]. Thomas Rich, the chief executive officer of F.D. Rich Co[mpany], a long time real estate developer in Stamford, is Tolari's managing member, and also an owner of Summer House [condominium]. F.D. Rich Co[mpany] is described as the primary developer\n   of Summer House.... Tolari and the principals of the plaintiffs, Kostas Alafoyiannis (principal of 57 Broad [Street Stamford, LLC] ) and Alexander Todorovic (principal of 59 Broad [Street Stamford, LLC] ) signed a contract, dated June 19, 2012, for [the plaintiffs'] purchase of [u]nit 1.... Because the [c]ondominium [d]eclaration and the plans for the apartment building were not complete at that time, the contract contained an 'out' clause allowing the [u]nit 1 purchasers a period of time to rescind the purchase for 'any reason or no reason.' There followed negotiations between attorneys for the [u]nit 1 purchasers ... and the attorney for the seller-declarant ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Footnote added.) These negotiations concerned the easement language that is at issue\n   in the present case. The language as negotiated is contained in [\u00a7] 12.2 of the declaration, which is dated October 24, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Approximately one year later, the construction plans were finalized. \"The construction contract for Summer House was dated August 28, 2013.... The plaintiffs were notified that construction would commence by letter dated January 7, 2014.... The progress of construction is shown by dated photographs ... taken between February, 2014 [and] October, 2015. The ... plaintiffs occasionally visited their building during the construction period.\" (Citations omitted; footnote omitted.) During this time, construction began on the service access structure at issue in this appeal. \"[T]he service access structure is approximately [seventy-five] feet long running east to west and [twenty] feet wide. The structure effectively leaves three means of access to the south side of the plaintiffs' building on [u]nit 1. These means of access ... are: (1) a [ten] foot wide passage way between the Target Store and [u]nit 1 extending south from Broad Street to the light and air easement area south of [u]nit 1; (2) a seven foot wide sidewalk running east-west between the 'service access structure' and the Target Store garage; and (3) an entryway under the Summer House varying in width from [twenty to twenty-six] feet beginning at what is labeled 'Loading Area' ... and running east from the Target access way and turning north toward the back, or south side, of the plaintiffs' building on [u]nit 1.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, \"[i]n December, 2015, ... [the plaintiffs' attorney], on behalf of the plaintiffs in a letter to\n   ... [the defendant's attorney], demanded the defendant cease and desist from building further structures located on [the easement] and demolish what had been built there.... [The defendant's attorney] responded a little over a week later, noting that the plaintiffs had information for over two years of the planned construction on [the easement] and in any event, the plaintiffs would have the access and parking called for in [\u00a7] 12.2 of the [d]eclaration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiffs commenced the underlying action the following month, claiming that their easement rights encompassed\n   the entirety of the easement area and that the construction of a service access structure in the center of the easement interfered with those rights. A five day trial to the court took place between June 15 and July 21, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 30, 2016, the court issued its memorandum of decision. It concluded that the defendant had not interfered with the plaintiffs' use and enjoyment of the easement and rendered judgment in favor of the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiffs first claim that the court improperly concluded that the defendant did not interfere with their reasonable use and enjoyment of the easement. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the court erred in\n   concluding that the defendant's construction of the 1500 square foot service access structure within the 6900 square foot easement area did not violate their easement rights.

Section 12.2 of the declaration provides in relevant part: \"(i) A perpetual right and\n   easement is granted to Unit No. 1 and to the Association to pass and repass over those portions of Unit No. 2 shown as 'Easement A' on the Survey including all walkways, drives, roads and parking areas shown on the Survey, for the purposes of: (a) accessing the building and Improvements now or hereafter located upon Unit No. 1; (b) accessing the recycling and refuse area located on Unit No. 2; and (c) accessing eighteen (18) parking spaces located within Unit No. 2 in the area shown on the Survey, and parking vehicles within said parking spaces ('Parking Area'). The easement granted herein for the benefit of Unit No. 1 shall be shared with others to whom the Owner of Unit No. 2 has granted, or shall hereafter grant, rights to enter and pass over and upon Unit No. 2 ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The easement thus sets forth the right to pass and repass over the easement for three particular purposes. See\n   <em>\n    Zirinsky\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carnegie Hill Capital Asset Management, LLC\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6780303\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/139/706/#p714\">\n    139 Conn. App. at 716-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20A.3d%20284\">\n    58 A.3d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"an easement generally authorizes limited uses of the burdened property for a particular purpose\" [emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted] ). Those purposes include access to (1) the building and\n   improvements on unit 1, (2) the recycling and refuse area on unit 2, and (3) eighteen parking spaces in the parking garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the construction of the service access structure interferes with the first two rights set forth in the easement-accessing the building and improvements on unit 1 and accessing the recycling and refuse area on unit 2. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that, as a result of the service access structure, large trucks are prevented from entering the area fully, there may be traffic congestion if tenants are moving into the apartments in unit 2 at the same time deliveries are being made to the other units, and hand trucks must be used to remove refuse from the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Despite the plaintiffs' contention to the contrary, the trial court concluded that the construction of the service access structure does not interfere with or impair their rights under the easement. The claim that there\n   <em>\n    may be\n   </em>\n   congestion if a certain number of vehicles are present in the area at once is mere conjecture, especially given that the plaintiffs have yet to occupy unit 1. Additionally, the evidence admitted at trial established that the plaintiffs still will be able to access the recycling and refuse area, as the other units currently do without issue. Thus, the only remaining argument is that the service access structure unreasonably interferes with the plaintiffs' use and enjoyment of the easement because large vehicles, such as box trucks and tractor trailer trucks, can make it no closer than approximately 100 feet of unit 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As an initial matter, we note that nothing in the language of the declaration provides for full and unlimited access by large vehicles. The plaintiffs' attorney conceded at oral argument before this court that the plaintiffs intended for the easement to permit access for large vehicles but that it was never discussed with the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, nothing in the language of the declaration prohibits the construction of permanent structures within the easement area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Avery\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Conn.%20App.%20433\">\n    151 Conn.

The court noted in its memorandum of decision that, even with the structure, three means of access to the rear of the plaintiffs' unit remain-a ten foot wide passage, a seven foot wide sidewalk, and a loading area under the Summer House. Evidence presented at trial established that large trucks make deliveries to the other units with which the plaintiffs share the easement rights without issue. These\n   trucks can get as close as 100 feet to the building, and then deliveries are made via hand trucks. The court also noted that \"vehicles sufficient to allow service of the HVAC equipment on the roof of the [u]nit 1 building and to access other exterior building repairs could [occur]\" even with the existence of the structure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiffs have not demonstrated that, in order to make reasonable use and enjoyment of their easement rights, large trucks must be able to get directly to the rear door of their unit.
