On appeal, the plaintiff challenges the court's decision to grant the defendants' motion for summary judgment without considering either (1) excerpts from the certified transcripts of two depositions taken in this case, one of Brianna and the other of Bayne, which the plaintiff had filed in opposition to the motion, or (2) the surreply brief with attached exhibits which she later filed, without the court's permission, in further opposition to the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The amended complaint and record demonstrated the following. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants negligently caused Brianna's injuries and resulting damages as follows. On the evening of January 7, 2013, while Brianna was practicing as a member of the junior varsity cheerleading squad of Bristol Eastern High School under the supervision of Bayne, her coach, she attempted, for the first time ever, to perform a cheerleading stunt known as the \"ladder stunt.\" To perform that stunt, two cheerleaders acting as \"bases,\" flanked by front and back spotters to protect the participants' safety, lift a third cheerleader acting as the \"flyer\" into the air, where they hold her as she transitions from half to full extension. Practicing as the \"flyer\" with her stunt group on that evening, Brianna had difficulty performing the ladder stunt, twice attempting but failing to complete it. Although Bayne was aware of Brianna's difficulty in performing the stunt and of her resulting apprehensiveness about trying to perform it again, she instructed Brianna to\n   \"try it one more time,\" but then walked away to assist other cheerleaders without assisting Brianna to perform the stunt a third time or\n   giving her further instruction as to how to do so correctly. When Brianna thereafter complied with Bayne's instructions by trying to perform the stunt again, she fell to the floor after being lifted into the air and transitioning from half to full extension, causing her to break several bones in her arm. The plaintiff alleged that Bayne's conduct in supervising Brianna was negligent because, inter alia, she encouraged Brianna to perform the stunt again despite Brianna's uncertainty and apprehensiveness, when she knew or should have known that it was unsafe and unreasonable to do so; failed to give Brianna hands-on assistance in performing the stunt again or proper instruction as to how to perform it correctly when it should have been apparent that her failure to do so would likely subject Brianna to imminent harm; and failed to provide sufficient spotters to catch Brianna if she fell. The defendants answered the plaintiff's amended complaint by denying all allegations of negligence against them and interposing the special defense of qualified governmental immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 9, 2015, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground of qualified governmental immunity, together with a supporting memorandum of law and several exhibits, including an affidavit from Christopher Cassin, the board's supervisor of athletics, physical education and health; an affidavit from Bayne; and a memorandum of decision granting a defense motion for summary judgment on the ground of qualified governmental immunity in another Superior Court action in which the plaintiff, an injured cheerleader, sought to recover damages from municipal defendants for injuries she claimed to have suffered due to their negligence in conducting a high school cheerleading practice. On the basis of those submissions, the defendants argued that there was no genuine issue of material fact that they were entitled to prevail on their special defense of qualified governmental\n   immunity, and thus to the entry of judgment in their favor on the plaintiff's claims of negligence, because the conduct and supervision of cheerleading practices is a governmental activity that requires the exercise of discretion. They further argued that there was no evidence that their alleged negligence in exercising such discretion in this case came within an exception to qualified governmental immunity by subjecting Brianna, as an identifiable member of a narrowly defined class of foreseeable victims, to a risk of imminent harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 11, 2015, the plaintiff filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the defendants' motion along with several attached exhibits, including her second amended complaint; excerpts from the original certified transcripts of Brianna's and Bayne's depositions in this case; the plaintiff's disclosure of Dr. Gerald S. George as an expert witness on the subjects of biomechanics and cheerleading safety; an excerpt from the National Federation of State High School Associations 2012-13 Spirit Rules Book; and an excerpt from the Bristol Public Schools Coaching Handbook.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the basis of those materials, the plaintiff claimed that the defendants' motion should be denied because the evidence she had submitted raised two genuine issues of material fact as to the viability of the defendants' special defense of qualified governmental immunity: first, whether the conduct and supervision of\n   cheerleading practices involves the performance of ministerial, rather than discretionary, duties, as to which the special defense of qualified governmental immunity is unavailable as a matter of law; and second, even if the conduct and supervision of cheerleading practices involves the performance of discretionary duties, whether Bayne's alleged negligence in performing such duties in this\n   case, as evidenced by Brianna's and Bayne's deposition testimony, fell within an exception to qualified governmental immunity because Brianna was subjected to a risk of imminent harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, on March 2, 2016, the defendants filed a reply memorandum in further support of their motion. Attached to the reply memorandum were two additional exhibits: a supplemental affidavit from Cassin, and an additional excerpt from the original certified transcript of Brianna's deposition. On the basis of Brianna's deposition testimony, so supplemented, the defendants argued, inter alia, that before Brianna fell, she did not object to performing the ladder stunt again or tell Bayne of her fear of so doing, and thus Bayne had no notice that by instructing Brianna to try the stunt one more time, she was subjecting her to a risk of imminent harm. Both the plaintiff and the defendants included, as parts of each deposition excerpt they filed in connection with the defendants' motion, the cover page of the original deposition transcript from which the excerpt in question was taken, the page of the transcript on which the court reporter certified the truth and accuracy of the entire deposition, as he transcribed it, and the page of the transcript on which the deponent swore before the court reporter, who took her oath in his capacity as a notary public, that she had read the entire transcript of the deposition and certified to its truth and accuracy, as transcribed or as later corrected on the attached errata sheet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither party objected in writing to the other party's submission of or reliance upon any such deposition excerpt, so authenticated, as evidence in support of or in opposition to the motion, or suggested that any corrections had ever been made to the transcript on an errata sheet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 4, 2017, after the previously described memoranda and materials were filed, the plaintiff, without the permission of the trial court, filed a surreply brief in further opposition to the motion. Attached to that brief were several additional exhibits, including an affidavit from her expert, Dr. George; a document listing the \"highlights\" of Dr. George's professional resume; and a copy of the bylaws of the Connecticut Student Activities Conference. These additional exhibits bore only upon the plaintiff's claim that the defendants were not entitled to governmental immunity because their duties in conducting and supervising cheerleading practices were ministerial, rather than discretionary, in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court heard oral argument on the defendants' motion on March 7, 2016. During the argument, when the defendants' counsel began to present argument in support of the motion based upon Brianna's certified deposition testimony, the court advised the parties that it considered the deposition excerpts they had submitted to be unauthenticated, and thus to be inadmissible as evidence on the motion unless all parties consented, because such excerpts were neither separately certified as true and accurate excerpts from the original certified deposition transcripts, nor accompanied by affidavits from persons with personal knowledge of the contents of such original certified transcripts, averring that the excerpts were true and accurate excerpts\n   from those transcripts. When the defendants' counsel was informed by the court that she could, but need not, consent to the use of the deposition excerpts as evidence in support of or in opposition to the motion, she promptly reversed course, declining to offer her consent, although the deposition excerpt she had submitted and relied upon was presented and authenticated in the same manner as the excerpts submitted by the plaintiff. It would be \"fair,\" she suggested, if no such\n   deposition excerpt from either party was considered in deciding the motion. Accordingly, the court announced that, in the absence of an agreement among the parties, none of the deposition excerpts they had filed would be considered in deciding the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When counsel for the plaintiff was so informed of the court's decision not to consider the deposition excerpts she had filed in opposition to the defendants' motion, she promptly asked the court for permission to supply it with a sworn affidavit averring that the excerpts she had submitted were true and accurate excerpts from Brianna's and Bayne's original certified deposition transcripts. The court twice refused this request despite observing that no party had suggested that any such excerpt was inaccurate in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The court also advised the parties during the argument that the plaintiff's surreply brief and attached exhibits had been filed improperly, without the court's permission, in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 11-10 (c). Even so, it granted the defendants permission to file their own surreply brief in response to the plaintiff's surreply brief in case it should ultimately decide to consider such briefs and exhibits in deciding the motion. One week later, on March 14, 2016, the defendants filed their own surreply brief without additional exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By an order dated April 18, 2016, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court ruled, on the basis of the evidence it found to be admissible, that the defendants were entitled to governmental immunity because there was no genuine issue of material fact that (1) cheerleading is a student athletic activity authorized by the board, and thus Bayne's conduct in supervising that activity was public in nature;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Bayne's duties while engaging in such supervisory activity were discretionary, rather than ministerial, in nature; and (3) Bayne's alleged negligence in performing such discretionary duties on the evening of Brianna's fall did not come within an exception to qualified governmental immunity by subjecting Brianna, as an identifiable member of a narrowly defined class of foreseeable victims, to a risk of imminent harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In rendering summary judgment in favor of the defendants as aforesaid, the court did not consider any of the deposition excerpts that the parties had filed in connection with the defendants' motion on the previously stated ground that they were not authenticated properly. Nor did\n   the court consider either party's surreply brief or the exhibits attached to the plaintiff's surreply brief because, as it had noted during the argument, the plaintiff's surreply brief and exhibits had been filed without the court's permission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment (1) without considering the deposition transcript excerpts she had filed in opposition to the motion, and (2) without considering her surreply brief and attached exhibits. We agree with the plaintiff that the trial court erred in not considering the deposition excerpts she offered in opposition to the motion on the ground that they were not authenticated properly. We disagree, however, that the trial court abused its discretion in not considering the plaintiff's surreply brief and\n   attached exhibits. We therefore reverse the summary judgment rendered by the trial court in favor of the defendants, and remand this case for further consideration of the defendants' motion in accordance with this opinion, and for such other proceedings as may thereafter be appropriate, according to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Before addressing the plaintiff's claims in greater detail, we note that ... [b]ecause the present case was disposed of by way of summary judgment, we first address the appropriate framework for appellate review of a summary judgment determination.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Grady\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Somers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5770143\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/294/324/#p331\">\n    294 Conn. 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 331,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=984%20A.2d%20684\">\n    984 A.2d 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). The purpose of summary judgment procedure is to provide a vehicle for ending litigation short of trial where the admissible evidence available to the parties, as presented to the court, establishes that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because there is no genuine issue as to one or more material facts upon which his right to judgment depends. See Practice Book \u00a7 17-49 (summary judgment \"shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The ultimate facts upon which a party's right to a judgment in his favor depends are determined by the pleadings, which not only identify the claims and defenses upon which the parties have joined issue, but the factual theories upon which they have committed themselves to proving those claims and defenses. Although the sufficiency of such pleaded allegations to state viable claims and defenses can be determined by comparing the pleaded claims and defenses to the pleaded allegations, the availability to the pleader of evidence to prove such allegations cannot be inferred\n   from the mere fact that they have been pleaded. Accordingly, our rules of court require any party moving for summary judgment to prove to the court that admissible evidence available to him not only tends to prove the material facts upon which his right to judgment depends, but eliminates any genuine issue as to the existence of such material facts, thereby establishing his right to prevail on his claim or defense as a matter of law. A party opposing summary judgment, by contrast, need only demonstrate that the admissible evidence available to the moving party is insufficient to eliminate any genuine issue as to the material facts upon which the movant's right to judgment depends, or that admissible evidence available to her is sufficient to raise a genuine issue as to the existence of one or more such material facts. \"In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.... The party moving for summary judgment has\n   the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Grady\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Somers\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5770143\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/294/324/#p331\">\n    294 Conn. at 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=984%20A.2d%20684\">\n    984 A.2d 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because a motion for summary judgment must be adjudicated without conducting trial, our rules of practice have established an alternative procedure for establishing the availability of admissible evidence in support of or in opposition to a motion for summary judgment. Under that procedure, the party seeking summary judgment must first support his motion by filing certain designated types of materials with the court that constitute, contain or demonstrate the availability to the party of admissible evidence. Such materials, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-45, include sworn affidavits, certified transcripts of testimony given under oath, disclosures and pleadings. If such materials establish the availability of admissible evidence tending to prove the\n   material facts upon which the movant's right to judgment depends, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to file similar materials tending to raise a genuine issue as to any such material fact. The court's task in reviewing the parties' submissions is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to decide any factual issues they raise, but only to decide if, in fact, they raise any such factual issues, as by demonstrating a potential inconsistency or conflict in the admissible evidence concerning one or more facts upon which the movant's right to judgment depends. In the event the court determines that there is such a genuine issue of material fact, it must deny the motion for summary judgment and leave resolution of the issue to the trier of fact at trial, who will hear and evaluate the evidence on both sides of that issue firsthand before deciding it. \"On appeal, we must determine whether the legal conclusions reached by the trial court are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision of the trial court.... Our review of the trial court's decision to grant the [defendants'] motion for summary judgment is plenary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=984%20A.2d%20684\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The first issue raised in this appeal concerns the process by which one form of evidence routinely submitted in connection with motions for summary judgment must be authenticated before the court can consider it in deciding such a motion. The evidence in question consists of excerpts from certified transcripts of testimony given under oath. Because the purpose of authentication, as established in our case law, is to make a preliminary showing that the proffered evidence is what the party offering it claims it to be, it is important at the outset to understand the reason why such transcripts, if authenticated, are admissible on a motion for summary judgment. Importantly, certified transcripts\n   of testimony given under oath are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   admitted in connection with such motions because they\n   <em>\n    constitute\n   </em>\n   admissible evidence at trial. This is because, under our rules of evidence, the admissibility of prior sworn testimony depends upon both the unavailability of the witness to testify at trial and the prior availability to all other parties of an opportunity to cross examine the witness when he gave his prior sworn testimony. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (1). Instead, the reason why such certified transcripts are admissible in connection with summary judgment motions is to demonstrate the availability to the party submitting them of live testimony from the witnesses, consistent with their prior sworn testimony, as it appears in the certified transcripts. The purpose of authentication of such certified transcripts is thus to make a preliminary showing that they accurately\n   record testimony that the witnesses in question gave under oath.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In this case, the trial court sua sponte refused to consider two deposition excerpts filed by the plaintiff and one deposition excerpt filed by the defendants in connection with the defendants' motion for summary judgment because they failed to submit either full certified transcripts of the witnesses' depositions or to file affidavits from knowledgeable witnesses separately establishing that the excerpts in question were true and accurate excerpts from such full certified transcripts. The plaintiff complains that the trial court's ruling to this effect constituted an overly strict application of the authentication requirement and deprived her improperly of actual, reliable proof as to the availability of admissible evidence in opposition to the defendants' motion. For the following reasons, we agree with the plaintiff and reverse the trial court's ruling rendering summary judgment in favor of the defendants in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiff asserts that our standard of review over her first claim is plenary. The defendants argue, to the contrary, that we must review the plaintiff's claim under the abuse of discretion standard. Because, however, the claim involves the interpretation of a rule of practice, we agree with the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Wiseman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305117\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/94/#p99\">\n    295 Conn. 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=989%20A.2d%201027\">\n    989 A.2d 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (\"[t]he interpretation and application of a statute, and thus a Practice Book provision, involves a question of law over which our review is plenary\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \" Practice Book \u00a7 17-45 provides in relevant part that [a] motion for summary judgment shall be supported by such documents as may be appropriate, including but not limited to affidavits,\n   <em>\n    certified transcripts of testimony under oath\n   </em>\n   , disclosures, written admissions and the like....

However, far from objecting to the plaintiff's submission of the subject excerpts from the certified deposition transcripts of Brianna and Bayne, the defendants themselves submitted, as an attachment to their reply memorandum, an overlapping excerpt from Brianna's certified deposition transcript, which was authenticated in precisely the same manner as the plaintiff had authenticated the excerpt from that same deposition that she had submitted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   By so doing, without correcting the plaintiff's submission in any way, then expressly relying upon such excerpts in their own summary judgment argument, the defendants effectively stipulated to the authenticity of both excerpts from Brianna's deposition, which the parties had submitted as true and accurate excerpts from the original certified transcript of that deposition. \"Stipulations or admissions prior to or during a trial provide two other means of authentication.\" Conn.

She contends that because the phrase \"certified transcripts of testimony under oath\" is not defined in Practice Book \u00a7 17-45 or elsewhere, and the deposition transcript excerpts she submitted along with her opposition memorandum of law included the deposition\n   cover page, the page on which the court reporter certified the accuracy of the entire deposition transcript as he transcribed it, and the page on which the deponent swore that she had read the entire deposition transcript and certified to its truth and accuracy, so transcribed, it fully satisfied the requirements of the rules of practice.

Such proof of genuineness is fully consistent with the purpose for which certified transcripts of depositions are admitted in support of or in opposition to summary judgment motions, which is to prove that the submitting party has available to her, for presentation at trial, admissible evidence consistent with the witness' prior recorded testimony under oath. If the court reporter has duly certified that the entire deposition was given under oath and that it was accurately transcribed, he has thereby, necessarily, certified that the excerpt in question was accurately transcribed as part of that sworn testimony, a fact that was confirmed in this case by the defendants' own submission of and reliance upon excerpts from the same original deposition transcript in support of their motion, and by the deponent's certification under oath that she had read her entire testimony, so transcribed, and found it to be truthful and accurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Our rules of practice, in fact, expressly allow for the use of such excerpts. See Practice Book \u00a7 17-46, which provides in relevant part: \"Sworn or certified copies of all papers\n   <em>\n    or parts\n   </em>\n   thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto.\" (Emphasis added.) There is therefore no requirement that the entire document be attached to make an excerpt therefrom admissible in support of a summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We acknowledge concerns that a trial court may have in considering an excerpt from a deposition transcript; see footnote 9 of this opinion; however, we find that those concerns are easily addressed. In cases such as this one, where both parties have access to full copies of the original deposition transcripts from which the excerpts in question were taken, if a party includes the cover page of the transcript, the page on which the court reporter certifies the accuracy of his transcription, and the page on which the deponent certifies under oath that, upon reading the entire deposition, the testimony in\n   it is truthful and accurate, nothing more can be required of the submitting party to make her \"preliminary showing of [the document's] genuineness ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    New Haven\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pantani\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5491042\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/89/675/#p679\">\n    89 Conn. App. at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=874%20A.2d%20849\">\n    874 A.2d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A party must, of course, include enough of the full deposition transcript in the submitted excerpt to put the testimony upon which she wishes to rely in its proper context, so that its meaning can be understood and its true significance can be properly evaluated by the court, but she has no need- indeed, no right-to file other portions of the deposition that contain testimony that is irrelevant to the issues raised on summary judgment, or that contain answers that are beyond the personal knowledge or competency of the deponent or are otherwise inadmissible in evidence. If, however, an opposing party wishes to object to a proffered deposition excerpt, in whole or in part, on any basis, he has ample means at his disposal to protect his rights. If he feels that the chosen excerpt is inadmissible in evidence on the issues raised on the pending motion, he can move to strike the entire excerpt or object to particular portions of it. If the court agrees with his position, it can grant him relief after both parties have been heard on the issue. If, by contrast, he feels that the excerpt, though admissible as submitted, is nonetheless misleading because it does not\n   include portions of the original deposition transcript that shed important light on issues which the excerpt concerns, he can seek the court's permission, under \u00a7 1-5 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, to introduce any other part of the deposition that \"ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with\" it. That, in fact, is what the defendants in this case did by attaching additional excerpts from Brianna's deposition to their reply memorandum. Where, moreover, a party proffers excerpts from a certified deposition transcript that has not already been made available to all counsel, Practice Book \u00a7 17-47 entitles his opponent to request a postponement of all summary judgment proceedings to enable him to conduct further investigation, pursue additional discovery or obtain additional affidavits in order to respond effectively to the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, the plaintiff submitted excerpts from the certified depositions of Brianna and Bayne, both of which were fully available to the defendants, who did not object to them until prompted to do so by the court. Because such excerpts were submitted along with pages from the original deposition transcripts establishing that such original transcripts were accurate transcriptions of the deponents' truthful testimony under oath, such excerpts were properly authenticated for the purpose of Practice Book \u00a7 17-45, which is to establish the availability of admissible evidence bearing upon the issues raised on the defendants' summary judgment motion. For that reason we conclude that the court erred by refusing to consider such deposition excerpts in deciding the motion. Thus, we reverse the court's\n   granting of summary judgment in favor of the defendants and remand this case for further proceedings on that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The plaintiff also claims that the trial court erred in not considering the parties' reply memoranda. We review this\n   claim under the abuse the discretion standard. \"An abuse of discretion standard would be consistent with the general rule that [t]he trial court has wide discretion in granting or denying amendments [to pleadings] before, during, or after trial.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Dimmock\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lawrence &amp; Memorial Hospital, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960593\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/286/789/#p799\">\n    286 Conn. 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=945%20A.2d%20955\">\n    945 A.2d 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the court agreed at oral argument to consider the parties' reply memoranda. It is undisputed that the court granted the defendants one week from oral argument to file a surreply memorandum in response to the plaintiff's surreply. It is further undisputed that the court did not consider either party's surreply briefs in deciding the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 11-10 was amended on June 12, 2015, with an effective date of January 1, 2016, to add current subsections (b) and (c) to the rule. According to commentary accompanying the amendment, \"[t]his change ... [clarified that] [n]o surreply memoranda can be filed without the permission of the judicial authority.\" Practice Book (2016) \u00a7 11-10, commentary. The court therefore had discretion under the rules of practice not to consider this additional briefing. We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in not considering the parties' surreply memoranda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Of all of the exhibits attached to the plaintiff's memorandum of law, only the excerpts from the certified deposition transcripts are at issue in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Neither party included such errata sheets.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    See\n    <em>\n     Jahn\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Board of Education\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20Conn.%20App.%20652\">\n     152 Conn.
