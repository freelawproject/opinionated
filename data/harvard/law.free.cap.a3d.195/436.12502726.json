Carney, appeals from the judgment of the trial court denying his motion to correct an illegal sentence. The defendant claims that the court improperly (1) concluded that the sentencing court properly construed General Statutes \u00a7 17a-566 as limiting the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) to a recommendation as to the appropriate place of confinement only and, therefore, properly declined to consider information provided by Whiting Forensic Division (Whiting) at the \u00a7 17a-566 hearing when it imposed the sentence; and (2) failed to conclude that the sentencing court relied on inaccurate information provided by Whiting. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendant's claims. They arise primarily from five separate proceedings: a plea proceeding on May 9, 2003; a June 27, 2003 hearing in which the court granted a continuance for sentencing; a July 18, 2003 hearing regarding the defendant's motion for a psychological evaluation; a September 5, 2003 hearing in which Whiting doctors testified regarding the defendant's need for further evaluation; and a January 16, 2004 sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 9, 2003, the defendant pleaded guilty to murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. On that date, the court,\n   <em>\n    Handy, J.\n   </em>\n   , advised the defendant that the possible sentence for the crime was between twenty-five and sixty years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant's attorney\n   stated that he had retained Donald Grayson, a psychiatrist, to conduct a psychiatric evaluation of the defendant in anticipation of a possible extreme emotional disturbance defense,\n   and that he had discussed Grayson's report with the defendant. Before accepting the defendant's plea, the court canvassed the defendant on his waiver of the right to a trial, including his right to present an affirmative defense at trial. The court also indicated that it had reviewed Grayson's report and had considered the information contained therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pursuant to the plea agreement, the defendant agreed to a forty-two year sentence. The court informed the defendant that he would be sentenced to forty-two years at the sentencing proceeding to be held at a later date, and the defendant affirmed that he understood. The court further informed the defendant that once the court accepted his plea, he could not take it back. The defendant again affirmed his understanding. The court found that the defendant's plea was \"voluntary, made with understanding, [and] made with the assistance of competent and effective counsel.\" The court accepted the defendant's guilty plea, and a sentencing hearing was scheduled for June 27, 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 26, 2003, the day before the scheduled sentencing, the defendant attempted suicide and was taken to a hospital. Sentencing was continued to July 18, 2003, because the defendant was in the hospital on June 27, 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following the defendant's attempted suicide, his attorney filed a motion for a psychiatric evaluation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-566.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 18, 2003, the court heard\n   both parties regarding the defendant's motion. The state did not object, and the court ordered the defendant to be sent to Whiting for a presentence psychiatric evaluation in order to determine whether the defendant should serve his sentence in Whiting or at a Department of Correction (DOC) facility. The court indicated that the evaluation would not alter the defendant's agreed upon forty-two year sentence. The defendant did not object to the court's statement that the sole purpose of the psychiatric assessment was to provide guidance regarding the place of confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 5, 2003, the court held a hearing regarding the Whiting recommendation. At the outset of the hearing, the court reiterated that the Whiting evaluation would not alter the length of the agreed upon forty-two year sentence. The court inquired as to whether either party disagreed with the court's understanding of the purpose of the inquiry, and both parties expressly stated that they did not disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Eileen McAvoy, a psychologist who evaluated the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 17a-566, testified as to her findings, and her written report was admitted as a full exhibit. In her report, she concluded that the\n   defendant was in need of further evaluation at Whiting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 16, 2004, after the further evaluation, the court held a sentencing hearing at which Whiting personnel testified as to their recommendations. The Whiting report, including a psychiatric evaluation and Whiting \"recommendations,\" was admitted as a full exhibit, under seal. Paul Amble, the chief forensic psychiatrist for the Connecticut Division of Forensic Services, and Sean Hart, a clinical psychologist, testified that the defendant should serve his sentence at a DOC facility. Both Amble and Hart further testified that they believed the DOC would be able to provide the defendant adequate psychiatric treatment. During summation, defense counsel raised concerns regarding the methods the Whiting personnel used in evaluating the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, defense counsel argued that the defendant should serve his sentence at Whiting. The court adopted Whiting's recommendation and sentenced the defendant in accordance with the plea agreement to forty-two years imprisonment to be served at a DOC facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 4, 2016, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22, the defendant, representing himself, filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence. The defendant claimed that his sentence was imposed in an illegal manner because the sentencing court relied on inaccurate information and improperly concluded that the purpose of the \u00a7 17a-566 hearing was to determine only the place of the defendant's confinement. After a \"sound basis\" hearing pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Casiano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3951260\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/282/614/\">\n    282 Conn. 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=922%20A.2d%201065\">\n    922 A.2d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007), the court did not appoint counsel to represent the defendant in connection with his motion to correct, and the defendant proceeded as a self-represented party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 1, 2016, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    D'Addabbo, J.\n   </em>\n   , held a hearing on the defendant's motion to correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court concluded that the sentencing court properly had construed \u00a7 17a-566, and the court determined that there was no basis for the claim that the sentencing court had relied on inaccurate information in imposing the agreed upon sentence. Finally, the court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction the defendant's claim, as the court perceived it, that the defendant received inadequate care from the DOC. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We begin with the relevant standard of review and legal principles. \"We review the [trial] court's denial of [a] defendant's motion to correct [an illegal] sentence under the abuse of discretion standard of review.... In reviewing claims that the trial court abused its discretion, great weight is given to the trial court's decision and every reasonable presumption is given in favor of its correctness....

Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22, however, the sentencing court may correct an illegal sentence, illegal disposition, or a sentence imposed in an illegal manner. An illegal sentence is one that \"exceeds the relevant statutory maximum limits, violates a defendant's right against double jeopardy, is ambiguous, or is internally contradictory.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304713\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/825/#p839\">\n    295 Conn. 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 839,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=992%20A.2d%201103\">\n    992 A.2d 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).

As related previously in this opinion, the sentencing court stated that the statutory scheme related to placement of inmates and that the Whiting referral and resulting information would not be considered in the determination of the length of the sentence to be imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In construing a statute, we \"ascertain its meaning from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Panek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492036\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/1113/#p225\">\n    328 Conn. 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 225,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492036\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/1113/#p225\">\n    177 A.3d 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Section 17a-566(a) provides that a sentencing court may refer certain convicted persons to Whiting for evaluation, and the initial Whiting examination may result in temporary commitment to Whiting for additional evaluation. Following the evaluation, a report is to be\n   prepared in accordance with \u00a7 17a-566(c). Section 17a-566(d) provides that the report is to include \"(1) [a] description of the nature of the examination; (2) a diagnosis of the mental condition of the defendant; (3) an opinion as to whether the diagnosis and prognosis demonstrate clearly that the defendant is actually dangerous to himself or others and requires custody, care and treatment at [Whiting]; and (4) a recommendation as to whether the defendant should be sentenced in accordance with the conviction, sentenced in accordance with the conviction and confined in the institute for custody, care and treatment, placed on probation by the court or placed on probation by the court with the requirement, as a condition to probation, that he receive outpatient psychiatric treatment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Section 17a-567(a) prescribes the process to be followed after the report is filed in court. If the report recommends confinement\n   in Whiting, a further hearing is required. If, however, \"the report recommends that the defendant be sentenced in accordance with the conviction ... the defendant shall be returned to court directly for disposition.\" General Statutes \u00a7 17a-567(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plain language of the statutes yields the conclusion that their direct purpose is to guide the sentencing court in the determination of the appropriate place of confinement. The statutory language provides a detailed procedure for making that determination: in the circumstances of the present case, either the convicted person ultimately is confined at Whiting or the person is returned to court for \"disposition in accordance with the conviction.\" There is no statutory authority for Whiting to make any recommendation as\n   to length of sentence, and we conclude that the court properly construed and applied the statutory authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendant appears to make the further argument, however, that once the Whiting report was before the court and the Whiting personnel testified, even if a hearing was not statutorily required because the evaluators recommended a disposition not involving Whiting, the sentencing court was bound at least to consider the substance of the Whiting report and testimony in sentencing the defendant. The defendant's position apparently is twofold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendant has constructed an intricate argument that, so far as we can tell, runs as follows. The Whiting report and testimony indicated that the defendant was severely mentally ill, even if not to the degree requiring confinement at Whiting, and specific diagnoses were made. In this situation, then, the court was required to apply various human rights statutes, most notably General Statutes \u00a7 46a-7,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and presumably was bound to consider rejecting the agreed upon sentence as too harsh in light of his mental illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We reject this position for two reasons. First, we are not persuaded that \u00a7\u00a7 46a-7 et seq. have any relevance\n   to sentencing in the criminal justice system, at least in the context of this case. The facilities expressly listed in the human rights statutes do not include correctional facilities; see General Statutes \u00a7 46a-11a(6) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 18-96a and 17a-560 et seq. specifically govern the treatment of mentally ill persons within correctional facilities. Second, as noted by the trial court,\n   prior to imposing the agreed upon sentence, the sentencing court reviewed the Grayson materials, which are consistent with and very similar to the Whiting materials. We conclude that the trial court did not err in declining to hold that the receipt of the Whiting information required consideration of a more lenient sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, the defendant claims, somewhat paradoxically in light of his first claim, that the Whiting materials contained erroneous information such that the trial court erred in concluding that the sentencing court did not rely on inaccurate information when it imposed the defendant's sentence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defendant argues that the Whiting personnel testified that he would receive adequate treatment at a DOC facility, and, he suggests, he has not received adequate treatment. As the trial court recognized, insofar as this is a claim regarding the conditions of confinement, it is a claim more appropriately brought in a habeas action. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%20288\">\n    319 Conn. 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 299,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20A.3d%20100\">\n    127 A.3d 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (\"if [the defendant] believes that the mental health treatment he is receiving while in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction is ... inadequate, [his remedy] is ... an expedited\n   petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the conditions of his confinement\"); see also General Statutes \u00a7 52-466(a)(2). The statements of Whiting personnel were predictions rather than statements of fact, and, in any event, there is no record, including findings of fact and conclusions, on which to review the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, as noted by the trial court, there is nothing to indicate that the sentencing court materially relied on any information in the Whiting report or testimony in imposing the sentence. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304713\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/825/#p839\">\n    295 Conn. at 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=992%20A.2d%201103\">\n    992 A.2d 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A defendant [cannot] ... merely alleg[e] ... factual inaccuracies or inappropriate information.... [He] must show that the information was materially inaccurate and that the judge relied on that information.\" [Citations omitted; emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.] ). What is clear is that the sentencing court, having recognized the likelihood of mental illness, took appropriate statutory measures and ultimately accepted the plea agreement of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    \"The Court: And the penalties under [\u00a7] 53a-54a are twenty-four years to life.
