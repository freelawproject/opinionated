On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court improperly denied her motion to suppress the pretrial and in-court identifications of her\n   because they were the result of unnecessarily suggestive photographic arrays, and (2) the state presented insufficient evidence to convict her of arson, conspiracy to commit arson, and the insurance fraud charge pertaining to the homeowner's insurance policy of her mother. We agree with the defendant's second claim as it pertains to the insurance fraud count and, accordingly, reverse in part the trial court's judgment. We otherwise affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. At about 2:45 p.m. on May 28, 2011, the defendant set fire to her mother's house in Stratford. Neighbors, including Carmen Febles, Juan Febles, and Karen Wakeley, heard an explosion and saw flames coming from the house. The defendant appeared among the neighbors, barefoot, claiming that she had been mowing the lawn when the fire started. At least one of the neighbors was familiar with the defendant. The defendant, who spoke English and Spanish, identified herself as the homeowner's daughter, and then used Carmen Febles' cell phone to call her mother's cell phone and asked the person on the other line, \"Where are you?\" Approximately thirty minutes later, two unidentified individuals drove to the scene, picked up the defendant, and drove away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Meanwhile, emergency personnel arrived at the scene to extinguish the fire and investigate its origins. They determined that the fire was started intentionally through the use of gasoline as an accelerant. A K-9 unit alerted to several areas of the house where an accelerant was used, and a partially melted gasoline container was found in the house. At about the same time, a tracking K-9 searched the neighborhood. Another neighbor, Debra Hirth, who had not witnessed the fire, alerted an officer to a pair of sandals smelling of gasoline that appeared to have been thrown onto\n   her property. The sandals were then presented to the other K-9 unit, which alerted to the sandals as containing accelerants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant returned to the scene while police were still there and voluntarily provided a written statement to police. She claimed to have been at her home in Danbury during the fire, but had left her car parked in her mother's garage. The following items were found inside her car: a cell phone; two televisions; trophies; frozen and canned food; a safe containing multiple valuables and documents, including the mother's marriage license and jewelry; and a pocketbook containing the defendant's\n   passport, multiple identification cards, and multiple social security cards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant later filed an insurance claim with Esurance for damage to her car. The defendant's mother filed an insurance claim with Homesite Insurance Company (Homesite) for damage to the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Carmen Febles and Juan Febles met with police on May 31, 2011, and gave statements concerning their encounter with the defendant on the day of the fire. Stratford police separately administered photographic arrays to Carmen Febles and Juan Febles. Both identified the defendant as the woman they encountered at the fire scene. Wakeley likewise gave a statement to police, and also identified the defendant in a photographic array as the woman she talked to at the fire scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In an amended information, the state charged the defendant with arson in the first degree as a principal and an accessory, conspiracy to commit arson in the first degree, and two counts of insurance fraud. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the pretrial identifications made by the Febleses and Wakeley, and sought to prevent them from making in-court identifications. The court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After a jury trial, the defendant was convicted on all counts. The defendant was sentenced to a total effective term of twenty years of incarceration, execution suspended after twelve years, and five years of probation. One of the conditions of the defendant's probation was that she pay $337,000 in restitution to the insurer of her mother's home, Homesite Insurance Company. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court improperly denied her motion to suppress identifications made by the Febleses and Wakeley. Specifically, the defendant argues that the identification procedure used by police was suggestive and unreliable, and, therefore, the trial court should have suppressed the pretrial and in-court identifications of the defendant by these witnesses. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to the present claim. As we stated previously in this opinion, prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence of pretrial identifications made by Carmen Febles, Juan Febles, and Wakeley. Additionally, she asked the court to prevent these witnesses from making in-court identifications. On October 29, 2015, the court held a hearing on the defendant's motion at which it heard testimony from two Stratford police officers, Edward Leary and Lawrence Overby, and a Milford police officer, Bruce Carney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   All three witnesses were shown arrays consisting of the same eight photographs appearing on a single sheet of paper, although the arrangement of the photographs in each array was different. The cover sheet attached to each array was\n   identical, each cover sheet reflected the witness' sworn statement that he or she had identified the person he or she had encountered at the fire scene, and each cover sheet contained instructions that had been initialed by each witness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Leary testified in relevant part that he administered the photographic array to Carmen Febles. He lacked a recollection of the circumstances surrounding the array, but, relying on the array and the cover sheet attached to it, he testified that he had administered the array to Carmen Febles, that he followed standard police procedures for administering the array, and that Carmen Febles had identified the defendant. He testified that it would have been the normal practice for the Stratford police to have had two officers present during the administration of the array. Moreover, Leary testified that standard police procedure would entail his reading the instructions on the cover sheet to the witness and having the witness sign his or her initials next to each instruction. He stated his belief that this procedure was followed with Carmen Febles because the cover sheet attached to the array reflected the witness' initials next to each instruction set forth thereon, and his signature appeared on the cover sheet, indicating that the witness swore before him that she under-stood the instructions and had identified the person selected from the array as the person she had encountered at the fire scene. Leary testified that the standard instructions indicated that a suspect may or may not be depicted in the array. Leary asserted that he would have followed protocol in administering the array and\n   would not have directed Carmen Febles to choose any particular photograph. Leary also testified that Carmen Febles indicated her understanding of the instructions, and had selected the defendant's photograph from those appearing in the array by circling the defendant's photograph and signing her name near it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Overby testified at the suppression hearing that he took part in administering the photographic array to Juan Febles. Overby testified that although another police officer, Jeff Nattrass, had administered the array to Juan Febles, he nonetheless \"notarized\" Juan Febles' statement that appears on the cover sheet of the array that the photograph he had selected was that of the person he had observed at the fire scene. Overby testified that, in accordance with standard police procedure, the cover sheet of the array reflects that Juan Febles had initialed next to each of the standard array instructions, one of which stated that \"[t]he person you saw may or not be in the photograph.\" Moreover, the array reflected that Juan Febles circled the defendant's photograph in the array and signed his name near the photograph. The cover sheet reflects the defendant's signature as well as Overby's signature, as evidence that Febles had made a sworn statement to him concerning the array.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Carney testified that, at the request of the Stratford police, he constructed the arrays shown to the Febleses. He was provided the defendant's name and date of birth. Carney retrieved the driver's license photograph of the defendant that the Milford police already had in their possession, and he searched for photographs in Milford's police database that depicted females who were similar in age, race, and facial features to the defendant. Carney then changed the defendant's photograph to black and white, so that its background matched the backgrounds in the seven other photographs in the\n   array consisting of mug shots in the Milford police database.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the hearing, the defendant argued that the array was unduly suggestive. She argued that only one other woman in the array appeared to be of the defendant's age, that the witnesses were shown the\n   photographs simultaneously as opposed to sequentially, that the defendant's photograph stood out because she was smiling, and that, in composing the array, Carney did not obtain photographs by relying on physical features identified by the witnesses, but instead relied on the driver's license photograph alone to select the other photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The state countered in relevant part that the array contained eight different photographs, that the defendant's photograph was not highlighted, that the witnesses were instructed that a suspect might not be in the array, and that the witnesses were not shown multiple arrays with the defendant's photograph appearing in each array. Also, although Carney used a photograph of the defendant that depicted her without curly hair, contrary to the description of the suspect by the witnesses, the state argued that all three witnesses were instructed that \"persons in the photos may not look exactly like they did on the date of the incident ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court, noting that \"the defendant ha[d] the burden of proving that the identification[s] resulted from an unconstitutional procedure,\" found that the defendant failed to prove that the arrays were suggestive. The court rejected the defendant's arguments that the array had highlighted the defendant and relied on the police officers' testimony concerning the procedures employed. The court stated that it did not agree with the defendant that her age and appearance were substantially different from those of the other persons\n   depicted in the array. The court, therefore, denied the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At trial, Carmen Febles, Juan Febles, and Wakeley testified about the manner in which they selected the defendant in photographic arrays that the police had administered to them prior to the time of trial, and the completed arrays were presented in evidence. Each of these witnesses testified that the police had provided them with instructions and that they had identified the person that they had encountered at the scene of the fire. Moreover, each of these witnesses made an in-court identification of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"In determining whether identification procedures violate a defendant's due process rights, the required inquiry is made on an ad hoc basis and is two-pronged: first, it must be determined whether the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive; and second, if it is found to have been so, it must be determined whether the identification was nevertheless reliable based on examination of the totality of the circumstances....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"In the seminal case of\n   <em>\n    Neil\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173155\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/188/\">\n    409 U.S. 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173155\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/188/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173155\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/188/\">\n    34 L.Ed.2d 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972) ], the [United States] Supreme Court explained the overarching concern that courts face when assessing a challenged identification procedure: It is ... apparent that the primary evil to be avoided is a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification....

First, we address the defendant's arguments that the arrays were composed in such a manner that they unfairly highlighted her. The court considered the defendant's argument that she appeared to be a different age than the majority of the people in the array. The court, however, found that the defendant did not appear \"to be substantially different in age or appearance from the other individuals who are in the array.... [T]he array was made in black and white so as not to highlight the defendant ....\" The defendant also argues that her photograph in the array is the only photograph that depicts someone smiling. To be unnecessarily suggestive, a variation must highlight the defendant to the point that it affected the witnesses' selection of the defendant.

After our own scrupulous review of the array, we are not persuaded that the defendant looks so different from the other women in the array so as to make the array unduly suggestive. Some, but not all, of the photographs in the arrays depict females with what may be described as neutral facial expressions. In her photograph, the defendant appears to be smiling slightly but, similar to the appearance of the other females depicted in the array, her teeth are not visible. Our careful examination of the arrays does not lead us to conclude that the defendant appears to be highlighted in the array or that she was dissimilar to the other females depicted therein. Thus, our examination of the arrays does not lead us to conclude that the court erred in finding that the photographs used were not so dissimilar that they rendered the arrays suggestive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The defendant also argues that there was an increased risk that the witnesses would select the defendant's photograph because the photographs were administered simultaneously instead of sequentially.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Marquez\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5764830\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/122/#p141\">\n    291 Conn. at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=967%20A.2d%2056\">\n    967 A.2d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , our Supreme Court opined that \"this continues to be an issue particularly ill suited to generic, bright line rules,\" and that \"[d]ue process does not require the suppression of a photographic identification that is not the product of a double-blind, sequential procedure.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

The evidence supported the finding that the defendant's mother filed an insurance claim for the property damage caused by her daughter. Prior to lighting the fire, the defendant stowed valuables belonging to both her and her mother in the trunk of her car. There was also evidence that the defendant's mother packed items in her own car and made arrangements to be away from her home when the defendant started the fire. This culmination of the circumstantial evidence could lead a reasonable jury to infer that the defendant did not start the fire simply to destroy her mother's home, but that the defendant's conduct was part of a plan to defraud and that she possessed the requisite intent when she started the fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The defendant also challenges her conspiracy conviction on the limited ground that the evidence was insufficient to establish that she possessed the requisite mens rea for the underlying crime. Because of our conclusion that the defendant acted with an intent to defraud, however, there is sufficient evidence to support the inference that the defendant possessed the requisite intent to commit the arson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We finally address the defendant's claim that there was insufficient evidence that she violated\n   \u00a7 53a-215 (a) (2). Specifically, she argues that the insurance fraud statute required the state to prove that she assisted or conspired with another to make or prepare a statement in connection with her mother's fraudulent insurance claim and that the state presented no evidence in this regard. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Section 53a-215 (a) provides in relevant part: \"A person is guilty of insurance fraud when the person, with the intent to injure, defraud or deceive any insurance company ... (2) assists, abets, solicits, or conspires with another to\n   <em>\n    prepare or make any written or oral statement\n   </em>\n   that is intended to be presented to any insurance company in connection with, or in support of, any application for any policy of insurance or any claim for payment or other benefit pursuant to such policy of insurance, knowing that such statement contains any false, incomplete, or misleading information concerning any fact or thing material to such application or claim for the purposes of defrauding such insurance company.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As there is no precedent from this court or our Supreme Court interpreting the meaning of \u00a7 53a-215 (a) (2), our resolution of this portion of the defendant's claim becomes an issue of statutory interpretation. \"The process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case .... When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case .... In seeking to determine that meaning ...

We agree with the state that this does not require evidence of physically filing the claim. We disagree with the state's argument, however, that the same evidence that supports the defendant's arson conviction can be used to uphold her insurance fraud conviction. Although this evidence supports the inference that the defendant intended to defraud when she started the fire, it does not reasonably support the inference that she engaged in the making or preparation of the actual statement given to Homesite. Ultimately, after a thorough review of the record, we conclude that there is no evidence that the defendant participated in the making or preparation of any statement provided to Homesite.
