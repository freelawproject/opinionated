Woermer, appeals from the judgment of foreclosure by sale rendered by the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, Sandra M. Hirsch, Trustee. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) granted the plaintiff's motion to strike his special defense of unconscionability and (2) denied his motion to\n   open. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff holds a note from the defendant, which is now in default, for the original principal amount of $73,200 secured by a mortgage on real property located in Branford. The mortgage was dated March 31, 2015, and recorded on the Branford land records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff initiated this foreclosure action on May 3, 2016. On October 5, 2016, the defendant filed an answer and three special defenses on the basis of lack of standing, invalid mortgage, and unconscionability. On October 11, 2016, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, and subsequently moved to strike the defendant's three special defenses on December 15, 2016. On January 30, 2017, the defendant filed an objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 31, 2017, the court granted the plaintiff's motion to strike. In striking the special defense of unconscionability, the court stated that \"the defendant's claim that the initial loan was 'outrageous and unconscionable' is without any statutory or case law basis. There is nothing in the record that indicates that the defendant was tricked or coerced into entering the original instrument.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in March, 2017. In support of the motion, the plaintiff argued that the defendant admitted liability on the complaint and had no valid special defense. On March 20, 2017, the court granted the plaintiff's motion and rendered judgment in her favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 15, 2017, the defendant filed a motion to open the judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the defendant filed a motion for permission to amend on May 15, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the defendant requested permission to file a proposed amended special defense and a counterclaim alleging a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 36a-746 et seq., the Connecticut Abusive Home Loan Lending Practices Act (act). In response, the plaintiff filed separate objections on May 25, 2017, to the defendant's motion to open and the motion to amend. At the hearing\n   on the motion to open and motion to amend, the plaintiff argued that the act does not provide a\n   private right of action; rather the act describes activities that are regulated by the Commissioner of Banking. Following the hearing, the court denied both motions on May 31, 2017. Thereafter, on June 2, 2017, the plaintiff filed a motion for judgment of foreclosure by sale, and on July 3, 2017, the court rendered a judgment of foreclosure by sale, determining the amount of debt and setting the sale date as September 2, 2017. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court improperly granted the plaintiff's motion to strike his special defense of unconscionability. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In his answer, the defendant claimed that the mortgage and note are unconscionable for one or more of the following reasons: \"(a) the attorney performing the closing is the same attorney foreclosing on the property; (b) the attorney performing the closing failed to provide a retainer agreement; (c) the loan is predatory for one or more of the following reasons: (1) the term is for just over [one] year, (2) the interest rate is 15 [percent], and (3) the points charged were in excess of 5 [percent].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the outset, we set forth our well-established standard of review. \"Because a motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court, our review of the court's ruling on [a motion to strike] is plenary.... A party wanting to contest the legal sufficiency of a special defense may do so by filing a motion to strike. The purpose of a special defense is to plead facts that are consistent with the allegations of the complaint but demonstrate, nonetheless, that the plaintiff has no cause of action.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    TD Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    M.J.

The defendant alleged that the attorney performing the closing is the same attorney foreclosing on the property and that the attorney performing the closing failed to provide a retainer agreement. To the extent that the allegations implicate procedural unconscionability, the defendant has not sufficiently alleged facts constituting unfair surprise that relate to the making, validity, or enforcement of the mortgage or the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As to substantive unconscionability, the defendant asserts that the loan is predatory because of the one year term with a 15 percent interest rate and points in the amount of 5 percent. These allegations, alone, however, are not sufficient to render the contract unenforceable on the ground of substantive unconscionability.

See\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Emigrant Mortgage Co.\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 3:04cv1767 (JCH),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204800725\">\n    2007 WL 4800725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *6 n.1 (D.

The financial circumstances of the borrower, the increased risk associated with a second mortgage, and the income-producing capacity of the mortgaged property are some of the questions of fact that might appropriately be explored to shed light on whether a designated interest rate is or is not unconscionable.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Hamm\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1951377\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/180/491/#p495\">\n    180 Conn. 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 495,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=429%20A.2d%20946\">\n    429 A.2d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Accordingly, if a bald allegation of an annual or default interest rate of 18 percent is not enough to establish unconscionability, it follows that the mere allegation of an annual interest rate of 15 percent likewise is not enough to establish unconscionability. The other alleged predatory terms, including the points \"in excess of 5 [percent]\" and the term of the loan for \"just over [one] year,\" do not tip the scale to support a defense on substantive unconscionability.

Although a motion to open can be filed within four months of a judgment ... the filing of such a motion does not extend the appeal period for challenging the merits of the underlying judgment unless filed within the [twenty day period provided by Practice Book \u00a7 63-1 ].... When a motion to open is filed more than twenty days after the judgment, the appeal from the denial of that motion can test only whether the trial court abused its discretion in failing to open the judgment and not the propriety of the merits of the underlying judgment....
