On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court (1) erroneously computed\n   his presumptive minimum child support obligation and (2) abused its discretion by ordering the defendant to pay nonmodifiable unallocated alimony and support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the defendant and, accordingly, we reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.\n   The following facts, as found by the trial court, and procedural history are relevant to our consideration of the issues raised on appeal. The plaintiff and the defendant were married on July 19, 1997. They are the parents of three minor children. By complaint dated February 26, 2014, the plaintiff sought, inter alia, dissolution of the parties' marriage, custody of the minor children, and temporary and permanent alimony and child support. On June 21, 2016, following a trial over several days on financial and property issues, the court dissolved the parties' marriage. In its memorandum of decision, the court ordered, inter alia, that the defendant pay unallocated alimony and support to the plaintiff in the amount of $12,500 per month \"until the death of either party, the [p]laintiff's remarriage, or November\n   3, 2025, whichever shall occur first.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The duration and the amount to be paid were nonmodifiable by either party. The court indicated that it was deviating from the child support guidelines' (guidelines) presumptive support amount of $752 per week \"based on the extraordinary disparity in income and the provision of alimony.\" The defendant then filed the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before addressing the merits of the defendant's claims, we first set forth the applicable standard of review in domestic relations matters. \"[T]his court will not disturb trial court orders unless the trial court has abused its legal discretion or its findings have no reasonable basis in the facts.... As has often been explained, the foundation for this standard is that the trial court is in a clearly advantageous position to assess the personal factors significant to a domestic relations case.... In determining whether a trial court has abused its broad discretion in domestic relations matters, we allow every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action.... Notwithstanding the great deference accorded the trial court in dissolution proceedings, a trial court's ruling ... may be reversed if, in the exercise of its discretion, the trial court applies the wrong standard of law.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    LeSueur\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    LeSueur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489835\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/32/#p774\">\n    172 Conn.

Specifically, the defendant argues that the court erred in calculating his presumptive child support obligation on the basis of his earning capacity rather than his actual earnings. He contends that the court did not calculate the amount of child support that would have been required based upon actual income, nor did it make a finding\n   that application of the guidelines would be inequitable. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this issue. In its initial memorandum of decision, the court ordered the defendant to pay $12,500 to the plaintiff each month as unallocated alimony and support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court did not indicate whether this award was based on the defendant's actual earnings or earning capacity. The court attached a worksheet for the Connecticut Child Support and Arrearage Guidelines (worksheet), prepared by the Connecticut Judicial Branch, to its memorandum of decision. The worksheet indicated that the defendant's gross weekly income was $5288,\n   or approximately $275,000 per year, and his net weekly income was $3392, or $176,384 per year. On December 6, 2016, the defendant filed a motion for articulation asking the court to articulate, inter alia, the bases on which the court completed the worksheet. Specifically, the defendant asked the court to articulate the factual basis on which it determined that his gross weekly income was $5288, the factual basis for each deduction from gross weekly income and the factual basis for its determination that his net weekly income was $3392. The court denied the motion, and the defendant filed a motion for review. This court thereafter granted review but denied the requested relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In his principal appellate brief, the defendant argued that the court's erroneous calculation of his gross and net income lacked evidentiary support. In response, the plaintiff argued that the court's income findings were not based on the defendant's actual income, but were based on his earning capacity, and that these findings were supported by the record. At oral argument before this court, we questioned both sides regarding whether the trial court's financial award was based on the defendant's actual earnings or earning capacity. Following oral argument, we ordered the court to articulate whether the finding of weekly gross income of $5288, as recorded on the worksheet, represented a finding as to the defendant's actual income or the earning capacity and the factual basis for that finding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its articulation, the court indicated that the gross weekly income amount of $5288 reflected on the worksheet represented the defendant's earning capacity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Section 46b-215a-5c (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides in relevant part that \"[t]he current support ... amounts calculated under [the regulations] ... are presumed to be the correct amounts to be ordered. The presumption regarding each such amount may be rebutted by a specific finding on the record that such amount would be inequitable or inappropriate in a particular case....

Following an articulation by the trial court and supplemental briefing by the parties, the defendant argued that the court erroneously computed his presumptive child support obligation and that the factual basis articulated by the trial court does not support its findings as to the defendant's gross and net annual earning capacity. Because we conclude that the trial court erroneously computed the defendant's presumptive child support obligation by relying on his earning capacity rather than his actual earnings, we reverse the judgment and remand the case to the trial court for reconsideration of all of its financial orders. We, therefore, need not consider the defendant's additional claims pertaining to the calculation of the financial orders. We will, however, consider the defendant's claim that the court abused its discretion by ordering the defendant to pay nonmodifiable unallocated alimony and support, as this issue is likely to arise on remand.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    November 3, 2025, is the eighteenth birthday of the parties' youngest child.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    \"Even though an unallocated order incorporates alimony and child support without delineating specific amounts for each component, the unallocated order, along with other financial orders, necessarily includes a portion attributable to child support in an amount sufficient to satisfy the guidelines.\"\n    <em>\n     Tomlinson\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Tomlinson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Conn.%20539\">\n     305 Conn. 539\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 558,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20A.3d%20112\">\n     46 A.3d 112\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2012).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    This court's order stated: \"Pursuant to Practice Book [\u00a7\u00a7] 61-10 and 60-5, [this] court hereby orders the trial court,\n    <em>\n     Tindill\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     J\n    </em>\n    .... to articulate: (1) whether the finding of weekly gross income of $5288, as recorded on court exhibit B (worksheet for the Connecticut Child Support and Arrearage Guidelines), represented a finding as to the actual income or the earning capacity of the defendant ... and (2) the factual basis for that finding.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The court further stated that review and consideration of the following factors formed the factual basis for its finding that the defendant could realistically be expected to earn the gross and net income amounts on the worksheet: the defendant's age, the defendant's testimony that he was in good health, the parties' testimony that the defendant graduated from Pace University with degrees in math and physics, the defendant's testimony that he has insurance licenses in property, casualty, life and health and that he has passed some actuary exams, the defendant's testimony regarding his work history, purchase and ownership of insurance businesses, and formation of insurance businesses, the defendant's financial affidavits, the parties' worksheets, certain exhibits filed by the defendant and the testimony from both parties and Robert Pintucci, the defendant's accountant, regarding the parties' finances.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The plaintiff concedes that, pursuant to\n    <em>\n     Fox\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Fox\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20Conn.%20App.%20611\">\n     152 Conn.

Following the court's articulation, we ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs.

Although General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a) authorizes the court to modify support orders \"[u]nless and to the extent that the decree precludes modification,\" the manner in which the trial court should exercise its discretion under the statute to issue nonmodifiable child support orders is not articulated and remains unclear. The need for adequate financial support of minor children from their parents is an established public policy. See\n    <em>\n     Sablosky\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Sablosky\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"357734\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/258/713/#p721\">\n     258 Conn. 713\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 721,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=784%20A.2d%20890\">\n     784 A.2d 890\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2001). In light of this public policy, a question remains as to what extent a trial court may issue a child support order that remains nonmodifiable even in the event of a substantial, or, for example, a catastrophic, change in the circumstances of a parent, a child or both. Stated differently, a question continues to exist as to whether the trial court, having the authority under \u00a7 46b-86 (a) to issue a nonmodifiable child support order, reasonably exercises its authority under the statute by issuing a child support order that precludes modification even in the event of a substantial change of circumstances adversely affecting the adequacy of financial support for the child.
