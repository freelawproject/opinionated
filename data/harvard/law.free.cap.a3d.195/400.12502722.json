On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the board improperly: (1) affirmed the commissioner's finding and dismissal; (2) affirmed the commissioner's denial of the plaintiff's motion to correct the finding; and (3) denied the plaintiff's motion to submit additional evidence. We affirm the decision of the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, found by the commissioner or otherwise undisputed in the record, and procedural history are relevant to the plaintiff's appeal. The plaintiff worked as an eligibility service specialist for the defendant from October, 1986 through December 9, 2010. The plaintiff worked in the defendant's New Haven office. During her period of employment, she worked eight hours a day, five days a week. Her responsibilities included determining a client's eligibility for cash assistance, food stamps, and medical benefits. Her position required a \"great deal of walking back and forth on the [intake] line where she met applicants.\" Although work on the intake line consumed half of her workday, it did not constitute a significant portion of her job duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 1990, the plaintiff was involved in a motor vehicle accident that was not related to her work. As a result of this accident, she sustained disc herniations to her cervical spine and lumbar spine. In 2006, the plaintiff began treatment with Dr. Craig D. O'Connell, a chiropractor. In October, 2008, the plaintiff was involved in a second motor vehicle accident that was not related to her work, which exacerbated her preexisting cervical and lumbar spinal pain and caused her to miss work\n   until March, 2009. In December, 2008, the plaintiff began treatment with Dr. Michael E. Opalak, a neurosurgeon, on referral from her primary care physician, Dr. Sudipta Dey, regarding her injuries stemming from both motor vehicle accidents. Dr. Opalak noted that the recent accident seemed to have worsened some of her lumbar symptoms and increased her neck discomfort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 5, 2009, Dr. Opalak reviewed the plaintiff's imaging and noted that she had some element of disc disease at the lower three levels of the lumbar spine, but most of her symptoms were related to her cervical complaints. Dr. Opalak recommended conservative measures and epidural injections before considering surgery. The next day, Dr. O'Connell drafted a letter from the plaintiff on his letterhead, stating: \"I have a history of cervical disc degeneration and herniations dating back to 1990. I felt at that time and still feel that cervical disc surgery is [too] risky. I have advised neurosurgeon, Michael Opalak that I am not going to have cervical surgery and I would like to continue with conservative chiropractic care which has always helped me in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Dr. O'Connell has informed me of the possible complications of my cervical spinal herniations and canal stenosis. Among these are possible drop foot, paralysis, and bowel/bladder dysfunction. He also advised if I experienced any of these complications or any other questionable symptoms to contact Dr. [Opalak] (neurosurgeon) or go to the emergency room. (Immediately).\" The plaintiff signed the letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 4, 2009, the plaintiff filed a request with the defendant pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., to be taken off the intake line permanently and for an ergonomic workstation. She requested, inter alia, a new desk and headset. On December 31, Ray Primini of the\n   Department of Administrative Services conducted an evaluation of the plaintiff's workstation. Primini recommended that the defendant provide the plaintiff with an adjustable high-back chair with arms and lumbar support to accommodate someone of her height.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Primini also recommended that the defendant provide the plaintiff with a document holder to reduce the need for her to look down. He did not recommend that the defendant provide a new headset, as the defendant had already provided the plaintiff with one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Primini determined that rather than providing the plaintiff a new desk, the plaintiff's workstation could be rearranged by placing her computer tower and monitor on already existing surfaces, and her keyboard on the existing desk surface. Primini rearranged a table and desk and placed the computer equipment in a way that fit the plaintiff in an ergonomic fashion. On March 10, 2010, a new high-back desk chair was delivered to and signed for by the plaintiff. The defendant also provided the plaintiff with a document holder, which could be adjusted from the back to accommodate vertical and horizontal documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 9, 2010,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiff filed a first report of injury,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   complaining of extreme discomfort in the cervical and lumbar spinal regions beginning approximately six months earlier. She attributed her injury to lack of proper ergonomics at her workstation. On January 11, 2011, the plaintiff returned to Dr. Opalak after not having seen him for two years. Dr. Opalak was concerned by how the plaintiff's condition had progressed, as she presented with much more neck and\n   back pain, had difficulty rising from a sitting position, and had difficultly feeling her feet. The plaintiff expressed fear of surgery. Dr. Opalak recommended that, for safety's sake, the plaintiff have a discectomy. On April 1, 2011, Dr. O'Connell disabled the plaintiff from work due to the absence of a proper ergonomic work environment for her chronic spinal condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 24, 2011, the plaintiff consulted Dr. Khalid Abbed for a second opinion about the need for surgery. He recommended a cervical decompression surgery prior to addressing the issues with the plaintiff's lumbar spine. On August 3, Dr. Abbed again recommended the surgery, but at the plaintiff's request, agreed to wait six months and reassess. On December 20, Dr. Abbed again recommended surgery, but agreed to wait for approval because a workers' compensation hearing was scheduled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 26, 2011, the commissioner approved a jurisdictional voluntary agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The injury was identified as a December 9, 2010 lumbar neuropathy and cervical myelopathy injury due to sitting, which caused an aggravation of prior injuries. Drs. O'Connell and Opalak were listed as treating physicians. Also on September 26, the commissioner approved a voluntary agreement in which Dr. Opalak awarded the plaintiff a 30 percent permanent partial disability rating\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (PPD) for the December 9 cervical myelopathy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiff then requested a change in physician because she believed that Dr. Opalak was rude to her after she indicated that she did not want surgery on her cervical spine because she feared paralysis. On January 26, 2012, Commissioner Scott A. Barton appointed Dr. Abbed as the authorized treating physician. On March 26, a voluntary agreement was approved, in which Dr. Opalak awarded the plaintiff a 5 percent PPD rating for the December 9, 2010 lumbar neuropathy. At a July 23,\n   2012 informal hearing, Commissioner Barton noted that the plaintiff could put the surgery through her group health insurance and that the defendant would issue a form 43 to disclaim responsibility for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 19, 2012, Dr. Jacob Mushaweh, a neurosurgeon, performed a medical examination of the plaintiff for the defendant. In his opinion, surgery at the C5-C6 level was reasonable, while surgery at the C6-C7 level amounted to a judgment call. He concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that the lack of ergonomics at work played any role in the plaintiff's need for surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 23, 2013, Dr. Abbed performed an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery on the plaintiff. Subsequently, Dr. John Reilly, a plastic surgeon, performed a bilateral trigger thumb release on both of the plaintiff's hands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Formal hearings were held before the commissioner on September 22, 2014, October 23, 2014, November 18, 2014, January 12, 2015, April 7, 2015, and June 29, 2015. At the beginning of the September 22 hearing, the parties agreed that the issues involved compensability of the plaintiff's cervical spine fusion surgery, total disability benefits,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   form 36,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   form 43,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiff's motion to preclude,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, if the commissioner found compensability, lien reimbursement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record was closed on November 9, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 5, 2016, the commissioner issued a finding and dismissal. He found that the plaintiff \"suffered spinal injuries in separate non-work-related motor vehicle accidents in 1990 and 2008.\" He found that Dr. Opalak and Dr. Abbed recommended surgery \"long before\" the plaintiff filed her workers' compensation claim and the\n   formal hearing on that claim, and that her \"fear of undergoing surgery was well documented\" by her treating physicians and her own testimony. He further found that the plaintiff was not credible, and\n   concluded that she failed to establish that \"the aggravation of her cervical and lumbar spine injuries was a substantial contributing factor to the need for surgery that had been recommended for several years.\" He concluded that the defendant \"did not unreasonably contest the [plaintiff's] request for cervical fusion surgery,\" and that the plaintiff failed \"in her burden of persuasion to establish [that] the cervical spine fusion surgery is compensable.\" He also concluded that the plaintiff failed to establish causation as to her bilateral thumb surgery. The commissioner denied and dismissed the plaintiff's claim for medical and indemnity benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff appealed to the board, arguing that the commissioner \"failed to credit what she considers to be uncontested expert testimony supporting her claim, and this constitutes reversible error.\" The board rejected this argument and affirmed the commissioner's finding and dismissal. The board concluded: \"We are not persuaded by this argument and find that the trial commissioner's decision is supported by probative evidence that he found persuasive and credible, and a determination by the commissioner that the [plaintiff's] expert witnesses were not persuasive.\" The board further concluded: \"It was the [plaintiff's] burden to persuade the trial commissioner that her workplace conditions were a substantial contributing factor in her need for surgery and resultant medical conditions. We believe that on the record herein a reasonable fact\n   finder could be left unpersuaded.\" This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiff first claims that the board improperly affirmed the commissioner's finding and dismissal. Specifically, she argues that the commissioner failed to accept \"undisputed testimony\" of the plaintiff's primary care physician, Dr. Dey,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   which conclusively established that: (1) the plaintiff has been disabled from work since December 10, 2010; (2) the PPD of 30 percent of her cervical spine, as stated in the January 6, 2012 voluntary agreement, was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff to be disabled from work; (3) the PPD of 5 percent of her lumbar spine, as stated in the March 26, 2012 voluntary agreement, was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff to be disabled from work; (4) the combination of the 30 percent disability of the cervical spine and 5 percent disability of the lumbar spine was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff to be disabled from work; and (5) the PPD of 30 percent of the cervical spine was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff to undergo cervical spine surgery. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. At the April 7, 2015 formal hearing before Commissioner Jack R. Goldberg, the plaintiff entered into evidence the complete transcript of the deposition testimony of Dr. Dey. Dr. Dey, who\n   is board certified in internal medicine, testified about his treatment of the plaintiff, which began in 2002. Dr. Dey testified that he treated the plaintiff for cervical myelopathy, cervical disc herniation, lumbar disc herniation, and lumbar neuropathy.\n   He testified that as early as 2003, he noted when he examined the plaintiff that \"she had all the signs and symptoms of cervical myelopathy, and I actually recorded in my notes, she had hyperreflexia, both sides. And I wrote it down, 'Cervical disc herniation with probable cervical myelopathy. Needs intermittent traction. Neuropathic pain. Patient does not want neurosurgical intervention.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   He testified that, in his opinion, the plaintiff is totally disabled from gainful employment. He testified that \"there is a probable relationship with a reasonable degree of medical probability the 30 percent impairment was a substantial factor ... [i]n being totally disabled from gainful employment.\" When questioned as to whether the 5 percent PPD of the plaintiff's lumbar spine was a substantial factor in \"bringing about\" the plaintiff's disability, Dr. Dey responded, \"[p]robably, yes.\" He further testified that the combination of the disabilities of the lumbar and cervical spine \"made her completely disabled.\" With respect to whether the 30 percent PPD of the plaintiff's cervical spine was a substantial factor in causing her to undergo cervical spine surgery, Dr. Dey testified that the plaintiff \"had some degree of neck pain as well as cervical disc herniation, for a long time, which got exacerbated over a period of time. She also sustained a motor vehicle accident in between, and subsequently her condition progressed so much that she needed surgical intervention.... It was related.... It is related, probably related. I cannot-probably related, yes.\" When questioned about a prior opinion that he gave attributing the plaintiff's permanent disability to her work-related injury,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Dey testified that it was not based on his own certainty. Rather, it was based on the opinion of Dr. O'Connell\n   \"[t]o some degree.\" In Dr. Dey's opinion, however, the lack of an ergonomic workstation was more likely to have exacerbated the plaintiff's preexisting injuries than not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The commissioner, in his finding and dismissal, credited Dr. Dey's \"opinion ... that the [plaintiff] in 2003 exhibited the symptoms of cervical myelopathy and displayed neuropathic pain, cervical disc herniation, and did not want neurosurgical intervention.\" He found, however, that Dr. Dey's opinion \"attributing the [plaintiff's] need for surgery to the lack of proper ergonomics at the workplace\" was not credible, as it was grounded in speculation or conjecture. He credited the opinion of Dr. Opalak that the plaintiff required cervical fusion surgery in 2008. He also found Dr. Mushaweh's testimony \"credible and persuasive that the recommended cervical fusion surgery was reasonable but not attributable to the lack of an ergonomic workstation.\" He also credited Dr. Abbed's opinion regarding the plaintiff's need for cervical fusion surgery. He also credited and found persuasive Dr. Abbed's statement that he could not \"say that [a] failure to use an ergonomic workstation directly caused the [plaintiff's] cervical spine condition,\" but found his statement that it \"probably aggravated a preexisting condition and increased her level of discomfort\" to be grounded in speculation and conjecture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On appeal to the board, the plaintiff argued that \"the trial commissioner failed to credit what she considers to be uncontested expert testimony supporting her\n   claim, and this constitutes reversible error.\" She argued that, pursuant to this court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Bode\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Mason Contractors, The Learning Corridor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262870\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/130/672/\">\n    130 Conn.

The board concluded that \"[a]fter reviewing the totality of Dr. Dey's testimony, we are satisfied that a reasonable fact finder could have reached a conclusion that it was insufficiently reliable to support the [plaintiff's] position,\" and noted that a commissioner is not obligated to find a plaintiff's expert persuasive and reliable and, therefore, could have \"considered all [of the relevant evidence of her treaters] and found it less persuasive than the evidence presented by the [defendant].\" The board noted the commissioner's conclusion that Dr. Dey's opinions were \"substantially influenced and derivative of\" Dr. O'Connell's opinions, which the commissioner declined to credit and found unpersuasive. The board further concluded that although the plaintiff characterized Dr. Dey's opinions as \"uncontroverted,\" both Dr. Abbed and Dr. Mushaweh offered differing opinions, and the commissioner \"found Dr. Mushaweh in particular credible and persuasive on the issue of workplace causation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review and legal principles. \"A party aggrieved by a commissioner's decision to grant or deny an award may appeal to the board pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301.... The appropriate standard applicable to the board when reviewing a decision of a commissioner is well established.

[T]he test of proximate cause is whether the [employer's] conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about the [employee's] injuries.... [Our Supreme Court] has defined proximate cause as [a]n actual cause that is a substantial\n   factor in the resulting harm .... The question of proximate causation ... belongs to the trier of fact because causation is essentially a factual issue.... It becomes a conclusion of law only when the mind of a fair and reasonable [person] could reach only one conclusion; if there is room for a reasonable disagreement the question is one to be determined by the trier as a matter of fact.... [W]hether a sufficient causal connection exists between the employment and a subsequent injury is ... a question of fact for the commissioner. It is axiomatic that, in reaching that determination, the commissioner often is required to draw an inference from what he has found to be the\n   basic facts.

The commissioner specifically credited and relied on portions of Dr. Abbed's and Dr. Mushaweh's testimony, and statements that differed from the opinions of Dr. Dey in determining that the plaintiff's claimed December 9, 2010 injuries were not a substantial factor in her medical conditions and need for surgery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   That\n   evidence included Dr.\n   Mushaweh's opinion, after examining the plaintiff, that \"there was simply no evidence to suggest that the lack of ergonomics at work played any role in the need for surgery,\" and Dr. Abbed's \"reluctance to state that failure to use an ergonomic workstation directly caused the [plaintiff's] cervical spine condition ....\" Although Dr. Dey opined that the plaintiff's need for surgery was attributable to the lack of proper ergonomics at the workplace, as the commissioner found and the board noted, \"cervical fusion surgery was recommended by Dr. Opalak and Dr. Abbed long before the [plaintiff] filed the present claim and before the voluntary agreements were issued, and was continually delayed by her because of fear of undergoing the surgery....

On February 3, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion to correct the finding. In her motion, the plaintiff requested that the commissioner amend his findings by adding forty-two findings to the commissioner's findings of fact. On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claims only that the commissioner erred in denying seven of her forty-two proposed corrections, specifically, those set forth in paragraphs thirteen through sixteen and eighteen through twenty of her motion. Those paragraphs proposed the addition of the following findings: (13) \"[a]s the result of the aforementioned compensable injuries to the [plaintiff's] cervical spine and lumbar spine, the [plaintiff] has been disabled from work from [December 10, 2010] through the present time\"; (14) \"[the 30 percent PPD] of the cervical spine was a substantial factor in causing the [plaintiff's] disability from work\"; (15) \"[the 5 percent PPD] of the lumbar spine was a substantial factor in causing the [plaintiff's] disability from work\"; (16) \"[t]he combination of the permanent disability of the cervical spine and the permanent disability of the lumbar spine was a substantial factor in causing the [plaintiff's] disability from work\"; (18) \"[t]he 30 [percent] impairment of the cervical spine was a substantial factor in causing the cervical anterior [discectomy ] and\n   fusion surgery\"; (19) \"[a]s the result of that surgery the [plaintiff] incurred medical bills\"; and (20) \"[t]he [plaintiff] had no change in her spinal condition after the surgery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The plaintiff also requested the modification or deletion of four additional findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 9, 2016, the commissioner denied the motion to correct in its entirety. On appeal to the board, the board characterized the plaintiff's motion as an effort to \"substitute findings supportive of compensability for the findings reached by Commissioner Goldberg\" and concluded that the commissioner properly denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review and legal principles that guide our analysis. \"The finding of the commissioner cannot be changed unless the record discloses that the finding includes facts found without evidence or fails to include material facts which are admitted or undisputed....

The plaintiff cannot expect the commissioner to substitute the plaintiff's conclusions for his own. Furthermore, this claim amounts to little more than a restatement of her previous claim, which we already have rejected, in part I of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Because the findings of the commissioner were supported by the evidence and included all material facts as determined by him, we conclude that the board properly affirmed the commissioner's denial of the plaintiff's motion to correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The plaintiff finally claims that the board improperly denied her motion to submit additional evidence. Specifically,\n   she argues that this evidence, which was \"discovered in response to a freedom of information request that [she] made ... more than nine months after the evidence was closed,\" would have \"cast [a] new light upon the credibility\" of a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. After the plaintiff's September 4, 2009 ADA request for an ergonomic workstation, Primini recommended that the defendant provide the plaintiff with an adjustable high-back chair with arms and lumbar support. The defendant's employee, Haysteen Nickelson, who was responsible for the purchase of the new chair, arranged for a new high-back desk chair to be delivered to the plaintiff. The new high-back desk chair was delivered to and signed for by the plaintiff on March 10, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At the January 12, 2015 hearing, the plaintiff testified that the chair was broken when delivered to her. She testified that the chair was not a \"[brand new high-back] chair .... It was a broken chair they brought from another district office.\" She further testified that Nickelson \"came down and they removed the chair.... They took and told me they were going to order me a brand new chair. Which I waited from March until I left in December, and it never came, I never got anything.\" She testified that when the broken chair was provided, she \"was given a blank piece of paper to sign that was matched separately to the purchase order to make it appear as if she approved the delivery of the chair.\" She further testified that after the broken chair was delivered, Nickelson procured another chair for her from a different district office of the defendant. On November 9, 2015, the commissioner\n   closed the record. On January 5, 2016, the commissioner issued his finding\n   and dismissal. The commissioner found that the plaintiff was not credible, and found the testimony of both Primini and Nickelson to be \"credible and persuasive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On April 28, 2016 the plaintiff filed a motion requesting that the board hear additional evidence or testimony. In her motion, the plaintiff contended that the additional evidence would \"[raise] questions about the accuracy of Ms. Nickelson's testimony.\" The additional evidence consisted of: (1) a December 17, 2010 invoice for a new desk chair from Insalco Corporation, which she obtained through a April 6, 2016 freedom of information request, which showed a \"due date\" of January 16, 2011; (2) e-mails between employees of the defendant concerning her ergonomic accommodations; and (3) an April, 2016 correspondence from the plaintiff's counsel to the defendant's counsel concerning the plaintiff's chair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The plaintiff also attached to her motion an affidavit, in which she averred that she did not receive a high-back chair. In support of this, she noted that: (1) the invoice stated that the high-back office chair was delivered on December 17, 2010, eight days after her last day of work on December 9, (2) e-mails, attached to the motion as exhibit C, showed a department employee, Deborah A. McMullen, writing, \"I was verbally informed that the chair brought down on [March 10, 2010] was not a high-back chair,\" and (3) on April 27, 2016, counsel sent a letter to the defendant's counsel concerning the plaintiff's chair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The defendant subsequently filed an objection to the plaintiff's motion. It argued, inter alia, that because the documents which the plaintiff sought to offer as additional evidence predated the formal hearings, the plaintiff could have offered them in the proceedings before the commissioner before resting her case. The\n   defendant contended that the plaintiff did not \"provide any reason why the additional evidence is material or why it was not presented to the commissioner.\" The defendant further argued that even if the proposed additional evidence were considered by the board, that because the majority of the commissioner's findings were based on medical records and testimony, and only a small majority of those findings related to the plaintiff's desk chair, \"it does not negate or alter the medical evidence upon which the commissioner relied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addressing the motion in its memorandum of decision, the board observed: \"The [plaintiff] argues that additional evidence is warranted on the issue of the ergonomic chair provided to her because contradictory evidence was presented by Ms. [Nickelson] at the June 29, 2015 hearing which she wishes to challenge. We note that the [plaintiff] did not object to this witness' testimony at that hearing or advise the trial commissioner at the conclusion of her testimony that rebuttal evidence would be proffered to refute her narrative and documentation. Instead, counsel for the [plaintiff] agreed with the trial commissioner [that] the record was complete and the parties would proceed to brief the case.\" The board agreed with the defendant that the plaintiff lacked sufficient justification for the admission of additional evidence, and also concluded that, because it found in the record \"no discussion to the effect that the evidence the [plaintiff] presented at that time was incomplete, we believe admission of this evidence at this juncture would be an effort to try the case in an inappropriate piecemeal fashion.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The board sustained the defendant's objection and denied the motion to submit additional evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review and legal principles that guide our analysis. \"The\n   board is statutorily authorized to review additional evidence, not submitted to the commissioner, in limited circumstances. General Statutes \u00a7 31-301(b) provides: The appeal [from the commissioner] shall be heard by the ... [b]oard as provided in [ General Statutes \u00a7] 31-280b. The ... [b]oard shall hear the appeal on the record of the hearing before the commissioner, provided, if it is shown to the satisfaction of the board that additional evidence or testimony is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceedings before the commissioner, the ... [b]oard may hear additional evidence or testimony. The procedure that parties must employ in order to request the board to review additional evidence is provided in \u00a7 31-301-9 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which provides: If any party to an appeal shall allege that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceedings before the commissioner, he shall by written motion request an opportunity to present such evidence or testimony to the compensation review division, indicating in such motion the nature of such evidence or testimony, the basis of the claim of materiality, and the reasons why it was not presented in the proceedings before the commissioner. The compensation review division may act on such motion with or without a hearing, and if justice so requires may order a certified copy of the evidence for the use of the employer, the employee or both, and such certified copy shall be made a part of the record on such appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"Thus, in order to request the board to review additional evidence, the movant must include in the motion (1) the nature of the evidence, (2) the basis of the claim that the evidence is material and (3) the reason why it was not presented to the commissioner....

This court, in concluding that the board reasonably could have concluded that the plaintiff had not demonstrated that he had good reasons for not presenting such evidence to the commissioner, noted the board's finding that \"the plaintiff had not established\n   that the evidence could not have been obtained at the time of the original hearing.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=980%20A.2d%20347\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Here, the plaintiff submitted her freedom of information request in April, 2016, five months after the commissioner closed the record in November, 2015.

Although the commissioner did not explicitly find that the plaintiff was not totally disabled from work, logic dictates that by finding that the claimed December 9, 2010 injury was not a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's need for surgery, he implicitly found that the plaintiff was not totally disabled as the result of a compensable, work-related injury. Put another way, the December 9 injury, if not a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's need for surgery, also could not be a substantial factor in causing her to be totally disabled.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The plaintiff argues, as she did on appeal to the board, that this court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Bode\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Connecticut Mason Contractors, The Learning Corridor\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262870\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/130/672/\">\n     130 Conn.

There were two vocational reports dated August, 2004, and July, 2008, both of which stated that the plaintiff\n    <em>\n     was not\n    </em>\n    employable. The commissioner also had before him the job search forms showing the plaintiff's failed attempts to secure employment. Despite this evidence, he (1) made no conclusions as to the reliability of the vocational reports or regarding the plaintiff's employability, (2) ignored the August, 2004 vocational report and the job search forms and (3) concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to total temporary disability benefits.\" (Emphasis in original.)

Here, as we have concluded, Dr. Dey's testimony was not \"undisputed ....\" Dr. Abbed disputed Dr. Dey's testimony, and Dr. Mushaweh disputed Dr. Dey's testimony. This was not a case where there was \"no evidence\" from which the commissioner could conclude that the plaintiff's claimed December 9, 2010 injury was not a substantial factor in her medical conditions and need for surgery. This is also not like\n    <em>\n     Bode\n    </em>\n    , where the commissioner failed to make findings with respect to material pieces of evidence. The finding and dismissal contained an abundance of well reasoned findings, which are supported by the record.
