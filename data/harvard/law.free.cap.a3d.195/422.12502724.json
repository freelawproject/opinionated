On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court (1) abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal from the denial of his second amended petition, and (2) improperly concluded that he failed to establish that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. We conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal and, accordingly, dismiss the petitioner's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of the petitioner's appeal.

The [petitioner] grabbed her by her ponytail causing her to fall face down on the side of the road. The [petitioner] then engaged in a struggle with the victim that, according to testimony, lasted approximately five minutes. The [petitioner] wrapped his arms around her, touching her breasts, and tried to pick her up. The victim fought back and screamed. The [petitioner] covered her mouth to suppress her screams, told her to shut up, and attempted to pick her up. The victim began 'heaving,' unable to catch her breath. The [petitioner] released the victim, backed away, and asked her if she was okay. The victim responded, 'just leave,' and, 'please leave.' When the [petitioner] turned and walked toward his truck, the victim ran into a wooded area and hid. The victim attempted to call her mother from her cell phone, but was unable to reach her.

He argues, however, that it was improper for the court to instruct the jury regarding the underlying uncharged assault. The petitioner's basis for this claim is that, because trial counsel was applying new law, he was uncertain if\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   was going to remain good law and should not have allowed the proposed instruction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The habeas court found that the \"decision by [trial counsel] to accept the jury instruction on kidnapping, as given by the trial judge, was intentional and the\n   product of much thought and discussion among the trial judge, prosecutor, and [trial counsel],\" and, therefore, was not outside of reasonably acceptable professional conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner has offered no expert\n   testimony or sound legal theory to support his claim.

Prior to the petitioner's\n   criminal trial, trial counsel moved to adopt the suppression motions of the petitioner's previous defense attorney.

At the criminal trial, law enforcement officers testified that they visited the petitioner's home on August 11, 2007, at approximately 4 p.m., to interview him regarding the complaint. En route to the petitioner's residence they did not use sirens or emergency lights. Trooper Theresa Freeman testified that \"[they] parked ... on the opposite side of the street back from the house.... [T]wo troopers [were directed] to go around the back .... [They] walked up ... to the front door [where] there was a female sitting on a chair ... [they] could see through the window. [They] knocked, [and] she came to the door .... [Trooper Freeman asked] 'Is [the petitioner] home?' \" The woman then called to the petitioner, who then came to the door. \"Trooper Uliano asked him to step outside on the porch ... which he did.... [Then Trooper Freeman] looked right at him [and] said, '[d]id you put your hands on a fifteen year old girl?'... [At which point], [h]e looked at [Trooper Freeman], turned his head to the side and said, 'I didn't\n   know she was fifteen,' and dropped his head.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"In order to establish that he was entitled to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings [the petitioner] must show that he was in custody when he made the statements and that he made the statements in response to police questioning.... In assessing whether a person is in custody for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , the ultimate inquiry is whether a reasonable person in the [petitioner's] position would believe that there was a restraint on [his] freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest....

The habeas court found that \"[trial counsel] well knew that the petitioner ... had personal interaction and experience with state troopers regarding such inquires in the past that never resulted in a loss of his freedom of movement. Under these circumstances, [trial counsel] correctly assessed that any attempt to suppress admission of these statements would be meritless and futile, and he was within professional competence for declining to make that attempt.\" The habeas court explained that \"[u]nder this scenario ... a reasonable person would not believe that his freedom of movement was restrained by [the] display of police authority [encountered].\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Evidence adduced at the underlying criminal trial and at the habeas hearing indicates there was not a sufficient show of police force that would lead a reasonable person, in his own home, to feel that he was in custody for the purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, we conclude that the habeas court properly determined that the petitioner failed to demonstrate that trial counsel rendered deficient performance with respect to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    \"In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of the crime of risk of injury to a child, we decline to identify the victim or others through whom the victim's identity may be ascertained.

This claim has no merit. No tangible evidence was admitted at trial as a result of the seizure. Instead, the only evidence related to the petitioner's truck was testimony regarding the appearance of the truck itself, which served to identify the petitioner as the perpetrator and did not flow from its seizure. The habeas court concluded that, because the seizure of the petitioner's truck was supported by the plain view doctrine, any challenge by trial counsel would have been meritless. The petitioner has presented this court with no basis from which we could conclude that his trial counsel's conduct in failing to move to suppress evidence that was not admitted at trial fell outside the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. Accordingly, the habeas court properly concluded that trial counsel did not render deficient performance in failing to raise a meritless challenge to the seizure of the petitioner's truck.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Because we conclude that the petitioner failed to satisfy his burden of overcoming the strong presumption that his trial counsel provided effective assistance in this matter, we need not reach the petitioner's claim that he was prejudiced by trial counsel's alleged deficient performance.
