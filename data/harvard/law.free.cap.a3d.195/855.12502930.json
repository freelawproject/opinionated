For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the consent given by Appellant, Randy Jesus Valdivia (\"Valdivia\"), to Pennsylvania State Police Troopers Jeremy Hoy and David Long to search his van did not extend to a canine search occurring approximately forty minutes later. A reasonable person in Valdivia's position would not have understood that he was consenting to such a search. We therefore reverse the decision of the Superior Court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At approximately 4:30 p.m. on December 12, 2013, Troopers Hoy and Long were traveling together in a marked police cruiser on Interstate 80 in Centre County, Pennsylvania. They drove behind Valdivia, who was operating a white minivan with a Michigan plate. After about two miles, they observed Valdivia change lanes without using his turn signal and initiated a traffic stop on that basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trooper Lang stood at the rear of Valdivia's vehicle while Trooper Hoy approached on the passenger side of the van and requested Valdivia's license, registration and proof of insurance. Valdivia responded that he was about to run out of gas and gave the trooper his license, issued in the State of Florida, and a rental agreement for the vehicle. Trooper Hoy noted that Valdivia was nervous and his hand was shaking when he handed\n   Trooper Hoy the documentation, something the trooper said he \"look[s] for in every traffic stop.\" N.T., 8/8/2014, at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When asked, Valdivia explained that he was traveling to Union City, New Jersey to visit family. He told Trooper Hoy that he had originally planned to fly there from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, but his plane was rerouted to Detroit, Michigan. He missed his connecting flight to New Jersey and decided to drive the rest of the way. Trooper Hoy observed two large boxes wrapped in Christmas paper in the back of the van. Based on Valdivia's story, the trooper found it odd that the gifts had no \"markings from an airliner,\" and were \"not banged up.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. He testified to his familiarity with the tactic of wrapping boxes containing drugs in Christmas paper during the holiday season for camouflage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Additionally, Trooper Hoy found it strange that the rental agreement showed that Valdivia had rented the vehicle in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which was approximately thirty miles away from the airport in Detroit. The rental agreement also indicated that it was a one-way rental, which the trooper stated he knew to be \"common with ... criminals traveling across the country\" trafficking drugs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Further, through his training and experience, Trooper Hoy was aware that drug traffickers often used the I-80 corridor to travel from Detroit to New York and surrounding areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Trooper Hoy returned to his vehicle and, as he did in every traffic stop, ran a record check on Valdivia. While he waited for the report on Valdivia's prior record, Trooper Hoy contacted State Police K-9 Officer Aaron Tiracorda to conduct the search of the vehicle with his canine partner, Tom.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Trooper Tiracorda was off duty at that time, he had to drive to the scene from his house, which was located approximately thirty miles away. When the record check returned, it revealed that Valdivia had previously been charged in Florida with possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Troopers Hoy and Long approached Valdivia's vehicle together and asked him to step out of the car. Trooper Hoy explained the written warning Valdivia was receiving for failing to use his turn signal when changing lanes. After returning his documentation, Trooper Hoy asked Valdivia if he would answer a few more questions. Although Valdivia again stated that he needed to go get gas in his van, he agreed to answer additional questions. Trooper Hoy asked Valdivia why he did not fly directly from Fort Lauderdale to either New York City or Newark, New Jersey. In response, Valdivia altered his original story, stating instead that he flew to Detroit to visit a friend (a linebacker for the Detroit Lions). Valdivia indicated that he had arrived in Detroit around 11:00 p.m. on December 11 and then left the next morning around 9:00 a.m. to rent the vehicle and drive to New Jersey. Trooper Hoy asked about the location of the rental agency, and Valdivia explained that when he arrived at Detroit's airport, all of the rental companies were closed, and so he\n   went to Ann Arbor the next morning to rent the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Upon hearing this new version of events, Trooper Hoy asked for Valdivia's consent to search the vehicle. Valdivia gave his verbal consent, and thereafter signed a written consent presented to him by Trooper Long.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although it was Trooper Hoy's \"standard practice\" to \"keep the individual informed of what's happening [during] a traffic stop,\" he could not say that he specifically informed Valdivia either that a canine (and not a human) would be conducting the search or that he would have to wait until Trooper Tiracorda arrived with Tom for the search to occur.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55-56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   It was a cold evening, and Valdivia accepted the troopers' offer for him to sit in the back of the police cruiser while he waited. Trooper Tiracorda and Tom arrived approximately forty minutes later, at 5:40 p.m. Prior thereto, neither Trooper Hoy nor Trooper Long conducted a search of Valdivia's vehicle. Upon the arrival of Tom and Trooper Tiracorda, the troopers removed the two Christmas packages and a suitcase from the back of the van. Tom alerted on one of the two boxes, and subsequently indicated on the same box.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Trooper Tiracorda relayed this information to the other troopers, they opened both boxes and found clear, vacuum-sealed packages containing individually wrapped bags of suspected marijuana. The trooper seized the boxes, as well as a mobile smartphone and tablet, and arrested Valdivia. The total weight of the suspected contraband was approximately twenty pounds. Subsequent testing confirmed that it was marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Commonwealth charged Valdivia with possession of a controlled substance, possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, and possession of drug paraphernalia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Valdivia filed a timely omnibus pretrial motion seeking, inter alia, suppression of all evidence obtained as a result of the search of his vehicle. Of relevance to this appeal, Valdivia alleged that his consent was not voluntarily given, and that even if it was voluntary, the canine sniff and the lengthy delay exceeded the scope of any purported consent he gave. He argued that all evidence obtained from his vehicle must be suppressed pursuant to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following a hearing on the motion before the Honorable Thomas King Kistler, at which the above-referenced testimony was presented, the court denied suppression. The suppression court found that Valdivia had voluntarily given his consent to search and that it was not the product of police coercion. The suppression court further found that the use of a canine sniff was within the scope of his consent because Valdivia \"never indicated he was limiting his search so as not to include a consent for a K-9 Unit, nor did he make any attempt to revoke consent when he\n   saw the K-9 Unit arrive.\" Suppression Court Opinion, 9/9/2014, at 9. Because Valdivia was engaged in the transport of illegal drugs, the suppression court found that he should have been aware that a canine sniff was within \"the realm of possibilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Judge Kistler held a stipulated bench trial on October 27, 2014, at which the parties agreed to the submission of the criminal complaint, the lab report confirming the substance recovered to be marijuana and recording the weight thereof, and the transcripts of the preliminary hearing and the suppression hearing. The court convicted Valdivia of the crimes charged and on January 23, 2015 sentenced him to 11\u00bd to 23 months of incarceration followed by 30 days of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Valdivia timely appealed to the Superior Court, challenging, in relevant part, the finding by the suppression court that his consent was voluntarily given, contending that the investigative detention that occurred following the completion of the purpose of the original traffic stop was unlawful and that the circumstances surrounding his detention were coercive. He further asserted that even if valid, the canine sniff was not within the scope of his consent because a reasonable person would not have understood that he was consenting to a search by a dog and that the lengthy delay before the search was conducted vitiated his consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In a published opinion authored by the Honorable Patricia H. Jenkins, the Superior Court affirmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Although the troopers failed to communicate information at the time Valdivia gave his consent (which, as discussed infra, directly impacts the scope of Valdivia's consent), there was no evidence that the troopers acted stealthily, secretly or deceitfully, and the suppression court did not so find. There is also nothing in the record to suggest that Trooper Hoy removed Valdivia from his vehicle to prolong the initial traffic stop to give the K-9 unit time to arrive. Trooper Hoy testified that it is his \"standard practice\" to remove individuals from their cars during traffic stops and that he does this for every traffic violation. N.T., 8/8/2014, at 48.

He contends that his failure to object cannot be the basis for allowing the expansion of the scope of the search that occurred in this case, where he had no basis upon which to object until after police had already expanded the scope of the search.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. According to Valdivia, the \"reasonable person standard\" is at odds with the Superior Court's conclusion that the burden was on Valdivia to object or limit the scope of the search.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35. In his view, placing the burden on the citizen to object to a search that exceeds the scope of the consent given \"would effectively eliminate the 'reasonable person' standard\" because it would not matter what a person would have understood the search to include under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   An individual would have to object to limit a more expansive search than initially contemplated, e.g., \"opening locked containers, destroying parts of a car, or summoning a trained dog to the scene[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Commonwealth responds first by contending that Valdivia knew that a canine was going to be used to conduct the search and that there would be some delay because Trooper Hoy testified that it was his \"standard practice ... to so inform a consenting suspect.\" Commonwealth's Brief at 8. The Commonwealth asserts that the suppression court failed to make a finding of fact on this question, and thus, pursuant to our standard of review, we must accept that Trooper Hoy followed this practice in the case at bar because it was presented as evidence by the prevailing party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Further, the Commonwealth argues that because a dog sniff is unquestionably a \"search,\" it was necessarily encompassed by Valdivia's consent to a search of his vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. Similar to the analysis conducted by the Superior Court, the Commonwealth states that because Valdivia did not restrict the type of search that could be conducted, protest when he saw the K-9 unit arrive, or revoke his consent at any time, the use of the dog to conduct the search was within the scope of his consent - a conclusion, it states, that aligns with this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Reid.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Commonwealth also asserts that the delay of forty minutes was objectively reasonable under the circumstances because the K-9 unit was off duty and had to travel to the scene of the search.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16. It notes that in\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   , a majority of this Court found that a search of the defendant's vehicle conducted three days after he gave consent was valid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. The Commonwealth further speculates that the use of a canine to conduct the search here was likely comparable to the duration of a human search, as a human search would have required a more intrusive examination of the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We begin by addressing the Commonwealth's contention that we must find that Trooper Hoy informed Valdivia that a K-9 unit was coming to the scene. The Commonwealth is correct that evidence of a person's habit or routine practice is\n   <strong>\n    admissible\n   </strong>\n   as evidence that he or she acted in conformance therewith on the occasion in question. Pa.R.E. 406. The evidence presented by the Commonwealth on this point, however, was internally contradictory - Trooper Hoy testified at the suppression hearing that he informed Valdivia after obtaining his consent that he was going to call a K-9 unit to the scene, but after being confronted with his preliminary hearing testimony, at which he testified that he did not so inform Valdivia, he changed his testimony, stating instead that he did not know whether he told Valdivia that he had called for a canine to conduct the search. N.T., 8/8/2014, at 54-56;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   N.T., 12/18/2013, at 24. Trooper Hoy\n   could say only that it was his \"standard practice ... to, you know, keep the individual informed of what's happening on a traffic stop.\" N.T., 8/8/2014, at 55-56. He did not specifically testify that it was his habit or practice to inform individuals that a canine, instead of a person, would be conducting a vehicle search, or that the vehicle search would be delayed for the better part of an hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Moreover, in its written opinion, the suppression court's discussion of the claimed illegality of the canine sniff is consistent with a finding that Trooper Hoy did not inform Valdivia that he had called for a dog to conduct the search. The suppression court based its decision to deny suppression on Valdivia's failure to limit the search to exclude a dog sniff and his failure to revoke his consent when the K-9 unit arrived at the scene. Suppression Court Opinion, 9/9/2014, at 9. The court did not discuss the possibility that the canine search was within the scope of Valdivia's consent based on his actual knowledge that a dog was coming to conduct the search. Thus, although the suppression court did not enter a specific factual finding on this point, its discussion of this issue reflects its conclusion that Trooper Hoy did not inform Valdivia that he had called for a dog to conduct the search of his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As stated above, we are bound by the factual findings made by the suppression court that are supported by the record.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316530,12278269\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/127/\">\n    160 A.3d at 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the record supports a finding that Trooper Hoy did not inform Valdivia that he had called a K-9 unit to conduct the search, and it was on this factual premise that the suppression court decided the issue, we conclude that we are bound to proceed on the basis that Valdivia was not informed that a K-9 unit had been called to conduct a search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We now turn to the question of whether Valdivia, without actual knowledge that Trooper Hoy called a K-9 unit to the scene, gave consent to Troopers Hoy and Long to a search of his vehicle that extended to a dog sniff search.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we have discussed, a determination of the scope of consent given for police to conduct a search requires consideration of what a reasonable person in the position of the defendant would have believed he or she was allowing, based on the exchange that occurred between police and the individual.

Instead, we must decide whether a reasonable person under the circumstances would have understood Valdivia's general consent given to two human officers to include a search conducted by a later produced narcotics detection dog. As our discussion of the precedent above makes clear, these are two categorically different searches. A dog sniff constitutes a separate and distinct mechanism for drug detection than a search conducted by a human officer.

Valdivia gave his consent to search the vehicle to the two police officers who conducted the traffic stop. Based on the facts present in this case, Valdivia's failure to object to the delayed search by the canine officer or to revoke his consent has no bearing on the outcome of this case. While an individual may place limits on the scope of any consent given, or revoke consent altogether, the failure to do so does not modify the consent to the search that was given, nor does it give police carte blanche to conduct a search of limitless scope and duration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The scope of a search is controlled by the scope of consent given, which, in turn, is determined pursuant to a reasonable person standard under the circumstances at the time the exchange between the officer and the suspect occurs. The burden is on law enforcement officials to conduct a search within those parameters. An individual is not required to police the police; absent another exception to the warrant requirement, when a search exceeds the scope of an individual's given consent, the search is illegal regardless of whether the individual objected or revoked his or her consent.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   68 Am.

While there certainly could be more than one \"exchange\" that occurs between an officer and an individual during a single encounter, case law does not support a finding that an officer's unilateral decision to conduct a wholly different type of search than a reasonable person would have understood his consent to allow is nonetheless within the scope of the given consent simply because the suspect failed to object. Justice Todd's claim is unfounded that we are somehow reformulating the law by limiting the scope of the search to what was reasonably understood at the time consent was given.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

They do not stand for the proposition that would be required here, i.e., that the failure to object brings an otherwise uncontemplated type of search within the scope of consent. In fact, in all of the circuit court cases relied upon in her concurring and dissenting opinion, the search was conducted in the manner consented to by the suspect. As stated, the question in those cases dealt with whether the area searched was within the scope of consent, not whether the type of search that occurred was, in fact, consented to.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, these cases do not support a finding that Valdivia's failure to object under the circumstances of this case rendered the canine search conducted within the scope of his consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Under the circumstances of this nighttime roadside vehicle stop when Valdivia's consent was sought and received, a reasonable person would have expected the two police officers at the scene to conduct an immediate hand search of the vehicle. Conversely, our objective review of the exchange between Valdivia and Trooper Hoy, as well as the surrounding circumstances, leads us to conclude that a reasonable person in Valdivia's position would not have understood his consent to encompass a search conducted by a drug sniffing dog\n   that would occur forty minutes after he gave his consent. Valdivia gave a general consent to two human police officers to search his car. The search that occurred exceeded the scope of that consent. Therefore, the evidence obtained as a result of the search should have been suppressed. On this basis, we reverse the decision of the Superior Court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Chief Justice Saylor and Justices Dougherty and Wecht join the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Justice Todd files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which Justice Baer joins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Justice Mundy files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which Justice Baer joins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   At issue in this appeal is whether Appellant Randy Jesus Valdivia's oral and written consent to allow police to search his vehicle, which ultimately led to the discovery of 20 pounds of marijuana valued at $160,000, was voluntary; whether the scope of Appellant's consent properly included a canine sniff; and whether the execution of such a search 40 minutes after his consent was given rendered it invalid. For the reasons that follow, considering the circumstances surrounding the consent and search, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must, I agree with the majority that Appellant's consent was voluntary, but dissent regarding its conclusion that a canine search was outside the scope of Appellant's consent.

First, he maintains that a reasonable person would not consider a canine sniff to be part of a generalized consent to search - that he envisioned only a hand search of his vehicle - thus, the use of a canine to search his vehicle was beyond his consent. Second, he claims that, in any event, the 40 minutes he waited for the canine unit to arrive was beyond that to which a reasonable person should be subjected, and, thus, such a delayed search was beyond the scope of his consent and, therefore, invalid. I address these assertions\n   <em>\n    seriatim.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Whether a canine search is one a reasonable person would expect to be part of a general consent to search has been the subject of debate and varied conclusions by a number of courts.

We must determine what was reasonably understood by the police and Appellant to be the scope of this search, in light of the totality of all the circumstances,\n   viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the prevailing party below. Considered in this context, based upon the circumstances in the evidentiary record, in my view, the use of a dog by the police was within the scope of the search to which Appellant consented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   First, Appellant gave an oral generalized consent to search and signed a written \"Waiver of Rights and Consent to Search\" form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   N.T. Omnibus Pretrial Motion Hearing, 8/8/14, at 17. Appellant never indicated that he was limiting his consent or the scope of the search so as to exclude a canine search. After giving a general consent to search, both orally and in writing, the officers offered that, as it was a cold evening, Appellant could wait in the trooper's vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Appellant accepted the offer and sat in the police cruiser with one of the troopers. The officers, however, did not perform a hand search of the vehicle immediately, or for the ensuing 40 minutes, and Appellant remained in the police cruiser with a trooper for this period of time. At no point did Appellant inquire as to the reason for the delay. The uncontested testimony established that Appellant's line of sight from his seat in the police cruiser allowed him to see the K-9 unit arrive, as well as the dog \"working around the vehicle and up front of the vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65. Yet, Appellant did not attempt to clarify his consent when he saw the K-9 unit arrive, nor did he inquire about the canine sniff, or seek to terminate the search, even though the canine search of the vehicle and packages were performed in his sight.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64-65, 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In my view, that Appellant consented, both orally and in writing, to a general search of his vehicle; that he made no inquiry regarding the lack of a hand search of his vehicle after his consent and for 40 minutes thereafter; that he sat in the police cruiser with an officer without making any comment or inquiry; and that he made no attempt to clarify his consent during the 40-minute period of police inaction (even with a trooper seated nearby), strongly suggests Appellant envisioned the consent to entail more than just a hand search. Moreover, Appellant's silence when he saw the K-9 unit arrive, and further silence when police commenced the search of the vehicle with a dog, are significant indications that such a search did not exceed the scope of his consent, and that he believed the breadth of his consented-to search included a canine sniff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   I view the majority's approach to determining the scope of consent as unfounded. As noted above, assessing the scope of consent standard is an objective evaluation of what a reasonable person would have understood by the exchange between the officer and the person who gave the consent, under the totality of all of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314433,1070125\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/811/530/\">\n    811 A.2d at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 549 ;\n   <em>\n    Jimeno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221328\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/248/#p250\">\n    500 U.S. at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221328\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/248/#p250\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Rather than considering the totality of the circumstances surrounding the exchange between the police and Appellant, the majority looks only to \"the circumstances at the time the exchange between the officer and the suspect occurs.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Opinion at 868. Thus, the majority narrows the examination, and, by doing so, the majority overlooks the failure to object or revoke consent as informing the inquiry, as, evidently, in the majority's view, such circumstances have no bearing on determining the scope of consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221328\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/248/#p250\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[W]hen a search exceeds the scope of an individual's given consent, the search is illegal regardless of whether the individual objected or revoked his or her consent.\").

First, I would eschew a formulaic approach to whether the duration of a search is beyond one's consent. Again, whether a search exceeds the duration of the consent turns on what a reasonable person would have understood the duration to be under the circumstances. Consistent therewith, I note that the traffic stop and subsequent consented-to search took place in a largely rural region in the center of the state near Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. The K-9 unit involved in the search was 30 miles away. N.T. Omnibus Pretrial Motion Hearing, 8/8/14, at 87. While this search was conducted on Interstate 80, a canine unit is not always readily available, and, where a K-9 unit is not initially involved in a stop, it will take some time for such a unit to be summoned and arrive. In my view, a wait of 40 minutes is not, in and of itself, objectively unreasonable, and case law supports such a conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

While the officers standing inactive during this time were in plain sight of Appellant, he made no inquiry, objection, or revocation of his consent regarding the delay. Even upon the arrival of the K-9 unit in his plain view, Appellant remained mute as the search commenced and thereafter. Appellant's claim that a 40-minute wait after he consented to a search was intrusive and rendered the search beyond the scope of his consent is undermined by the above facts. It is important to remember that, while any search may result in a disruption of travel plans, inconvenience, and intrusion, here, Appellant consented to the search - consent which could have been clarified or revoked at any time. Based upon these particular circumstances, again, viewed, as we must, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the prevailing party below, in my view, Appellant has failed to establish that the\n   40-minute delay exceeded the scope of his consented-to search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Accordingly, I conclude Appellant's consent was voluntary; the scope of his consent included a canine sniff; and the delay to perform such search was within the scope of his consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Justice Baer joins this concurring and dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   I join Justice Todd's concurring and dissenting opinion in full. Because the Majority opinion incorrectly focuses on Valdivia's subjective knowledge, engages in fact finding, and creates a new category for consent in canine searches, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The focus in this case is whether consent to search a vehicle includes consent to a canine sniff of packages in the vehicle. As noted by the Majority, \"the standard for measuring the scope of an individual's consent is one of 'objective reasonableness[,]' \" and \"[w]e do not ascertain the scope of consent from the individual's subjective belief[.]\" Majority Op. at 862 (citations omitted). Nevertheless, the Majority focuses on the subjective knowledge of Valdivia, repeatedly faulting Trooper Hoy for failing to inform Valdivia that the search would be conducted by a canine and not a human, a rule promulgated for the first time by the Majority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 859, 865. The Majority's entire analysis hinges on Trooper Hoy's failure to inform Valdivia of the canine sniff thus placing it outside the scope of consent. However, the suppression court made no such finding of fact. As the Majority concedes, \"the suppression court did not enter a specific factual finding on this point.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 864. \"We are bound by the suppression court's factual findings so long as they are supported by the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

There is no finding of fact that Valdivia was not informed by Trooper Hoy that the officers intended to conduct a canine sniff. The Majority attempts to bootstrap its fact finding by suggesting the trial court's \"discussion of the issue reflects its conclusion that Trooper Hoy did not inform Valdivia that he had called for a dog to conduct the search of his vehicle.\" Majority Op. at 865. However, in its conclusions of law the suppression court stated, \"[t]estimony at the hearing was conflicting as to whether or not Trooper Hoy indicated to the Defendant that he would be calling a K-9 Unit to conduct a search. Trooper Hoy testified that it was his standard practice to do so, but could not recall if he did on this specific instance.\" Suppression Ct. Op. at 9. This is contrary to the conclusion of the suppression court, and is a factual finding by the Majority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Further, the Majority cites to a line of cases that determined a canine sniff is a search under Article I Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, as opposed to a less intrusive encounter, and characterizes those cases as creating a distinction between human and canine searches.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. at 866-67 (citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

These cases dealt with the legality of a warrantless canine sniff and whether or not the intrusion was a search. The Majority quotes\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   and states, \"[o]f relevance to the case at bar, we observed that while 'canine sniffs are searches ...\n   <strong>\n    they are not akin to searches conducted by human law enforcement officers\n   </strong>\n   ,' and generally require a lesser degree of suspicion.\" Majority Op. at 866-67 (emphasis in original) (citing\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9244120,1329441\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/849/1185/\">\n    849 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1192 ). The Majority then concludes \"the level of intrusion involved with a canine sniff, as compared to a human search\" has no \"relevance to the question before us.\" Majority Op. at 867. Respectfully, I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The aforementioned precedent cannot be used to create two categories of searches, human and canine, while simultaneously dismissing the legal holdings that a canine sniff is less intrusive than a human search. I agree with the Superior Court's conclusion that \"[n]othing about a canine sniff strikes us as more intrusive than a vehicle search by humans, so when an individual consents to an official search of his vehicle, it is natural to assume that his consent includes both human and canine searches.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.
