As for the defendant's first claim in support of his motion to correct, by contrast, the state contends that that claim should have been denied on the merits rather than dismissed because, although the claim was unfounded in law or in fact, it fell within the court's limited subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 43-22. We agree with the state and, thus, reverse the court's judgment of dismissal with respect to the defendant's first claim only and remand this case with direction to render judgment denying that claim on the merits. The court's judgment of dismissal is affirmed in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts are relevant to this appeal. On or about May 7, 2009, the defendant and two other individuals were arrested and charged, inter alia, with home invasion in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100aa. Subsequently, the defendant and the others were offered plea deals involving recommended sentences of ten years incarceration in exchange for guilty pleas to conspiracy to commit home invasion in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-100aa. Although the other two individuals accepted such plea deals, the defendant rejected the state's offer and exercised his right to proceed to jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After unsuccessfully prosecuting a motion to suppress identification evidence, the defendant reinitiated plea negotiations with the state. The prosecutor\n   responded by offering the defendant a revised plea deal involving a recommended sentence of twenty years incarceration, execution suspended after twelve years, followed by five years of probation in exchange for his plea of guilty to conspiracy to commit home invasion. On January 31, 2012, the defendant accepted this offer and pleaded guilty under the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Notwithstanding this agreement, the defendant, at sentencing on April 5, 2012, asked the court to reinstate the original plea deal that he initially had been offered, but which he had rejected, for a recommended sentence of ten years incarceration in exchange for his guilty plea to conspiracy to commit home invasion. The court responded by noting that the defendant had rejected that offer and had \"substantially [gone] through the trial.\" The court then imposed sentence as agreed to in the second plea deal, which the defendant had accepted. The defendant subsequently filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Practice Book \u00a7 43-22. The motion was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because the trial court dismissed the defendant's claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we first set forth general legal principles and our standard of review as to jurisdiction. \"[T]he jurisdiction of the sentencing court terminates once a defendant's sentence has begun, and, therefore, that court may no longer take any action affecting a defendant's sentence unless it expressly has been authorized to act.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Specifically, the defendant claims that a twenty year sentence of imprisonment followed by a five year term of probation effectively constitutes a twenty-five year sentence thus exceeds the twenty year limit for a class B felony authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a (6). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Absent a statutory prohibition, a term of imprisonment with the execution of such sentence of imprisonment suspended after a period set by the court and a period of probation is an authorized sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The plain language of the statute concerning authorized sentences, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-28 (b) (5), specifies that a defendant can be sentenced to a term\n   of imprisonment, but have that sentence suspended while he serves a period of probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the present case, the defendant's maximum exposure to imprisonment under such a sentence is twenty, not twenty-five, years. Moreover, \u00a7 53a-35a expressly states that \"the\n   <em>\n    sentence of imprisonment\n   </em>\n   shall be a definite sentence and ... the term shall be ... (1) [f]or a class B felony other than manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm ... a term not less than one year nor more than twenty years ....\" (Emphasis added.) Further-more, the statute concerning periods of probation, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-29 (d), expressly states that \"the\n   <em>\n    period of probation\n   </em>\n   ... (1) [f]or a class B felony, [shall be] not more than five years.\" (Emphasis added.) The defendant's sentence does not violate any of these provisions. We agree with the state, however, that the defendant's claim that his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum falls within the court's narrow jurisdiction to correct an illegal sentence under Practice Book \u00a7 43-22. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Tabone\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668520\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/279/527/#p533\">\n    279 Conn. at 533-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20A.2d%201058\">\n    902 A.2d 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An appellate court, however, \"can sustain a right decision although it may have been placed on a wrong ground.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v. Osuch\n   </em>\n   , supra, 124 Conn. at 583,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233424\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/124/572/#p578\">\n    124 Conn.App. 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The form of the trial court's judgment is improper as the\n   court should have denied on the merits, rather than dismissed, this part of the defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant's remaining claims were properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The defendant asserts that the disparity between his sentence and those of the other individuals involved in the underlying crime brings his claim within the purview of\n   Practice Book \u00a7 43-22. As previously noted, jurisdiction under \u00a7 43-22 is narrow, applying only to limited claims. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Tabone\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668520\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/279/527/#p533\">\n    279 Conn. at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20A.2d%201058\">\n    902 A.2d 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Connecticut courts have considered four categories of claims pursuant to [Practice Book] \u00a7 43-22. The first category has addressed whether the sentence was within the permissible range for the crimes charged.... The second category has considered violations of the prohibition against double jeopardy.... The third category has involved claims pertaining to the computation of the length of the sentence and the question of consecutive or concurrent prison time.... The fourth category has involved questions as to which sentencing statute was applicable.... [I]f a defendant's claim falls within one of these four categories the trial court has jurisdiction to modify a sentence after it has commenced.... If the claim is not within one of the categories, then the court must dismiss the claim for a lack of jurisdiction and not consider its merits.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.
