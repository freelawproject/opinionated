On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly affirmed the decision of the board because a then recent statutory amendment, General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 31-222(a)(5)(O), as amended by No. 08-150 of the 2008 Public Acts, exempted the\n   claimant, Richard Peck,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and certain other individuals from the definition of \"employee\" under the act. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff provided flag escort services for oversized vehicles traveling within or through Connecticut. The plaintiff\n   would assign requests for such services to various contractors. In March, 2008, Peck, who had performed services for the plaintiff as an escort vehicle operator, filed a complaint with the administrator claiming that the plaintiff had failed to pay him appropriate unemployment compensation benefits. The plaintiff had not reported wages for Peck and, as a result, the administrator's field unit conducted an audit for the applicable time period, from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2008, the legislature enacted Number 08-150 of the 2008 Public Acts (P.A. 08-150) which, in \u00a7 43 (O), exempted services performed by operators of escort vehicles, under certain circumstances, from the definition of \"employee\" for purposes of \u00a7 31-222.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   See General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 31-222(a)(5)(O), as\n   amended by No. 08-150 of the 2008 Public Acts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This amendment became effective June 12, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By a determination letter dated July 7, 2008, the administrator concluded that the plaintiff had employed Peck and other individuals within the terms of \u00a7 31-222(a)(1)(B)(ii),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   during the audit period from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2007, and that the \"potential amount\" the plaintiff owed for unpaid unemployment compensation contributions was $26,812.05\n   plus interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff appealed to the appeals referee from the administrator's July 7, 2008 determination. In a February 2, 2009 decision, the appeals referee affirmed the July 7, 2008 determination of the administrator. The appeals referee noted that the parties requested only that he address the issue of whether the amendment codified in P.A. 08-150 was the controlling law to be\n   applied to the July 7, 2008 determination of the administrator. The appeals referee concluded that the amendment did not apply retroactively to the named individuals who worked for the plaintiff between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007. The plaintiff appealed that conclusion to the board. On November 12, 2010, the board affirmed the referee's decision and dismissed the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 23, 2010, the plaintiff appealed the board's dismissal to the trial court. On January 8, 2015, the court remanded the matter back to the board \"to institute factual findings regarding the applicability of the amendment to the claims against [the plaintiff].\" (Footnote omitted.) The court stated: \"The board argues that the court should simply decide that the amendment does not apply and affirm the board. [The plaintiff] states that if the amendment is not in effect, then it will not pursue the matter further, but if it does apply, then it stands ready to prove that the amendment as a factual matter exempts it.... The court, however, would prefer to have the agency provide its factual findings to the court in advance of its determination of the applicability of the amendment.\" (Footnotes omitted.) In its remand order, the trial court retained jurisdiction to review the matter in full at the conclusion of the administrative appeals process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 28, 2015, the board remanded the matter to the administrator \"to conduct further proceedings and to issue a new decision.\" The board noted that it did not retain jurisdiction. By letter dated April 24, 2015, the administrator concluded on remand \"that none of the escort drivers providing services to [the plaintiff] during the time period covered in the original determination [January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007] would be exempted from covered employment by the application of Public Act No. 08-150.\" The plaintiff appealed the administrator's decision regarding the applicability of the amendment to the appeals referee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The appeals referee framed the issue before him as \"whether the [plaintiff] would still be liable for contributions if the administrator applied the test set forth in ... \u00a7 31-222(a)(5)(O), as amended by Section 43 (O) of Public Act No. 08-150.\" In a memorandum of decision dated May 31, 2016, the appeals referee sustained the plaintiff's appeal and reversed the April 24, 2015 decision of the administrator. The appeals referee held that the escort drivers who had provided services for the plaintiff during the relevant time period would be exempt from the definition of \"employee\" under the relevant amendment to the act, \u00a7 31-222(a)(5)(O), if it were applied. The appeals referee ordered the administrator \"to reimburse the [plaintiff] from contributions already paid in an amount required by law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 9, 2016, the administrator appealed to the board from the decision of the appeals referee. The administrator argued that \u00a7 31-222 (a) (5) (O), as amended, did not apply to the drivers in this case. The board affirmed the decision of the appeals referee that the escort drivers who\n   provided services for the plaintiff during the relevant time period would be exempt from the definition of \"employee\" if the amendment were applied. The board certified to the trial court the record of the proceedings following the court's December 31, 2014 remand order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the board's decision on remand, the trial court rendered a decision on January 9, 2017, dismissing the plaintiff's November 23, 2010 appeal. The court held that \"the issue on this appeal is ... a legal one: the right, not of a claimant, but the administrator for contributions when the determination letter was sent after the amendment. Regardless of the date of the determination letter, the general rule is that where an employer incurred liability for unemployment insurance taxes under a statute, a subsequent amendment of the statute to exempt the employer from payment of further taxes does not operate retroactively to relieve the employer\n   of liability incurred before the effective date of the amendment.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that the amendment to \u00a7 31-222(a)(5)(O) in P.A. 08-150 was inapplicable to the facts of this case. The plaintiff emphasizes that it does not claim that the amendment should be applied retroactively, but rather argues that the triggering event for purposes of applying the new statutory amendment was the issuance of the July 7, 2008 determination letter. The plaintiff contends that, prior to the issuance of the determination letter, there had been no formal finding that the named individuals were employees rather than independent contractors. It argues that the determination letter triggered legal proceedings and triggered the plaintiff's payment obligations. The amendment should apply in this case, the plaintiff argues, because the amendment was in effect at the time the determination letter was issued. The administrator argues that the amendment cannot be applied retroactively to the plaintiff's liability for unemployment compensation contributions for a time period of January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007, which occurred before the effective date of the amendment. We agree with the administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"If ... the issue is one of law, the court has the broader responsibility of determining whether the administrative action resulted from an incorrect application of the law to the facts found or could not reasonably or logically have followed from such facts. Although the court may not substitute its own conclusions for those of the administrative board, it retains the ultimate obligation to determine whether the administrative action was unreasonable, arbitrary, illegal or an abuse of discretion.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Mattatuck Museum-Mattatuck Historical Society\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Administrator\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1197770\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/238/273/#p276\">\n    238 Conn. 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 276,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=679%20A.2d%20347\">\n    679 A.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The issue raised by the plaintiff is whether the July 7, 2008 determination letter was the event that triggered the application of the amendment. In that determination letter, the administrator informed the plaintiff that its employment of certain individuals within the terms of \u00a7 31-222(a)(1)(B)(ii) during the audit period triggered its obligation for unpaid unemployment compensation contributions. Although the administrator informed the plaintiff of its liability for unemployment contributions following the effective date of P.A. 08-150, which exempted the plaintiff's escort drivers from the act, the date of the determination letter did not trigger the application of the amendment. The audit period referenced in the determination letter, January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007, was the time frame during which the named individuals provided services and is, therefore, the time frame during which the\n   plaintiff's obligation to make unemployment compensation contributions arose. This obligation under \u00a7 31-222 existed until the legislature amended it. Because the audit period predated the June 12, 2008 effective date of the amendment, the exemption contained in P.A. 08-150 would not apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly dismissed the plaintiff's appeal from the board's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Peck was a nonappearing defendant at trial and is not involved in this appeal.
