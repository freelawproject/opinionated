Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947081\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/86/245/\">\n    86 A.3d 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Super. 2014), ordered Appellants to comply with the new registration conditions and terms assigned to their crimes under SORNA. Appellants request that we reverse the decisions of the trial court, and enforce the terms of the original registration requirements from the time of their initial pleas and sentencing hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We are constrained to order that under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the trial court may not increase their registration requirements under SORNA. Consequently, we find that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   abrogates\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and agree with Appellants that the original periods of sexual offender registration and conditions imposed in each case be reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The relevant facts and procedural history of these consolidated appeals are as follows. Each of the nineteen Appellants accepted plea agreements to various sexual offenses prior to SORNA's effective date, which was December 20, 2012. Under the law regarding sexual offender registration effective at the time of their plea agreements, two Appellants did not have to register as sexual offenders, and the remaining Appellants had to register for a period of ten years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While Appellants' cases are not identical, each is similarly situated. Two Appellants, Wilson and Colbert, pled guilty to crimes that, at the time, did not require any period of registration as sexual offenders. The remaining seventeen Appellants accepted plea deals to crimes that included ten years of registration as sexual offenders under then-existing versions of Megan's Law, 42 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 9791 - 9799.7 (expired December 20, 2012). In exchange for Appellants' guilty or no-contest pleas, the Commonwealth withdrew several other charged offenses in each case. Had Appellants been convicted of these withdrawn\n   offenses, each would have been subjected to longer periods of registration as sexual offenders. All of these dispositions occurred prior to the effective date of SORNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At sentencing in each case, Appellants were informed of whether they were required to register, and if so for how long. All nineteen Appellants later violated their respective probationary terms. Appellants were each resentenced, to either incarceration or additional periods of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On December 20, 2011, the Legislature enacted SORNA, which, as aforesaid, became effective on December 20, 2012. Appellants were informed that they were subject to its new registration requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The new requirements increased each Appellant's registration term from its original length imposed at sentencing. Nearly all Appellants' registration terms increased to lifetime reporting requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Each Appellant filed a \"Petition to Enforce Plea Agreement or for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.\" Appellants challenged the retroactivity of SORNA to their cases, and argued that it violated the plea deals each had made with the Commonwealth. The trial court denied Appellants' petitions, holding that Appellants were not entitled to specific performance of the negotiated plea bargain because Appellants had violated the terms of their plea agreements. In each case, the trial court relied upon\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . This Court ultimately granted\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review, and these consolidated appeals are now before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A more detailed recitation of the facts relating to each Appellant follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Carlos Fernandez: On September 20, 2006, Fernandez entered into a negotiated plea agreement with the Commonwealth and pled guilty to Indecent Assault, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 3126(a)(7),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Corruption of Minors, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 6301(a)(1)(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 20, 2006, he was sentenced to a period of confinement followed by a term of probation. Under the applicable version of Megan's Law at the time, 42 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 9795.1(a), Fernandez was required to register as a sex offender for a period of ten years. Thereafter, Fernandez violated the terms of his supervision and was resentenced. After SORNA became effective, he was reclassified as a Tier III offender,\n   and retroactively subjected to lifetime registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Deborah Jedrzej: On January 10, 2006, Jedrzej entered into a negotiated plea with the Commonwealth and pled\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   to Indecent Assault, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 3126(a)(7), Corruption of Minors, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 6301(a)(1)(i), and Endangering the Welfare of Children, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 4304(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sentencing occurred on February 22, 2006, and she received a sentence of confinement followed by five years of probation. Under the applicable version of Megan's Law, 42 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 9795.1(a), Jedrzej was required to register as a sex offender for a period of ten years for the Indecent Assault conviction. Following a violation of her probation, she was resentenced. Under SORNA, Jedrzej was reclassified requiring lifetime registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Joseph Lewis: Lewis entered into a negotiated plea of guilty to one count each of Unlawful Contact with a Minor, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 6318(a)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Statutory Sexual Assault, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 3122.1\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and Corruption of Minors, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 6301(a)(1)(i), on April 21, 2010. Under the applicable version of Megan's Law, the Unlawful Contact with a Minor charge required him to register as a sex offender for ten years unless he was adjudged a sexually violent predator. After receipt of the report from the Sexual Offender Assessment Board (\"SOAB\"), the Commonwealth elected not to request a sexually violent predator hearing. He received a sentence of incarceration followed by five years of probation. He later violated the terms of his probation and was resentenced. After the effective date of SORNA, he was reclassified to twenty-five years of registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Anthony Marano: Referred to as A.M. in the Superior Court docket,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Marano entered into a negotiated plea agreement on\n   September 21, 2010, and pleaded\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   to Indecent Assault, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 3126(a)(7), and Corruption of Minors, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 6301(a)(1)(i). He was sentenced the same day to confinement followed by nine years of probation. Marano was required to register as a sex offender for a period of ten years for the Indecent Assault conviction under the then-current version of Megan's Law. After receipt of the report from the SOAB, the Commonwealth elected not to request a sexually violent predator hearing. Thereafter, Marano violated the terms of his supervision and, on December 28, 2011, his probation was revoked and he was sentenced to additional periods of incarceration. Under SORNA, Marano was reclassified for lifetime registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Carl Corbin: On February 7, 2011, Corbin pled guilty to Indecent Assault, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 3126(a)(7), and Corruption of Minors, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 6301(a)(1)(i). Corbin was sentenced on May 9, 2011, to five years of probation. After receipt of the report from the SOAB, the Commonwealth elected not to request a sexually violent predator hearing. Therefore, Corbin was required under Megan's Law to register for a period of ten years, 42 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 9795.1(a). Corbin violated the terms of his probation and was later resentenced to incarceration. Pursuant to the requirements of SORNA, Corbin was notified that he was reclassified for lifetime registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Willie Colbert: On April 9, 1997, Colbert entered into a negotiated guilty plea to one count of attempted rape, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 901 &amp; 3121.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was sentenced the same day to eleven and one-half to twenty-three months' confinement, followed by six years of probation. At the time of his guilty plea, Megan's Law did not apply to inchoate offenses, so Colbert was not directed to register as a sex offender. Eventually, Colbert violated the terms of his supervision, and was resentenced to further incarceration with an additional period of probation. After the effective date of SORNA, he was notified that he was reclassified to lifetime registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Albert Donnelly: Donnelly entered a negotiated guilty plea to Indecent Assault, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 3126(a)(7), and Endangering the Welfare of Children, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 4304(a)(1). At the time of the plea, Donnelly was required to register as a sex offender for a period of ten years due to the conviction of Indecent Assault, pursuant to the then-current version of Megan's Law, 42 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 9795.1(a). After receipt of the report from the SOAB, the Commonwealth elected not to request a hearing to determine if Donnelly should have been classified as a sexually violent predator. Donnelly was initially sentenced to probation on the charges. After he violated the terms of his supervision, he was resentenced to incarceration. Following the effective date of SORNA, he was notified that he was reclassified to lifetime registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Victor DeFelice: In May 2005, DeFelice entered into a negotiated plea agreement with the Commonwealth and pled guilty to Indecent Assault, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 3126(a)(7), and Corruption of Minors, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 6301(a)(1)(i). The Commonwealth\n   <em>\n    nolle prossed\n   </em>\n   the remaining charges, as it did in almost every one of these cases. After a hearing, the trial court ruled that the evidence did not support a finding that DeFelice be classified as a sexually violent predator; therefore, as a result of his conviction of Indecent Assault, he was required to register as a sex offender under Megan's Law for ten years. He received an initial sentence of confinement followed by five years of probation. After he violated the terms of his supervision, he was sentence to an additional period of probation. Under SORNA, he was classified as a lifetime registrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   April Greghini: On April 13, 2006, Greghini pled guilty to one count each of Corruption of Minors, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 6301(a)(1)(i), Endangering the Welfare of Children, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 4304(a)(1), and Sexual Exploitation of Children, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 6320(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Her sentence included incarceration followed by six years of consecutive probation. After receipt of the report from the SOAB, the Commonwealth elected not to request a hearing to determine if Greghini should have been classified as a sexually violent predator. Under the applicable version of Megan's Law, the conviction of Sexual Exploitation of Children required her to register as a sex offender for ten years. She subsequently violated the terms of her probation, and received a new sentence. Under SORNA, she was reclassified to twenty-five years of registration under 42 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 9799.15 as a Tier II offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Tracey McKinney: On May 24, 2010, McKinney entered into a negotiated plea agreement with the Commonwealth whereby he pled\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   to Indecent Assault, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 3126(a)(7). His initial sentence was for incarceration followed by three years of consecutive probation. At that time, he was required to register as a sex offender under Megan's Law for ten years. After receipt of the report from the SOAB, the Commonwealth elected not to request a sexually violent predator hearing. He later violated the terms of his probation and was resentenced. After the effective date of SORNA, he was reclassified for lifetime registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Jose Melendez: Melendez pleaded guilty to Indecent Assault, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 3126(a)(7), which required him to register as a sex offender for ten years under Megan's Law, 42 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 9795.1(a). His initial sentence was for probation, but he was found to have violated his supervision and was resentenced to confinement followed by a consecutive term of probation. Under SORNA, he was required to be a lifetime registrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Mariano Ortiz: On November 13, 2006, Ortiz entered a guilty plea to Indecent Assault, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 3126(a)(7). Under the applicable version of Megan's Law, the Indecent Assault charge required him to register as a sex offender for ten years unless he was adjudged a sexually violent predator. After receipt of the report from the SOAB, the Commonwealth elected not to request a sexually violent predator hearing. He received a sentence of five years probation. He later violated the terms of his supervision and was resentenced to an additional period of probation. After the effective date of SORNA, he was reclassified as a lifetime registrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Robert Ned: Ned pleaded guilty on December 10, 2008, to one count of Indecent Assault, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 3126(a)(7), and Unlawful Restraint, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 2902(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the applicable version of Megan's Law, the Indecent Assault charge required him to register as a sex offender for ten years unless he was adjudged a sexually violent predator. After receipt of the report from the SOAB, the Commonwealth elected not to request a sexually violent predator hearing. He received a sentence of incarceration followed by ten years of probation. He later violated the terms of his probation and was resentenced to additional periods of imprisonment and probation. After the effective date of SORNA, he was notified that he was now subject to lifetime registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Michael Stanger: On December 14, 2010, Stanger pled guilty to Sexual Abuse of Children (child pornography), 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 6312(d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   This crime, as a first offense, is graded as a felony of the third degree. 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 6312(d.1). On March 22, 2011, he was sentenced to seven years of probation. At the time of the plea, Stanger was required to register as a sex offender for a period of ten years due to this conviction, pursuant to the then-current version of Megan's Law, 42 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 9795.1(a). After receipt of the report from the SOAB, the Commonwealth elected not to request a hearing to determine if Stanger should have been classified as a sexually violent predator. He later violated the terms of his probation and was resentenced to imprisonment followed by five years of probation. After the effective date of SORNA, he was notified that he was reclassified to fifteen years of registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Albert Wilson: On February 17, 2011, Wilson entered a plea of\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   to Statutory Sexual Assault, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 3122.1. He was sentenced to a negotiated term of eleven and a half to twenty-three months' confinement followed by eight years of probation. At that time, he was not required to register as a sex offender under the applicable version of Megan's Law. Thereafter, Wilson violated the terms of his supervision and was resentenced to two to four years' incarceration followed by four years of probation. Under SORNA, he has been classified as a lifetime registrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Tyrek White: White entered a negotiated guilty plea to Indecent Assault, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 3126(a)(7), Corruption of Minors, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 6301(a)(1)(i), and Endangering the Welfare of Children, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 4304(a)(1). He was sentenced to probation, however, after he was found to have repeatedly violated the terms of his supervision, he was eventually resentenced to confinement followed by additional years of probation. Initially, the applicable version of Megan's Law, 42 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 9795.1(a), required White to register as a sex offender for a period of ten years for the Indecent Assault conviction. Following the violation of his original term of probation, he was reclassified under SORNA as lifetime registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Albert Tilson: On June 27, 2011, Tilson entered a guilty plea to Indecent Assault, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 3126(a)(7), and was subsequently sentenced to incarceration and three years of consecutive probation. The applicable version of Megan's Law, 42 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 9795.1(a), required Tilson to register as a sex offender for a period of ten years. The Commonwealth waived the sexually violent predator assessment hearing after receiving the report from the SOAB. Tilson violated the terms of his supervision and was eventually resentenced to additional periods of incarceration and probation. When SORNA took effect, he was reclassified as a Tier III lifetime registrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Frank Garcia: Garcia pleaded guilty to Indecent Assault, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 3126(a)(7), and Endangering the Welfare of Children, 18 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 4304(a)(1), on July 26, 2011. The applicable version of Megan's Law, 42 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 9795.1(a), required Garcia to register as a sex offender for a period of ten years for the Indecent Assault conviction. After receipt of the report from the SOAB, the Commonwealth elected not to request a hearing to determine if Garcia should have been classified as a sexually violent predator. He was sentenced to incarceration on the Indecent Assault charge followed by a period of six years of probation on the EWOC charge. He later violated the terms of his supervision and was resentenced.

Appellants assert that all parties to each plea agreement understood resentencing would be the consequence for a probation violation. Appellants indicate the stipulated facts show the Commonwealth withdrew charges requiring lengthier registration terms. Appellants argue\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   unjustly expands the holding in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hainesworth\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   by releasing the Commonwealth from its agreement to collateral terms unaffected by resentencing. They conclude we must overrule\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In its Rule 1925(a) opinion, the trial court explained that it relied solely on this Court's decision in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   when it denied Appellants' petitions to enforce their plea agreements based on their violations of the terms of probation.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , in turn, is premised on an extension of the logic in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hainesworth\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Therefore, we must examine how the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   decision affects these and related precedents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In 2009, Hainesworth pled guilty to three counts of statutory sexual assault, three counts of indecent assault, and one count of criminal use of a communications facility. At the time he pled guilty, none of the above-listed crimes carried a sexual offender registration requirement. Thus, Hainesworth did not register as a sexual offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Thereafter, SORNA became effective in 2012. SORNA required sexual offender registration for additional crimes, including those for which Hainesworth remained on probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Hainesworth filed a motion seeking to preempt registration pursuant to SORNA, and the trial court entered an order stating Hainesworth was not subject to reporting requirements, due to the contractual nature of his plea bargain. On appeal, an\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   panel of this Court affirmed the trial court's order, holding that non-registration was an express term of Hainesworth's plea bargain. The panel reasoned that Hainesworth relinquished meaningful rights in exchange for the Commonwealth's proposed terms, and fundamental fairness bound the Commonwealth to those terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the appellant, in 2007, entered a no-contest plea to indecent assault of a person under the age of thirteen, corruption of minors, and endangering the welfare of children. At that time, Partee was subject to a ten-year sexual offender reporting requirement for those crimes under Megan's Law II. In 2010, the court\n   found Partee in violation of his probation, and resentenced him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   SORNA became effective in 2012; SORNA increased the term for Partee's registration to twenty-five years. Partee sought enforcement of the ten-year reporting term from his initial plea bargain, arguing that it was an essential term of his plea bargain under the contract interpretation theory from\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hainesworth\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   A three-judge panel of this Court agreed that Partee's plea bargain was structured to avoid a lifetime reporting requirement. Nevertheless, the panel found that the reasoning used in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hainesworth\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was inapposite, as Partee had violated the terms of his probation. Instead, the panel ruled that Partee could not seek specific performance where he effectively rescinded the plea bargain by violating his probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Without mention of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , our Supreme Court, in 2016, adopted the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hainesworth\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court's approach in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . The\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court agreed that plea agreements are contractual in nature, and that convicted offenders are entitled to specific performance of the registration terms in their plea agreements. Consequently, the Court rejected retroactive imposition of SORNA's sexual offender registration requirements on parties who accept and comply with a plea bargain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hainesworth\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   preceded\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . In 2007, Muniz was convicted of two counts of indecent assault of a person under thirteen years of age. At that time, Muniz would have been required to register as a sexual offender for ten years. However, Muniz absconded before sentencing, and was not apprehended and sentenced until 2014. At sentencing, the court ordered Muniz to comply with lifetime sexual offender registration requirements under SORNA. This Court affirmed Muniz's judgment of sentence. Muniz sought allowance of appeal in our Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Supreme Court granted allowance of appeal and examined the factors weighing in favor of finding SORNA punitive. Ultimately, the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court found the registration conditions of SORNA to be punitive. The Court held that retroactive application of SORNA's registration requirements constituted a violation of both the United States and Pennsylvania's constitutional provisions against\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   laws. Consequently, the Court deemed such retroactive applications unconstitutional and therefore invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, following the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   decision, the Supreme Court issued a\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   order in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Reed\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=614%20Pa.%20342\">\n    614 Pa. 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12320729\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/168/132/\">\n    168 A.3d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Reed contested the increase of his registration time under his plea bargain. The increase was due to retroactive application of SORNA requirements. A panel of this Court, pre-\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , determined that Reed was not entitled to relief. This Court found that unlike the appellant in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hainesworth\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , Reed entered his guilty plea knowing that he could later be required to register as a sexual offender for life, depending on the finding of the Sexual Offender Assessment Board. Thus, our Court held the registration term was not a negotiated part of his plea bargain. The Supreme Court issued a\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   order reversing that decision, based squarely on\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We find the facts of this case nearly identical to those in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Appellants failed to comply with the sentencing requirements of their plea bargains, but still attempt to enforce the terms of these agreements. However, in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , our Supreme Court held that the enhanced registration provisions of SORNA constitute punishment, and may not be applied retroactively. Therefore, the reclassifications of\n   the Appellants after the effective date of SORNA cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   To the extent the Commonwealth claims Appellants failed to demonstrate their plea agreements precluded lifetime registration,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   renders such a demonstration unnecessary. Following\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , SORNA's sexual offender requirements may not be imposed retroactively on any defendant, regardless of whether the defendant accepted a plea bargain or was convicted at trial. Even offenders who, like Appellants, were sentenced before SORNA became law, have since violated the terms of their probation, and have been resentenced, are not subject to retroactive application of SORNA's requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Pennsylvania Legislature has endeavored to solve the issue of how to treat these offenders by passing a law to replace the invalidated portions of SORNA.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   2018 Pa. Legis. Serv. Act 2018-29 (H.B. 1952) (approved June 12, 2018) (\"Act 29\"), amending Title 42 (Judicial Procedure) of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes. Though Act 29 was enacted during the pendency of this appeal, it became effective immediately. In relevant part, its purpose is to eradicate the unlawful retroactive portions of SORNA proscribed in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and instead impose lower periods of registration for offenders who committed applicable crimes between April 22, 1996, and December 20, 2012.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   42 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 9799.52. Rather than increasing Appellants' registration terms, the new law effectively places many of the listed crimes back in a ten-year registration category.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   42 PA.C.S.A. \u00a7 9799.55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Nevertheless, this Court rightly noted in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Super., filed July 11, 2018), that SORNA also enhanced registration conditions by adding requirements such as frequent in-person reporting and the publication of an offender's personal information online. The\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Horning\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   panel aptly identified these additional obligations as noncompliant with\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Problematically, though it reduces the term of years for which these offenders must register, the new Act does not address these additional, more stringent conditions required under SORNA from those imposed under the earlier versions of Megan's Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   However, the issue of the possible retroactive application of the legislature's new amendments to Appellants is not before us. The only issue raised by Appellants, and argued to the Court, was whether the reclassification under the then-existing version of SORNA, as applied to each Appellant, was lawful. Under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , we hold that the more onerous registration requirements under these reclassifications are barred. Unless and until the Pennsylvania State Police attempt to again reclassify Appellants, this time under Act 29, and this new reclassification is challenged, this issue is not before the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Consequently, we find\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   abrogates\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and hold Appellants are not subject to SORNA's retroactive registration increases.

In the intervening years, Megan's Law was replaced by SORNA, which imposed more onerous obligations than which existed at the time of Appellants' pleas. Appellants sought to avoid the more stringent requirements by filing motions seeking enforcement of the sexual offender registration obligations in effect at the time of their guilty pleas, based upon\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

This\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   panel was set to address whether\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   should be overruled. Rather than decide that issue, the learned Majority chooses to answer a wholly different question, namely, whether Appellants are now serving an illegal sentence due to the subsequent holding in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20Pa.%20699\">\n    640 Pa. 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323520\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/1189/\">\n    164 A.3d 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (OAJC), which declared SORNA to constitute punishment. The Majority does not address the fundamental restriction in our plea enforcement line of cases, which is that we could not reach issues pertaining to the legality of the sentences. We therefore lack jurisdiction to apply\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   retroactively, as the Majority has done. Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   decision to address Appellants' sentences is unnecessary, as the Legislature has amended SORNA and applied\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   retroactively. Finally, the Legislature enacted Act 10 to fill in the gap caused by the retroactive application of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Accordingly, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Preliminarily, I disagree with the Majority's framing of what is at issue in these appeals. The Majority states that the trial court \"ordered Appellants to comply with the new registration conditions and terms\n   assigned to their crimes under SORNA,\" and then elects to apply\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to these cases. \"We are constrained to order that under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the trial court may not increase their registration requirements under SORNA.\" Majority Opinion at 301-02. This characterization is incorrect. Appellants' SORNA obligations were imposed by the Legislature and the Pennsylvania State Police, not the trial court. The trial court simply denied motions seeking restoration of non-SORNA obligations as contained within their plea agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   has nothing to do with whether Appellants are entitled to restoration of their prior plea bargains. The specific question presented on appeal was: \"Whether Appellants' plea agreements should be enforced with respect to the length or fact of sexual offender registration where they violate a condition of probation?\" Appellants' brief at 2.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   did not abrogate\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   's holding that criminal defendants who breach their plea agreements by violating the terms of probation are not entitled to enforcement of their bargains. I would apply\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , which I believe was correctly decided, and hold that Appellants' breach of their agreement precludes enforcement of the earlier bargain. I would therefore affirm the orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   This resolution would theoretically leave the SORNA portions of Appellants' sentences intact, but for the subsequent legislative action, discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . The Majority endeavors to address that point, by avoiding the question presented on appeal and answering whether this Court should address the legality of Appellants' sentences by retroactively applying the holding in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . We do not have jurisdiction to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   These cases are appeals from orders denying motions to enforce plea agreements, and a critical point in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hainesworth\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and its progeny was whether such motions were subject to the PCRA, since, if so, such motions would have to comply with the PCRA's one-year time bar. The Majority declines to discuss how we may address the legality of Appellants' sentences in a non-PCRA setting by observing that there is \"no reason to conclude\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   overruled our jurisdiction to review the decisions of trial courts to enforce plea bargains, especially given\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\" Majority Opinion, at 307. Relatedly, the Majority states that \"we may correct an illegal sentence\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   so long as we maintain jurisdiction over the case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 308. I agree that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   did not overrule our jurisdiction to enforce plea agreements, but that is because\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   has nothing to do with plea agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Majority erroneously assumes that we may apply\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   's holding to these Appellants by asserting that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   abrogated\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . I agree with that statement insofar as\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   holds that requiring persons convicted of offenses without adequate notice of the SORNA obligations cannot be ordered to comply with SORNA. The problem, however, is that this conclusion does not supply an answer as to whether\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   's rule retroactively applies to these offenders. Our current precedents hold that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   does not satisfy the exception to the PCRA's one-year time bar pertaining to new constitutional rights.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Murphy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493403\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/180/402/\">\n    180 A.3d 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Super. 2018). Therefore, our Court continues to affirm judgments of sentence that are no less unconstitutional than Appellants' sentences. The existence of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Murphy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   disproves the Majority's statement\n   that \"reclassifications of the Appellants after the effective date of SORNA cannot stand.\" Majority Opinion at 310.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Murphy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   accepts that SORNA classifications may remain in place notwithstanding\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and we therefore cannot simply ignore\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   despite the fact that affirming on that basis raises the possibility of affirming a sentence that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   says is illegal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Therefore, the Majority seeks to apply\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   retroactively, without acknowledging the fact that the continuing existence of cases like\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Murphy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   means that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   would henceforth apply in a disparate fashion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fortunately, this issue is one we need not answer since the Legislature has already applied\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   retroactively. In response to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the General Assembly amended SORNA to include the following language: \"This subchapter shall apply to individuals who committed a sexually violent offense on or after December 20, 2012, for which the individual was convicted.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.11(d). That language has freed Appellants and all offenders who committed their crimes before SORNA was law from its punitive obligations, which is precisely what\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   demands. Thus, the Legislature has itself applied\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   retroactively and has abrogated\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Murphy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Additionally, effective February 21, 2018, the Legislature enacted Act 10, which added a new subchapter to SORNA, \"Continued Registration of Sexual Offenders.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9799.51 - 9799.75. The stated purpose of Act 10 was,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to address\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and it applies to the following individuals:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   This subchapter shall apply to individuals who were:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (1) convicted of a sexually violent offense committed on or after April 22, 1996, but before December 20, 2012, whose period of registration with the Pennsylvania State Police, as described in section 9799.55 (relating to registration), has not expired; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (2) required to register with the Pennsylvania State Police under a former sexual offender registration law of this Commonwealth on or after April 22, 1996, but before December 20, 2012, whose period of registration has not expired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Additionally, I note that the Majority declares that \"Appellants are instead subject to the original periods of sexual offender registration and conditions imposed at the time of their plea bargains, if applicable.\" Majority Opinion at 311. It is unclear what the opaque language \"if applicable\" means, and the Majority dispenses with the need to answer that question by claiming that the issue is not before us. The Majority has fashioned a kind of severability law by reviving the former obligations through judicial fiat.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   However, the issue of the possible retroactive application of the legislature's new amendments to Appellants is not before us. The only issue raised by Appellants, and argued to the Court, was whether the reclassification under the then-existing version of SORNA, as applied to each Appellant, was lawful. Under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , we hold that the more onerous registration requirements under these reclassifications are barred. Unless and until the Pennsylvania State Police attempt to again reclassify Appellants, this time under Act 29, and this new reclassification is challenged, this issue is not before the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Majority Opinion at 310 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Speaking to this point, it appears to me that the enabling legislation of SORNA may have eliminated all prior versions of Megan's Law.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.41 (listing provisions that shall expire on December 20, 2012);\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Nevertheless, the notion that some remnants of Megan's Law II survive in vestigial form seems questionable, and I am skeptical of an analytical framework that requires Appellants to comply with statutes that may no longer exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Finally, the Majority emphasizes that its disposition is simply giving Appellants what they asked for: the restoration of their prior obligations. However, the Appellants are not entitled to that relief under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Partee\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and, in any event, that relief was sough in a pre-\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   world. We do not know if Appellants herein would continue to ask for restoration of their prior bargains post-\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and the changes in law. It may be that some of these Appellants would pursue the theory outlined above, that in the absence of SORNA obligations,\n   <strong>\n    all\n   </strong>\n   prior obligations were eliminated. Or perhaps they would wish to pursue some other theory. The Majority has rendered an advisory opinion on this point, finding, without the benefit of any advocacy, that Appellants must comply with their previous obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \"[W]e have known that, from time to time, judicial decisions will leave a law in pieces.
