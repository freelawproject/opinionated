After review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On or about April 3, 1989, the Lehigh County Office of Adult Probation hired Renner as a \"Parole Officer.\" Complaint \u00b6 3. In July 2011, Renner disclosed to Sikora that he had been diagnosed with a serious medical condition as he was hospitalized at that time for said condition and subsequently absent from work on a medical leave for four to six weeks. During Renner's absence, Sikora called him several times to confirm that Renner's condition was legitimate. Upon Renner's return to work, Sikora and Surovy allegedly began treating him in a hostile manner which included: (1) telling Renner to resign or take a leave of absence; (2) suggesting that Renner was no longer capable of performing his job duties; (3) subjecting Renner to new cases in excess of a normal caseload and increasing his reviews; (4) requiring Renner to work without a functional laptop; (5) Sikora stopped working on charitable projects with Renner, restricting his communication purely for business purposes; and, (6) suggesting that Renner was faking his medical condition. Renner confronted Sikora about his hostile behavior, but Sikora refused to discuss the matter. Surovy requested that Renner be transferred out of Surovy's supervision, but Sikora denied the request. Renner also requested a transfer, but Court Administrator William Berndt refused his request. Sikora subsequently began insinuating that Renner was gay and made inappropriate and hostile comments about gay people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In October 2013, Sikora allegedly asked Renner to resign because of his medical condition. Instead, Renner opted to enter the employer sponsored employee assistance program (EAP). In March 2014, Sikora terminated Renner's employment for failing to administer a urine test to an offender under his supervision. Renner averred that the test was not required and his employment termination was pretextual. Renner protested his employment termination to Common Pleas Court's then President Judge Carol K. McGinley (Judge McGinley) who was the designated Appeals Officer under Lehigh County's Rules and Regulations. Judge McGinley allegedly refused to take any action. Thereafter, Renner could not obtain employment in any other court system. Renner therefore sought retraining as a Municipal Police Officer, and completed his Police Academy training on June 26, 2015. Renner was offered a job by Northampton and Fountain Hill Boroughs as a police officer. Renner's duties as a police officer required that he be available to appear in courts, including but not limited to Lehigh and Northampton Counties. Police officers are permitted to remain armed with their duty weapons while in the Lehigh County Courthouse. Through means unknown to Renner, Common Pleas Court and Lehigh County allegedly learned that Renner was to be hired as a police officer, and caused an order to be issued on October 1, 2015, banning him from possessing a firearm or Taser in the Lehigh County Courthouse, Old Courthouse and Government Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Allegedly, as a direct consequence of this action by Common Pleas Court and Lehigh County, Salisbury,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Northampton and Fountain Hill Boroughs rescinded their employment offers to Renner. Renner\n   appealed from Salisbury's rescission letter, and was given a hearing date of February 11, 2016. Renner's gun ban was allegedly rescinded on February 3, 2016, and as a condition of the ban's rescission, Common Pleas Court and Lehigh County allegedly required Renner to undergo a medical examination that is prohibited under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On or about February 11, 2016, Salisbury's Police Civil Service Commission upheld the rescission of Renner's job offer. Renner avers that Common Pleas Court and Lehigh County continue to interfere with his employment opportunities, including but not limited to, providing false and misleading job references to municipal police agencies. Fountain Hill Borough allegedly has refused to hire Renner based solely upon information supplied by Common Pleas Court and Lehigh County that Renner is not favored by the Lehigh County Judges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Renner believes that Common Pleas Court and Lehigh County provided information to Salisbury Township that resulted in its decision to uphold the rescission of his job offer. Renner alleges that Common Pleas Court and Lehigh County took no remedial action to prevent this discriminatory and retaliatory conduct, and permitted such conduct to continue unabated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 29, 2014, Renner filed a charge of unlawful discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which was dual-filed with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC), against Lehigh County Adult Probation, Sikora and Surovy. On November 10, 2016, Renner filed his Complaint in the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Common Pleas Court filed Preliminary Objections, along with a Brief in Support of Preliminary Objections, on December 16, 2016. Renner filed a response and Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Common Pleas Court's Preliminary Objections on December 22, 2016. The trial court held oral argument on June 2, 2017. On July 10, 2017, the trial court sustained the Preliminary Objections and dismissed all claims against Common Pleas Court with prejudice. Renner appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Initially, Renner intertwines his arguments by relying on\n   <em>\n    Court of Common Pleas of Erie County v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"466675\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/546/4/\">\n    546 Pa. 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7873224,466675,466748,7873093\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/682/1246/\">\n    682 A.2d 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996), as support for his position that the General Assembly in its enactment of the PHRA waived immunity for the common pleas courts and that the PHRA does not violate the separation of powers doctrine. However, to correctly apply\n   <em>\n    Erie County\n   </em>\n   it is important to understand its context. Before\n   <em>\n    Erie County\n   </em>\n   was decided, this Court issued\n   <em>\n    Allegheny County v. Wilcox\n   </em>\n   , 76 Pa.Cmwlth. 584,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=465%20A.2d%2047\">\n    465 A.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983), wherein it explained that because Section 4(b) of the PHRA's definition of employer does not specifically except the common pleas court from the PHRA's ambit, it was the legislature's intent that the common pleas court be subject to the PHRA. The\n   <em>\n    Allegheny County\n   </em>\n   Court further rejected the common pleas court's argument that the PHRC's action violated the separation of powers clause, holding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [U]nder the\n   <em>\n    facts of the case before us,\n   </em>\n   we do not believe that the [common pleas court] has carried its burden of establishing that the PHRA is unconstitutional. The [PHRC's] order does not direct the [common pleas court] to hire anyone into confidential employee positions or to fire such an employee. Rather, the [PHRC's] order merely requires the\n   <em>\n    upgrading\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    equalization\n   </em>\n   of pay, and it is clear that the courts can compel the appropriate legislative body to appropriate sums which are reasonably necessary for their proper operation and administration. We do not find, therefore, under the facts presented, any impairment of the independence or function of the [common pleas court].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Allegheny County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=465%20A.2d%2047\">\n    465 A.2d at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original; citations omitted). Thereafter, in\n   <em>\n    Erie County\n   </em>\n   , the Pennsylvania Supreme Court expounded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The present case, unlike [\n   <em>\n    Allegheny County\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   implicates a court's power to discharge its personnel. In order to carry out the duties delegated to the judiciary by the Constitution, the courts must retain the authority to select the people who are needed to serve in judicial proceedings and to assist judges in performing their judicial functions. By reviewing court personnel decisions, the PHRC would encroach upon this authority. The separation of powers doctrine thus prohibits the PHRC from hearing a discharged court employee's claim. Otherwise, the PHRC could potentially reinstate an employee terminated by the judiciary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Erie County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7873224,466675,466748,7873093\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/682/1246/\">\n    682 A.2d at 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Finally, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    First Judicial District of Pennsylvania v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"607128\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/556/258/\">\n    556 Pa. 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"607128,11634027\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/727/1110/\">\n    727 A.2d 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999), revisited\n   <em>\n    Allegheny County\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Erie County\n   </em>\n   , and clarified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   In [\n   <em>\n    Erie County\n   </em>\n   ], this [C]ourt held that 'in order to carry out the duties delegated to the judiciary by the Constitution, the courts must retain the authority to select the people who are needed to serve in judicial proceedings and to assist judges in performing their judicial duties.' [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] at 1248. In that case, the [PHRC] sought to assert jurisdiction over the [common pleas court] in a complaint alleging that a court employee was fired because of his race. Although we held that the [PHRC] had no jurisdiction in such a case because of the separation of powers doctrine, we did not reject the rationale [of\n   <em>\n    Allegheny County\n   </em>\n   ] wherein the Commonwealth Court had held that the [PHRC] may require a court to equalize pay in a gender discrimination suit under the [PHRA] without violating the separation of powers doctrine. Thus, the state of the law concerning the [PHRC's] jurisdiction following [\n   <em>\n    Erie County\n   </em>\n   ] could be summarized as allowing the [PHRC's] involvement in some aspects of court\n   personnel policies and practices, but not others. In order to discover whether a particular involvement was acceptable, the matter would have to be adjudicated to determine whether it was impermissibly invasive under the constitution.\n   <strong>\n    We now reject this view. Further, we hold that the\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    PHRC\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    has no jurisdiction, because of the separation of powers doctrine, to adjudicate any complaints against the judicial branch.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   This holding is only a logical extension of the holding in [\n   <em>\n    Erie County\n   </em>\n   ] that 'the separation of powers doctrine requires that judges retain the authority to select, discharge and supervise court employees.' [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] at 1247, citing\n   <em>\n    Bradley v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd.,\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1742131\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/479/440/\">\n    479 Pa. 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1742131\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/479/440/\">\n    388 A.2d 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ( [Pa.] 1978). It is self-evident that if the [PHRC] imposed methods of employee selection or supervision or discharge, or directed that certain working conditions rather than others must apply, judges would have lost the power to control these aspects of the operation of the courts. The fundamental error in [\n   <em>\n    Allegheny County\n   </em>\n   ] was not recognizing that a non-judicial agency's involvement in running the courts can never survive constitutional scrutiny, for no matter how innocuous the involvement may seem, the fact remains that if an agency of the executive branch instructs a court on its employment policies, of necessity, the courts themselves are not supervising their operations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    First Judicial District\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"607128,11634027\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/727/1110/\">\n    727 A.2d at 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   It is against this backdrop, we examine Renner's arguments. Renner first argues that the trial court erred by concluding that sovereign immunity barred his Complaint. Section 2310 of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972 (SCA), states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [I]t is hereby declared to be the intent of the General Assembly that the Commonwealth, and its officials and employees acting within the scope of their duties, shall continue to enjoy sovereign immunity and official immunity and remain immune from suit\n   <strong>\n    except as the General Assembly shall specifically waive the immunity\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2310 (emphasis added). Further, Section 8521(a) of the Judicial Code states: \"Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, no provision of this title shall constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity for the purpose of [Section 2310 of the SCA] (relating to sovereign immunity reaffirmed; specific waiver) or otherwise.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8521(a). Section 8522(a) of the Judicial Code provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The General Assembly, pursuant to [S]ection 11 of Article I of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, does hereby waive, in the instances set forth in subsection (b) ..., sovereign immunity as a bar to an action against Commonwealth parties, for damages arising out of a negligent act where the damages would be recoverable under the common law or a statute creating a cause of action if the injury were caused by a person not having available the defense of sovereign immunity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(a). This Court has summarized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The nine exceptions to sovereign immunity, as provided by [ Section 8522(b) of the Judicial Code ], are: (1) vehicle liability; (2) medical-professional liability; (3) care, custody or control of personal property; (4) Commonwealth real estate, highways and sidewalks; (5) potholes and other dangerous conditions; (6) care, custody and control of animals; (7) liquor store sales; (8) National Guard activities; and (9) toxoids and vaccines.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Heicklen v. Hoffman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11151513\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/761/207/\">\n    761 A.2d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209 n.7 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Renner contends that Section 4(b) of the PHRA which defines \"employer\" reveals\n   the General Assembly's intent to expressly waive sovereign immunity and make Common Pleas Court liable for its alleged unlawful discriminatory and retaliatory conduct. That Section provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    the Commonwealth or any political subdivision or board, department, commission or school district thereof and any person employing four or more persons within the Commonwealth\n   </strong>\n   , but except as hereinafter provided, does not include religious, fraternal, charitable or sectarian corporations or associations, except such corporations or associations supported, in whole or in part, by governmental appropriations. The term 'employer' with respect to discriminatory practices based on race, color, age, sex, national origin or non-job related handicap or disability, includes religious, fraternal, charitable and sectarian corporations and associations employing four or more persons within the Commonwealth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   43 P.S. \u00a7 954(b) (emphasis added). This Court in\n   <em>\n    Allegheny County\n   </em>\n   concluded that the above definition does include common pleas courts. However, it expressly rejected the common pleas court's sovereign immunity argument because it was not sufficiently argued in its brief, not because the General Assembly waived sovereign immunity by including common pleas court in the PHRA's definition of employer. Thus, the fact that the PHRA's definition of employer could be construed to include the common pleas court is not dispositive of the sovereign immunity issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Renner further relies upon\n   <em>\n    Erie County\n   </em>\n   in support of his argument that the legislature waived sovereign immunity for the common pleas court and thus, Common Pleas Court can be sued for unlawful employment discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Renner concedes that in\n   <em>\n    Erie County\n   </em>\n   , the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the separation of powers doctrine prohibits the PHRC from hearing a case involving the common pleas court's hiring or firing of personnel. However, Renner emphasizes that the\n   <em>\n    Erie County\n   </em>\n   Court continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [C]ourt employees who are discriminated against are not without recourse.

It is Renner's contention that this translates to a recognition that Common Pleas Court is not protected by sovereign immunity. Contrary to Renner's assertion, sovereign immunity was not before the Court in\n   <em>\n    Erie County\n   </em>\n   .
