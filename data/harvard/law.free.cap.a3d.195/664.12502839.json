We decline to overrule\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   , and conclude that the waiver of sovereign immunity under \u00a7 13a-144 extends to the actions of state employees other than those employed by the commissioner, but only to the extent that they are performing duties related to highway maintenance and the plaintiff proves that a relationship exists between the commissioner and the state employee such that the commissioner can be found to have breached his statutory duty to keep the highways, bridges, or sidewalks in repair. We further conclude that, in the present case, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the requisite relationship existed between the commissioner and the\n   state police. Accordingly, we reverse in part the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the relevant facts and procedural history. \"In the plaintiff's original complaint dated July 5, 2012, as later revised on May 29, 2014 ... he alleged that the [commissioner] has a statutory duty to keep and maintain all highways and bridges within the state highway system in a reasonably safe condition, and that that duty extends to Interstate 95, a public highway in that system. He further alleged that, in the early morning hours of December\n   12, 2011, employees, representatives and agents of the department became aware that the surface of Interstate 95 on the Gold Star Memorial Bridge had become icy and unreasonably dangerous, based upon reports they had received from the state police of numerous ice related accidents on the bridge that morning. The plaintiff alleged that later that morning, at 6:38 a.m., as he was driving his pickup truck in the northbound lanes of the bridge about one-tenth of one mile south of the New London-Groton town line, it slid on black ice, rolled over on its side and collided with a bridge structure, causing him serious injuries. The plaintiff alleged that the cause of his accident and resulting injuries [were due to the commissioner's] breach of his statutory duty to keep the bridge in a reasonably safe condition by failing to take adequate measures, in response to the notice he had received of its dangerous condition, either by treating its icy surface, placing or utilizing warning signs in the area to warn travelers of that dangerous condition, or closing the bridge entirely until that dangerous condition could be remedied. Finally, the plaintiff alleged that he had provided timely written notice to the [commissioner] of his intent to sue in connection with his accident and injuries within ninety days of their occurrence, as required by \u00a7 13a-144.\n   \"On September 12, 2012, the [commissioner] moved to dismiss the plaintiff's original complaint on the ground that the location of the accident specified in the plaintiff's written notice of intent to sue described an area so large that it failed to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 13a-144, in violation of the sovereign immunity doctrine. This motion was initially granted by the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Devine, J.\n   </em>\n   Thereafter, however, upon reconsideration of its ruling, the court determined that the language of the plaintiff's written notice was subject to at least one reasonable interpretation that could be found to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 13a-144. Concluding, on that basis, that the adequacy of the plaintiff's written notice to apprise the [commissioner] of the location of his accident and injuries was a disputed issue of fact that should be decided by the finder of fact at trial, the court vacated its initial ruling and denied the [commissioner's] motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Thereafter, on May 8, 2014, the [commissioner] moved for summary judgment on three grounds: (1) that he did not breach his statutory duty to keep and maintain the bridge in a reasonably safe condition on the morning of the plaintiff's accident because he lacked actual notice of the specific ice patch that caused that accident, and even if he had constructive notice of that ice patch, he lacked sufficient time after receiving such notice to remedy that ice patch before the plaintiff's accident occurred; (2) insofar as the plaintiff's written notice of intent to sue described the location of his accident, it failed to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 13a-144 ; and (3) that the plaintiff could not prove that the [commissioner's] breach of statutory duty under\n   \u00a7 13a-144, if any, was the sole proximate cause of his accident and resulting injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The [commissioner] supported his motion with a memorandum of law and several attached exhibits, including: sworn affidavits from four employees of his department, Peter Silva, James F. Wilson, Jay D'Antonio and Theodore Engel; an excerpt from the certified transcript\n   of the deposition of state police Trooper Robert D. Pierce, who responded to and investigated the plaintiff's accident; and copies of the plaintiff's written notice of intent to sue in connection with his accident, Trooper Pierce's police report concerning the accident, and the department's work log for the day of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The main thrust of the [commissioner's] argument on the first of his three grounds for seeking summary judgment, to which the trial court ultimately limited its decision on his motion, was that he did not breach his statutory duty to remedy the ice patch that caused the plaintiff's accident and injuries because, although his employees responded promptly to the first report they received of an ice related accident on the bridge that morning, they could not have reached the bridge with the necessary equipment and materials to treat its icy surface and make it reasonably safe for travel before the plaintiff's accident occurred. The department's call log showed, more particularly, that the department first was notified of icing on the bridge at 5:49 a.m. that morning, in a call from the state police to its Bridgeport operations center, of which Silva was the supervisor. That call reported that an ice related accident had occurred on the bridge at 5:40 a.m. The operations center responded to the call by implementing its standard protocol for responding to off-hour calls for service by calling D'Antonio, the supervisor of the department's maintenance garage in Waterford, which services the Gold Star Memorial Bridge, with instructions to call out a crew to salt the bridge. The Waterford garage, which\n   was then closed, routinely dispatched two man work crews, with one crew leader and one helper, to respond to off-hour calls for service. When crew members were called out to salt an icy bridge or highway, they had to drive in their own nonemergency vehicles to the garage, where the department's deicing equipment and materials were stored, open the garage with the crew leader's key, start and load the salting truck, then drive to the location where salting was to be performed. The garage had two crew leaders in December, 2011: Engel, who lived in Madison, approximately thirty to thirty-five minutes away from the garage when there was no traffic, and another unnamed person whose town of residence was not disclosed. D'Antonio assigned Engel to salt the bridge after the 5:40 a.m. accident was reported to him pursuant to his general practice of alternating off-hour call-outs between crew leaders so as not to 'unduly burden' either one of them in the busy winter season.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"After being called out at about 5:51 a.m. on December 12, 2011, Engel and his helper, William Grant, needed more than one hour to get to and open the garage, prepare and load a truck for salting operations and drive the truck to the bridge. By the time they reached the bridge, the plaintiff's accident had already occurred, and the state police, who had been on the bridge since before 6 a.m. responding to other accidents, had closed the bridge. On the basis of this evidence, the [commissioner] argued that he could not be held liable for the plaintiff's accident or injuries because he lacked sufficient time after receiving constructive notice of ice on the bridge at 5:49 a.m. to reach and treat the bridge before the plaintiff's accident occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Finally, the [commissioner] presented evidence, through Silva's sworn affidavit, that in addition to attempting to treat the bridge with salt on the morning of the plaintiff's accident, his employees attempted, at\n   6:23 a.m., to warn motorists approaching the bridge of its dangerous condition by illuminating electronic signboards positioned about one-tenth of one mile before\n   the start of the bridge in both directions, which read: 'Slippery Conditions. Use Caution.' The plaintiff, he contended, had to drive by one such illuminated signboard when he drove his truck onto the bridge approximately fifteen minutes later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The plaintiff opposed the [commissioner's] motion for summary judgment with his own memorandum of law and accompanying exhibits, including: an excerpt from the certified transcript of the deposition of Diana Dean, the driver who had been involved in the first ice related accident reported to the [commissioner] on the morning of the plaintiff's accident; the police report concerning the Dean accident, which was written by state police Trooper Christopher Sottile, who had responded to and investigated that accident before the plaintiff's accident that morning; an excerpt from the certified transcript of the deposition of Engel, the crew leader who had been called out to treat the bridge after the Dean accident; the sworn affidavit of Silva, the supervisor of the department's operations center in Bridgeport, who described the department's standard protocol for responding to off-hour calls and averred that the previously described electronic signboards had been illuminated before the plaintiff's accident; the plaintiff's own sworn affidavit describing his accident and the events leading up to it; another excerpt from the certified transcript of the deposition of Trooper Pierce, as to his investigation of the plaintiff's accident; the police report of Trooper Pierce concerning the plaintiff's accident; and work logs for the Waterford garage on the day of Dean's and the plaintiff's accidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The plaintiff relied on these submissions to raise issues of fact as to several aspects of the [commissioner's] initial ground for seeking summary judgment. First,\n   Dean testified and [Trooper] Sottile wrote in his police report that when [Dean's] accident occurred at 5:40 a.m. on the morning of the plaintiff's accident, the entire surface of the roadway on the northbound side of the bridge was covered with black ice, which caused her vehicle to spin out of control in the right lane of the five lane bridge and continue spinning all the way across the bridge until it crashed into the cement barrier on the opposite side of the roadway. Second, the plaintiff averred in his affidavit and Trooper Pierce confirmed in his police report that when the plaintiff's accident occurred almost one hour after the Dean accident, the entire surface of the roadway on the northbound side of the bridge was still completely covered with black ice. Third, Engel testified, based upon his three years of experience working at the Waterford garage in the winter, that when the outside temperature falls below freezing, the surface of the Gold Star Memorial Bridge, unlike those of other nearby bridges, is prone to freezing over completely, with black ice of the kind he saw on the morning of December 12, 2011, due to the recurring presence of ice fog in the area. The [commissioner's] work logs confirmed that the air temperature at 6 a.m. on that date was 27 degrees Fahrenheit, and the surface temperature of the roadway was 24 degrees Fahrenheit. Fourth, although Silva averred in his affidavit that electronic signboards warning of slippery conditions on the bridge had been illuminated before the plaintiff drove onto the bridge on the morning of his accident, both the plaintiff and Engel swore that they had not seen any such warning signs when they drove onto the northbound lanes of the bridge several minutes later. Fifth, shortly after the plaintiff's accident took place, the state police closed the northbound lanes of the bridge entirely until its icy surface could be treated by department personnel.\n   \"In light of the foregoing evidence, the plaintiff claimed that the [commissioner] was not entitled to\n   summary judgment on the first ground raised in his motion because the reasonableness of a [commissioner's] response to notice he receives of ice on a bridge or highway is a multifactorial factual issue that must typically be decided by the finder of fact at trial. Here, in particular, the plaintiff claimed that he had presented evidence raising several genuine issues of material fact about factors upon which the ultimate resolution of that issue in this case depends. Those issues included: whether the [commissioner] had actual notice of the dangerous icing condition that caused [the plaintiff's] accident and injuries based upon the reported observations by the state police of black ice covering the entire northbound surface of the bridge from almost one hour before the plaintiff's accident until the state police responded to it well after it occurred; whether, in light of the magnitude of the danger presented by the pervasive icing condition of which the [commissioner] had notice, as evidenced by the numerous ice related accidents it had caused in subfreezing weather conditions known to cause icing due to ice fog, it was reasonable for the [commissioner] to call out [people from] a work crew that predictably could not reach the bridge and treat it until more than one hour after they were first called out; whether, if [people from] a work crew called out to treat the bridge could not reasonably be expected to treat it for more than one hour after they were first called out, adequate measures were taken in the interim to warn motorists still using it of its dangerous icing condition before that condition was remedied; and whether, if the bridge could not be treated more quickly and the motoring public could not be warned more effectively of its dangerous condition before it was treated, the bridge should have been closed to all traffic before, not after, the plaintiff's accident. In light of those open, contested issues, the plaintiff insisted that the reasonableness of the [commissioner's] response to the\n   black ice condition reported to the department before the plaintiff's accident presented a genuine issue of material fact that should be decided by the finder of fact at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"On January 12, 2015, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Cole-Chu, J.\n   </em>\n   , heard oral argument on the [commissioner's] motion for summary judgment, at which the foregoing arguments were presented. Thereafter, on May 12, 2015, the trial court granted the [commissioner's] motion for summary judgment. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court held that 'despite ... the drawing of inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party ... the court concludes that the [commissioner] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court cannot conclude that the [commissioner] had actual notice of the black ice condition which caused the plaintiff's accident before the report of that accident. Even treating the black ice on the bridge in general as the defect which caused the plaintiff's accident and treating the black ice accident on the same bridge fifty minutes before the plaintiff's accident as constructive notice to the [commissioner] of that defect, the court finds as a matter of law that the [commissioner's] response time was reasonable. Indeed, the plaintiff does not contend otherwise, other than by claiming that the [commissioner] should have anticipated the black ice condition.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Footnotes added and omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Transportation\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487874\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1147/#p611\">\n    168 Conn.

Extending \u00a7 13a-144 to include the negligence of any state employee,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   otherwise engaged in highway maintenance and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   in a\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   type relationship with the commissioner, constitutes an expansion of potential liability on the state that is not within the clear reach of the statute. It cannot be that \u00a7 13a-144 waives sovereign immunity as to the commissioner for the actions of any state employee without regard to whether that employee was engaged in the business that it is the commissioner's duty to oversee; that would be far too broad and attenuated from the highway maintenance purpose of the statute.

At most, the limited relevant information in Silva's affidavit establishes that, at times, the state police call the operations center. There is no evidence that this is their duty to do so or that such calls are made as part of a formal procedure between the state police and the commissioner. In addition to calls from the police, the operations center receives calls from the public reporting defects. Thus, it is not even clear whether the police call in their official capacity or as members of the concerned public.

But the plain language of the waiver contained in \u00a7 13a-144 sweeps broadly, reaching allegations of neglect or default \"of the state or any of its employees,\" and not just of the department, its employees or those with a relationship to the commissioner. In contrast, the legislature took pains to limit otherwise broad language within the same statute. For example, the broad term, \"[a]ny person injured,\" is limited by the manner (\"through the neglect or default\") and means (\"by means of any defective highway\") of the injury.

Rather, recalling that the issue on appeal in\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   was whether the jury was properly instructed that \"negligence on the part of the state police could provide a basis for finding the defendant liable under \u00a7 13a-144\"; id., at 166,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20A.2d%20190\">\n    520 A.2d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the court in\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   concluded only that state police officers sometimes performed duties relating to highway maintenance, and that \"neglect or default of the state police in safeguarding the hazardous ice condition ... provided a basis for the defendant's liability under \u00a7 13a-144.\" Id., at 171,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20A.2d%20190\">\n    520 A.2d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To prove liability, the plaintiff would still have to establish at trial that the state police breached any duty owed to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In my view, the question of duty on the part of the state police is distinct from and not dispositive of the first certified question, which concerns the scope of the sovereign immunity waiver. Rather, the question of duty falls within the ambit of the second certified question, which the majority does not reach in favor of its sovereign immunity ruling. If indeed the state police had a duty to close the road in this case, I believe the plaintiff should have the opportunity\n   to prove a breach of that duty at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Because I believe that the majority has mixed sovereign immunity (the first certified question) with the concepts of duty and breach (the second certified question), I do not feel compelled in this opinion to measure whether the evidence was sufficient in this case to demonstrate that the state police had a duty to close the bridge or breached that duty. It bears emphasis, however, that the Appellate Court noted that the record contains evidence that \"the state police have the authority to close the road if they believe it is in the interest of public safety to do so.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487874\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1147/#p611\">\n    Id., at 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487874\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1147/#p611\">\n    148 A.3d 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Also, the record contains evidence that the \"[d]epartment relies on calls into its highway operations centers during off hours to advise it of road conditions,\" and that \"off-hour calls ... come predominately from state and local police,\" who \"are advised to call the operations center\" when conditions require the department's response. In my\n   view, the plaintiff should be afforded the chance to develop this evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The majority worries that if we construe the statute's waiver of sovereign immunity to include the factual scenario in this case, the \"floodgates\" will open and plaintiffs will bring claims about the neglect of all sorts of state employees, thereby subjecting the state to additional-and perhaps fanciful-lawsuits. I don't see it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Although I suppose it is (and has been) true under\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   that an allegation that the failure of a Department of Social Services employee, a correction officer or a judge(!) to take some action to close a highway could fall within the scope of the waiver of sovereign immunity (\"neglect or default of the state or any of its employees\"), I am hard-pressed to think of an instance in which such specious allegations could state a claim that might lead to liability. Again, in my view, the majority infuses the concept of duty into the question of the scope of a sovereign immunity waiver. In those clearly more attenuated situations the majority imagines, it is unlikely those state employees or officers would have any duty to keep the highway in repair. Although this might necessitate the commissioner's having to file a motion to strike based on lack of duty; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Jarmie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Troncale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20578\">\n    306 Conn. 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 580,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20802\">\n    50 A.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (affirming trial court's granting of motion to strike based on lack of duty); rather than a motion to dismiss based on sovereign immunity, that is only because of the legislature's exercise of its prerogative to enact a broad waiver of the state's sovereign immunity.

Even\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   itself, in construing the waiver as reaching state employees\n   beyond the department, limited that waiver to the negligence of only those employees \"performing duties related to highway maintenance.\"\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498027\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/202/158/\">\n    202 Conn. at 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20A.2d%20190\">\n    520 A.2d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Moreover, as the commissioner admits candidly in his brief, the sovereign immunity question he advances is not about the state's ultimate fiscal liability: it is about deflecting responsibility for certain lawsuits to a different forum (i.e., the Claims Commissioner instead of the Superior Court) or to a different agency (i.e., the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection instead of the Department of Transportation). As discussed in part V, I do not believe that the statute's plain language reflects an expressed concern by the legislature about which agency\n   would be named a defendant, but instead was intended to provide a forum for all motorists injured by the negligence of \"the state or any of its employees ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Even when it comes to interpreting sovereign immunity waivers, which are narrowly construed, I do not \"presume that the legislature intended [a] bizarre and potentially inequitable result.\"\n   <em>\n    Lyon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5764311\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/384/\">\n    291 Conn. 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404 n.10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=968%20A.2d%20416\">\n    968 A.2d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).

But in my view, the legislature's acquiescence is also informed by the way the executive branch has treated\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, the commissioner in the present case-an executive branch official-has argued that\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided and should be overruled. Accordingly, this argument demonstrates the commissioner's own understanding that the Appellate Court's ruling was true to\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   ; it signals that this is the interpretation the state has relied on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   More than thirty years have passed since this court decided\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   , more than ample time for us to conclude that the legislature has acquiesced in\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   's holding.

Concluding that the statute waives sovereign immunity for the neglect or default of\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    state employee is problematic for two reasons. First, this interpretation renders meaningless the requirement that a plaintiff bringing an action under \u00a7 13a-144 must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the commissioner \"actually knew of the particular defect or ... should have known of that defect.\"\n    <em>\n     Ormsby\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Frankel\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1120080\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/255/670/#p675\">\n     255 Conn. at 675-76\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=768%20A.2d%20441\">\n     768 A.2d 441\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Such a reading would impute to the commissioner the observations of possibly thousands of state employees who might drive past a defect. Second, this interpretation greatly expands the interpretation of \u00a7 13a-144 set forth by this court in\n    <em>\n     Lamb\n    </em>\n    , and particularly the court's explicit statement that \u00a7 13a-144 waives sovereign immunity for the neglect of the state or any of its employees \"\n    <em>\n     at least when performing duties related to highway maintenance\n    </em>\n    .\" (Emphasis added.)\n    <em>\n     Lamb\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Burns\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498027\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/202/158/\">\n     202 Conn. at 169\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20A.2d%20190\">\n     520 A.2d 190\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Finally, the dissent's reading of \u00a7 13a-144 is inconsistent with the well established principle under which we construe waivers of sovereign immunity strictly in favor of the state.

The dissent's interpretation of \u00a7 13a-144 would defeat that aspect of sovereign immunity that protects the state from suit except in the narrow instances carved out by the legislature. As we have explained, \"[t]he practical and logical basis of [sovereign immunity is] that the\n    <em>\n     subjection of the state\n    </em>\n    ...\n    <em>\n     to private litigation might constitute a serious interference with the performance of\n    </em>\n    [\n    <em>\n     its\n    </em>\n    ]\n    <em>\n     functions\n    </em>\n    ....\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Horton\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Meskill\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"507234\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/172/615/#p624\">\n     172 Conn. at 624\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=376%20A.2d%20359\">\n     376 A.2d 359\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

No such action shall be brought except within two years from the date of such injury, nor unless notice of such injury and a general description of the same and of the cause thereof and of the time and place of its occurrence has been given in writing within ninety days thereafter to the commissioner. Such action shall be tried to the court or jury, and such portion of the amount of the judgment rendered therein as exceeds any amount paid to the plaintiff prior thereto under insurance liability policies held by the state shall, upon the filing with the Comptroller of a certified copy of such judgment, be paid by the state out of the appropriation for the commissioner for repair of highways; but no costs or judgment fee in any such action shall be taxed against the defendant. This section shall not be construed so as to relieve any contractor or other person, through whose neglect or default any such injury may have occurred, from liability to the state; and, upon payment by the Comptroller of any judgment rendered under the provisions of this section, the state shall be subrogated to the rights of such injured person to recover from any such contractor or other person an amount equal to the judgment it has so paid. The commissioner, with the approval of the Attorney General and the consent of the court before which any such action is pending, may make an offer of judgment in settlement of any such claim. The commissioner and the state shall not be liable in damages for injury to person or property when such injury occurred on any highway or part thereof abandoned by the state or on any portion of a highway not a state highway but connecting with or crossing a state highway, which portion is not within the traveled portion of such state highway. The requirement of notice specified in this section shall be deemed complied with if an action is commenced, by a writ and complaint setting forth the injury and a general description of the same and of the cause thereof and of the time and place of its occurrence, within the time limited for the giving of such notice.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    See footnote 2 of the majority opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    For example, under the majority's interpretation of the statute and\n    <em>\n     Lamb\n    </em>\n    , if the state police indeed had a duty to close the bridge, the plaintiff, rather than being able to bring an action under the defective highway statute's sovereign immunity waiver, would have to present a \"claim\" to the Claims Commissioner alleging negligence on the part of the state police. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-141 et seq. Rather than having the benefit of the two year statute of limitations under \u00a7 13a-144, the plaintiff would face a one year statute of limitations with the Claims Commissioner. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-148.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Exactly what a plaintiff would have to establish at this hearing is not clear. The statute offers no guidance and the majority offers only that a plaintiff can establish this relationship by providing evidence of \"custom,\" \"usual procedure,\" \"formal procedure,\" whether the commissioner \"availed\" himself of the police, and whether the police had \"assumed\" the duty. Whether these factors are exhaustive or are mandatory predicates is not clear, nor to what extent a plaintiff can rely on traditional tort law principles and case law regarding duty.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Both the commissioner and the majority rely on language from our decision in\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Burns\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566586\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/307/#p323\">\n     213 Conn. 307\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%201195\">\n     567 A.2d 1195\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1990), that reads: \"[T]he terms 'neglect' and 'default' refer\n    <em>\n     solely to that action or failure to act by the commissioner\n    </em>\n    which triggers liability for breach of his statutory duty to\n    <em>\n     repair and maintain\n    </em>\n    the state highway.\" (Emphasis added.) Id., at 323,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%201195\">\n     567 A.2d 1195\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    goes on to say that \"[t]he commissioner ... is the\n    <em>\n     only one\n    </em>\n    upon whom is imposed the duty\n    <em>\n     to repair\n    </em>\n    under \u00a7 13a-144.\" (Emphasis altered.) Id., at 326,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%201195\">\n     567 A.2d 1195\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The majority concludes from these two quotations: \"In other words, under \u00a7 13a-144, the commissioner alone is responsible for the maintenance of the state's highways and, accordingly, he alone is liable for a breach of that duty.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    I do not agree with the conclusion the majority draws from this language. First, the only neglect or default at issue in\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    was the commissioner's; the court did not have to address the neglect or default of other state agencies or employees, as was at issue in\n    <em>\n     Lamb\n    </em>\n    . Thus,\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    in no way considers the broader language, \"the state or any of its employees,\" while considering the commissioner's duties and, of course, does not in any way suggest that it overruled\n    <em>\n     Lamb\n    </em>\n    . Second,\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    was only about \"sole proximate cause\" and not about the scope of the legislature's waiver of sovereign immunity.\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Burns\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566586\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/307/#p323\">\n     213 Conn. at 327\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%201195\">\n     567 A.2d 1195\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Finally, this syllogism does not work. It might be true that the commissioner has a duty to\n    <em>\n     repair and maintain\n    </em>\n    the state's highways; and he\n    <em>\n     alone\n    </em>\n    may have a duty to\n    <em>\n     repair\n    </em>\n    the state's highways. But that does not mean he alone has \"duties related to highway maintenance.\"\n    <em>\n     Lamb\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Burns\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498027\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/202/158/\">\n     202 Conn. at 169\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20A.2d%20190\">\n     520 A.2d 190\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Construing the phrase from\n    <em>\n     Lamb\n    </em>\n    , \"at least when performing duties related to highway maintenance\";\n    <extracted-citation index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20A.2d%20190\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; the majority assumes that \"at least\" imposes a minimum condition. But the phrase can also mean \"if nothing else\" or \"in any case.\" The former means that the condition is necessary while the latter means that it is merely sufficient. I read\n    <em>\n     Lamb\n    </em>\n    to contemplate the latter because we know from that case that at certain times, department officials or employees are not available, and others may be responsible for \"duties related to highway maintenance\" to make our roads safe for motorists.\n    <em>\n     Lamb\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Burns\n    </em>\n    , supra, at 169,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20A.2d%20190\">\n     520 A.2d 190\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
