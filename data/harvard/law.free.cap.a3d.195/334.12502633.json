(Turf Club) petitions this Court for review of the Pennsylvania Department of Health's (Department) November 16, 2017 Final Agency Determination and Order (Determination) denying Turf Club's application for an exception (Exception Application) to the general public smoking ban under the Clean Indoor Air Act (CIAA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The issue before this Court is whether the Department erred by concluding that Turf Club is not a \"drinking establishment\" as that phrase is defined by the CIAA. After review, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The facts of this case are not in dispute. Turf Club operates an off-track pari-mutuel wagering facility in Oaks, Pennsylvania, which sells and serves alcohol pursuant to a restaurant liquor license originally held by Bensalem Racing Association, Inc. (Bensalem), and subsequently transferred to Turf Club in late 2016 or early 2017. Turf Club applied to the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB) for a new restaurant liquor license to cover its recently-built Oaks facility. The PLCB approved the application on January 15, 2016, and issued Turf Club License No. OWR-44.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 8a-10a, 59a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 25, 2017, Turf Club applied to the Department's Bureau of Health Promotion and Risk Reduction (Bureau) for a CIAA exception to allow smoking in its new facility because it is a Type I Drinking Establishment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 3a-11a. On July 10, 2017, based solely on the record without a hearing, the Bureau denied the Exception Application because \"[t]he CIAA does not provide for an establishment exception to be granted to the holder of an Off-Track Wagering Restaurant (OWR) liquor license.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.R. at 38a. On November 16, 2017, the Department issued its Determination, upholding the Bureau's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 92a-108a.

Accordingly, the CIAA authorizes the Department to grant an exception to permit smoking at \"drinking establishment[s].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Turf Club argues that the Department erred by concluding that it does not qualify as a Type I Drinking Establishment. Turf Club specifically asserts that the Department improperly interpreted Section 2(1) of the CIAA and added statutory requirements not found therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In its Determination, the Department made the following undisputed findings of fact (FOF):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 \"Turf Club, with its [Exception A]pplication, enclosed [ ] approval letters issued by the PLCB on January 15, 2016 ....

Notwithstanding,\n   the Department concluded that \"Turf Club fail[ed] to meet its burden of pro[ving] that it is entitled to a [Type I] Drinking Establishment [e]xception under [Section 3(b)(10) of the CIAA].\" Determination at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Department contends that, although\n   <strong>\n    Turf Club\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <strong>\n    has total annual sales of food sold for on-premises consumption of less than or equal to 20% of the combined gross sales of the establishment\n   </strong>\n   [,]\" 35 P.S. \u00a7 637.2(1)(ii) (emphasis added),\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <strong>\n    does not permit individuals under 18 years of age\n   </strong>\n   [,]\" 35 P.S. \u00a7 637.2(1)(iii) (emphasis added), Turf Club does not possess the type of liquor license that satisfies the CIAA's requirements for a Type I Drinking Establishment exception. Consequently,\n   <strong>\n    this Court must determine whether, as Section 2(1)(i) of the CIAA requires, the Turf Club\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <strong>\n    operates pursuant to\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    a\n   </strong>\n   ] ...\n   <strong>\n    restaurant liquor license\n   </strong>\n   ...\n   <strong>\n    under the\n   </strong>\n   ...\n   <strong>\n    Liquor Code\n   </strong>\n   [.]\" 35 P.S. \u00a7 637.2(1)(i) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At the outset, in order to sell liquor or malt or brewed beverages for on-premises consumption, an entity must hold a PLCB-issued retail liquor license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sections 401(a) and 491(1) of the Liquor Code, 47 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4-401(a), 4-491(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sections 401(a) and 403(a) of the Liquor Code generally limit the retail sales of liquor and malt or brewed beverages to hotel, restaurant and club licensees and other licenses and permits derived therefrom.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   47 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4-401(a), 4-403(a). Section 102 of the Liquor Code defines \"restaurant,\" in pertinent part, as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   a reputable place operated by responsible persons of good reputation and habitually and\n   <strong>\n    principally used for the purpose of providing food for the public\n   </strong>\n   , the place to have an area within a building of not less than four hundred square feet, equipped with tables and\n   chairs, including bar seats, accommodating at least thirty persons at one time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   47 P.S. \u00a7 1-102 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Neither the Liquor Code nor the PLCB's Regulations specifically provide for or define an off-track wagering restaurant liquor license. Notwithstanding, Section 405 of the Liquor Code authorizes pari-mutuel wagering facilities that wish to offer alcohol for sale on their premises to apply for restaurant licenses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Every application for a\n   <strong>\n    restaurant liquor license for a nonprimary\n   </strong>\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   <strong>\n    pari-mutuel wagering location\n   </strong>\n   or a racetrack shall be accompanied by an applicant's fee of five thousand dollars ($5,000) for the first year of a licensing period. Thereafter, the nonprimary pari-mutuel wagering location or the racetrack shall be\n   <strong>\n    subject to the above[-]stated fees for restaurant licenses\n   </strong>\n   for each year of a licensing period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   47 P.S. \u00a7 4-405(e) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Here, the Department specifically found based on clear record evidence that Turf Club applied for and indeed obtained such an off-track wagering\n   <em>\n    restaurant liquor license\n   </em>\n   . Nevertheless, the Department claims that Turf Club's off-track wagering restaurant liquor license is not a restaurant liquor license because it is a distinct license that is treated differently than other restaurant liquor licenses. The Department further contends, based upon its statutory interpretation of the CIAA, that if Turf Club's primary purpose was anything other than wagering, it would not have been issued an off-track wagering restaurant liquor license. Turf Club counters that the type of restaurant liquor license it holds is irrelevant for purposes of the CIAA or the Liquor Code, since the Liquor Code does not recognize it as distinct from a restaurant liquor license issued for any other type of facility or specifically define an off-track wagering restaurant liquor license. This appears to be an issue of first impression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Resorting to the Statutory Construction Act of 1972 (Statutory Construction Act),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Department analyzed what the General Assembly\n   <em>\n    may have\n   </em>\n   intended by the term \"drinking establishment\" in Section 3(b)(10) of the CIAA. The Department relied upon the separate dictionary definitions of \"drinking\" and \"establishment\" to conclude that \"the principle line of business at a drinking establishment is the service of alcoholic beverage[s] to its patrons\" and, thus, for a drinking establishment to qualify for a smoking ban exception under Section 3(b)(10) of the CIAA, it must \"be a public place where the intake of alcoholic beverage[s] [i]s the primary business activity.\" Determination at 11. The Department concluded that since \"Turf Club is primarily an off-track betting establishment, with liquor and food tangentially part of the business[,]\" the General Assembly did not intend for it to qualify for the smoking ban exception. Determination at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has [ ] made clear:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    v.

Accordingly, this Court need only decide whether the Department erred in concluding that Turf Club does not \"operate[ ] pursuant to\" a PLCB-issued \"restaurant liquor license[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   35 P.S. \u00a7 637.2(1)(i). We begin with the binding definition of \"drinking establishment\" in Section 2(1) of the CIAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Liquor Code reflects the General Assembly's intent that certain entities not typically thought of as \"restaurants\" may obtain restaurant liquor licenses. For instance, just as Section 405 of the Liquor Code authorizes the PLCB to issue restaurant liquor licenses for nonprimary pari-mutuel wagering locations, Section 413(a) of the Liquor Code authorizes the PLCB \"to issue a restaurant liquor license to performing arts facilities[,]\" 47 P.S. \u00a7 4-413(a), and Section 414 of the Liquor Code allows continuing care retirement communities to obtain restaurant liquor licenses,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   47 P.S. \u00a7 4-414, even though they are not typically considered businesses \"principally used for the purpose of providing food for the public[.]\" 47 P.S. \u00a7 1-102. As it does for other non-traditional restaurant entities, the Liquor Code simply states that an off-track wagering company may obtain a restaurant liquor license to sell alcoholic beverages at its premises. Accordingly, despite that the PLCB issues restaurant liquor licenses to varying business entities and gives them specific subset designations related thereto (specifically, Off-Track Wagering Restaurant (OWR)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   liquor license rather than Restaurant (R) liquor license), the Liquor Code itself does not grant to them anything other than restaurant liquor licenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   If it was the General Assembly's intent, as the Department claims, to preclude off-track wagering restaurant liquor licenses from restaurant liquor licenses and/or to distinguish them from other restaurant liquor licenses as not \"operat[ing] pursuant to [a] ... restaurant liquor license ... under the ... Liquor Code[,]\" 35 P.S. \u00a7 637.2(1)(i), it was clearly within its authority to so state, but it did not. Moreover, since this Court lacks the authority to expand statutes beyond their terms, we must decline to superimpose a specificity requirement into the Liquor Code for restaurant liquor licenses that does not exist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weaver v.

Because Turf Club \"operates pursuant to\" a PLCB-issued \"restaurant liquor license[,]\" 35 P.S. \u00a7 637.2(1)(i), Turf Club satisfied the three requirements to qualify as a \"drinking establishment\" under Section 2(1) of the CIAA.
