Because the defendant failed to make an offer of proof regarding how the witness would have responded to any question about the alleged misconduct, we conclude that the record is inadequate to review that claim and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   resided in the third floor apartment of a multifamily home on Park Street in Manchester. The victim's apartment had two entrances. One was located on the exterior of the house and could be reached by a fire escape. That entrance opened into the apartment's living room. The second entrance was through an interior door that opened into a hallway\n   near the bedroom and could be reached by a common interior staircase. The defendant lived near the victim, and had walked past the victim's residence on occasion, but never previously had been on or inside the premises or met the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 18, 2014, sometime during the early morning hours, the defendant entered the victim's apartment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant found the victim in her bedroom where she lay sleeping and he forced her to engage in vaginal intercourse. He then repeatedly and fatally struck the victim in the head with a ceramic ashtray, causing\n   her to suffer multiple skull fractures. After she died, the defendant poured lighter fluid on her and ignited it in an attempt to destroy evidence of his crimes. The fire caused significant burns to the victim's genital region and face, and destroyed her mattress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the victim's landlord, who lived in one of the other apartments in the residence, was awoken by a smoke detector alarm. She looked up the interior staircase and saw smoke coming from underneath the victim's interior door. After placing an emergency call, she entered the victim's apartment through the exterior door, which was unlocked, but she was forced to retreat to the exterior staircase landing because of heavy smoke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   First responders began arriving at the residence shortly after 5 a.m. After the fire was extinguished, investigators discovered the victim's badly burned corpse on her bed. The victim was wearing only a single sock and a long sleeve garment that had been bunched up around her shoulders. Between the victim's legs, investigators discovered a partially melted plastic container that was consistent with packaging used to hold igniter fluid for cigarette lighters. A police dog trained to detect accelerants alerted to evidentiary materials\n   taken from the victim's shoulder and groin areas, as well as the victim's bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The police collected a number of items of evidence from the crime scene, including a heavy ceramic ashtray, on which it later was determined there were traces of the victim's hair and blood, and two DNA swabs taken from the interior doorknob of the living room door that exited onto the fire escape. During the autopsy of the body, a biological sample was collected from inside the victim's vaginal cavity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant concedes that the DNA sample collected from the doorknob swabs came from him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state laboratory tested the doorknob DNA sample and determined that it contained a mixture of DNA from two or more individuals. After comparison with a known DNA sample of the victim's blood collected during the autopsy, the victim was identified as a contributor of some of the DNA. Another contributor was determined to be male and, after comparing the DNA profile of that contributor with those contained in a state database of other unidentified DNA profiles and known DNA profiles from convicted offenders, it was found to match a known profile of the defendant. The known DNA sample of the defendant was then submitted to the state laboratory for additional testing and comparison with the DNA evidence collected in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The state laboratory determined that the doorknob DNA was consistent with that of the defendant or\n   another male member of his paternal lineage. The expected frequency of individuals other than the defendant who could have been a contributor to the doorknob DNA was less than one in seven billion in the African American, Caucasian and Hispanic populations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The laboratory also identified the defendant as a contributor to the DNA obtained from the swab of the victim's vaginal cavity,\n   albeit with far less statistical certainty than that attributed to the doorknob DNA. More specifically, the DNA that was detected on the vaginal swab was determined to contain male DNA that consisted of a mixture of sperm-rich cells and epithelial skin-rich cells. That DNA was determined to be consistent with that of the defendant or another member of his male paternal lineage. The random probability that an individual other than the defendant (or another member of his male paternal lineage) was a source of the DNA material extracted from the skin rich cells was 1 in 1900 in the Caucasian population, 1 in 1100 in the African American population and 1 in 870 in the Hispanic population. The random probability that an individual other than the defendant (or another member of his male paternal lineage) was a source of the DNA material extracted from the sperm rich cells was 1 in 8 in the Caucasian population, 1 in 3 in the African American population, and 1 in 10 in the Hispanic population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As a result of having obtained the defendant's name in connection with the DNA evidence collected, the police began an investigation of the defendant to determine whether he had any connection to the victim, her family or the location of the murder. No connections were found. The police later obtained a warrant to search the defendant's Facebook records. Those records included a message that the defendant sent at 4:26 on the morning of the murder to a close friend, John Paul Torres, stating, \"[y]o, we need to talk, asap.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The police also interviewed Torres. Although he provided no useful information during the initial interview, he contacted the police at a later date and disclosed that the defendant had confessed to him that he had killed the victim and set her on fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant was arrested and charged by information with murder, felony murder, burglary in the first degree, sexual assault in the first degree, arson in the first degree and tampering with physical evidence. He was tried before a jury, which returned a guilty verdict on all counts. See footnote 1 of this opinion. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant's sole claim on appeal is that the trial court improperly restricted his cross-examination of Torres by barring the defendant from questioning Torres for impeachment purposes about misconduct that Torres allegedly committed as a juvenile. Although, at its core, the defendant's claim is evidentiary in nature, he also asserts a consequent constitutional violation. Specifically, he argues first that the court abused its discretion by precluding inquiry into Torres' juvenile misconduct on the ground that the evidence was cumulative of his adult convictions of larceny and burglary. He next asserts that the court's improper ruling amounted to an impermissible limitation on his right to confront witnesses as guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution, which right necessarily includes an opportunity to expose a witness' motive, interest, bias, or prejudice, and to test the witness' veracity and credibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"765852\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/232/740/#p746\">\n    232 Conn. 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 746,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=657%20A.2d%20611\">\n    657 A.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Holley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491832\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/514/#p593\">\n    327 Conn. 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593-94,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491832\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/514/#p593\">\n    175 A.3d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (linking confrontation clause of sixth amendment to defendant's right to present defense);\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Leconte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20500\">\n    320 Conn. 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 510,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20A.3d%201132\">\n    131 A.3d 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (same). The state argues that the defendant's constitutional claim is unpreserved, but that, regardless of whether the defendant's claim is evidentiary in nature or of constitutional magnitude and therefore amenable to review under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), the record is inadequate to review the claim. More particularly, the state argues that because the defendant never made an offer of proof regarding how Torres would have responded if the defendant had been permitted to question him regarding his alleged misconduct as a juvenile, this court is left to speculate whether the court's ruling excluded potentially admissible impeachment evidence that harmed the defendant. We agree that the record is inadequate to review the defendant's claim.\n   The following additional facts are relevant to our discussion. Prior to the commencement of evidence, the court,\n   <em>\n    Kwak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , authorized the disclosure of Torres' subpoenaed juvenile arrest records pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-124(e), and copies were provided to the defendant and the state. The parties were ordered by the court not to disseminate further any information in the juvenile records without the approval of the court. Immediately before Torres was called to testify for the state, the court inquired of the defendant whether he intended to offer any information from Torres' juvenile records. The following colloquy ensued:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Basically, Your Honor, it wasn't so much for the record as for the acts themselves that I wanted to question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The Court: Which acts?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: The act of breaking into his father's house in Waterbury stealing keys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"The Court: So burglary and the theft basically?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Burglary and theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"The Court: Okay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: My objection is to the particulars. First off, on the juvenile records that were received by subpoena and disclosed to us, we don't even have an adjudication. But the specific act, I would indicate that the character of the witness, again, this is admissible for impeachment purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The Court: Right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: And counsel's request again into the particulars, I would claim is not for impeachment purposes but to suggest third-party culpability for which there's not a basis. I would ask the court to consider [ Connecticut Code of Evidence \u00a7] 6-6 as it speaks to\n   his character and then in the commentary under [ \u00a7 6-6(c) ] it gives great discretion in the court to actually consider whether this extrinsic evidence is something that would actually confuse the jury, have them consider things that are both prejudicial, confusing, and cumulative and it reverts back to the criteria to be considered under [ Connecticut Code of Evidence \u00a7] 4-3, excluding evidence on those grounds. I would specifically indicate that for that purpose, it just clearly flies afield of what its purpose is. It's not to impeach this defendant for his credibility, but to get into a specific act of misconduct, which has nothing to do with his credibility. His credibility is already established as called into question by two convictions closer in time to his testimony today here. We have a larceny six, which goes to veracity, and a burglary three. The specific acts of conduct I think are misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"The Court: [Defense counsel].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Thank you, Your Honor. We have two recent ones and we have more removed ones by time, but they're consistent in his dishonesty and his dishonesty certainly goes to-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"The Court: Well isn't that cumulative. You can introduce the adult records regarding burglary and larceny which are the same acts that you want to introduce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Not the effect. The cumulative has the effect of showing a continuous pattern of dishonesty as opposed to one mistake or two mistakes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"The Court: No. I don't think that's-to introduce impeachment purposes, you can show evidence of dishonesty or crimes or felonies and you already have that with the adult records, so I don't see the relevance of the juvenile record[s], which show the exact same thing, it's very cumulative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Again, I wasn't going to ask him specifically about his record,\n   <em>\n    I was going to ask him had he committed the act\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    of\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    burglarizing his father's house or entering his father's house without permission to steal his father's keys.\n   </em>\n   And certainly what we have here is a bare record which says, okay, maybe the guy stole something, but what we have back, and I believe it was 2009, not only did he steal something, he steals it from his own father, which really indicates-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"The Court: Well I think a lot of people [steal from] their own families because they believe that they're not going to report them, and, you know, that's the truth, so I don't see the relevance with whether or not he stole from his father. [Prosecutor], anything else?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Only that those further questions would really just bear to general character and not character of the truthfulness and for that reason, it shouldn't be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"The Court: Okay. I'm not going to allow the juvenile records to come in because I believe it is cumulative, you have the adult records, which are more serious, so you can certainly ask him about those, but not the juvenile records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Very good, Your Honor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"The Court: All right. Thank you.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The defendant never asked the court to permit him to create a record by questioning Torres about his juvenile records outside the presence of the jury. The defendant also never proffered a good faith belief that, if asked whether he broke into his father's house and stole his keys, Torres would answer that question affirmatively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The state then called Torres to testify as the final witness in its case in chief. At the beginning of his direct examination, Torres acknowledged in response to the state's inquiry that he previously had been convicted in 2013 of both larceny and burglary. He then subsequently testified about two occasions on which the defendant confessed to having killed the victim. According to Torres, on the first occasion the defendant stated that \"he heard some people talking, he went inside through the window, when the door closed the lady came from around the corner and struck him, they got into it, whatever [she] struck him with, he then struck her with and he said there was a wheezing sound and a gurgling and that's when he knew it was finished.\" The defendant did not mention at that time that he had set a fire or had any sexual contact with the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   After Torres was interviewed by the police and learned more details of the murder, Torres confronted the defendant about the murder and the fact that the police were now investigating the defendant. At that time, the defendant indicated that \"he went to the window, him and the lady had it out, he beat the lady up, and then he wrapped her in a blanket, threw on the bed and lit her on fire.\" The defendant again did not describe any sexual contact with the victim. After this second confession, in which the defendant confirmed to Torres that he had set fire to the victim's body, Torres\n   decided to contact the police because \"it could have been some lady off the street, it could have been my daughter, it could have been anybody.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Although the court's ruling barred him from questioning Torres regarding the acts set forth in his juvenile records, the defendant nevertheless impeached Torres' credibility on cross-examination in a number of other ways. For example, he highlighted the fact that Torres originally had been untruthful to the police by telling them in his initial interview that he had no information about the murder, which was in direct conflict with his trial testimony that the defendant had confessed to him about the murder prior to his interview. The defendant also forced Torres to admit that he had not reported the defendant's confession until after the police began to make inquiries about several stolen watches that they had connected to Torres and the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The defendant further highlighted a number of factual inconsistencies between\n   Torres' trial testimony and his prior statements to police. Finally, the defendant was not precluded from revisiting Torres' adult criminal convictions that he disclosed on direct examination, and, although he was not asked about those convictions on cross-examination, the defendant raised them during his closing argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"In determining the relevancy and admissibility of evidence, trial courts have broad discretion.... Our standard of review of an evidentiary ruling is dependent on whether the claim is of constitutional magnitude. If the claim is of constitutional magnitude, the state has the burden of proving the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.... Otherwise, in order to establish reversible error on an evidentiary\n   impropriety, the defendant must prove both an abuse of discretion and a harm that resulted from such abuse.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Swinton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458606\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/268/781/#p797\">\n    268 Conn. 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 797-98,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20A.2d%20921\">\n    847 A.2d 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). As the appellant, the defendant also has the burden to ensure that the record on appeal is adequate to review any claim of error raised. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-10 ;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    James L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"755330\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/26/81/#p84\">\n    26 Conn.

If a constitutional claim was not preserved at trial, a party may be afforded appellate review only if \"(1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation ... exists and ... deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.

Testimony related to consent, therefore, could have aided the jury in deciding an issue directly related to the substantive crime charged.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Demers\n   </em>\n   expressly recognized the rule reflected in \u00a7 6-6 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence that extrinsic evidence to prove prior misconduct of a witness for purposes of impeachment is inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    Demers\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"561403\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/209/143/#p157\">\n    209 Conn. at 156-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=547%20A.2d%2028\">\n    547 A.2d 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court stated, however, that if \"prior acts of misconduct are relevant to a substantive or material issue in the case, the prior acts can be proven by extrinsic evidence, despite the fact that admission of that evidence directly contradicts the testimony of the state's witness, thereby also raising questions as to his or her credibility.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=547%20A.2d%2028\">\n    Id., at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=547%20A.2d%2028\">\n    547 A.2d 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, if evidence is otherwise admissible because it directly relates to a jury's ability to evaluate an element of the crime charged or a properly asserted defense, it will not be rendered inadmissible\n   pursuant to the prohibition in \u00a7 6-6 against extrinsic evidence simply because it also happens to impeach the credibility of the witness.\n   The present case does not involve application of the rape shield statute, which was central to the decision in\n   <em>\n    Demers\n   </em>\n   . Furthermore, Torres' juvenile misconduct is only relevant to his credibility, not to the jury's consideration of a substantive element of a charged offense or defense. The holding in\n   <em>\n    Demers\n   </em>\n   is limited to the unique situation at issue in that case and, to our knowledge, has never been relied upon by an appellate court as a basis for disregarding the clear rule set forth in our Code of Evidence that extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to prove a witness' specific acts of misconduct evidencing a character for untruthfulness. Accordingly, we find no merit in the defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Demers\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Returning to the present case, the record reflects that the court precluded the defendant from questioning Torres about specific acts referenced in his juvenile record on the ground that any relevant impeachment evidence would be cumulative of other admissible evidence. At no point during the colloquy with the court on this issue did the defendant ask to make a record by questioning Torres outside the presence of the jury. After the court issued its ruling, the defendant did not press the matter, but simply responded, \"[v]ery good, Your Honor.\" Because the defendant never made an offer of proof by seeking to question Torres on the record outside the presence of the jury as to the answers Torres would have given in response to any questions, the record simply contains no basis for us to evaluate whether Torres would have admitted any of the conduct about which the defendant sought to question him. Because this court cannot determine on the basis of the record provided whether allowing the defendant to question Torres would have resulted in the admission of any testimony that could affect Torre's credibility, the record is inadequate for us to evaluate whether the defendant suffered any harm from the trial court's\n   evidentiary ruling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly,\n   the defendant's claim necessarily fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of a victim of sexual assault, we decline to identify the victim.

Although the defendant attempts to frame his claim as one of constitutional magnitude, we are unconvinced that the defendant's claim is more than evidentiary in nature. It is true that a court's decision unreasonably to restrict a defendant's cross-examination of a witness can implicate sixth amendment rights of confrontation if, for instance, the court fails to allow a defendant sufficient latitude to impeach the credibility of an important state witness. In the present case, however, the record shows that the defendant was able to explore multiple avenues of impeachment with Torres, including the opportunity to raise before the jury his prior adult criminal convictions, which, as indicated by the trial court, were more recent and of a similar nature to the excluded alleged juvenile acts. Dressing an evidentiary claim in constitutional garb will not transform its nature.

Here, there was compelling and otherwise unexplained DNA evidence that placed the defendant at the scene and in sexual contact with the victim. Furthermore, Torres' testimony regarding the defendant's multiple confessions were independently corroborated by other evidence that would have lessened the impact of any additional impeachment value obtained through an admission of his actions as a juvenile. For example, other witnesses testified that the defendant and Torres were alone together at the times that Torres claimed the defendant confessed to him. There was also testimony that the defendant wanted to speak with Torres alone as well as the Facebook message that the defendant sent to Torres around the time of the murder seeking to discuss something \"asap.\" Torres' testimony that the defendant told him that he entered the victim's apartment through a window was consistent with testimony by first responders that there was no sign of forced entry with respect to the apartment doors. In other words, given the relative strength of the state's case against him, the defendant simply cannot demonstrate that it is more probable than not that the allegedly erroneous action of the court affected the result of the trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
