For the reasons that follow, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   King was issued a license to practice as a barber in Pennsylvania on March 27, 1986. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 98a. He was issued a license to practice as a barber manager in Pennsylvania on April 21, 1998.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 10, 2007, King was found guilty of one count of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse with a person less than 13 years of age, in violation of what was then Section 3123(a)(6) of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3123(a)(6), a first-degree felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.R. at 10a-11a. King also was found guilty of one count of indecent assault of a person under 13, one count of indecent exposure, and two counts of corruption of minors, all of which are first-degree misdemeanors. The convictions were based on conduct that occurred on three occasions, between approximately 1998 and 2001, when the victim was between seven and ten years old.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.R. at 10a-11a, 35a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   King was sentenced to 5 to 10 years of incarceration at a state correctional institution, plus 10 years of probation. The court attached the following conditions to his sentence: lifetime sex offender registration, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   Section 9795.1(b) of what was commonly referred to as Megan's Law III, 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   a prohibition from being unsupervised around girls under the age of 18; and a requirement that King undergo sex offender evaluation and any recommended treatment, including pharmacological intervention and periodic polygraph testing. Additional conditions required that King: have limited internet connection to prevent access to child pornography; take STD classes;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   perform community service; undergo individual counseling or psychiatric treatments as recommended; maintain family responsibilities; and maintain full-time employment. R.R. at 30a-32a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 1, 2008, while incarcerated, King earned his Board-issued barber teacher license. R.R. at 76a-78a. King was released on parole on May 12, 2012. One of the conditions of his parole is that he remain gainfully employed. R.R. at 52a. Within 30 days after his parole release, in June 2012, King was hired by World A Cuts Barber Institute (World A Cuts) in York as an instructor. R.R. at 65a, 76a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 20, 2016, the Board issued an order to show cause, based upon King's 2007 felony conviction, why the Board should not suspend, revoke, or otherwise restrict King's barber licenses, impose a civil penalty, or impose the costs of investigation. R.R. at 1a-6a. The Board's action was brought under Section 9124(c) of the Criminal History Record Information Act (CHRIA), 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 9124(c), which authorizes the Board to \"suspend or revoke any license ... [w]here the applicant has been convicted of a felony.\" On February 22, 2016, King filed an answer with new matter and a request for a hearing to present evidence in mitigation of any penalty the Board might impose. R.R. at 37a-38a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A Board Hearing Examiner conducted a hearing on May 18, 2016. The Commonwealth presented certified criminal records of King's conviction, the Board's order to show cause, and King's answer. King testified and offered the testimony of two additional witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Michael Welsh, King's parole officer, testified on King's behalf. Welsh has worked for the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole for nine years and is assigned to the Sex Offender Unit. He currently supervises a caseload of 110 sex offenders, including King. Welsh testified that he has been King's parole agent since May 12, 2012, and he described King as one of the most compliant offenders under his charge. Welsh explained that being gainfully employed is a condition of King's probation. Additional conditions of King's parole include maintaining weekly participation with Commonwealth Clinical Group, a sex offender treatment program; refraining from the use of drugs and alcohol; and having no contact with the victim or her family. Welsh said he meets with King's counselor and the assistant director at Commonwealth Clinical Group every\n   two weeks and that King is considered a model group attendee. R.R. at 51a-54a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Patrick Winter, the owner of World A Cuts, testified that the barber school prepares students to meet the state board licensing requirements. He stated that he and the institute's manager reviewed King's application, which reflected his criminal history. He said they met with King twice and discussed the charges with him, and King asked them to give him a chance to be employed. R.R. at 64a-65a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Winter testified that he hired King in June 2012 and that King has been a good employee. He said that King travels about an hour and a half to get to work each day and has never been late. Winter described King as honest, dedicated, and reliable, adding that King handles significant amounts of cash and manages student tuition and student aid. Winter also said that he gave King a key and a security code because he sometimes relies on King to open and close the business. R.R. at 65a-67a. Winter testified that King's duties as an instructor include classroom instruction and floor supervision of the school's students, who are male and female students age 18 and older. He noted that the barber school students service walk-in customers, some of whom may be under 18 and accompanied by parents. Winter also noted that, with the exception of the bathrooms, the entire school is under 24-hour ADT Security surveillance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.R. at 66a-68a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Winter stated that King is highly qualified, very reliable, a very good teacher, and a valuable employee. He stated that King's criminal conviction does not affect his ability to perform his barber instructor duties and that World A Cuts' business would suffer without him. R.R. at 68a-71a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   King testified that he had been employed at World A Cuts since June 2012. He added that he obtained his barber license in 1985 and has worked as a barber since the age of 18. King explained that, while he was incarcerated, the Department of Corrections afforded him the opportunity to obtain his barber teaching license. R.R. at 76a-78a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   King described his duties at World A Cuts as including theory instruction with textbooks and workbooks and practical instruction with walk-in clients who come in for haircuts. R.R. at 79a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Hearing Examiner questioned King about the incidents underlying his criminal charges. The Hearing Examiner specifically noted that King had committed a sexual offense against a minor with whom he had a trusting relationship, and he asked King to comment on those circumstances as they relate to the trust placed in him as an instructor at the barber school. King acknowledged that the three incidents occurred over a period of three years and that the victim was a member of his household and someone with whom he had a trusting relationship. He stated that, at the time, he was $100,000 in debt and under a lot of stress; he described himself as being \"in a sick place.\" R.R. at 85a. He said that he just snapped, adding that he should have sought therapy. King testified that he had learned a lot about himself since then. He stated that while he was incarcerated, he participated in eight months of low intensity therapy, after which he volunteered to participate in months of high intensity therapy, for a total of 20 to 24 months of treatment. R.R. at 84a-87a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Hearing Examiner observed that King lives with his mother, is not able to support himself as he once did, and would\n   always have different types of stress in his life. The Hearing Examiner asked King to address how he is better prepared now to handle stress than he was before. King stated that he has learned to identify things to avoid, such as being alone with a minor, and to leave that situation and ask for help. R.R. at 87a. He also confirmed that since he began his employment with World A Cuts, he has never been alone with a minor at work. He explained that students are always present and that minor customers are usually accompanied by their parents. King concluded by stating that if his licenses are revoked, he could no longer work at World A Cuts, and it could take months for him to find gainful employment, which would render him in violation of his parole conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 1, 2016, the Hearing Examiner issued a proposed adjudication and order. Certified Record (C.R.) Item 7. After concluding that the Board proved that King is subject to discipline under CHRIA, the Hearing Examiner determined that the \"only question remaining is the sanction to be imposed.\" C.R. Item 7 at 12. She first noted that \"[t]he Board has a duty to protect the health and safety of the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She further noted that \"[u]nder professional licensing statutes, including the Barber License Law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   [ ] the Board is charged with the responsibility and authority to oversee the profession and to regulate and license professionals to protect the public health and safety. For these reasons, the Board\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   impose disciplinary action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (footnote omitted) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Hearing Examiner then determined that King had provided substantial mitigation against any sanction, citing his rehabilitation efforts and his educational achievements since 2007. She specifically \"gave substantial weight to the fact that the underlying incidents resulting in [King's] convictions occurred approximately 15-20 years ago, that [he] successfully completed his barber teacher education during his incarceration, and that [he] participated in treatment and support group programs during and after his incarceration.\" C.R. Item 7 at 12. Finally, the Hearing Examiner noted that King had been gainfully employed at World A Cuts as a barber teacher for the past four years, that he had no parole violations, and that he had \"maintained an unblemished reputation in his community since his release on parole in 2012.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Based on those facts, she determined that \"[t]here are no established facts indicating that the public needs protection from [King], that [King] is a threat, or that [King] requires monitoring by the Board in order to deter any future violations.\" C.R. Item 7 at 12-13. She concluded that, \"[g]iven all of the circumstances, none of the bases for imposing a sanction is at all compelling.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. She noted that King has been a licensed barber for over 30 years, has had no prior disciplinary actions before the Board, received his barber teacher license in 2008 while incarcerated and has been gainfully employed for the past four years as a barber instructor without incident. Emphasizing that King has been actively participating in his rehabilitation for several years, the Hearing Examiner stated that \"the criminal offense at issue in this case is too remote in time to support imposing a sanction upon [him] at this point.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Consequently, the Hearing Examiner concluded that King is subject to disciplinary action under Section 9124(c)(1) of the CHRIA, but she recommended that no disciplinary sanctions be imposed. C.R. Item 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Attached to the Hearing Examiner's September 1, 2016 proposed report was a notice explaining the parties' right to file a brief on exceptions and noting that a failure to file a brief on exceptions within 30 days\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"shall constitute a waiver of all objections\" to the proposed adjudication. C.R. Item 7. On September 14, 2016, the Board issued a notice of its intent to review the Hearing Examiner's proposed adjudication. C.R. Item 8. The notice informed the parties that the Board could substitute its own findings for those of the Hearing Examiner and impose a greater or lesser sanction. C.R. Item 8 at 1. Neither King nor the Commonwealth filed a brief on exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Board considered the entire record in this matter at its regularly scheduled meeting on October 17, 2016. On December 23, 2016, the Board issued a final adjudication and order that revoked King's licenses as a barber, barber manager, and barber teacher, effective January 23, 2017. R.R. at 95a-110a. The Board explained that in imposing these sanctions, it considered its duty to protect the citizens of the Commonwealth and the severity of King's criminal charge and concluded that King's evidence was not sufficient to establish that he does not pose a risk to potential minor students or clients. R.R. at 106a-107a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   King now appeals to this Court. He argues that the Board abused its discretion and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by concluding that license revocation was an appropriate sanction for his criminal conviction, where the conduct leading to his conviction occurred 15 to 20 years ago, his criminal conduct bears no relationship to his job as a Board-licensed barber instructor, the Board issued his instructor license after his conviction, and the Board's disciplinary action was brought nine years later. We agree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Secretary of Revenue v. John's Vending Corporation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"577629\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/453/488/\">\n    453 Pa. 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20358\">\n    309 A.2d 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973), King argues that, in evaluating whether a licensing board's sanction reflects an abuse of discretion, Pennsylvania courts must consider whether the sanction imposed is reasonably related to a legitimate state purpose. In that case, the Secretary of Revenue revoked a corporation's wholesale cigarette license on July 14, 1971, in accordance with former Section 403 of the Cigarette Tax Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The revocation\n   was based on 50% shareholder Robert Martorano's convictions for crimes of moral turpitude (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , possessing and selling untaxed liquor and possessing and selling opium derivatives), in the early 1950s. Commonwealth Court affirmed the license revocation. However, on further appeal, our Supreme Court reversed. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   At the outset, it should be noted that every citizen has an inalienable right to engage in lawful employment. While a state may regulate a business which affects the public health, safety and welfare, it may not, through regulation, deprive an individual of his right to conduct a lawful business unless it can be shown that such deprivation is reasonably related to the state interest sought to be protected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dent v.

The court observed that at the time Martorano was president of the corporation, the statutory prohibition had not yet been enacted, and that during the years of Martorano's employment with the corporation, there was no suggestion of impropriety concerning his conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Supreme Court concluded in\n   <em>\n    John's Vending\n   </em>\n   that while it was reasonable to consider the character of persons being licensed, the facts established that there was no material relevance between the applicant's past crimes and his present ability to perform the duties required by the position. Noting that the crimes had occurred almost 20 years earlier, the court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A provision in the nature of Section 403(2) at best only suggests that a person who has committed certain acts in the past would be more likely to betray the trust that this license entails than a citizen with no such past history. Such reasoning, while not infallible, has a logical basis in experience. But that basis exists only where those events occurred so recently that the particular character trait of the individual involved can reasonably be assumed to have remained unchanged. Where, as here, nearly twenty years has expired since the convictions and the record reveals that the individual has held this position of responsibility for twelve years without any allegation of impropriety, it is ludicrous to contend that these prior acts provide any basis to evaluate his present character.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   In order to avoid an absurd and harsh result, a court may look beyond the strict letter of the law to interpret a statute according to its reason and spirit and accomplish the object intended by the legislature.\n   <em>\n    To interpret Section 403(2) as a blanket prohibition barring anyone who has been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude without regard to the remoteness of those convictions or the individual's subsequent performance would be unreasonable. We cannot assume that the legislature intended such an absurd and harsh result.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20358\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20358\">\n    at 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court further concluded that such a result would be inconsistent with the state's commitment to rehabilitation of persons who have been convicted of criminal offenses. \"To forever foreclose a permissible means of gainful employment because of an improvident act in the distant\n   past completely loses sight of any concept of forgiveness for prior errant behavior and adds yet another stumbling block along the difficult road of rehabilitation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20358\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   King also relies upon\n   <em>\n    Ake v.

Cmwlth. 2009), in which the State Board of Accountancy (Accountancy Board) relied on Kevin Ake's (Ake) unreported felony hate crime conviction, which occurred in Illinois seven years earlier, to revoke his certified public accountant's (CPA) credentials. The Accountancy Board reasoned that a revocation of Ake's CPA license would eliminate the risk of harm to those for whom he might work in Pennsylvania; deter other CPAs from committing felonious acts outside the state; and assure the public that only individuals of good moral character are permitted to practice as CPAs in Pennsylvania. The Accountancy Board rejected Ake's plea for leniency, based in part on his need for CPA credentials to practice his profession and to maintain gainful employment, and was not persuaded by Ake's mitigation evidence. Ake appealed, asserting that the Accountancy Board abused its discretion by imposing the maximum penalty allowed by law. This Court agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We first noted that the licensing board \"exercises considerable discretion in policing its licenses.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7295044\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/974/514/\">\n    974 A.2d at 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, citing the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    John's Vending\n   </em>\n   , we recognized that this Court has a duty \"to correct abuses of discretion in manner or degree of penalties imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7295044\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/974/514/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We vacated the Accountancy Board's decision and remanded for the imposition of a lesser sanction, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    John's Vending\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    teaches that the nature of the offending conduct and its remoteness in time must be considered where an agency seeks to revoke a professional license on the basis of a conviction.\n   </em>\n   In this case, nearly seven years elapsed between Ake's offending conduct and his application to reactivate his Pennsylvania CPA credentials. While not as long as the twenty years in\n   <em>\n    John's Vending\n   </em>\n   , seven years is a substantial interval of time.

Despite [King] and his employer's testimony that there are only two females currently enrolled at the institute, that the students are not minors and that there is surveillance in the building, the Board does not find this mitigating testimony sufficient to conclude that [King] does not pose a risk to the young students and minor clients. A sixteen or seventeen-year-old female student\n   <em>\n    could be enrolled\n   </em>\n   at the institute at any time in the future.

After considering the evidentiary record of this case, the Board finds that the seriousness of [King's] criminal offense, for which he blamed on occurring because he was under a lot of stress [sic], far outweighs the modest evidence of mitigation.
