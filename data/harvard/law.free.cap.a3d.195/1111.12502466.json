During the spring of 2015, plaintiff Stonewall of Woodstock Corporation (Stonewall) entered into negotiations to buy commercial property located in Woodstock from defendant Oliver Block, LLC (Oliver Block). A written contract of sale was signed by Stonewall, but not by Oliver Block, which instead sold the land to defendant Stardust 11TS, LLC (Stardust). Stonewall sued, claiming that there was a valid contract and seeking specific performance. The trial court granted summary judgment for Oliver Block, on the basis that any contract with Stonewall was unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds because it had not been signed by Oliver Block. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2. Stonewall is a Vermont corporation whose shareholders include John Ruggieri-Lam\n   and Maria Freddura.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oliver Block is a Vermont limited liability corporation whose sole member is Richard Coburn. The negotiations in 2015 were largely carried out between Ruggieri-Lam on behalf of Stonewall and Coburn, Coburn's lawyer Frank Urso, and Coburn's personal assistant Richard Sbeglia on behalf of Oliver Block.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3. On May 28, 2015, Sbeglia sent an unsigned contract of sale by email to Ruggieri-Lam, who returned it with proposed modifications. On June 2, Urso sent Ruggieri-Lam an updated unsigned version of the contract, incorporating the modifications that Ruggieri-Lam had requested, with instructions to execute and return it with a deposit of $25,000. Later the same day, Ruggieri-Lam and Freddura returned the document, which they had signed, to Urso along with the deposit check. In an email reply on June 3 Urso acknowledged receipt. On Coburn's instructions, Urso deposited the check in his law firm's trust account. But neither Coburn nor anyone else acting on behalf of Oliver Block signed the contract. In the days immediately following his return of the contract document and check, Ruggieri-Lam made several inquiries to Urso about whether Coburn had signed the contract. No representation was ever made to Ruggieri-Lam that Coburn had signed the document. Finally, on June 11, Coburn informed Stonewall that he could not go through with the negotiations as laid out in the June 2 document. During this same time, Coburn had been negotiating with another potential purchaser, Stardust. Those negotiations resulted in Coburn signing a contract of sale with Stardust on June 10. Urso returned Stonewall's deposit money on June 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4. Shortly after learning of the deal with Stardust, Ruggieri-Lam and Freddura filed suit against Oliver Block in the Federal District Court of Vermont, seeking specific performance on their own contract with Oliver Block.\n   <em>\n    Ruggieri-Lam v. Oliver Block, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4016571\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/120/400/\">\n    120 F.Supp.3d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Vt. 2015). They asserted that the emails sent by Urso on June 2 and 3 (instructing Ruggieri-Lam and Freddura to sign and return the contract with a deposit and then acknowledging receipt) satisfied the Statute of Frauds. They also sought an attachment on the Oliver Block property. As part of Oliver Block's response, Coburn prepared an affidavit denying that he had ever made a contract with Stonewall or authorized Urso or anyone else to make one. In July, the court denied Ruggieri-Lam and Freddura's petition for a writ of attachment on the Oliver Block property, concluding that they had no reasonable chance of success on the merits under Vermont contract law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4016571\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/120/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4016571\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/120/400/\">\n    at 406-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In February 2016, the federal suit was dismissed without prejudice on plaintiff's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5. Stonewall then filed this suit against Oliver Block and Stardust, alleging breach of contract and fraud, and again seeking specific performance. In September 2017, the court granted summary judgment for Oliver Block with respect to Stonewall's contract claims, holding that the June 2 purchase agreement was not an enforceable contract under the Statute of Frauds. The court denied Oliver Block's motion for summary judgment with respect to fraud, but this claim was later dismissed on a stipulated motion by Stonewall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6. On appeal, Stonewall argues that a valid contract was formed when it returned the signed contract with the deposit on June 2, thus accepting an offer made by\n   Oliver Block. Stonewall further contends that the Statute of Frauds is satisfied by either (1) the signed affidavit by Coburn in opposition to the petition for writ of attachment produced in federal court or (2) the two emails from Urso sent on June 2 and 3. Coburn's affidavit was part of the record below, but was not mentioned in the trial court's decision. Oliver Block and Stardust respond that no contract was ever formed and that in any event the signed writings offered by Stonewall do not meet the requirements of the Statute of Frauds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7. We agree with the trial court that the Statute of Frauds bars enforcement of Stonewall's claim. As a contract for the sale of land, the contract falls under the Statute, and neither Coburn's signed affidavit nor the emails from Urso meet the Statute's requirements. Because we hold that the contract is unenforceable under the Statute, we do not reach the questions of whether an otherwise valid contract was formed by offer and acceptance or whether specific performance would be the appropriate remedy for any breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8. We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, under the same standard as the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Bixler v. Bullard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"942877\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/172/53/#p57\">\n    172 Vt. 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"942877\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/172/53/#p57\">\n    769 A.2d 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 694 (2001). We will uphold a grant of summary judgment if we agree that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"942877\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/172/53/#p57\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation omitted); see V.R.C.P. 56(a). None of the relevant facts are disputed. The issue is whether the trial court correctly applied Vermont's Statute of Frauds, and this question is solely one of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   III. The Statute of Frauds\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9. The Statute of Frauds derives from the Act for the Prevention of Frauds and Perjuries passed by the Parliament of England in 1677, 29 Car. 2 c. 3, which remains in force in some form in almost all states, Restatement (Second) of Contracts ch. 5, stat. note (1981). It has apparently been part of Vermont law since at least 1779, when the common law of England was adopted as the law of the state. See\n   <em>\n    Clement v. Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4463777\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/78/290/#p300\">\n    78 Vt. 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 300-04,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20A.%20146\">\n    63 A. 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 148-50 (1906) (discussing history of reception of English common law in Vermont). The Statute is currently codified at 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 181, which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   An action at law shall not be brought in the following cases unless the promise, contract, or agreement upon which such action is brought or some memorandum or note thereof is in writing, signed by the party to be charged therewith or by some person thereunto by him or her lawfully authorized:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (5) A contract for the sale of lands, tenements, or hereditaments, or of an interest in or concerning them. Authorization to execute such a contract on behalf of another shall be in writing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Despite the Statute's pedigree, \"its rote application is not automatic,\" and courts should be sensitive to its \"underlying purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Maycock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9466205\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/33/1114/\">\n    2001 WY 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9466205\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/33/1114/\">\n    33 P.3d 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The main purpose of the Statute is, as its name suggests, to protect parties from the enforcement of fraudulent contracts, but it also \"helps to ensure that contracts for the sale of land or interests therein are not entered into improvidently.\"\n   <em>\n    Chomicky v. Buttolph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5778084\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/147/128/#p130\">\n    147 Vt. 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 130,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5778084\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/147/128/#p130\">\n    513 A.2d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1175-76 (1986) (refusing to enforce an oral real estate contract).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 10. The central requirements of the Statute are (1) a signature, affixed to (2) a writing. The requirement of a signature\n   by the party to be charged is strict.\n   <em>\n    Pike Indus., Inc. v. Middlebury Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8545231\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/136/588/#p592\">\n    136 Vt. 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 592,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8545231\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/136/588/#p592\">\n    398 A.2d 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 282 (1979) (refusing to enforce indemnity contract memorialized in unsigned telegram). As for what is signed, the Statute's requirements are not rigid. The signed writing does not need to be the contract itself, just \"a sufficient memorandum\" of it.\n   <em>\n    First Nat'l Bank of St. Johnsbury v. Laperle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4619353\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/117/144/#p148\">\n    117 Vt. 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 148,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4619353\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/117/144/#p148\">\n    86 A.2d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 638 (1952).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 11. A sufficient memorandum is any writing that indicates the existence of an agreement on a given subject and its essential terms. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 131. In\n   <em>\n    Laperle\n   </em>\n   , for instance, this Court concluded that a receipt acknowledging a down payment for the purchase of a building, signed by the buyer under the word \"Attest,\" satisfied the Statute.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4619353\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/117/144/#p148\">\n    117 Vt. at 146-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4619353\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/117/144/#p148\">\n    86 A.2d at 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The memorandum may also be assembled from multiple different writings, as long as \"one of the writings is signed and the writings in the circumstances clearly indicate that they relate to the same transaction.\" Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 132 ;\n   <em>\n    Crabtree v. Elizabeth Arden Sales Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2229902\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/305/48/\">\n    305 N.Y. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20N.E.2d%20551\">\n    110 N.E.2d 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 554 (1953). None of the writings need to have been produced with the purpose of memorializing the contract. See\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.

Stonewall emphasizes that the Statute is a \"rule of evidence\" and as such \"does not make oral contracts illegal or void\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   ,\" even when relating to land.\n   <em>\n    Troy v.

Stonewall also argues that in\n   <em>\n    Willey v. Willey\n   </em>\n   this Court enforced an oral real estate contract without a signed writing.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3148012\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/180/421/\">\n    2006 VT 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3148012\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/180/421/\">\n    180 Vt. 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3148012\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/180/421/\">\n    912 A.2d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We disagree with this reading of that case, which involved an oral divorce settlement in which the wife surrendered her claim to the marital home in exchange for a lump-sum payment; the husband later argued that the agreement did not satisfy the Statute of Frauds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 19. The record included both a written \" 'term sheet' containing the basic terms of the agreement\" and a check signed by the husband, for about a quarter of the settlement amount, with the notation \"Toward Settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Although we emphasized the circumstances surrounding the oral agreement as a basis for our decision, the combination of these clearly related writings was also enough to satisfy the Statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.\n   <em>\n    Willey\n   </em>\n   offers no exception to the general requirement of a\n   writing or writings that include both the essential terms of the agreement and \"a signature by the party to be charged.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 14. In this case, there is no doubt that the Statute applies to the alleged agreement between Stonewall and Oliver Block as a \"contract for the sale of lands.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   12 V.S.A. \u00a7 181(5). The essential terms of the alleged agreement that Stonewall seeks to enforce were fully specified in writing in the June 2 proposed contract that was left unsigned by Oliver Block. What is required under our cases is an additional, signed writing indicating that the agreement was in fact made. We consider the candidates presented by Stonewall to satisfy this requirement in turn: first the affidavit by Coburn, followed by the two emails from Urso.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A. Coburn's Affidavit\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 15. The affidavit of Richard Coburn at issue here was taken on July 6, 2015, as part of the proceedings in federal court. Although it is signed, we conclude that it is not a sufficient memorandum for the purposes of the Statute of Frauds (even when taken together with the unsigned contract), because its content does not provide the required recognition that an agreement was formed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 16. Coburn's affidavit contains the following relevant statements. Claiming that he had received offers to purchase the property from both Stonewall and Stardust, Coburn describes his next step as follows: \"I asked my attorney, Frank Urso ..., to produce contracts of sale based upon those offers and submit them to each of the prospective purchasers so that the terms of each deal could be fully negotiated and so that I could make a final decision.\" Coburn later received signed agreements back from both parties. He then states: \"I did not accept either the [Stardust] Offer or the [Stonewall] Offer, nor did I authorize anybody else to do so.\" Noting that he had \"serious concerns about [Stonewall's] creditworthiness,\" he \"instructed Mr. Urso to run [Stonewall's] $25,000 check through his trust account to be sure it wouldn't bounce.\" After further review, Coburn finally \"determined that [he] could not accept either offer as they stood.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17. A signed affidavit can, in general, provide the indication of a contract's existence required by the Statute. In\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

The Court granted summary judgment for the plaintiff, finding that an affidavit, signed by the former administrator and \"in which the terms of the oral agreement were set forth,\" satisfied the Statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4719652\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/140/134/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4719652\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/140/134/\">\n    at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4719652\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/140/134/\">\n    436 A.2d at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the context of transactions not under the Statute, a post hoc affidavit like Coburn's would not invalidate an oral agreement to which both sides had given an outward manifestation of assent. Since the affidavit cannot satisfy the Statute, we need not consider whether the actions that Coburn describes himself as taking in it would count as such a manifestation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   B. Urso's Emails\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 21. In addition to the affidavit, Stonewall relies on the two emails from Coburn's attorney Urso to Ruggieri-Lam of Stonewall. We conclude that these emails also cannot supply the signed writing required by the Statute of Frauds because Urso was not authorized in writing to conclude the sale on behalf of Coburn or Oliver Block.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 22. The text of the email sent on June 2 reads, in its entirety: \"Attached you will find: 1. A revised Agreement with changes shown; and 2. A revised Agreement (clean copy) for execution along with Exhibit A. Please execute and get copies back to me while mailing me the deposit check. Frank.\" The two versions of the agreement were attached. The second email from Urso, sent on June 3, reads, again in its entirety: \"I have received the signed agreement and the deposit check for $25000.\" Coburn and Sbeglia were copied on both emails. Ruggieri-Lam responded to this second email on the same day, stating in part: \"Great. Thanks for the confirmation. If you would kindly have [Coburn's] signature affixed to the P &amp; S and circulate same, that would be great.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 23.

The federal court held that the typed word \"Frank\" in the first email counted as a signature for the purposes of the Statute under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, 9 V.S.A. \u00a7 276.\n   <em>\n    Ruggieri-Lam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4016571\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/120/400/\">\n    120 F.Supp.3d at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties dispute whether this latter application of Vermont's law is correct. But even acknowledging the general prevalence and acceptance of the practice of electronic signatures, we do not need to decide the question because we conclude that there is no signed writing establishing that Urso was \"lawfully authorized\" to conclude the contract on behalf of Coburn or Oliver Block.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 24. Vermont's Statute of Frauds imposes an additional requirement specifically on contracts for sale of land: \"Authorization to execute such a contract on behalf of another shall be in writing.\" 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 181(5).

Because neither the affidavit nor any other writing in the record meets the special requirement of written authorization imposed by 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 181(5), the June 2 email from Urso cannot satisfy Vermont's Statute of Frauds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 26. The requirements of Vermont law were not met here: Stonewall presented no document recognizing a contract and signed by Coburn or anyone else authorized\n   by him in writing to act on behalf of Oliver Block. As such, summary judgment was properly granted for Oliver Block.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 27. I agree with the majority's ultimate conclusion, but for slightly different reasons. I disagree with the majority's conclusion that the Coburn affidavit is insufficient to satisfy the memorandum requirement because in the affidavit Coburn denies having formed a contract with Stonewall. I agree, however, with the majority's ultimate determination because the Coburn affidavit does not provide the necessary signed writing with respect to the modified terms, or counteroffer, that Ruggieri now seeks to enforce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 28. Had Ruggieri-Lam and Freddura agreed to the terms of the contract emailed to them on May 28, the Statute of Frauds would be satisfied by Coburn's affidavit. My conclusion on this point rests on the specific facts of the negotiation, as well as two legal considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 29. The critical facts are as follows. Ruggieri-Lam and Coburn had been negotiating for several weeks regarding Stonewall's potential purchase of Oliver Block. On May 28, Sbeglia, acting on behalf of Coburn, emailed Ruggieri a revised contract modified in accordance with Ruggieri-Lam's discussions with Coburn earlier that week. He wrote, \"If this is in order, please attach the Schedule of Leases we sent earlier and execute the agreements. Please send them to Frank Urso, together with the down payment check made payable to his firm. We will attach the documents required by Schedule B (if any) upon final execution.\" This appears to be the communication that Coburn acknowledged he authorized in his subsequent signed affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 30. The first relevant legal consideration is the purpose of the Statute of Frauds, and its impact on the requirements of a satisfactory writing. The commentary to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts explains the purpose of the Statute of Frauds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   The primary purpose of the Statute is evidentiary, to require reliable evidence of the existence and terms of the contract and to prevent enforcement through fraud or perjury of contracts never in fact made. The contents of the writing must be such as to make successful fraud unlikely ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Restatement (Second) Contracts \u00a7 131 cmt. c (1981). Given this purpose, the Restatement provides that the required writing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (a) reasonably identifies the subject matter of the contract,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    is sufficient to indicate that a contract with respect thereto\n   </em>\n   has been made between the parties or\n   <em>\n    offered by the signer to the other party\n   </em>\n   , and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (c) states with reasonable certainty the essential terms of the unperformed promises in the contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20P.%2071\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 131(a)-(c) (emphasis added). The purpose of the statute is not to let people back away from agreements they have freely made when the fact of the agreement, and the associated terms, can be clearly ascertained. It is to avoid attempts to enforce agreements that were never made in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 31. The second important legal consideration, as acknowledged by the majority,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20, is that the intent to be bound, and consequent formation of a contract, is an objective matter to be assessed based on the parties' words and actions. See\n   <em>\n    Quenneville v. Buttolph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196292\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/444/\">\n    2003 VT 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196292\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/444/\">\n    175 Vt. 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196292\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/444/\">\n    833 A.2d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 32. The May 28 communique from Sbeglia on behalf of Coburn to Ruggieri-Lam and Freddura is clearly an offer, and Coburn's signed affidavit confirms that it was extended at his instance. There is no dispute about the subject matter or essential terms of the contract, and the evidence is sufficient to indicate that a contract was offered by Coburn. That Coburn was, unbeknownst to Ruggieri-Lam and Freddura, simultaneously negotiating with another party for the sale of the same property, and that he subjectively intended for the May 28 communique to be something other an offer to sell on the terms outlined in that proposed purchase and sale agreement, are irrelevant to the analysis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196292\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/444/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The intent of the parties to be bound ... is a question of fact to be determined by examining the objective words and deeds of the parties.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 33. Although the majority acknowledges this legal framework, it suggests that Coburn's affidavit is not a sufficient writing because it denies a contract was ever formed. But the formation of a contract is ultimately a legal question answered by objective evidence. Coburn does not deny in his affidavit that he authorized the May 28 communique. Had he done so, I would fully agree with the majority. That would be a denial of the facts essential to the formation of a contract. But all Coburn denied was a subjective intent to be bound by the communications he authorized. His affidavit affirmatively validates the\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   that support a conclusion that the May 28 communication was an offer to sell to Stonewall on the terms outlined. For that reason, the Coburn affidavit would be sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds if Ruggieri-Lam and Freddura had accepted the May 28 proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 34. I concur with the majority's conclusion because Ruggieri-Lam and Freddura did not accept that proposal, but instead countered with proposed changes in the terms concerning price and the timing of a $50,000 payment. The June 2 communication from Urso back to Ruggieri-Lam incorporates those changes. I see nothing in the Coburn affidavit that expressly reflects that Coburn authorized Urso to make these changes and communicate them back to Ruggieri-Lam. Since this is the purported agreement Stonewall seeks to enforce, the absence of any writing signed by Coburn, including the Coburn affidavit itself, that reflects the essential terms and acknowledges his agreement is fatal to Stonewall's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 35. For these reasons, I do not join in \u00b6\u00b6 15-20 of the majority opinion, but concur in the result.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Stonewall later transferred its rights related to the deal to Accordion, LLC, a Vermont limited liability corporation of which Ruggieri-Lam and Freddura are the sole members.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Other cases cited by Stonewall for the enforcement of contracts in the absence of signed writings do not involve the sale of land or any of the other situations listed in Vermont's Statute of Frauds.

In the record it is unclear or disputed whether Coburn himself was aware of or had approved any or all of the modified terms in the June 2 draft of the contract. Ruggieri-Lam's subsequent requests for a copy of the contract signed by Coburn moreover imply that he was aware of the importance of getting Coburn's signature for Oliver Block.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The role of the June 3 email in Stonewall's argument is not entirely clear. Although Stonewall describes it as a \"signed email,\" it is not subscribed by Urso or anyone else personally. It includes only the presumably automated signature giving the name of the firm (\"Reis Urso &amp; Ewald, PC\") and its business address.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Because we hold that the Statute's requirement of written authorization was not met, we do not consider whether Urso was otherwise acting with Coburn's apparent or actual authority at the time of the alleged contract (a question to which Coburn's retrospective characterization of his subjective intention is irrelevant).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
