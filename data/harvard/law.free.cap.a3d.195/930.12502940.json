Kovalchik (\"the insurance companies\") appeal a non-jury verdict finding that they deceitfully profited from a business transaction with Gary and Mary Gregg. The trial judge held the insurance companies in violation of the \"catchall\" provision of Pennsylvania's Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (UTPCPL).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   That catchall provision prohibits anyone who advertises, sells, or distributes goods or services from \"[e]ngaging in any ... fraudulent or deceptive conduct which creates a likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding\" during a transaction. 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(4)(xxi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A decade ago, our appellate courts disagreed over that provision. The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, interpreting it expansively, granted consumers greater protections under the UTPCPL than under common law, while this Court did not. After studying Commonwealth Court and federal precedents, we realized we had inadvertently reduced a 1996 amendment's impact. Thus, in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bennett v. A.T. Masterpiece Homes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7313687\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/40/145/\">\n    40 A.3d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Super. 2012), we adopted Commonwealth Court's consumer-friendly view of the catchall provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the case at bar, the insurance companies would essentially have us undo\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . They argue that a jury verdict in their favor on common law claims precluded a non-jury verdict against them under the UTPCPL. The Commonwealth Court rejected that argument in 2011. Hence, the insurance companies invite us to reopen the split in authority that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   repaired. We decline their invitation and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1999, Robert A. Kovalchik, a financial adviser and insurance salesperson, solicited the Greggs to become his new customers. The Greggs and Mr. Kovalchik knew each other, because Mr. Kovalchik had advised Mr. Gregg's mother and sold her financial products, including insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At his first formal meeting with the Greggs, Mr. Kovalchik held himself out as having skill, training, and expertise in insurance and investment products. Mr. Kovalchik offered to review the Greggs' assets, liabilities, financial worth, investments, and goals. He said that he would advise and counsel them as to insurance or investment products, that they should rely upon his advice and counsel, that they could trust him to achieve their financial goals, and that they should delegate investment decisions to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Kovalchik also asked the Greggs a series of questions regarding their current life insurance protection, financial needs, retirement goals, and current financial situation. The Greggs revealed that they owned seven Prudential life insurance policies. Those Prudential Policies had a combined value of $121,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Kovalchik and the Greggs met a second time, when Mr. Kovalchik recommended various insurance and investment products to them. Based upon his review and analysis, Mr. Kovalchik advised the Greggs to liquidate their $121,000 Prudential Polices, so he could place the assets into IDS Life Insurance, a corporation that the appellant insurance companies eventually acquired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During his sales pitch, Mr. Kovalchik told the Greggs to purchase a new\n   $170,000 Flexible Premium Variable Life Insurance Policy for Mr. Gregg and a $75,000 spousal rider for Mrs. Gregg. Mr. Kovalchik also recommended that they surrender their existing IRAs and use those funds to purchase IRAs through IDS. Mr. Kovalchik then advised them not to enroll Mrs. Gregg into an Air Force-provided plan that would have paid her military benefits if Mr. Gregg died, because the insurance companies would provide better coverage at lower costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Kovalchik presented the Greggs with a \"Life Insurance Illustration\" to demonstrate that, if Mr. Gregg purchased the new $170,000 Flexible Premium Variable Life Insurance Policy through IDS Life (\"the IDS Policy\") and made annual payments of $1,671, the Greggs could expect the IDS Policy to accrue significant cash value. As a result, he led the Greggs to believe that they could use that policy as their retirement plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Greggs believed him and signed an application to purchase the IDS Policy. The Greggs also agreed to \"roll-over\" their existing IRAs into IRAs with IDS. Mr. Kovalchik directed them to surrender the proceeds from their Prudential Policies to fund the IDS Policy. The Greggs did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In December 1999, the Greggs provided Mr. Kovalchik with a $300 check, because he told them that the money would increase the savings portion of the IDS Policy. The Greggs also authorized automatic withdrawal of $300 per month from their checking account to cover the savings portion of the IDS Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   IDS issued them the IDS Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A few weeks later, Prudential sent several checks to IDS from the now-liquidated Prudential Policies; $13,600.60 went into the IDS Policy. Unbeknownst to the Greggs, however, Mr. Kovalchik began dividing their monthly $300 contributions between the IDS Policy and the two IRAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Also, despite Mr. Kovalchik's original plan for all Prudential Policy funds to go into the IDS Policy, this was not possible. Thus, Prudential sent an $11,601.34 check for the remainder directly to the Greggs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When Mr. Kovalchik learned this, he contacted the Greggs to offer them additional products. He told them he would deposit approximately $9,500 of $11,601.34 into their IDS Policy. Instead, he put $1,700 into each of their new IRAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In June 2000, Mr. Kovalchik opened an AXP Growth Fund account for the Greggs and deposited $6,100 of the Prudential Polices' proceeds into that account. Thus, he never invested any of the $9,500 into the IDS Policy. In addition, each IRA transactions increased Mr. Kovalchik's commissions via a surcharge of 5.75%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Next, the Greggs began sending Mr. Kovalchik $200 per month, which they believed were going to the IDS Policy. However, Mr. Kovalchik actually put the money in the AXP Growth Account. Every AXP Growth Fund deposit increased Mr. Kovalchik's commissions, because they all carried the 5.75% surcharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Greggs received a class action notice in January 2001, which led them to believe that the insurance companies broke the law. They sued. Among other things, the Greggs alleged fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of the UTPCPL's catchall provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The common law claims of fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation went to a jury, which returned defense verdicts on both counts. Relying upon the record from the jury trial, the judge made the following findings of fact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   this court finds that [the insurance companies'] conduct created a likelihood of\n   confusion or misunderstanding in their dealings with the [Greggs]. Even if the financial advisor did not directly misrepresent the cost of the life insurance policy, he failed to clearly and fully explain the cost and terms of the policy; and the [Greggs] reasonably believed they would not have to pay additional monies to fund the policy once their existing policies were transferred to the [insurance companies]. Additionally, the [Greggs] relied upon the [insurance companies] to their financial detriment when they elected to forgo the purchase of the survivor benefit option for Mr. Gregg's military pension, and instead cashed-in their whole life policies to purchase the variable life insurance policy recommended by [Mr. Kovalchik]. This court found the [Greggs]' testimony to be credible on these issues; and the [Greggs] proved all elements of their UTPCPL claim by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Trial Court Memorandum Order, 12/7/14, at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial judge then awarded $52,431.29 in UTPCPL damages to the Greggs. The judge arrived at that figure by refunding the premium that the Greggs had paid to the insurance companies, plus 6% interest, minus the $12,151.13 that the insurance companies had already paid the Greggs in September 2012. He also ordered the insurance companies to pay the Greggs' legal bills and costs of $69,421.26 and $12,065.88, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Both sides filed post-trial motions, which the trial court denied. Only the insurance companies have appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   They raise two issues. First, the insurance companies assert that the jury's verdict on the claims of common law misrepresentation required the trial court to dismiss the Greggs' UTPCPL claim.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Companies' Brief at 4. Also, they argue that the judge should have subtracted the value that the Greggs received by having the IDS Policy in effect from 1999 to 2012 (even though they never made a death-benefit claim) from the $52,431.29 he awarded them.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7313687\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/40/145/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Res Judicata\n     </em>\n     &amp; Collateral Estoppel\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In their first argument, the insurance companies invoke the doctrines of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and collateral estoppel. They assert that, in order to win a UTPCPL catchall claim, consumers must prove negligent misrepresentation or fraudulent misrepresentation. Thus, when the jury found neither form of misrepresentation, it simultaneously acquitted the insurance companies on the UTPCPL count, as well. The insurance companies therefore believe that the trial judge erred when he found them in violation of the UTPCPL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Applying the doctrines of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and \"collateral estoppel ... presents a question of law. Like all questions of law, our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Skotnicki v.

Thus, \"an existing final judgment rendered upon the merits, without fraud or collusion, by a court of competent jurisdiction, is conclusive of causes of action and of facts or issues thereby litigated, as to the parties and their privies, in all other actions in the same or any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction.\" 46 Am.Jur.2d, Judgments \u00a7 394 at 558-559. For\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   to apply four things must be identical between the old lawsuit and the new one: \"(1) identity of issues, (2) identity of causes of action, (3) identity of persons and parties to the action, and (4) identity of the\n   quality or capacity of the parties suing or sued.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Day v.

Here, the insurance companies invoke the doctrines to shield themselves from the trial judge's verdict. However, that shield provides no refuge, because the judge and jury decided distinct issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The insurance companies claim the issues are identical, because, they think, \"[t]o establish ... deceptive conduct under the UTPCPL's catchall provision, the [consumer] must, at a minimum, prove ... common law negligent misrepresentation.\" Companies' Brief at 15. To support their theory, the insurance companies cite\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kirwin v. Sussman Automotive\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134394\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/149/333/\">\n    149 A.3d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Super. 2016). Specifically, they offer this quote: \"Deceptive conduct ordinarily can only take one of two forms, either fraudulent or negligent ... The broadening of the UTPCPL ... makes negligent deception, e.g., negligent misrepresentations, actionable under the post-1996 catchall provision.\" Companies' Brief at 19 (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     quoting\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kirwin\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 336 ). The companies then correctly point out that, under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kirwin\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the Greggs \"can establish a claim of misrepresentation under the UTPCPL's catchall provision by proving either a fraudulent misrepresentation or negligent misrepresentation.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   But the insurance companies attempt to transform that permissive statement into a prohibitive one, by arguing that the Greggs could\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   establish a UTPCPL catchall violation \"by proving either a fraudulent misrepresentation or negligent misrepresentation.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   As we will explain below, we do not read the UTPCPL so narrowly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Granted, the word \"only\" appears in the quote from\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kirwin\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , which was quoting\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Dixon v.

The [insurance companies'] argument that [\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and] collateral estoppel precludes this Court's award on the UTPCPL claim was rejected by ... the Commonwealth Court ... in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     TAP\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .

Contrary to [their] assertion, the Commonwealth Court stated in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     TAP\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   that the test for deceptive conduct under the UTPCPL is \"essentially whether the conduct has the tendency or capacity to deceive, which is a lesser, more relaxed standard than that for fraud or negligent misrepresentation.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     TAP\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300145\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/36/1197/\">\n    36 A.3d at 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Trial Court Opinion, 12/5/17, at 2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We agree with the learned trial judge and the Commonwealth Court's reasoning in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     TAP\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Had the General Assembly intended to limit the catchall provision to cover only common law misrepresentation claims, it would have done so in more direct language than \"deceptive conduct.\" 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(4)(xxi). In the 1996 amendment, legislators could have prescribed only \"fraudulent or\n   <em>\n    negligent\n   </em>\n   conduct,\" had they so intended. Instead, they outlawed \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ...\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     deceptive\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   conduct,\" regardless of a vendor's mental state.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300145\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/36/1197/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Hence, any deceptive conduct, \"which creates a likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding,\" is actionable under 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(4)(xxi), whether committed intentionally (as in a fraudulent misrepresentation), carelessly (as in a negligent misrepresentation), or with the utmost care (as in strict liability). Whether a vendor's \"conduct has the tendency or capacity to deceive ... is a lesser, more relaxed standard than that for fraud or negligent misrepresentation.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     TAP\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300145\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/36/1197/\">\n    36 A.3d at 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The only thing more relaxed than negligence - regarding a consumer's burden of proof - is strict liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Commonwealth Court therefore went on to say that its post-amendment precedents \"have the effect of eliminating the common law state of mind element (either negligence or intent to deceive) ....\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300145\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/36/1197/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The sound reasoning of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     TAP\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   has persuaded us to adopt it in this Court, and we see no basis for creating a divergent line of authority for private lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Our holding also comports with this Court's rationale in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bumbarger v.

Despite making every effort to break, he ran a stop sign at the bottom. He collided with another car in the intersection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The car driver sued the truck driver (and his employer) on the theory that the trucker had violated the Vehicle Code by running the stop sign. The jury returned a defense verdict, \"due to the condition of the roadways.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 553. But the trial judge held the truck driver's failure \"to halt at the stop sign should not be excused under any circumstances\" and granted the plaintiff a new trial.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 554. \"The trial court, in effect, concluded that [the truck driver] was strictly liable for failing to stop at the sign at the bottom of the hill.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On appeal, this Court reversed and reinstated the verdict. In doing so, we explained that a statute imposes one of two types of duty - either (1) strict liability or (2) negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   . This Court turned to Dean Prosser for delineation between those two categories. Prosser wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   It is entirely possible that a statute may impose an absolute duty, for whose violation there is no recognized excuse ... In such a case the defendant may become liable on the mere basis of his violation of the statute. No excuse is recognized, and neither reasonable ignorance nor all proper care will avoid liability. Such a statute falls properly under the head of strict liability, rather than any basis of negligence ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     quoting\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   W.E. Prosser, TORTS , \u00a7 36 at 197 (4th Ed. 1971) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We concluded that stop signs impose a duty of negligence per se under the Vehicle Code. Therefore, the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bumbarger\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   jury could properly excuse the Vehicle Code violation due to hazardous road conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   A UTPCPL violation, however, is not amenable to excuses. Indeed, we can think of no instances when a vendor's deceptive act during a commercial transaction would be excused under the statute, if, as here, the consumers justifiably relied upon that conduct to their financial detriment. Unlike the fluid nature of moving traffic and changing road conditions that might, in some cases, excuse a driver's failure to comply with a stop sign by rendering compliance physically impossible, the same is not true of a commercial transaction. The latter occurs in a designed setting entirely of the vendor's own creation via preplanned marketing schemes. Thus, vendors place themselves, by choosing where, when, and how they enter the market, in a much stronger position to comply fully\n   with the UTPCPL before soliciting or interacting with consumers. Vendors not only elect whether to enter a market, but, because \"the market\" is a fictional place, they have full volitional control over their conduct when in it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The UTPCPL is for consumer protection. It undoes the ills of sharp business dealings by vendors, who, as here, may be counseling consumers in very private, highly technical concerns. Like the Greggs, those consumers may be especially reliant upon a vendor's specialized skill, training, and experience in matters with which consumers have little or no expertise. Therefore, the legislature has placed the duty of UTPCPL compliance squarely and solely on vendors; they are not to engage in deceitful conduct and have no legally cognizable excuse, if they do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Thus, we hold that the General Assembly, by \"eliminating the common law state of mind element (either negligence or intent to deceive),\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     TAP\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300145\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/36/1197/\">\n    36 A.3d at 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , imposed strict liability on vendors who deceive consumers by creating a likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding in private, as well as public, causes of actions. Carelessness or intent, required for negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations, may be absent when perpetrating \"deceptive conduct\" under 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(4)(xxi). Given their varying degrees of requisite intent, a UTPCPL catchall violation and the torts of negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation raise separate legal issues, as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As such, we conclude that the insurance companies' assertions of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and collateral estoppel fail the first step of their respective tests. Common law misrepresentations and UTPCPL catchall violations present distinct legal issues. Thus, the trial judge properly made a separate finding of fact under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     TAP\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and the insurance companies' first appellate issue lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Damages under the UTPCPL\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In their second appellate issue, the insurance companies seek to mitigate their damages for violating the UTPCPL. They argue that the trial judge misapplied the doctrine of rescission, because his award did not place both parties in the positions they occupied prior to Mr. Kovalchik's unlawful transaction. Relying upon THE RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF RESTITUTION AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT \u00a7 54, the insurance companies argue that they provided life insurance coverage to the Greggs of $24,027.55 from 1999 until 2012 and that, under THE RESTATEMENT (THIRD) , the trial judge should have offset that amount from what he awarded to the Greggs.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Companies' Brief at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The interpretation of a statute - such as the UTPCPL's damages provisions - presents a legal question, for which \"our scope of review is plenary, and our standard of review is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.
