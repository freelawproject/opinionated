On the trial, defendant\u2019s negligence was admitted, and also plaintiff\u2019s freedom from contributory negligence; so that the\" only question litigated was the extent of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Plaintiff \"had a verdict for $4,000, and from the judgment entered thereon, and the order denying a motion for a new trial, defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">On the trial, an expert witness, called on behalf of plaintiff t\u00f3 give evidence as to the extent of plaintiff\u2019s injuries, having testified, inter alia, that the plaintiff had chorea, was asked the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">\u201cQ. From your examination, state the treatment and the course of chorea in. her [plaintiff\u2019s] case\u2014what it will be\u2014the best way you can. Defendant\u2019s Counsel: I object to the question, as irrelevant, immaterial, and incompetent, and that there is no connection shown between the injury in this case and the \u2018chorea,\u2019 so called, and your honor will note my exception. The Court: The exception will be noted. Answer the question. Defendant's Counsel: How can he tell the course of something that has not happened? The Court: What will be the course, from his knowledge as an expert, of the disease? Defendant\u2019s Counsel: I object to that, on the ground that an expert is incompetent to testify to the future course of the disease. The Witness: .The disease chorea, and the allied diseases, of which there are several of the same kind, are caused by irritation of the brain. This irritation may be the result of injuries to the head, of shock, of fright, or a poisoned condition of the brain resulting from different fevers, \u2014from the poison of typhoid, or diphtheria, or scarlet fever, or diseases of that kind. When the irritation has reached a certain point, then these motions begin, usually in the hands, and spread to different parts of the body, and in time may become general, so that all the muscles of the body, the arms, legs, and face, are in a state of motion. The effect of this irritation also injures the brain. It is not at all uncommon to see cases of chorea who are stupid, and almost on the verge of idiocy. Now, in regard to the ultimate results of the disease,\u2014that is, as to its being able to be cured,\u2014 we usually find that simple chorea, not due to any organic injury of the brain, is quite curable, but where we have to deal with an organic disease of the brain,\u2014where injuries of the brain have occurred which cannot be cured by any means,\u2014there the chorea persists and remains with the patient.\" They cannot get rid of it, and it lasts for life, with a progressive mental degeneration as well as the muscular movements. Defendant\u2019s Counsel: I move to strike out in regard to chorea arising from injury to the brain organically, as having no connection with this case whatever, and because his testimony is not confined to results in this case. He is giving general lectures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">The motion was denied, and defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-16\">We are of the opinion that the motion to strike out should have been granted, and that the exception to the refusal so to do was well taken. . The question put by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and as modi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>fled or amended by the court, substantially called upon the witness to state, from his knowledge as an expert, the treatment and what would be the course of chorea in plaintiff\u2019s case. We think that the question itself was a proper one to put, but we look in vain in the answer for the slightest allusion to the plaintiff\u2019s case to which the question was addressed. The witness seems to have entered into a general discussion of the disease known as \u201cchorea,\u201d the various causes producing it, and some of the possible ultimate results thereof. Nowhere does the witness state or intimate or express an opinion as to what the course of the disease would be in plaintiff\u2019s case, or the probability or improbability of her recovery. On the contrary, the witness\u2019 answer was confined to the possible effects attending the progress of the disease in general, and its probable duration, and the results that might ensue to some person or other afflicted t^ith the disease, and those results dependent on the producing cause of the disease. We cannot say that this evidence did not prejudice the defendant, or influence the amount of the verdict. It improperly placed before the jury results that might ensue, future consequences that were possible, and it would be most natural that the jury, in estimating the damage to plaintiff, should take these elements into consideration in fixing the amount of the verdict. Strohm v. Railroad Co., 96 N. Y. 305; Tozer v. Railroad Co., 105 N. Y. 617, 11 N. E. 369. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider any other exception in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">For the reasons stated, we think that the judgment and order denying motion for a new trial should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
