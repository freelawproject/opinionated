It may be suggested, however, by way of complement thereto, that when proper emphasis is laid upon the language of the constitution there remains scarcely any opportunity' for the contention made by the appellant\u2019s counsel. Section 18 of article 3, which defines the powers of the legislature, provides that no law shall be passed authorizing the construction or operation of a street railroad, except upon the condition that the consent of the \u201clocal authorities having the control of that portion of a street or a highway upon which it is proposed to construct or operate such railroad be first obtained.\u201d Now, this language clearly indicates that the framers of the constitution recognized a condition of affairs, the existence of which is well known to every one at all familiar with the highway law of this state, viz. that a \u201cportion\u201d of a public highway is frequently territorially within one political subdivision of the state, while the burden of its control and maintenance is imposed upon another. And such is confessedly the situation which confronts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>-the parties to this action. One-half of the bridge in question is Avithin the boundaries of the village of Tonawanda, while the other half is within the confines of the village of North Tonawanda. But the structure itself was built by the towns of Tonawanda and Wlieatfield, with some assistance from the state, and the special act under which it was built provides that the towns shall be responsible for its repair and maintenance. Laws 1867, c. 863, \u00a7 9. Subsequently it was enacted by the legislature that nothing in the general act \u201cgiving to the board of trustees of a village power to make and repair bridges within the village bounds, or making them commissioners of highways, etc., shall be construed as divesting the commissioners of highways, for any town in Avhich a bridge may be located, of power or control over the same.\u201d Laws 1870, c. 291, as amended by Laws 1887, c. 513, \u00a7 3. It will be seen, therefore, that the control of this bridge is expressly conferred upon the plaintiffs, and, as it constitutes a \u201cportion\u201d of a highway over which the defendant seeks to construct and operate its road, it necessarily follows that the \u201clocal authorities\u201d whose consent is to be obtained as a condition of such construction and operation must be the town highway commissioners. In re Rochester El. Ry. Co., 123 N. Y. 351, 356, 25 N. E. 381. The application of a simple test will determine the correctness of this conclusion. Suppose the defendant were to place some obstruction upon this bridge; could either or both of the villages, whose corporate limits extend to its center, maintain an notion therefor? Most assuredly not, because the right to maintain and control the bridge resides elsewhere, and a municipality Avhich cannot sue for or restrain the obstruction of any particular portion of a highway certainly cannot authorize the same to be used for a street railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
