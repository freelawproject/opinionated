Grimshaw' was employed by the plaintiff to solicit orders from customers, and did not appear to have been intrusted with the possession of the whole or any part of the merchandise sold. Under these circumstances the payments to Grimshaw were made by the defendant at his peril of the former\u2019s want of authority. It is well settled that an agent to solicit orders merely, or to sell goods, who has not the possession of the goods, has no implied or apparent authority to receive payment. Higgins v. Moore, 34 N. Y. 417; McKindly v. Dunham (Wis.) 13 <em>N. </em>W. <em>485; </em>Butler v. Dorman, 30 Am. Rep. 795; Meyer v. Stone, 55 Am. Rep. 577; Kane v. Barstow (Kan. Sup.) 22 Pac. 588; Kohn v. Washer, 53 Am. Rep. 745. Proof of Grimshaw\u2019s authority to collect, either by plaintiff\u2019s express direction, or by inference from a course of dealing, was, therefore, essential to the defendant\u2019s success upon the trial (Higgins v. Moore, supra; Lamb v. Hirschberg, 1 Misc. Rep. 108, 20 N. Y. Supp. 678), and the absence of such proof renders the judgment appealed from erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
