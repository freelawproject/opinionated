Myers against Moses S. Bosenback. A judgment of the general term of the city court (31 N. Y. Supp. 993), affirming a judgment in favor of defendant, was affirmed (3\u00e1 lsT. Y. Supp. 63), and plaintiff moves for leave to appeal to the court of appeals. Denied.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b27-17\">Argued before DALY, C.

The point made on this motion that the error in the reception of evidence on the counterclaim may have influenced the jury on the merits of the action cannot be considered, as it was not presented on the appeal by any exception taken at the trial. The plaintiff\u2019s motions at the close of the case for a verdict in his favor on the whole case, and on the counterclaim, and on the question of damages, were united, to the denial of all which but one exception was taken; and as plaintiff was not entitled to the granting of all of such motions, the single exception taken does not present the particular error complained of. Bosley v. Machine Co., 123 N. Y. 550-557, 25 N. E. 990. That the decision of the general term may result in the defendant being compelled to pay costs in the numerous actions he has brought for the installments of rent he claimed, and which such decision may prevent his recovering, is not ground for granting leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
