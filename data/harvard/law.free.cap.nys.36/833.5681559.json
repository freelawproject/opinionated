The plaintiff, pursuant to the defendant\u2019s demand, served a bill of particulars upon the defendant, giving the dates and principal of each note, and the respective sums which the plaintiff claims to have paid upon each one of them. The defendant then moved to inspect the notes, to enable her to frame her answer, and the motion was granted.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b853-10\">Argued before PARKER, P.

She thus has a clear idea of what her answer ought to contain. We need not consider whether she will, after answer, need an inspection in order to prepare for trial, since her motion is not based upon that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">The order is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion below is denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
