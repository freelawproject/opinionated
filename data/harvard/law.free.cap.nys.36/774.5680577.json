Upon a careful review of the whole case, it clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>appears that the case was one for the jury, both upon the question of negligence and the question of contributory negligence; that no error was committed in the admission of evidence, or in refusing to dismiss the complaint; and that the verdict is not against the evidence, or against the weight of the evidence. Moreover, the verdict should not be disturbed as excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
