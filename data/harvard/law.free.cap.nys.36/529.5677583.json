By section 2552 of the Code of Civil Procedure the decree of the surrogate directing an executor to pay money to a person entitled to the same from the estate is conclusive evidence that there are sufficient assets in his hands to satisfy the sum directed to be paid. The defendant cannot be heard to impeach the decree, but the same must stand as conclusive as to all questions adjudicated therein, as there has been no appeal therefrom. The accounts were passed upon, and the sums due from the executor ordered to be paid. On the neglect or refusal of the appellant to pay, an execution was issued and returned unsatisfied. The appellant was examined in supplementary proceedings, which disclosed the fact that appellant had paid personal bills and money to himself and also to his lawyer. While the payments may have been legally made, he cannot now be heard to excuse his noncompliance with the decree by saying he has not the amount in his hands .to pay as required thereby. In re Snyder, 103 N. Y. 178, 8 N. E. 479; In re Kurtzman, 2 N. Y. St. Rep. 655. The defense urging that the assignee of Oscar Waring is not entitled to enforce the decree against Washburn has no merit. However that might have been in the surrogate\u2019s court, it cannot be urged at this time, as there is no power to correct the decree except in this court or upon appeal. Smith v. Nelson, 62 N.
