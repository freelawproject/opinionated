The evidence adduced in his behalf is found to properly sup: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>port the finding that this particular defect caused the injury, and that the plaintiff was himself chargeable with no negligence contributing to the result. Further, the defendant\u2019s negligence in maintaining the sidewalk as noted was sufficiently apparent from the period of its existence in this defective form,\u2014an interval of three months, according to some of the evidence. In support of the claim that this condition of the flagstones was not actually shown to have caused the injury, the defendant points to the evidence of the plaintiff that his foot struck \u201cthat stone,\u201d without an express statement appearing that the overlapping flagstone was intended; but, in view of all the circumstances shown by the proof in the case, we must hold that there was ample room for an inference to be drawn by the jury that the defendant\u2019s negligence, as pointed out, was the proximate cause of the accident. The award of damages is not questioned, and we can find no error in the rulings upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.
