Johnson v. New York Produce Exchange, 8 Mise. Rep. 552, 29 N. Y. Supp. S07, must control the special term of this court until it shall have been disapproved by a higher tribunal. The complaint and proceedings in that case were practically the same as in the one before me; and the facts so nearly approach those herein disclosed that I feel constrained to regard it as a controlling authority in the matter of this application. In both cases the complaint charged \u201cproceedings inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade,\u201d\u2014in the one case, by \u201cbreach of\u201d a specified contract; in the ether, by failure to comply with \u201cthe terms of\u201d a specified contract. In both cases the board of managers proceeded, in regular conformity with the by-laws, to investigate the matter; and in both cases they concluded that the accused party had, in their opinion, been guilty of conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade; and in both cases the accused was suspended, in perfect accordance with the by-laws. The two cases, therefore, being practically identical, and the general term of this court, having decided, in the Johnson Case, that the Exchange was without jurisdiction to suspend the accused, I have no other alternative than to grant the application herein asked for. The application granted, with $50 costs and disbursements to the applicant.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b448-4\">Argued before FREEDMAN and McADAM, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-5\">Baldwin &amp; Blackmar (Abel E.
