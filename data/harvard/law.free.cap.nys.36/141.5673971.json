Commissioners were appointed, and the streets were opened. Thereupon grading commissioners were appointed. When the presentation of their report for confirmation took place, objections were made thereto by the appellants, who were the owners \"of property within the assessment district. The objections were overruled, and the report. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>confirmed, and from the order of the confirmation the property owners have appealed to this court. The objections'are: First, in relation to the amount of the assessment; second, as to the legality of opening a portion of the avenue; and, third, that the commissioners have been legislated out of office.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">No misconduct or misapprehension is charged upon the commissioners, and there is no claim that they adopted any illegal rule or principle in making their assessments. Under such circumstances, appellate tribunals refuse to interfere upon mere questions of amount, unless the sums awarded are so inadequate or so large as to be palpably unjust. No such case is presented by this record. The second objection requires no consideration. It is plainly frivolous. The third objection presents no error. These proceedings are special, and the commissioners appointed therein are not town officers, and cannot properly be denominated town officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
