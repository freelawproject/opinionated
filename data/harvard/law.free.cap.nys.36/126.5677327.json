Judson against the Flushing Jockey Club to recover a sweepstake won on a horse race. A judgment was rendered by the trial court in favor of defendant, on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Laws 1895, c. 570 (Percy-Gray Racing Act), under which the action ivas brought, was unconstitutional. On appeal to the general term, the two judges before whom the case was argued differed in their views, and each wrote an opinion. A reargument was then ordered, because of the failure of concurrence. Afterwards it was suggested that the litigation was fictitious. Reference ordered as to character of litigation.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b147-5\">Argued before DALY, C.

Demarest v. Mayor, etc., 147 N. Y. 203, 41 N. E. 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Courts of judicature are organized only to decide real controversies between actual litigants. When, therefore, it appears, no matter how nor at what stage, that a pretended action is not a genuine litigation over a contested right between opposing parties, but is merely the proffer of a simulated issue by a person dominating both sides of the record, the court, from a sense of its own dignity, as well as from regard to the public interests, will decline a determination of the fabricated case so fraudulently imposed upon it. Lord v. Veazie, 8 How. 255; Cleveland v. Chamberlain, 1 Black, 426; Wood-Paper Co. v. Heft, 8 Wall. 333; Bartemeyer v. Iowa, 18 Wall. 134, 135; San Mateo Co. v. Southern Pac. R. Co., 116 U. S. 138, 6 Sup. Ct. 317; Washington Market Co. v. District of Columbia, 137 U. S. 62, 11 Sup. Ct. 4; South Spring Hill Gold Min. Co. v. Amador Medean Gold Min. Co., 145 U. S. 300, 12 Sup. Ct. 921; Manufacturing Co. v. Wright, 141 U. S. 696, 700, 12 Sup. Ct. 103; California v. San Pablo &amp; T. R. Co., 149 U. S. 308, 314, 13 Sup. Ct. 876; Hoskins v. Lord Berkeley, 4 Term R. 402; In re Elsam, 3 Barn. &amp; C. 597; Wood v. Nesbitt (Sup.) 19 N. Y. Supp. 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">If we may not accept the assurance of reputable members of the bar as proof that the action is a false and fictitious litigation, their statement suffices, at all events, for a postponement of the decision until the court shall be satisfied that it has to do with a legitimate-forensic discussion. According to the precedents, we may so as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>certain either by the record, by affidavits, or by a reference. The last-named expedient we adopt as the more effective method of investigation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
