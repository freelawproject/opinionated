When the officer reached the premises, the door was closed and fastened, but he obtained entrance through a window, and found within three men besides the defendant; the latter being behind the front bar, back of which was the back bar, which contained glasses and labeled bottles, such as are usually found in such places. Upon the front bar there were two glasses. To the question, \u201cWhat was in them?\u201d he answered, \u201cThey were removed before I could get to the bar.\u201d To the further question, \u201cSomething in them?\u201d he replied, \u201cYes, sir; a small quantity of liquor.\u201d It is evident from the testimony which preceded the last answer, as well as that which followed it, that this was a mere guess on the part of the officer. He saw nothing poured into the glasses; they were removed before he reached the bar; and he did not examine them afterwards for the purpose of ascertaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>whether they contained liquor. The fact that bottles bearing labels indicating that they contain spirituous liquors are stationed in their usual places upon a back bar is not of itself sufficient to support a conviction for a violation of the statute; for such a fact, standing alone, will not support a finding that the owner or person in charge was selling or offering or exposing for sale any part of the contents of such bottles. A person charged with violating the excise law, like all other alleged offenders against the law, is presumed to be innocent until proof of his guilt is furnished; and this is not accomplished by showing that the bottles were standing unused behind the bar. As there is no proof that any of the contents of the bottles were either sold or given away, it was necessary to prove other facts and circumstances to support a finding that their exposure was for the purpose of sale. There were three persons in the store, the doors of which were fastened; but whether they were customers of the store or friends of the defendant does not appear, nor were they seen to drink anything whatever. It does not appear that the two glasses on the bar were nut there for their use, or had been used by either of them, nor whether they had contained spirituous liquor of any character. The evidence, therefore, was insufficient to justify a finding by the court that the defendant had violated the statute as charged in the complaint, and he should have been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The judgment of conviction should be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
