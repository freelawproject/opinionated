J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_Xe\">These appeals arise out of a summary judgment granted to defendant Stamps.com Inc., in plaintiff Megan A. Kelly\u2019s action for wrongful termination and nonpayment of wages. In B167287, plaintiff appeals from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>that judgment, while in B171369 defendant appeals from a postjudgment order denying its motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">On plaintiff\u2019s appeal, we conclude that summary judgment should not have been granted, except with respect to two causes of action. We reverse the judgment and remand for entry of a limited summary adjudication order. On defendant\u2019s appeal, we affirm the order denying attorney fees, as defendant is no longer the prevailing party entitled to claim them.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">\n<em>THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A7_\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s first amended complaint (FAC) alleged at its outset claims for violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.; FEHA) and of public policy, to the effect that defendant on February 6, 2001 had discharged plaintiff from her employment as its vice-president of marketing, \u201cbecause she was seven months pregnant and was planning on taking her promised paid maternity leave in connection with the birth of her child in April of 2001.\u201d A third cause of action, for breach of contract, alleged that following a large reduction in workforce in October 2000, defendant had promised plaintiff a substantial retention bonus (35 percent of her $150,000 annual salary), to be paid in two installments, the second one on April 20, 2001. This promise allegedly created an implied contract that plaintiff\u2019s employment would continue until at least April 21, 2001, which defendant breached by terminating her sooner. Plaintiff also alleged this breach, in a fourth cause of action, as one of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In a fifth cause, the FAC alleged that defendant\u2019s failure to pay plaintiff\u2019s remaining bonus upon her termination constituted a breach of contract and a violation of Labor Code sections 201 and 2926. A sixth cause alleged that, in violation of public policy, defendant had terminated plaintiff in order to avoid paying her wages due, including her bonus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Defendant moved for summary judgment, or alternatively for summary adjudication of each cause of action. Defendant asserted that plaintiff\u2019s primary claims, for unlawful discharge on account of pregnancy, were unmeritorious because plaintiff had been terminated as part of a reorganization of defendant, with a further reduction of workforce, and she could not establish a triable issue that this reason was a pretext for pregnancy discrimination against her. With respect to the other four causes of action, defendant asserted that plaintiff\u2019s employment had been at will, and she had been terminated for good cause. Defendant supported its contentions with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>following facts and evidence, derived from documents and from declarations by Kenneth McBride and Kathleen (Kathy) Brush.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Defendant sells postage and related services on the Internet. Defendant hired plaintiff as its vice-president of direct marketing on October 20, 1999, at a base salary of $130,000 a year, later increased to $150,000. (Plaintiff\u2019s title at some point changed to simply vice-president of marketing.) Upon hiring, plaintiff executed an employment agreement and a confidentiality agreement, both of which provided that her employment was at-will, terminable by either party with or without reason. Plaintiff performed marketing activities for defendant\u2019s small business unit, headed by Doug Walner, her immediate superior. According to McBride, chief financial officer at the time and later also chief executive officer (CEO), plaintiff was hired and responsible primarily for direct marketing, to both existing and potential customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">In the same year that plaintiff was hired, defendant suffered a precipitous decline in stock value (over 93 percent), and a continual loss of capital, stemming from excess expenditures over revenues. To reduce expenses, in October 2000 defendant laid off about 240 of its then approximately 540 employees. Plaintiff\u2014who, according to the FAC, had made it known the previous month that she was pregnant and would be taking maternity leave in April 2001\u2014was not among those so terminated. Moreover, as part of a program to retain remaining employees, plaintiff in October received stock options and was awarded a cash retention bonus of 35 percent of her $150,000 salary (or $52,500), to be paid one-third in 90 days, and two-thirds in 180 days (April 20, 2000), provided she remained employed by defendant at those times.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Also in October 2000, defendant hired a new CEO, Coleman, who brought in as a contracting consultant Kathy Brush, a marketing expert and turnaround specialist. Brush was charged with recommending ways to cut defendant\u2019s costs and streamline its marketing efforts. According to both her and CFO McBride, upper management \u201chad become generally dissatisfied with the performance of the marketing group in the Small Business Unit.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">Early in 2001, defendant\u2019s management decided that the company\u2019s cash flow required another reduction in workforce, by approximately 150 employees, which would be implemented in early February. Concurrently, defendant would consolidate its three separate business units, including the small business unit, into one. The sales and marketing functions of these units <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>likewise would be combined in one group. Coleman directed Brush to evaluate defendant\u2019s marketing employees, and inform him who should be retained for the new sales and marketing group. Brush declared that she evaluated plaintiff on the merits and without regard to her pregnancy. At least once in December 2000 or January 2001, however, Coleman told McBride he believed plaintiff\u2019s attendance was poor, and he used the term \u201cchecked out\u201d to refer, according to McBride, \u201cto her poor attendance and attitude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">On February 2, 2001, Brush submitted to McBride a list of marketing employees to be retained. It did not include plaintiff. McBride consolidated the list with those he had received from other managers, and presented the combined list to Coleman, who approved Brush\u2019s recommendations. Plaintiff was terminated on February 6, 2001, the same day as the rest of those laid off. She received 60 days\u2019 severance pay, or $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Brush\u2019s declaration attached a written evaluation of plaintiff, of a type Brush was asked to prepare, \u201c[p]rior to the announcement of the February 2001 layoffs,\u201d regarding each employee she reviewed. In it, Brush stated that plaintiff was not responsible for \u201cproducts and partners,\u201d but for direct marketing programs, which had been reduced and were scheduled for further reduction along with the personnel layoffs. (McBride testified that defendant\u2019s marketing budget had decreased from $20.5 million for the third quarter of 2000 to $4.3 million for the first quarter of 2001.) Brush\u2019s evaluation also stated she had not considered plaintiff for vice-president of marketing after the restructuring, because that position \u201cwill be assumed by a generalist that will oversee direct marketing, sales, product marketing and business development for both the postage and shipping groups. These are qualifications that [plaintiff] does not have.\u201d Nor, Brush opined, was plaintiff appropriate for the position of director of a general team that would perform limited direct marketing, because of her \u201cinflexibility\u201d with projects (apparently in terms of size or expense) and ineffectiveness as a leader. Brush appraised plaintiff as of \u201climited motivation,\u201d often arriving late. Her atttendance had improved in January, \u201cwhen the CEO noted to Doug Walner that [plaintiff\u2019s] attendance was not good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">Upon consolidation, Brush assumed supervision of the sales and marketing group. Although still engaged as a contractor, she took the same title as plaintiff had had, vice-president of marketing. Nonetheless, Brush declared that \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s position as Vice President of marketing was . . . eliminated entirely in the February 2001 restructuring and she was not replaced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">In her opposition to the motion for summary judgment, plaintiff agreed that in February 2001 defendant had implemented a restructuring and reduction in force to reduce costs. Plaintiff undertook to show, however, a triable issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>that this tendered justification for her termination was a pretext for discharge on a discriminatory basis. To this end, plaintiff presented a declaration by her former supervisor Walner, and excerpts of the depositions of McBride, vice-president Ian Siegel, and plaintiff herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Walner, formerly manager of the small business unit, gave an appraisal of plaintiff\u2019s responsibilities and performance at odds with Brush\u2019s. He declared that plaintiff\u2019s duties had included overseeing not only direct marketing, but also online marketing, television, print, and general marketing, as well as brand marketing. The latter \u201cpervade[d] everything [defendant] did with partners and sales . . . .\u201d In these matters, plaintiff was an excellent employee, very good at all aspects, with a like understanding of brand marketing and its goals. She \u201cwas also a very committed employee and never . . . did I see a change in [plaintiff\u2019s] commitment to [defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Walner attached a formal assessment of plaintiff, which he had prepared in October 2000. On a five-level scale, from outstanding to below expectations, he had rated her \u201cAbove Expectations,\u201d the second-highest level, in five categories, and a one notch further down (\u201cMeets Expectations\u201d) for \u201cLeadership Skills.\u201d He also had answered affirmatively the question whether plaintiff was \u201cIndispensable to [defendant\u2019s] business needs,\u201d and had given as reasons plaintiff\u2019s \u201cRun[ning] significant portion of acquisition,\u201d her management of \u201ckey branded marketing programs,\u201d and that she had the respect of her department as a leader.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">With regard to plaintiff\u2019s nonretention, Walner declared that CEO Coleman had asked him to prepare a list of employees within the unit who should be retained after the impending force reduction. Walner had included plaintiff on the list, because her involvement in and knowledge of marketing would perfectly fit the need for an overseer of a reduced group.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Walner gave this list to Coleman, and they later discussed it. Coleman asked why Walner had included plaintiff, and Walner replied he felt she was the only person capable of managing the group, particularly as Walner would not be staying. Coleman repeated the question, and commented that plaintiff had mentally \u201cchecked out.\u201d According to Walner, Coleman then \u201cmade intonations about [plaintiff] being pregnant, saying she had mentally \u2018checked out,\u2019 and questioning whether she was really doing her job.\u201d Walner responded, \u201cYou know that is not true,\u201d and defended plaintiff\u2019s commitment, hard work, and singular ability \u201cto take that group forward without me there.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>A similar account was provided by Ian Siegel, defendant\u2019s vice-president for web development until April 2001, and a self-described member of defendant\u2019s senior management team. He testified that almost all of defendant\u2019s marketing programs proceeded using technology his department developed. Siegel worked with plaintiff almost daily, as she was head of marketing and was involved in not only direct marketing but also \u201cpartnering\u201d with other companies, as well as brand development and other functions. According to Siegel, plaintiff worked in the small business unit only after a substantial period as \u201cthe operational head of marketing\u201d for defendant, reporting to five different nominal superiors. He considered plaintiff extremely competent, and a tremendous asset to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Siegel further testified that before plaintiff\u2019s layoff, Coleman called him in and asked his opinion\u2014because he worked with the marketing group daily\u2014 about who in that group were strongest and should be kept on. Siegel replied, \u201cYou absolutely have to . . . start with [plaintiff], she is the heart and soul of that team,\u201d and he couldn\u2019t imagine it functioning without her. Coleman replied, \u201cMegan has checked out.\u201d Siegel said it would be a mistake to assume that. Coleman repeated that plaintiff had \u201cchecked out,\u201d saying it \u201cin a definitive, end-of-conversation type of way.\u201d He and Siegel then proceeded to discuss other marketing employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Over defendant\u2019s objections, Siegel specifically and diametrically disagreed with each statement that Brush had made regarding plaintiff in her written evaluation. He also recounted that after plaintiff\u2019s departure, Brush had taken over plaintiff\u2019s position as operational head of marketing, assuming management of the partner program, messaging, and design of the Web site, \u201call of the things that Megan had done prior to Kathy taking over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">In her own deposition, plaintiff described commendations she had received from numerous members of defendant\u2019s management during her tenure, and she testified none had ever commented negatively on her performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">Regarding her discharge, plaintiff stated she had been concerned just before February 6, 2001, because she had not been informed of her impending status, or asked for her input, as had other vice-presidents. Moreover, Walner and Siegel had told her how Coleman had referred to her having \u201cchecked out.\u201d Plaintiff accordingly met with Mike Zuercher, a house counsel for defendant, on the afternoon of February 5. She expressed her fear that she would be included in the reduction in force, notwithstanding her group had been performing well. Referring to Coleman, plaintiff told Zuercher, \u201cI don\u2019t know what he means by \u2018checked out.\u201d I can\u2019t help to think that he thinks I am checked out because I\u2019m pregnant and I am going to go off on maternity leave____\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>Plaintiff also told Zuercher she was concerned that perhaps McBride wanted her gone. She related that she had heard McBride had made vulgar, derogatory remarks about her, which led her to believe he might now want to get rid of her.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Zuercher told plaintiff he would share her concerns with Coleman. Later that day, Zuercher told her, \u201cI talked to Bruce [Coleman].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">After her discharge, plaintiff testified, she requested a meeting with Coleman. It was held on February 12, 2001, with Zuercher also in attendance. Plaintiff told Coleman of her beliefs about her discharge, and asked him to explain, in light of her having been at the top of Walner\u2019s list. Coleman replied that she hadn\u2019t been on Walner\u2019s list. This heightened plaintiff\u2019s confusion. Coleman told plaintiff he had never discriminated against anyone, and offered to list people whom she could ask about it. He also told plaintiff that defendant had eliminated her position. She stated that she did not so understand, because many of her functions were then still ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">McBride testified that Brush\u2019s report was in plaintiff\u2019s personnel file. It also had been sent to him by Brush, as an e-mail attachment, on February 5, 2001. Finally, plaintiff testified she had been informed that maternity leave benefits included insured disability leave at two-thirds of salary for six weeks, followed by company paid leave for six more weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">At the hearing of the motion for summary judgment, the trial court initially indicated its tentative view that although defendant had made a showing of legitimate reasons for plaintiff\u2019s layoff, plaintiff had presented substantial evidence that these reasons were a pretext. The court stated that the case was triable, observing that \u201cher firing, if it was not done for discriminatory purposes, was very inartfully executed.\u201d The court also remarked, \u201cIt does lead one to believe that a company in financial trouble was looking to get rid of an employee for whom they were going to have to keep on the books because they promised her maternity leave . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">At a further session the following day, the court announced it was inclined to change its tentative ruling, It expressed the view that if Brush assumed, or \u201csubsumed,\u201d plaintiff\u2019s duties together with others, then the reason for plaintiff\u2019s discharge was not pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">Following the hearing, the court granted the motion for summary judgment, and issued \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of law\u201d in explanation of its ruling. (Cf. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (g).) With respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>discrimination claims, the court ruled that plaintiff had shown a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge, but ultimately had not established that defendant\u2019s preferred reason, the corporate restructuring and consolidation of her position with others, had been pretextual. The court found the remaining four causes of action lacked merit because plaintiff had been terminated for good cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">1. <em>The Discrimination Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">We consider first the trial court\u2019s summary adjudication of plaintiff\u2019s first two causes of action, for discriminatory discharge on the basis of pregnancy, in violation of FEHA and of public policy. (See <em>Badih </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1289 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 229].) On this as on plaintiff\u2019s other causes of action, we review the court\u2019s decision de novo. <em>(Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400 </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 767 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 23 P.3d 1143].) The scope of each party\u2019s substantive burden in this type of case was delineated in <em>Guz v. Bechtel National Inc. </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 354-357 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089] <em>(Guz).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">Ordinarily, a plaintiff employee who claims discrimination must first make a prima facie case, consisting of evidence that she was within the class protected from discrimination and was performing her job competently, but was terminated\u2014plus some other circumstance suggesting discriminatory motive. <em>(Guz, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 354-355.) This showing raises a presumption of discrimination, shifting to the defendant employer the burden of producing evidence to establish a genuine issue that the termination was made for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 355-356.) If the employer does so, the presumption disappears, but the employee, who retains the overall burden of persuasion, may then yet seek to show discriminatory motive, by evidence that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was false and a pretext, and any other evidence of discriminatory motive. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 356.)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">A defendant employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment slightly modifies the order of these showings. If, as here, the motion for summary judgment relies in whole or in part on a showing of nondiscriminatory reasons for the discharge, the employer satisfies its burden as moving party if it presents evidence of such nondiscriminatory reasons that would permit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>trier, of fact to find, more likely than not, that they were the basis for the termination. (See <em>Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850-851 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493]; cf. <em>Guz, </em>supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 357.) To defeat the motion, the employee then must adduce or point to evidence raising a triable issue, that would permit a trier of fact to find by a preponderance that intentional discrimination occurred. (Aguilar, at pp. 850-851; <em>Guz, </em>at p. 357.) In determining whether these burdens were met, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, as the nonmoving party, liberally construing her evidence while strictly scrutinizing defendant\u2019s. <em>(Aguilar, </em>at p. 856.)</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The basis for defendant\u2019s motion was that plaintiff was terminated for legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons, namely defendant\u2019s economically induced restructuring and reduction in force in February 2001. From the evidence defendant initially presented, this explanation may be deemed a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, sufficient to shift to plaintiff the burden of showing a triable issue of its falsity, with respect to her, and ultimately of discriminatory motive instead. Whether plaintiff satisfied this burden remains the principal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Defendant makes a preemptive argument that lacks merit. In her separate statement of facts, plaintiff admitted that defendant underwent the restructuring and layoffs in February 2001. But she did not admit, there or ever, that this had been the actual, motivating reason for her discharge. Defendant\u2019s contention that plaintiff\u2019s admission precluded her from claiming that defendant\u2019s adduced neutral reason was untrue is therefore meritless. As explained in <em>Guz, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at page 358, \u201c[D]ownsizing alone is not necessarily a sufficient explanation, under the FEHA, for the consequent dismissal of [a protected] worker. An employer\u2019s freedom to consolidate or reduce its work force, and to eliminate positions in the process, does not mean it may \u2018use the occasion as a convenient opportunity to get rid of [protected] workers.\u2019 [Citations.] Invocation of a right to downsize does not resolve whether the employer had a discriminatory motive for cutting back its work force, <em>or engaged in intentional discrimination when deciding which individual workers to retain and release.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Defendant also argues that any possibility of discriminatory motive in plaintiff\u2019s discharge was lacking because defendant did not discharge plaintiff, and in fact awarded her a retention bonus, during the initial, October 2000 layoffs, even though, as plaintiff alleged, she had made known to defendant in September her pregnancy and intent to take maternity leave at the end of April 2001. This contention fails, however, because neither Coleman nor Brush, the alleged decision makers in plaintiff\u2019s firing, was involved with the October layoffs and bonuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>Plaintiff did adduce evidence of a number of circumstances that cast doubt on the genuineness of defendant\u2019s explanation for her discharge. First, plaintiff was let go despite a record of excellence in her executive responsibilities, as attested to by both her superior (Walner) and another high executive with whom she worked continually (Siegel). Second, when these executives were asked by Coleman who should be retained in marketing, they both proffered plaintiff, and attested to her abilities to manage marketing efforts in a period of downsizing and transition. Third, however, Coleman dismissed this advice, with the peremptory expression that plaintiff had \u201cchecked out.\u201d As discussed below, this reaction and terminology are not, as the trial court suggested, unamenable to signifying a discriminatory animus. Indeed, in at least one instance when he used the phrase concerning plaintiff, Coleman also referred in some fashion to her pregnancy. Moreover, even if the language be deemed nondiscriminatory in isolation, there is no doubt that Coleman\u2019s manifest attitude toward plaintiff\u2019s retention was bluntly negative, in vivid contrast to the views and assessments of those executives who worked with her.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Furthermore, there was evidence that Coleman lied to plaintiff when she asked him to explain her termination, on February 12, 2001. Coleman denied that plaintiff had been on Walner\u2019s list of persons suggested for retention. But according to Walner, not only had plaintiff been on his list, she had been the first one he had mentioned and commended when Coleman later asked him about his preferences. As is the case with evidence of false reasons, a finding that Coleman was knowingly untruthful here could give rise to an inference that \u201cthe employer [wa]s dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose.\u201d <em>(Reeves </em>v. <em>Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc. </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 133, 147 [147 L.Ed.2d 105, 120 S.Ct. 2097] <em>(Reeves).)</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">In the same meeting, Coleman also told plaintiff that she had been discharged because her position had been eliminated. Defendant presently repeats this reason for plaintiff\u2019s discharge, together with and as a refinement of the more general reason of reorganization and layoffs. But the evidence reflects a triable issue whether the claim that defendant eliminated plaintiff\u2019s position was true or untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>First, a new (and not pregnant) individual, Brush, assumed plaintiff\u2019s title of vice-president of marketing after plaintiff left. Second, plaintiff and Siegel effectively testified that Brush thereafter performed plaintiff\u2019s former functions, and served, as had plaintiff, as the \u201coperational head of marketing.\u201d Although defendant stresses that this testimony did not establish that Brush was performing all of the functions and programs plaintiff had run, even evidence that one or more programs were discontinued at one point or another would not establish that plaintiff\u2019s position was eliminated, as opposed to her having been replaced. (See <em>Barnes v. GenCorp Inc. </em>(6th Cir. 1990) 896 F.2d 1457, 1465 <em>(Barnes).),</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Defendant\u2019s further argument that plaintiff did not negate Brush\u2019s having performed duties additional to plaintiff\u2019s also does not validate the claim of \u201cposition elimination.\u201d Defendant\u2019s evidence did not establish that Brush performed such additional duties, and it was defendant\u2019s burden to show that plaintiff\u2019s position was eliminated, the essence of defendant\u2019s espoused legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for dismissing her. Moreover, Brush was not \u201canother employee assigned to perform the plaintiff\u2019s duties in addition to other duties,\u201d as referred to in <em>Barnes, supra, </em>896 F.2d at page 1465. Rather, Brush was an independent consultant, who was not assigned to perform marketing duties for defendant until plaintiff was fired. In sum, there is a triable issue whether the claim plaintiff\u2019s position was eliminated\u2014as offered in explanation by Coleman in 2001 and by defendant now\u2014is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">The content and circumstances of Brush\u2019s written evaluation of plaintiff also lend support to plaintiff\u2019s claims, both of false reasons and of discriminatory purpose. First, Brush\u2019s negative opinions conflicted with those of defendant\u2019s managers who were more familiar with plaintiff and her performance. Second, plaintiff presented evidence indicating that Brush\u2019s evaluation may have been prepared or utilized as a pretext. McBride testified that the evaluation had been attached to an e-mail Brush sent him. Dated February 5, 2001, at 7:41 p.m., the e-mail stated that Brush was including two files regarding employee evaluations, one about elimination of positions and the second with notes on performance. Brush stated that the first document was \u201c[hjopefully ... all that will be needed if anything is needed.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">This e-mail was sent just hours after plaintiff had complained, to Zuercher, that Coleman might be contemplating letting her go because of her pregnancy. And a copy of Brush\u2019s evaluation ended up in plaintiff\u2019s personnel file. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>In short, within a day, plaintiff complained of possible discrimination, Coleman was notified, Brush sent her evaluation of plaintiff to top management, and plaintiff was discharged. From this it could be inferred that the evaluation was either prepared or at least transmitted the night before the layoffs in an effort to preempt or rebut plaintiff\u2019s incipient claim of discriminatory discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">We conclude that plaintiff presented a triable issue that the reason or reasons defendant gave for her termination were false. While this showing was substantial, in order to avoid summary judgment plaintiff also had to tender\u2014most aptly as part of her prima facie case\u2014evidence of pregnancy-discriminatory motive on defendant\u2019s part. <em>(Guz, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 361-362; <em>Reeves, supra, </em>530 U.S. at pp. 147-149; <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 502, 511 [125 L.Ed.2d 407, 113 S.Ct. 2742].)</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Plaintiff established this element of her case as well.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Much of the evidence that defendant\u2019s reasons were pretextual, cited <em>ante, </em>also supported an inference that the actual reason for plaintiff\u2019s termination was the discriminatory one she alleged. (Cf. <em>Reeves, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 147.) And there was direct evidence as well. Walner and Siegel both testified that when Coleman solicited their opinions about who should be retained in marketing, they each suggested and praised plaintiff. Coleman\u2019s response to them was that plaintiff had \u201cchecked out,\u201d and there was no reason to consider her. Under the circumstances, that plaintiff was about seven months pregnant and was expected to take her allotted three months\u2019 pregnancy leave, Coleman\u2019s \u201cchecked out\u201d comments could reasonably be understood as referring to some combination of plaintiff\u2019s commitment to take the leave, and a temporary diversion of her attention attendant to her condition. In other words, Coleman could be seen as saying that plaintiff\u2019s pregnancy and upcoming leave disqualified her for retention. And of course, Walner testified that Coleman directly connected his \u201cchecked out\u201d remarks to plaintiff\u2019s pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">Defendant\u2019s efforts to disqualify Coleman\u2019s statements from discriminatory relevance fail. The claim that he was not the decision maker is, as already stated <em>{ante, </em>fn. 1099), extremely tenuous. The notion that his language was too vague or neutral to imply discrimination ignores the context, just discussed. Nor may Coleman\u2019s statements be characterized\u2014as a matter of law\u2014as \u201cstray\u201d remarks, unconnected with the process of retention and termination. (See generally <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Consolidated Services </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 794, 801 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 187].)</p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>Defendant also cites the trial court\u2019s statement in its \u201cfindings\u201d that assuming Coleman\u2019s remarks referred to plaintiff\u2019s pregnancy, \u201c[they do] not respond to the uncontroverted evidence that plaintiff\u2019s position was eliminated by way of consolidation.\u201d We have already explained, however, that there was no such \u201cuncontradicted evidence.\u201d And even if plaintiff\u2019s exact position were determined to have been eliminated, defendant could still face liability if plaintiff was removed from employment because of her pregnancy. (See <em>Guz, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 357-358.)</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">We therefore hold that the trial court should not have granted summary adjudication of plaintiff\u2019s first and second causes of action, for discriminatory discharge based on plaintiff\u2019s pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">2. <em>The Retention Bonus Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">The trial court also summarily adjudicated as without merit plaintiff\u2019s third through sixth causes of action. All of these claims involved or arose from the two-part retention bonus that defendant had awarded plaintiff in October 2000. The court rejected these claims essentially on grounds that plaintiff had been discharged for good cause, namely the economic reduction in force which the court had found the unrebutted cause on the discrimination causes of action. Mindful of our holding that that reason has not been established, we consider the individual causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">The third cause of action alleged that in awarding plaintiff a bonus, the second installment of which would be paid on April 20, 2001, defendant created an implied contract that plaintiff\u2019s hitherto at-will employment would continue until at least then, which contract defendant breached by discharging plaintiff in February 2001. In its argument here, plaintiff has alternatively termed the contract a unilateral one, which plaintiff performed by continuing to work for defendant. Relatedly, the fourth cause of action alleged that defendant had breached the employment contract\u2019s covenant of good faith by terminating plaintiff before the bonus was payable, to deprive her of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">The trial court held these claims defeated by defendant\u2019s good cause to terminate plaintiff in February. Although the presence or absence of such cause is now an open, triable question,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> there is another reason why these causes of action were unmeritorious. Plaintiff cannot reasonably assert that the grant of the two-stage bonus represented either an implied promise that defendant would retain her until the second payment came due, or an offer for a new term of employment until then, subject to acceptance by plaintiff\u2019s continuing with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>The memo by which defendant extended the bonus did express defendant\u2019s desire that plaintiff remain working for it, and provided as an incentive that to receive the two parts of the bonus plaintiff had to \u201cbe employed with the company on each of the respective dates . . . .\u201d This may have represented an offer of unilateral contract for the bonus, calling for plaintiff to continue her employment. (See <em>DiGiacinto v. Ameriko-Omserv Corp. </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 629, 635 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 300]; <em>Newberger v. Rifkind </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 1070, 1075 [104 Cal.Rptr. 663].) But by no means can it be said, or read, to have included a promise by defendant of continued employment. Plaintiff testified at deposition that this was her understanding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Accordingly, the third cause of action, based on an untenable claim of an implied or unilateral contract guaranteeing plaintiff employment until at least April 20, 2001,' was properly summarily adjudicated. The same is true of the fourth cause of action, which asserted a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the same alleged contract. Because defendant alternatively moved for summary adjudication (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (f)), it will be entitled to that relief with respect to these claims on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s fifth cause of action alleged that by failing to pay plaintiff her bonus, which she had been promised and had earned, defendant committed both a breach of contract (to pay the bonus) and a violation of Labor Code sections 201 and 2926, which require prompt payment of earned wages after an employee is discharged. Plaintiff sought to recover the bonus, a penalty under Labor Code section 203, and attorney fees under Labor Code section 218.5.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court ruled that plaintiff was not entitled to the bonus, because she \u201cwas terminated for good cause prior to the bonus date . . . .\u201d Once again, that premise has not here been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">Defendant contends that summary adjudication of this cause of action should be upheld because plaintiff simply was no longer employed by defendant as of April 20, 2001, and therefore was not entitled to the second installment of the bonus, by its terms. However, should plaintiff establish that she was unlawfully terminated in February 2001, she could assert that that termination excused fulfillment of the condition of employment on April 20, and rendered the bonus payable upon termination. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1440.) Summary adjudication of the fifth cause of action therefore was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>Finally, plaintiff\u2019s sixth cause of action alleged that defendant terminated her to avoid paying wages that were due, including the second bonus installment, and that this termination violated \u201cthe fundamental public policy entitling employees to prompt payment of wages due,\u201d reflected in Labor Code sections 201 and 2926. The trial court\u2019s ruling did not specifically discuss this claim, and defendant supports the ruling only on grounds that plaintiff was not entitled to the bonus. As with the preceding cause of action, the issue of entitlement to the bonus remains unsettled, and therefore the sixth cause of action must presently stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">In sum, in B167287, the summary judgment and integral summary adjudication must be reversed, except with respect to the third and fourth causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">\n<em>THE ORDER DENYING ATTORNEY FEES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">After entry of judgment, defendant moved for an award of attorney fees against plaintiff, in excess of half a million dollars, for defending the case. The request for fees was made on two legal grounds: (1) that defendant was entitled, under Labor Code section 218.5, to its fees as the prevailing party on plaintiff\u2019s wage-related fifth and sixth causes of action; (2) that under Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b), which provides for attorney fees in the court\u2019s discretion, defendant as prevailing party under FEHA should receive its fees, or at least those incurred after McBride\u2019s deposition allegedly disclosed that the discrimination claims were meritless. The trial court denied the motion under section 12965, because the discrimination claims had not been frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, as required (see, e.g., <em>Jersey v. John Muir Medical Center </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 814, 831 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 807]), and under Labor Code section 218.5, on grounds the fifth and sixth causes were not factually distinct from plaintiff\u2019s primary claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">Defendant\u2019s appeal from this order is before us for resolution. But we need not pursue any extended analysis of the parties\u2019 contentions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because, as we have held, defendant should not have been granted summary adjudication of either the discrimination causes of action or the fifth and sixth causes, defendant was not entitled to a fee award under either Government Code section 12965 or Labor Code section 218.5. The order denying attorney fees must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">In B167287, the judgment is reversed with respect to defendant, Stamps.com Inc. On remand, the trial court shall enter an order summarily adjudicating as without merit the third and fourth causes of action of the first amended complaint, and otherwise denying defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. In B171369, the order denying attorney fees is affirmed. Plaintiff shall recover costs on both appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Boland, J., and Flier, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">On January 20, 2006, the opinion was modified to read as printed above. The petition of respondent Stamps.com Inc., for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 12, 2006, S141520. Werdegar, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-9\">The FAC included three further causes of action, which plaintiff has now abandoned. One of them was asserted against defendant\u2019s former chief executive officer, Bruce Coleman, who successfully demurred to it. Plaintiff does not seek reversal of the judgment with respect to Coleman.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b946-8\">We focus here on the evidence and proceedings with respect to the two discriminatory discharge causes of action.

They did not, and in any event plaintiff was not prejudiced, the significance of the original findings having been plain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Defendant contends that Coleman\u2019s statements and attitude are irrelevant, because Brush, not he, was the decision maker in plaintiff\u2019s discharge. This is hardly a triable contention, in light of Brush\u2019s and McBride\u2019s testimony about the decisional process. Brush was an outside consultant, who advised Coleman, the CEO. The evidence supports if not mandates a finding that Coleman was the decision maker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b953-8\">\u201cBecause of the similarity between state and federal employment discrimination laws, California courts look to pertinent federal precedent when applying our own statutes.\u201d (Guz, <em>supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 354.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b954-7\">Plaintiff filed her opposition to the motion for summary judgment before she received this e-mail in discovery, and she did not seek to augment her opposition with it until the hearing.
