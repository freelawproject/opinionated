INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-9\">Attorneys settled a malpractice and negligent misrepresentation action against them by trust beneficiaries and obtained a good faith settlement determination order pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a separate probate proceeding, the trust beneficiaries sought relief against the trustee of those trusts for certain derelictions of his trust duties. This dispute was settled. In the case before us, the attorneys were sued by the trustee, whom the attorneys had represented, for various torts related to the services provided the trustee in connection with the trusts. The trial court denied the attorneys\u2019 summary judgment and summary adjudication motions to bar claims based on the good faith determination order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-10\">The attorneys cross-claimed against the trustee for equitable indemnity for monies paid by the attorneys to settle the beneficiaries\u2019 claims against them. The jury found for the trustee against the attorneys, but found that because the trustee was 50 percent at fault and the attorneys were entitled to equitable indemnification, the judgment should be reduced accordingly. The trial court refused to modify the jury\u2019s findings, and a judgment in favor of the trustee for damages was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-11\">In the published portion of the opinion, we hold that the attorneys can appeal from the denial of the summary judgment and summary adjudication motions and that, because of the good faith determination, the trial court erred in not granting summary judgment in favor of the attorneys. We conclude that a good faith determination may bar the claims of an unnamed party; the trustee and the attorneys were joint tortfeasors; the trustee\u2019s claims were either for indemnification or in effect for indemnification; and therefore, under section 877.6, the good faith settlement barred the trustee\u2019s claims. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment on the trustee\u2019s first amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we affirm the judgment on the attorney\u2019s cross-complaint against the trustee for equitable indemnity. The jury verdict on the cross-complaint is supported by substantial evidence. We remand the matter to the trial court to enter a judgment in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">A. <em>General Allegations and Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">In 1987, defendant, Attorney Patrick Frawley (Frawley),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prepared documents establishing two trusts for Agnes Gordon. One trust, the Agnes Gordon Trust (Sisters\u2019 Trust), was to benefit Ms. Gordon\u2019s sisters (Sisters) and to include a house (the Marlin Place Property) so that one of the Sisters would \u2022always have a home. The other trust, the Billy and Agnes Gordon Trust (Charitable Trust), was a residual charitable trust created to establish a program to train dogs to assist hearing-impaired persons. After the creation of the Sisters\u2019 Trust, Agnes Gordon allegedly revoked her will. That will provided for distributions comparable to those provided for by the trusts. Plaintiff Henry C. Gackstetter (Gackstetter), a close friend of Agnes Gordon and her late husband, was the trustee for both trusts. After Agnes Gordon died, Frawley represented her executor and niece, Patricia Murphy (Murphy), in the probate of the estate. According to Gackstetter, Frawley provided legal services to Gackstetter as trustee of the trusts and individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-8\">By mistake, before Agnes Gordon\u2019s death, Frawley had transferred the Marlin Place Property into the Charitable Trust instead of the Sisters\u2019 Trust. One of the Sisters continued to live in the house, and Gackstetter used funds in the Charitable Trust to maintain the residence. Gackstetter claimed to have made personal loans to the Charitable Trust and to have repaid himself out of trust funds. Gackstetter also mortgaged the Marlin Place Property to obtain $104,000 for himself. He said that money, or some of it, was later used to repay his loans. As trustee for the trusts, Gackstetter failed to prepare accountings, tax returns, and other necessary documents and otherwise failed to maintain proper records. It was necessary to open a probate proceeding for the Agnes Gordon estate because the Sisters\u2019 Trust was not funded, and assets had to be redistributed in view of Frawley\u2019s error. Various proceedings and actions ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-9\">1. <em>Sisters\u2019 Petition Against Gackstetter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-10\">In the Agnes Gordon probate proceeding, on May 14, 1998, the Sisters filed a petition (Murphy Petition) against Gackstetter alleging a breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>of fiduciary duty in connection with the Marlin Place Property, the taking of money generated by placing a mortgage on that property, and for failure to provide accountings for the trusts. By their petition, the Sisters sought an accounting, appointment of successor trustee, return of trust assets, surcharge of the trustee, and to quiet title. Frawley initially represented Gackstetter in the Murphy Petition proceeding, and Gackstetter signed a retainer fee agreement with Frawley in connection with that representation. Frawley withdrew as counsel after it was disclosed that he caused the Marlin Place Property to be placed in the wrong trust. Gackstetter alleged he thereafter became aware of his own failures to file trust tax returns, prepare trust accountings, and maintain trust records properly. Because of these failures, when records were destroyed in an earthquake, hundreds of hours were required to make proper accountings and to defend the Murphy Petition. In 1999, the Attorney General made claims against Gackstetter in the probate proceeding in connection with alleged mishandling of the Charitable Trust.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On July 13, 2000, Gackstetter settled the Murphy Petition claims against him. As part of the settlement, Gackstetter caused the transfer of the Marlin Place Property to the Sisters\u2019 Trust. Gackstetter, although attributing his acts and omissions to Frawley, also settled with the Attorney General on July 13, 2000, by, inter alia, waiving any claim for fees and reimbursement. The probate court approved the settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">2. <em>Sisters\u2019 Action Against Frawley</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">On July 23, 1999, the Sisters sued Patrick Frawley and Doe defendants for malpractice and negligent misrepresentation in connection with placing the Marlin Place Property in the wrong trust and failing to disclose this error. The Sisters also alleged in this action that Frawley represented Gackstetter as trustee, that Gackstetter made misrepresentations regarding the property and took money by placing a mortgage on it, and that claims against Gackstetter had been made by the Murphy Petition. The parties stipulated <em>for the consolidation of </em>discovery in the Murphy Petition proceeding against Gackstetter and in the Sisters\u2019 action against Frawley. On July 20, 2000, after the instant case by Gackstetter against Frawley had been filed, Frawley settled the Sister\u2019s action against him for $104,000, the amount of the encumbrance Gackstetter had placed on the Marlin Place Property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After giving notice to Gackstetter of an application for good faith settlement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>Frawley obtained from the trial court a September 1, 2000 order granting the application for good faith settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">3. <em>Gackstetter\u2019s Action Against Frawley\u2014The Instant Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">On May 5, 2000, Gackstetter, on behalf of himself, sued Frawley in the instant action for improperly advising Gackstetter of his duties and concealing the improper transfer of the Marlin Place Property. The Attorney General intervened in this case, making claims against Frawley that he \u201caided and abetted Gackstetter in breaching his trust.\u201d Frawley settled the Attorney General\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">Specifically, in his first amended complaint against Frawley, Gackstetter alleged Frawley concealed the incorrect conveyance of the Marlin Place Property, improperly advised him as to his duties and obligations as trustee, and committed other acts resulting in improper distributions that adversely affected the funding of the Charitable Trust. Gackstetter alleged that as a result of Frawley\u2019s actions, the trusts were damaged and that he was sued by the Sisters and the Attorney General in the Murphy Petition proceeding. Gackstetter explicitly sought indemnity in connection with his settlement with the Sisters arising out of the Murphy Petition against him, and he also claimed for breach of fiduciary duty, professional negligence, misrepresentation, and breach of the attorney-client retainer agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">Frawley asserted as an affirmative defense the bar of section 877.6. Frawley had demurred, and later moved for summary judgment and summary adjudication, on the basis of the good faith settlement, but the trial court rejected that contention.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Frawley also cross-claimed for indemnity for the amount he paid to the Sisters in settling their action against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\">A jury found Patrick Frawley liable for professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and breach of contract and assessed damages in the amount of $289,000 for economic damages and $3,000 for emotional distress. The jury found that Gackstetter was responsible, in part, for his own damages, requiring a 10 percent reduction in the economic damages. The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>also found that, as to Frawley\u2019s cross-claims for indemnity for his $104,000 payment for the benefit of the Sisters, Gackstetter was 50 percent at fault in connection with the Sisters\u2019 damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">Gackstetter filed a posttrial motion for directed verdict on Frawley\u2019s cross-complaint as it pertained to contributory negligence and indemnity. The trial court denied the motion and entered judgment on special verdicts against Frawley for $211,000. The trial court declined to award Gackstetter any attorney fees. Gackstetter had claimed attorney fees in the amount of $521,612.50 based on a special verdict finding that Frawley had breached the retainer fee agreement with Gackstetter. That agreement contained an attorney fees clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Frawley appeals, claiming that the good faith settlement in the Sisters\u2019 action against him barred Gackstetter\u2019s recovery. He asserts that he can appeal from the denial of his motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication, by which he invoked the good faith settlement. He contends that all of Gackstetter\u2019s causes of action were, in effect, disguised indemnity claims and therefore barred. He also argues that there could be no contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">Gackstetter cross-appeals, asserting that Frawley is not entitled to the indemnity that resulted in the reduction of damages by the jury based on a percentage of the amount Frawley paid in settlement of his case with the sisters. Gackstetter contends that there can be no contributory negligence in connection with an intentional tort, that Frawley is not entitled to equitable indemnity, and that Gackstetter is entitled to attorney fees because he prevailed in a claim based on a contract that included an attorney fees clause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">B. <em>Specific Allegations, Statements of Undisputed Facts, and Supporting Evidence in the Instant Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">1. <em>Gackstetter\u2019s Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-9\">In the general allegations incorporated into all of the causes of action in Gackstetter\u2019s first amended complaint, Gackstetter alleged that Frawley had conveyed the Marlin Place Property to the wrong trust; Frawley represented him in connection with Gackstetter\u2019s position as trustee of the trusts and gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>\u201clegal guidance\u201d to him in the administration of the trusts; Frawley concealed from him the mistaken placement of the Marlin Place Property in the wrong trust; Frawley \u201cknew or should have known that [Gackstetter] would be sued and be subject to possible civil and criminal liability for his trust management under the supervision of [Frawley]\u201d; Frawley failed to cause the preparation and retention of records for the trusts; Frawley\u2019s legal advice regarding the trusts was negligent; Frawley confirmed to Gackstetter that he, Gackstetter, was properly performing his duties as trustee; and Frawley\u2019s advice and false representations were made for the purpose of preventing Gackstetter and others from discovering Frawley\u2019s errors regarding the trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">Gackstetter alleged causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and fraud, and for each of these causes of action he alleged damages to him and the Charitable Trust. He also alleged a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation. Both the fraud and negligent misrepresentation causes of action are based on misrepresentations concerning the trusts and Gackstetter\u2019s duties as trustee. In addition, Gackstetter alleged causes of action for \u201cImplied Indemnity\u201d and \u201cFor Equitable Indemnity on a Comparative Fault Basis\u201d in which he claimed he is entitled to damages arising out of the Murphy Petition against him. In his last two causes of action, Gackstetter alleged that Frawley breached agreements to defend him in the Murphy Petition proceeding and to advise him with regard to the administration of the trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">2. <em>Summary Judgment Contentions of Undisputed Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">Frawley stated in his statement of undisputed facts in support of his summary judgment and summary adjudication motions that \u201cGackstetter and the Frawley defendants are joint tortfeasors with regard to the claims by the Sisters against them in that it was alleged that both Gackstetter and the Frawley defendants caused the Sisters to not receive the Marlin Place Property free and clear.\u201d Although Gackstetter disputes this statement in his statement regarding undisputed facts, the dispute was only on the grounds that he did not draft the documents, the Sisters sued Frawley for negligence, the Sisters\u2019 action against Frawley did not mention Gackstetter,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Murphy Petition against Gackstetter did not mention Frawley. This response by Gackstetter, however, does not refute the assertion that Frawley and Gackstetter were joint tortfeasors based on the allegations in the two proceedings brought by the Sisters and the allegations in Gackstetter\u2019s first amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-8\">Also in his statement of undisputed facts, Frawley stated that \u201cthe only damages sought by Gackstetter in his capacity as an individual and as trustee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>of the Agnes Gordon Trust [Sisters\u2019 Trust] in connection with [each of the causes of action] are damages he incurred in the defense and settlement of the <em>Murphy v. Gackstetter </em>action.\u201d In response, Gackstetter stated that the fact is \u201cmisleading in that it omits damages to plaintiff, individually, incurred because of the involvement of the Attorney General\u2019s Office . . . and based upon his reliance on the advise <em>[sic] </em>and instructions of Defendant\u2019s [sz'c] in his management of the trust for twelve years and in his defense of the Sisters litigation; Forged Documents in Probate.\u201d In some responses, Gackstetter said the Murphy Petition proceeding and the Murphy lawsuit against Frawley were not related or that he was damaged by \u201cConcealed Trust Assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">3. <em>Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">In support of his motion for summary judgment, Frawley submitted the Murphy Petition against Gackstetter, in which Murphy sought to compel Gackstetter as trustee to file accountings; transfer the Marlin Place Property to the Sisters\u2019 Trust, and, in turn, to the beneficiaries under Agnes Gordon\u2019s will; and to obtain a surcharge order and imposition of a constructive trust because of alleged errors Gackstetter committed as trustee. Frawley also submitted the first amended complaint in the Sisters\u2019 action against Frawley in which it was alleged that he negligently transferred the Marlin Place Property to the wrong trust, failed to disclose the error, and misrepresented where the property should have been transferred. Plaintiffs further alleged in that amended complaint that Frawley represented the trust estate and that the trustee and Gackstetter had misrepresented the facts about the Marlin Place Property and had obtained monies by placing a deed of trust on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">Gackstetter was not named a party in the Sisters\u2019 action against Frawley, but the complaint in that action contained a reference to the Murphy Petition against Gackstetter. Other than the substitution of Ms. Murphy as administrator for a recently deceased trust beneficiary, all of the plaintiffs (Sisters) in the legal malpractice action against Frawley were essentially the same as the petitioners in the Murphy Petition against Gackstetter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">Frawley\u2019s other evidence consisted of his settlement of the Sisters\u2019 lawsuit against him, the good faith settlement, and the application for order and order regarding approval of a settlement of the Murphy Petition against Gackstetter. The application for the good faith settlement in the Sisters\u2019 action against Frawley included the settlement agreement between Frawley and the Sisters. In that settlement agreement, which referred to Frawley\u2019s representation of Agnes Gordon in preparing the estate planning documents, the parties released each other generally from all claims \u201crelating to or arising\u201d from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>representation. The good faith settlement order declared that the settlement agreement described in the application \u201cwas made and entered into in good faith . . . within the meaning of and effect of <em>Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 877.6P</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">In the application for the order settling the Murphy Petition against Gackstetter, among the recitals are the following: Frawley\u2019s negligence and concealment in connection with the trusts; Frawley\u2019s advice to Gackstetter \u201cin these proceedings, that caused the Petitioners to be unaware of the loss of their rights and interest in and to [the Marlin Place Property] until recently\u201d; Gackstetter as trustee \u201ccontends that he has vigorously defended the trust\u201d; Gackstetter \u201cfurther asserts that he has expended Trust and personal funds and efforts to maintain and improve [the Marlin Place Property]\u201d; and the Attorney General filed his own petition in the proceeding against Gackstetter for an accounting and to surcharge the trustee. The settlement provides that Gackstetter shall, as trustee, transfer the Marlin Place Property from the Charitable Trust to the Sisters Trust and shall pay $104,000 to the beneficiary of the deed of trust on the Marlin Place Property and that the beneficiary of the deed of trust is to execute a full reconveyance of the deed of trust on the property. Frawley also submitted in evidence the settlement that was later completed between Gackstetter and the Attorney General. A principal term of that settlement was that Gackstetter waived all claims he had for fees and loan repayments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">Gackstetter, in opposition to the summary judgment and summary adjudication motions, submitted documents from Agnes Gordon\u2019s probate case. He also introduced documents showing Frawley\u2019s representation of Gackstetter and Frawley\u2019s preparation of the trust estate documents in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">m. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">A. <em>Appealability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">Frawley contends that the propriety of the denial of a summary judgment<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> may be raised in an appeal from a judgment after a trial. Gackstetter asserts that by not seeking a writ of mandate as provided by section 437c, subdivision (m)(l),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Frawley has forfeited the right to challenge the denial of a summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>Section 437c, subdivision (m)(l) provides that entry of a summary judgment is appealable and that any order entered pursuant to the summary judgment statute may be challenged by a petition for peremptory writ. The case law has not been uniform on the reviewability of a denial of summary judgment on an appeal from a final judgment. In <em>Lackner v. LaCroix </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 747, 753 [159 Cal.Rptr. 693, 602 P.2d 393], the Supreme Court stated that, \u201c[a]n order denying partial summary judgment is a nonappealable order although reviewable on appeal from the final judgment.\u201d At that time, however, there was no provision in the summary judgment statute for a peremptory writ.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (See also <em>Aas v. Avemco Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 312, 323-324 [127 Cal.Rptr. 192]; <em>Whitmire </em>v. <em>City of Eureka </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 28, 32, fn. 3 [105 Cal.Rptr. 185].) In <em>Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 579, 582 [210 Cal.Rptr. 573], decided after the summary judgment statute was amended to provide for a writ procedure, the court stated that the denial of a petition for a writ challenging a denial of a summary judgment does not \u201cpreclude petitioner from raising the issue in an appeal from an adverse final judgment in the event real parties prevail in the Superior Court.\u201d In <em>Coy v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1077, 1082, footnote 2 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 215], this division (Turner, J.) said, \u201cAn order denying a summary judgment is an interlocutory order [citation] which may be reviewed on direct appeal from a final judgment entered after a trial. [Citations.]\u201d (See \u00a7 906 [\u201cUpon . . . appeal. . . the reviewing court may review . . . any intermediate ruling . . . which involves the merits or . . . which substantially affects the rights of a party . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">In <em>Waller </em>v. <em>TJD, Inc. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 830, 836 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 38] <em>(Waller), </em>the court recognized \u201cas a general proposition, that an order denying a motion for summary judgment, while not directly appealable, may be reviewed on appeal from the final judgment.\u201d It added, however, that no case has \u201cconsidered] the merits of the order denying summary judgment as a basis to reverse a judgment entered after the trial on the merits.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court refused to do so, limiting its opinion \u201cto situations in which a party moves for a summary judgment on the ground that there is no triable issue of fact, the motion is denied, and the same questions raised by the motion are then decided adversely to the unsuccessful moving party after a trial on the merits which is itself free from prejudicial error.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It noted, \u201cWe do not intend by this decision to imply that review of such orders is never possible.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>But in <em>Sierra Craft, Inc. </em>v. <em>Magnum Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1256 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 681], the court said the denial of a summary judgment is reviewable only by a timely writ petition and not by an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>One authority stated, \u201cA decision based on less evidence (i.e., the evidence presented on the summary judgment motion) should not prevail over a decision based on more evidence (i.e., the evidence presented at trial).\u201d (Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs (2004) | 8:168.10, p. 8-114.) That authority added, \u201cit is difficult to imagine a scenario where error in the denial of summary judgment would cause prejudice at trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at ][ 8.168.11, p. 8-115.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">Gackstetter points to cases under section 877.6,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the good faith settlement statute, stating that the provision for a writ procedure in that statute is exclusive. (See <em>O\u2019Hearn v. Hillcrest Gym &amp; Fitness Center, Inc. </em>(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 491, 498 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 342]; <em>Main Fiber Products, Inc. v. Morgan &amp; Franz Ins. Agency </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1130, 1137 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 108].) Yet, the court in <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Andreini &amp; Co. </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1413 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 752], concluded that, even though a good faith settlement determination can be reviewed by prejudgment writ, it can also be reviewed by postjudgment appeal. (See <em>Wilshire Ins. Co. v. Tuff Boy Holding, Inc. </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 627 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 480].) In view of the conflict of authorities, the analogy to section 877.6, subdivision (e) is not helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">Although the denial of a summary judgment after a trial normally would be harmless error, there can be exceptions. <em>(Waller, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 836.) The facts here result in one of those exceptions. The good faith settlement order was not made in this case. Frawley, having obtained that good faith determination in another case was, of course, in no position to seek a writ in that case. In this case, he raised the effect of the good faith settlement by way of demurrer and summary judgment. Frawley could have sought a writ, but the language of section 437c, subdivision (m)(l) providing for a writ procedure contains the permissive word \u201cmay.\u201d (Cf. <em>Wilshire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tuff Boy Holding, Inc., supra, </em>86 Cal.App.4th 627, 637 [\u201cmay\u201d used in \u00a7 877.6, subd.

This result achieves the primary objectives of section 877.6: promoting the \u2018equitable sharing of costs among the parties at fault and the encouragement of settlements.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Maryland Casualty Co. v. Bailey &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 856, 877 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 519].) A settling tortfeasor may raise the section 877.6 bar of another tortfeasor\u2019s claim in a separate action, and this can be by demurrer and summary judgment. (See <em>Britz, Inc. v.

The words \u201cindemnity\u201d or \u201ccontribution\u201d need not be used. It is the substance of the claim that is determinative. (Ibid.; <em>Norco, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at p. 964.) \u201cFollowing a good faith determination, the judge doubtless may dismiss disguised or artfully pleaded claims for indemnity or contribution\u2014 i.e., causes of action purporting to state direct claims but which, in fact, seek to recover derivative damages.\u201d <em>(Norco, supra, </em>at p. 964; see <em>Ratcliff Architects </em>v. <em>Vanir Construction Management, Inc. </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 595, 607 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 1] [\u201cnegligence claim is essentially a claim for indemnification\u201d for purposes of good faith settlement consequences].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">In addition, a good faith settlement does not bar a claim that the trial court would not contemplate in determining the proportionate liability of a settling tortfeasor. A good faith settlement would not preclude a claim by a tortfeasor who committed a tort separate and distinct from the tort committed by the settling tortfeasor. Under this circumstance, there could be no right to indemnity. <em>(Turcon, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d at p. 284.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">2. <em>Good Faith Settlement Bars Claims in Instant Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">In this case, Gackstetter has alleged that the claims against him arose because of Frawley\u2019s acts and omissions. In an allegation incorporated into each cause of action against Frawley, Gackstetter alleged that Frawley improperly conveyed the Marlin Place Property into the wrong trust and failed to disclose this error to Gackstetter who was acting as trustee; as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>result, Frawley \u201cknew or should have known that [Gackstetter] would be sued and be subject to possible civil and criminal liability for his trust management under the supervision of [Frawley].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">Both the derelictions of Gackstetter as trustee and those of Frawley as attorney for the trustee caused damages to the trusts and the Sisters as trust beneficiaries. In the Murphy lawsuit against Frawley, in which the good faith settlement order was made, the plaintiffs alleged that Gackstetter committed the same tortious acts as Frawley did and that plaintiffs had sought relief in the probate proceedings against Gackstetter for these and other acts. Gackstetter attributed his own conduct to Frawley\u2019s tortious acts as attorney for the trusts and trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">The uncontradicted evidence shows that Frawley and Gackstetter both committed tortious acts that \u201c \u2018concurred to produce the sum total of the injuries to the plaintiff[s].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Topa, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.4th at p. 1341.) They each \u201ccontributed to or solely caused the single injury\u201d to the plaintiff Sisters. <em>(Yamaha Motor Corp. v. Paseman </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 958, 970 [268 Cal.Rptr. 514].) Thus, for purposes of section 877.6, they were joint tortfeasors.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">Frawley\u2019s alleged misconduct and Gackstetter\u2019s lesser culpability because of reliance on negligent or fraudulent advice and vicarious liability do not render section 877.6 inapplicable. <em>(Far West, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 815.) A \u201cvicariously or derivatively liable tortfeasor, like any other minimally culpable tortfeasor\u201d is subject to section 877.6 but has \u201csubstantial protection\u201d by the requirement that the settlement by the more culpable tortfeasor be in good faith. (46 Cal.3d at p. 815.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">Gackstetter\u2019s claims in the instant action fulfill the requirement of section 877.6 that they be for indemnity. Two of Gackstetter\u2019s claims against Frawley explicitly are for indemnification. The other causes of action, although having different labels, are in effect for indemnification. Each of those causes of action is based on alleged damages Gackstetter suffered as a result of claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>by the trust beneficiaries. For such damages, Gackstetter seeks to be indemnified by Frawley, who represented Gackstetter as trustee. All of Frawley\u2019s acts and omissions were as attorney for the trusts, and therefore his torts were directed at, and damaged, the trusts and their beneficiaries. Likewise, Gackstetter\u2019s acts and omissions as trustee were directed at, and damaged, the trusts and their beneficiaries. According to Gackstetter, his liability and expenses were due to Frawley\u2019s acts and omissions as attorney for the trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">Gackstetter is, in effect, claiming indemnification from Frawley for all of Gackstetter\u2019s expenses for his liability as trustee arising from claims of the beneficiaries and the Attorney General. The total indemnity sought is relief that is encompassed within the bar of a good faith settlement. <em>(Far West, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d 796.) Moreover, Gackstetter\u2019s claim for his attorney fees is considered \u201ca form of implied equitable indemnity\u201d that also can be barred by a good faith settlement. <em>(John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Setser </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1524, 1533 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 413].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">Gackstetter asserts that the Sisters\u2019 action against Frawley that was settled was limited to the erroneous transfer of the Marlin Place Property, while Gackstetter\u2019s action against Frawley involved claims that were not limited to the conveyance of the property. Gackstetter contends that he is claiming damages incurred because of his reliance on Frawley that resulted in claims against Gackstetter for mismanagement of the trusts, and because of the involvement of the Attorney General. Thus, Gackstetter maintains that the good faith settlement could not bar claims that do not concern the Marlin Place Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">The scope of a good faith settlement offer is normally addressed by the trial court determining the good faith of the settlement. That court has the \u201cdiscretion to ferret out those claims that are in fact claims for indemnity\u201d that would be barred by the good faith settlement. <em>(Cal-Jones Properties v. Evans Pacific Corp., supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at pp. 327-328.) At the time of the good faith settlement order, the claims by the Sisters and the Attorney General had been made. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Gackstetter had notice and the opportunity to contest the scope of the settlement of the Sisters\u2019 action against Frawley. By not appearing at the good faith settlement determination, Gackstetter not only forfeited any opportunity to raise his lack of culpability in determining the good faith of the settlement, but also failed to protect claims he believes should not be covered by that settlement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>Nevertheless, we can determine in this proceeding the application and scope of the good faith order. We should do so in a way that encourages settlements. <em>(Far West, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 810.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">The \u201cnegligence of both appellant and respondent[] concurred to produce the sum total of the injuries to the plaintiff[s] [Sisters].\u201d <em>(Turcon, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d at p. 284.) It is not necessary that all of the tortious acts that \u201cconcurred\u201d to produce the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201csum total\u201d injuries be alleged specifically in the action in which there was a good faith settlement to be barred by the good faith settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">There may be situations in which the joint tortfeasors have committed torts against the plaintiff that are sufficiently distinct from the torts and damages covered by a good faith settlement so that a claim by one of the tortfeasors for indemnification in connection with the distinct torts would not be barred by the good faith settlement. \u201c[I]f there were in fact two separate and distinct torts committed, one by the appellant and one by the respondents, appellant would never, under any theory, be entitled to indemnity for damages attributable to its tortious conduct.\u201d <em>(Turcon, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d at p. 284.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">Here, all of Gackstetter\u2019s claims involve the management of the trusts and thus either were alleged or could have been alleged in the action in which the good faith settlement occurred\u2014the Sisters\u2019 action against Frawley. In that action, in which the good faith settlement order took place, the plaintiffs alleged that Frawley improperly conveyed the Marlin Place Property and failed to disclose or made misrepresentations about that conveyance. Significantly, the allegations in that action also included that Frawley represented the trust and that Gackstetter as trustee made various misrepresentations and misappropriated loan proceeds obtained by placing a mortgage on the Marlin Place Property. Thus, in the very case in which the good faith settlement order was made, Gackstetter was characterized as a joint tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">In the instant action, Gackstetter incorporated into every one of his causes of action the allegations that Frawley conveyed the Marlin Place Property to the wrong trust; that Frawley failed to disclose this error; that Frawley \u201cknew or should have known that plaintiff would be sued and be subject to possible civil and criminal liability for this trust management under the supervision [of Frawley]\u201d; and that as a result of the improper conveyance, Gackstetter made improper expenditures. Most, if not all, of the damage Gackstetter alleged resulted from the improper transfer and concealment of the Marlin Place Property. It was that improper transfer and its concealment that were the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>of the Sisters\u2019 action. Frawley\u2019s acts and omissions alleged by Gackstetter, in effect, constituted acts and omissions by Gackstetter and by Frawley as joint tortfeasors directed at the trusts and their beneficiaries. And the damages Gackstetter seeks to recover are in essence for indemnification from Frawley for these acts and omissions. The Sisters\u2019 respective actions against Frawley and Gackstetter did not specify any damages apart from the result of the wrongs related to the Marlin Place Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">The Attorney General intervened in the Murphy Petition proceeding against Gackstetter to protect the Charitable Trust, and that intervention resulted from the allegations of the Sisters. The Attorney General alleged improper expenditures by the Charitable Trust, inter alia, those spent on the Marlin Place Property that did not belong in that trust. Other allegations concerned improper expenditures and accountings. The Attorney General in the case before us also intervened claiming that Frawley \u201caided and abetted Gackstetter in breaching his trust.\u201d Many of the alleged improper acts can be attributed to the incorrect placement of the Marlin Place Property in the Charitable Trust. Again, the placement of that property in the Charitable Trust was the subject of the Attorney General\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">Gackstetter\u2019s attorney, in what the trial court treated as argument, specified the damages and stated that they were \u201cincurred as the result of the concealment/fraud of Defendants and the detrimental reliance of Mr. Gackstetter upon their legal advise [szc] and counseling for over twelve years.\u201d But Gackstetter\u2019s attorney also contended that Frawley\u2019s \u201congoing assertions that the Marlin Place Property belonged to the Trust and that the Sisters had no interest therein\u201d caused Gackstetter to expend trust funds on the property and refuse to deliver accountings. In effect, Gackstetter, in the summary judgment proceeding, asserted that much, if not all, of his damages could be attributed to Frawley\u2019s misrepresentations concerning in which trust the Marlin Place Property belonged\u2014the very subject of the good faith settlement. Moreover, as noted, Gackstetter incorporated in each of his causes of action the allegations about Frawley\u2019s improper conveyance and concealment\u2014 allegations that were the basis of the case in which the good faith settlement occurred\u2014the Sisters\u2019 action against Frawley.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">The acts and omissions of Frawley and Gackstetter concurred to produce \u201cthe sum total of the injuries to the plaintiffs] [Sisters].\u201d <em>(Turcon, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d at p. 284.) \u201cThe divisibility or indivisibility of injuries does not rest on the nature of the injuries but on the element of causation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Both Gackstetter and Frawley caused the same injury to the Sisters. Gackstetter contended that Frawley was the cause of all of Gackstetter\u2019s improper conduct. All of Gackstetter\u2019s alleged damages from the operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>the trusts, and actions against him by the trust beneficiaries and Attorney General result from the acts and omissions of Frawley and Gackstetter as joint tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">Gackstetter\u2019s argument that the claims not specifically alleged in the settled action are not barred by the good faith settlement cannot, in any event, prevail because Gackstetter has not distinguished between causes of damages to the Sisters. He has not distinguished between, on the one hand, damages that may be a consequence of the claims asserted in the Marlin Place Property action against Frawley for which both Frawley and Gackstetter are liable as joint tortfeasors and that are subject to the good faith settlement and, on the other hand, any other damages he claims might not be subject to the good faith settlement. Accordingly, based on the allegations and evidence, we conclude that Gackstetter\u2019s claims in the instant action are, as a matter of law, subject to the bar of section 877.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">Gackstetter asserts that Frawley\u2019s settlement was not in good faith. Gackstetter did not attempt to challenge the good faith of the settlement either when it was made or, if he could, before the trial court in this case. Thus, he is bound by that determination. (See <em>Britz, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th 177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">Based on the uncontradicted facts, all of Gackstetter\u2019s claims are for indemnification from a joint tortfeasor as that term is used in section 877.6. By broadly interpreting and applying section 877.6, we conclude that the good faith settlement in the Sisters\u2019 action against Frawley encompasses and bars all of Gackstetter\u2019s claims against Frawley in the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">D. <em>Cross-Complaint</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">Frawley\u2019s good faith settlement of the Sisters\u2019 action against Frawley bars Gackstetter\u2019s claims. The trial court erred by not granting Frawley\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Frawley\u2019s judgment on the cross-complaint is affirmed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>V.

The matter is remanded to the trial court to enter a judgment dismissing the amended complaint of Henry Gackstetter and awarding Patrick Frawley et al. $52,000 against Henry Gackstetter. Appellants and cross-respondents Patrick Frawley et al. shall recover their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">Turner, P.
