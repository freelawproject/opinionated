The first of these is for a deposit credit book having complementary pages, one of which is a deposit sheet, the other an account sheet provided with appropriately headed spaces for data relating to commercial transactions other than those with the bank, etc. The second relates to books employed to secure safety in commercial transactions, and has for its purpose the utilization of a bank account or other credit balance to secure credit for an equal or lesser sum in merchandise elsewhere than at the place of deposit without withdrawing any part of the bank account in the first instance, and without interrupting the accumulation of interest upon the balance. The claim is for a credit book with oppositely disposed sheets divided into columns appropriately headed, in which are to be made different entries showing the amount deposited, the amount withdrawn, the amount of purchases at certain stores, and balance due the depositor. The general scheme of the present application is the same as that of the above-mentioned patents. It adds other columns for the purpose of keeping an account of liquidated damages, that is, the amount which the depositor must pay the guarantor for the failure to purchase a stipulated amount of merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We agree with the Commissioner that it involves no invention to add to the book the additional columns to accomplish this purpose. See <em>Munson </em>v. <em>New York, </em>124 U. S. 601, 604, 31 L. ed. 586, 587, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 622; <em>United States Credit System, Co. </em>v. <em>American Credit Indemnity Co. </em>8 C. C. A. 49, 20 U. S. App. 172, 59 Fed. 139, 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The decision will be affirmed. It is so ordered, and that this decision be certified to the Commissioner of Patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
