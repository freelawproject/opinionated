RODR\u00cdGUEZ, P.J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">In this opinion, we address conflicting Tax Court decisions regarding a 2006 legislative amendment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to New Jersey\u2019s realty transfer fee on property purchases over $1,000,000, also known as the \u201cMansion Tax,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.2. This amendment, codified as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4, provides a refund of the Mansion Tax to contracts for commercial properties that were \u201cfully executed before July 1, 2006,\u201d provided that the deed was transferred on or before November 15, 2006. We address both appeals in one opinion. The source of the dispute is that two Tax Court judges came to different interpretations of the phrase \u201cfully executed before July 1, 2006.\u201d We hold that: (1) <em>N.J.S.A </em>46:15-7.4 is not an \u201cexemption\u201d from the Mansion Tax, but rather a refund provision; (2) as such, the section should be construed in favor of the taxpayer; and (3) the plain meaning and common usage of the phrase \u201cfully executed before July 1, 2006\u201d means a real estate contract that is signed and binding upon the parties before July 1, 2006, whether or not there are subsequent amendments to the terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">The statutory section at issue here provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">[F]or the transfer of real property that was classified pursuant to the requirements of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:12-2.2 as Class 4A \u201ccommercial properties\u201d at the time of the recording of the deed, provided that the deed was recorded on or before November 15, 2006, and that was transferred pursuant to a contract that was fully executed before July 1, 2006, the fee imposed pursuant to section 8 of [L.] 2004, c. 66 shall be refunded to the grantee by the filing, within one year following the date of the recording of the deed, of a claim with the New Jersey Division of Taxation for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>refund of the fee paid. Proof of claim for refund shall be made by the submission of such documentation as the Director of the Division of Taxation may require.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asc\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\"><em>Wells Reit II </em>\u2014 80 <em>Park Plaza, LLC (Wells Reit)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">On June 13, 2006, Wells Reit\u2019s assignor entered into a contract with Newark Urban Renewal Investors, L.P., (Newark Urban) to purchase property located at Park Place in Newark for $155,000,000. All parties signed the contract on that date. The contract included a \u201cdue diligence period,\u201d which was to end on June 21, 2006. The parties subsequently agreed to seven contract amendments, each referring to June 13, 2006, as the date the contract was formed. A July 25, 2006 amendment reduced the price to $147,500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">On September 21, 2006, the purchaser assigned the contract to Wells Reit and the parties closed on the sale. Wells Reit paid a $1,475,000 realty transfer fee set by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.2 and recorded the deed. Wells Reit subsequently filed an RTF-3 Claim for Refund of the realty transfer fee with the Division of Taxation. The Division denied Wells Reit\u2019s claim for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASO\">Your claim contained a contracted sale-purchase agreement ... for a purchase price of $155,000,000. The sale agreement had several amendments and the July 25, 2006 [amendment] set the purchase price at $147,500,000 to reflect the consideration amount on the deed. Although the deed was recorded before the November 15, 2006 deadline as mandated by <em>[L. </em>2006, c. 33] [the Division] must deny your claim because the contract sale was not fully executed on July 1, 2006[,] as provided by statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Wells Reit appealed this decision and filed a complaint against the Director, Division of Taxation (Director) in the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">After both parties moved for summary judgment, the judge granted summary judgment in favor of the Director. The judge concluded that \u201c[i]n enacting the [Mjansion [T]ax as a revenue-raising measure for general State purposes, the Legislature carved out, in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4, a limited exclusion from the tax for certain transactions.\u201d <em>Wells Reit II </em>\u2014 80 <em>Park Plaza, LLC v. Dir., Div. of Tax\u2019n, </em>24 <em>N.J.Tax </em>98, 103 (Tax 2008). The judge found that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4 was \u201cequivalent to an exemption from the tax[,] which should be construed narrowly.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Therefore, the judge construed \u201cthe phrase \u2018fully executed before July 1, 2006\u2019 as referring to a contract signed on or before June 30, 2006, none of the essential terms of which was amended in a material respect on or after July 1, 2006.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103-04. Therefore, the Director\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted, Wells Reit\u2019s motion was denied, and the complaint was dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 104. Wells Reit appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">\n<em>Chicago Five Portfolio, Inc. (Chicago Five)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">On June 12, 2006, Chicago Five\u2019s assignor agreed to purchase property in Fort Lee for $18,155,000 from ECS-FT. Lee, LLC. A month later, the parties agreed to lower the purchase price to $17,400,000 and added a new economic feasibility clause, which allowed the purchaser to terminate the contract if it concludes \u201cthat the acquisition of the property is not economically feasible ... prior to the expiration of the due diligence period.\u201d In August 2006, the purchaser assigned its rights to Chicago Five. The transaction closed on August 16, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.2, Chicago Five paid a realty transfer fee in the amount of $174,000 and subsequently filed an RTF-3 Claim for Refund of the realty transfer fee. The Division denied the claim, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">Your claim contained an Agreement of Sale from ECS-FT. Lee, LLC to Storage Specialists, LLC with a contracted sales pnce of $18,155,000. The assignment of purchase and sale agreement shows Storage Specialists, LLC as assigning over lights to Chicago Five Portfolio, LLC on August 14, 2006. The deed dated August 22, 2006[,1 was transacted from ECS-FT. Lee, LLC to Chicago Five Portfolio, LLC with a stated consideration of $17,400,000. Therefore, [the Division] must deny your claim because the Agreement of Sale dated June 12, 2006 lists a buyer who is not the stated buyer in the deed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">Chicago Five appealed the decision and filed a complaint against the Director in the Tax Court. Both parties moved for summary judgment. Judge Vito L. Bianco granted summary judgment to Chicago Five. In his published decision, the judge wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A51k\">This court must respectively disagree with the standard applied in [ <em>Wells Reit, </em>supra, 24 <em>NJ.Tax </em>98,1 for determining whether a Mansion Tax refund is warranted. In this court\u2019s view, interpreting the contract phrase [\u201c]fully executedp\u2019l based upon the narrow standard established for tax exemptions was never contemplated by the Legislature in its adoption of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4. To determine whether the taxpayer was entitled to a refund of the Mansion Tax, the court in <em>Wells Reit </em>inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>mingled the narrow tax exemption standard with an abbreviated contract analysis focused solely on a change to an essential term of a contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\"><em>[Chicago Five Portfolio, LLG v. Dir., Div. of Tax\u2019n, </em>24 <em>N.J.Tax 342, </em>349 (Tax 2008) (emphasis removed).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Judge Bianco then engaged in statutory interpretation. Because the Legislature provided no definition of the term \u201cfully executed,\u201d Judge Bianco consulted several dictionaries and legal treatises:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">Consistent with one usage of the phrase [\u201c]executed contract[\u201d] as currently defined in legal dictionaries ... the phrase [\u201c]fully executed!\u201d] as it relates to a contract for the sale of real estate has been defined to mean that all parties have signed a contact. This definition is not based upon the performance of the parties. Rather, it is based more on general custom and usage than on sound legal theory____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">The phrase !\u201c]under contract!\u201d] refers to the time period from the signing of the contract to the closing of title (or termination), where the parties and the subject property are bound by contract. Taking the phrases [\u201cjfully executed!\u201d] and [\u201c]under contract!\u201d] together, as respectively used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4 and its Committee Statements, the court concludes that the Legislature intended to refund the Mansion Tax on those sales of Class 4A commercial properties that were subject to the terms of a binding contract before July 1, 2006, if the sale closed and the deed was recorded by November 15, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 352-53 (emphasis removed).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">Judge Bianco found no \u201cclear and definite intention\u201d of the parties \u201cto effect a novation,\u201d which would have created a new contract and extinguished the old one. <em>Id. </em>at 356. Rather, the contract amendment contained a provision expressly stating that all terms and conditions of the purchase agreement were to remain in full force and effect. He concluded that the amendment was a modification and not a novation, thus the purchase agreement was fully executed before July 1, 2006, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4. He also found that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4 was not a tax exemption and should be construed in favor of the taxpayer. Thus, the judge granted summary judgment to Chicago Five. The Director appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">\n<em>Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">Wells Reit raises the following arguments in A-5276-07T3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-13\">THE TAX COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN NOT ACCORDING THE TERM \u201cFULLY EXECUTED\u201d ITS PLAIN MEANING AND REWRITING THE STATUTE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>THE TAX COURT\u2019S INTERPRETATION OF <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4 AS CREATING AN \u201cEXEMPTION\u201d IS ERRONEOUS AND MANDATES REVERSAL OF THE ORDER WITH A DIRECTION TO ENTER JUDGMENT GRANTING WELLS ITS REFUND.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">In its supplemental brief, Wells Reit also argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">THE PROPER STANDARD OF REVIEW IS DE NOVO.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">The Director raises the following arguments in A-3381-08T3: THIS COURT SHOULD REVERSE THE TAX COURT\u2019S RULING BECAUSE IT DOES NOT COMPORT WITH EITHER THE PURPOSE UNDERLYING THE REALTY TRANSFER FEE OR PRIOR CASES PROVIDING THAT A CONTRACT IS NOT \u201cFULLY EXECUTED\u201d UNTIL ALL MATERIAL MODIFICATIONS TO A CONTRACT ARE COMPLETE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">In a supplemental brief, the Director also argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">THE RESPONDENT\u2019S CONTRACT OF SALE WAS NOT \u201cFULLY EXECUTED\u201d BEFORE JULY 1, 2006, AS REQUIRED BY LAW, THUS THE TRANSFER FEE PAID BY RESPONDENT CANNOT BE REFUNDED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Our review of the Director\u2019s decisions regarding the imposition of tax is \u201climited.\u201d <em>Quest Diagnostics, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Tax\u2019n, 387 N.J.Super. </em>104, 109, 903 A.2d 442 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>577, 911 A.2d 69 (2006). We recognize \u201cthe Director\u2019s expertise in the highly specialized and technical area of taxation,\u201d and thus the Director\u2019s interpretation of law will prevail unless it is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Aetna Burglar &amp; Fire Alarm Co. v. Dir., Div. of Tax\u2019n, </em>16 <em>N.J.Tax </em>584, 589 (Tax 1997) (citing <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Tax\u2019n, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 327, 478 A.2d 742 (1984)). However, the Director\u2019s interpretation will not be followed when the Director \u201cextends a statute \u2018to give it a greater effect than its language permits.\u2019\u201d <em>Oberhand v. Dir., Div. of Tax\u2019n, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>558, 568, 940 A.2d 1202 (2008) (quoting <em>GE Solid State, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Tax\u2019n, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>298, 306, 625 A.2d 468 (1993)). Ultimately, statutory interpretation is primarily the role of the judiciary and is not an administrative function. <em>Bd. of Educ. v. N.J. State Bd. of Educ., </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>341, 345-49, 858 A.2d 576 (App.Div.2004) (citing <em>Mayflower Sec. Co. v. Bureau of Sec., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">We use the same summary judgment standard that is used by trial courts. <em>Jolley v. Marquess, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255, 267, 923 A.2d 264 (App.Div.2007) (citing <em>Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Boylan, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 167, 704 A.2d 597 (App.Div.), <em>certif. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>denied, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>608, 713 A.2d 499 (1998)). Once we determine that no genuine issues of material fact exist, then we decide whether the trial court\u2019s application of the law was correct. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cA trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u201d <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Here, there were no material facts in dispute and summary judgment was appropriate. The issue presented is purely legal. Thus, we owe no deference to either judge\u2019s statutory interpretation. De novo review is appropriate. <em>H.J. Bailey Co. v. Neptune Twp., </em>399 <em>N.J.Super. </em>381, 385, 944 A.2d 706 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In order to qualify for the refund of the Mansion Tax, the following requirements must be met: (1) the contract must be \u201cfully executed\u201d prior to July 1, 2006; (2) the deed must be recorded on or before November 15, 2006; and (3) the refund claim form must be filed with the Division within one year. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4. Here, all parties agreed that the second and third conditions were met. At issue is whether the contracts were \u201cfully executed\u201d prior to July 1, 2006. We find that both contracts were indeed \u201cfully executed\u201d prior to July 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">\n<em>Whether The Amendments Are Modifications Or Novations?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">We begin our analysis with \u201c[a] well-established canon of statutory interpretation ... that the Legislature \u2018is presumed to be aware of judicial construction of its enactments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. Scaccetti, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>256, 276, 927 A.2d 1269 (2007) (quoting <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 494, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">When performing statutory interpretation, \u201ca court must first look to the language of the statute itself.\u201d <em>Macysyn v. Hensler, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 485, 748 A.2d 591 (App.Div.2000) (citing <em>Kimmelman v. Henkels &amp; McCoy Inc., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>123,128, 527 A.2d 1368 (1987)). \u201cEach word in the statute must be given its plain meaning; no word should be rendered inoperative or superfluous.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Dempsey v. Mastropasqua, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>234, 238, 576 A.2d 335 (App.Div.1990)). <em>See also DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (\u201cWe ascribe to the statutory words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>their ordinary meaning and significance ... and read them in context with related provisions so as to give sense to the legislation as a whole[.]\u201d) (internal citations omitted). \u201cIf the plain language leads to a clear and unambiguous result, then [the court\u2019s] interpretive process is over.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>189, 195, 927 A.2d 543 (2007) (citation omitted). It is not the court\u2019s function to \u201crewrite a plainly-written enactment of the Legislature [ ]or presume that the Legislature intended something other than that expressed by way of the plain language.\u201d <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (alteration in original) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">However, where a statute\u2019s language is ambiguous or leads to more than one interpretation, courts may turn to extrinsic evidence for guidance. <em>Richardson, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 195-96, 927 A.2d 543. The court may consider \u201cextrinsic factors, such as the statute\u2019s purpose, legislative history, and statutory context to ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Twp. of Pennsauken v. Schad, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>156, 170, 733 A.2d 1159 (1999). It is also appropriate to look to dictionary definitions for determining the meaning of words. <em>Macysyn, supra, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 485, 748 A.2d 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">In <em>Wells Reit, supra, </em>24 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 104, the judge narrowly construed the phrase \u201cfully executed before July 1, 2006\u201d to mean \u201ca contract signed on or before June 30, 2006, none of the essential terms of which was amended in a material respect on or after July 1, 2006.\u201d However, the judge provided no legal analysis to demonstrate how he came to this definition or how he determined which terms were \u201cmaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4 provides no definition for the term \u201cfully executed.\u201d Statements by the legislative committees for Assembly Bill A.4701 (enacted as <em>L. </em>2006, c. 33 and codified as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4) also do not define \u201cfully executed,\u201d but do provide an explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">[S]pecial provisions are made for transactions that were <em>\u201cunder contract,\" </em>before \u2022July 1, 2006[,] and for which the transaction was recorded by November 15, 2006[,1 so that, in the case of a deed transaction, the fee mil be refunded after recording!,] and[,] in the case of a non-deed transaction!,] no tax will be due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>[Assembly Budget Committee Statement to Assembly Committee Substitute for A4701, </em>(July 7,2006); <em>Senate Budget and, Appropriations Committee Statement to S.1982, </em>(June 26, 2006) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">As both judges below noted, \u201cthe meaning of the phrase \u2018under contract\u2019 used in the Committee Statements is no more apparent than the meaning of the phrase \u2018fully executed\u2019 as set forth in the statute.\u201d <em>Chicago Five, supra, </em>24 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 351 (quoting <em>Wells Reit, supra, </em>24 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 102-03). Therefore, this court must use extrinsic sources to determine the plain meaning and common usage of the phrases \u201cfully executed\u201d and \u201cunder contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The term \u201cexecuted contract\u201d can be defined as a contract that \u201chas been fully performed by both parties.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>321 (7th ed. 1999). The language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4 conflicts with this definition. Logically, in order for a real estate contract to be \u201cfully performed,\u201d the purchase price must be paid and the deed must be transferred. <em>N.J.S.A </em>46:15-7.4, however, requires the contract to be \u201cfully executed\u201d before July 1, 2006, but allows the deed to be transferred as late as November 15, 2006. Therefore, the \u201cfully performed\u201d definition of an \u201cexecuted contract\u201d cannot be applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The intended definition of \u201cfully executed\u201d is more likely \u201ca signed contract.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>321 (7th ed. 1999). An \u201cexecuted\u201d document is one \u201cthat has been signed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589. <em>See also </em>William C. Burton, <em>Legal Thesaurus </em>467 (1980) (indicating that \u201csigned\u201d is synonymous with \u201cexecute\u201d); <em>The Law Dictionary </em>(2002 ed.) (\u201c[A]n executed contract also means that signatures, attestation requirements!;,] and appropriate filings have been fully completed, leaving no question as to the quality of the contract\u2019s formation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">As Judge Bianco noted, this definition seems to fit squarely in line with \u201cterms of art that have long been associated with real estate sales contracts.\u201d <em>Chicago Five, supra, </em>24 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 351 (citing several real estate websites that define \u201cexecuted contract\u201d as a contract that has been signed). Judge Bianco also pointed to several real estate resources that indicate that \u201c[t]he phrase \u25a1under contraetf] generally refers to the time period from the signing of the contract to the closing of the title (or termination), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>where the parties and subject property are bound by contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353 (emphasis removed).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The Legislature has provided no indication that the phrases \u201cfully executed\u201d or \u201cunder contract\u201d should be given anything other than plain meaning and common usages definitions. Therefore, we adopt Judge Bianco\u2019s analysis and hold that the phrase \u201cfully executed\u201d within <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4 is a contract that was signed and binding before July 1, 2006. The next step in our analysis is thus to determine whether the two contracts at issue were signed and binding before July 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The determinative issue is whether the subsequent \u201camendments\u201d to the contracts were modifications or novations. New Jersey has long recognized the ability to modify one\u2019s contract. <em>DeAngelis v. Rose, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>263, 280, 727 A.2d 61 (App.Div.1999) (citing <em>County of Morris v. Fauver, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>80, 95, 707 A.2d 958 (1998)); <em>Gillette v. Cushion, </em>21 <em>N.J.Super. </em>511, 516, 91 A.2d 421 (App.Div.1952). \u201c[Limited changes or amendments to a contract can be accomplished through modification.\u201d <em>Fauver, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 100, 707 A.2d 958. A contract modification is \u201ca change in one or more respects which introduces new elements into the details of a contract and cancels others but leaves the general purpose and effect undisturbed.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Bus. Lists, Inc. v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>147 F.3d 636, 641 (7th Cir.1998). A modification can be proved by \u201can explicit agreement to modify or by the actions and conduct of the parties as long as the intention to modify is mutual and clear.\u201d <em>DeAngelis, supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 280, 727 A.2d 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Unlike a modification which leaves the original contract in place, a novation substitutes a new contract and extinguishes the old one. <em>Fusco v. City of Union City, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>332, 336, 618 A.2d 914 (App.Div.1993) (citing 15 <em>Williston on Contracts, </em>\u00a7 1865 at 582-85 (3d ed. 1972)). The elements of a novation are: (1) a previously valid contract; (2) an agreement to make a new contract; (3) a valid new contract; and (4) an intent to extinguish the old contract. <em>T &amp; N, pic v. Penn. Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n, </em>44 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>174, 186 (3d Cir.1994); <em>In re Timberline Property Dev., Inc., </em>115 <em>B.R. </em>787, 790 (Bankr.D.N.J.1990) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The first, second, and third elements are established in both underlying cases. As Judge Bianco found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">The first element of novation is met under the present facts as ... the [plurchase [agreement was a previously valid contract. The second element of novation has been met since the signing of the [ajmendment clearly demonstrates the parties\u2019 intent to be bound by its terms. The [third] element of novation has been satisfied as well since the validity of the [a]mendment has not been challenged. Furthermore, the [a]mendment is binding and contains all the components of a contract-offer, acceptance, and consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\"><em>[Chicago Five, supra, </em>24 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 354-55 (emphasis removed).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">What is left to decide here is the fourth element, whether the parties \u201cintend[ed] to extinguish the old contract.\u201d <em>T &amp; N, supra, </em>44 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">When determining whether a novation occurred, \u201c[t]he questions always one of intention.\u201d <em>Morecraft v. Allen, </em>78 <em>N.J.L. </em>729, 732, 75 <em>A. </em>920 (E. &amp; A.1910) (citation omitted). \u201cIn order to effect a novation there must be a clear and definite intention on the part of all concerned that such is the purpose of the agreement, for it is a well settled principle that novation is never to be presumed.\u201d <em>Sixteenth Ward Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Reliable Loan Mortgage &amp; Sec. Co., </em>125 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>340, 342-43, 5 A.2d 753 (E &amp; A.1939). The burden of proving a novation lies with the party alleging it. <em>Id. </em>at 345, 5 A.2d 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Because intent is the primary inquiry, the issue of whether there was a novation is generally a question of fact to be presented to the jury and summary judgment should not be granted. <em>Alexander v. Mama, </em>22 <em>N.J.Misc. </em>88, 99, 36 A.2d 142 (Sup.Ct.1944). <em>See also Fanucchi &amp; Limi Fatyns v. United Agri Prods., </em>414 F.3d 1075, 1082 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cDetermining the parties\u2019 intent is a highly fact-specific inquiry---- Such inquiries are not generally suitable for disposition on summary judgment.\u201d) (citation omitted). However, when the evidence is \u201cone-sided\u201d regarding whether the parties entered into a novation, summary judgment is appropriate. <em>Tung v. Briant Park Homes, Inc., </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>232, 239, 670 A.2d 1092 (App.Div.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Here, the amendments fail to provide a \u201cclear and definite intention\u201d by the parties to create a novation. <em>Sixteenth Ward, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>at 342-43, 5 A.2d 753. Every amendment to the Wells Reit contract referred to the June 13, 2006 original purchase agreement and stated that the parties wish to \u201camend\u201d the agreement. The definitions of terms not defined in the amendment \u201chave the meanings ascribed to them in the [ajgreement.\u201d Further, each amendment contains a ratification clause that states: \u201cIn all other respects, except as <em>modified, </em>hereby, the [ajgreement remains unmodified and <em>in full force and effect.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). None of this language suggests a \u201cclear and definite intention\u201d to effect a novation rather than a modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Similarly, the sole amendment to Chicago Five\u2019s contract states a \u201cdesire to amend\u201d the original June 12, 2006 contract. The amendment also specifically provides that, \u201c[ejxcept as <em>modified </em>herein, all terms and conditions of the [pjurchase [ajgreement shall remain <em>in full force and, effect,.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). As such, none of the language suggests a \u201cclear and definite intention\u201d to effect a novation rather than a modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The Director argues that in both cases the change in purchase price renders the amendments novations rather than modifications. To support this argument, the Director relies on <em>In re Timberline Property Development, Inc., supra, </em>115 <em>B.R. </em>787, a 1990 decision by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. In <em>Timberline, </em>the court held that \u201ca change in the purchase price is obviously a new term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790. However, the <em>Timberline </em>court also found that two other amendments, one that required court approval of the contracts and another that changed the seller to a debtor-in-possession, combined with the price change, demonstrated a mutual \u201cagreement\u201d to make a new contract and extinguish the old one. <em>Id. </em>at 790 (\u201cThe buyers, no doubt, wanted the revised purchase price over the original, higher price, and the motion to approve the sale was brought before the court by the attorneys for the debtor. Thus, there appears to have been an agreement to make the new contract.\u201d). Here, there are no indications that the parties intended to make new agreements and cancel the old contracts. To the contrary, the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>in the amendments indicate that the changes are modifications and that the original purchase agreements remain \u201cin full force and effect.\u201d The Director provides no additional cases where a New Jersey court has held that a change in price automatically equates to a novation.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In summary, in each case below the novation cannot be presumed, the evidence is one-sided, and there is no indication that the parties had the intention of extinguishing the original contract. We thus find the changes were modifications, not novations, and the original contracts remained in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\n<em>Whether N.J.S.A. 46:15-7.4 Creates An \u201cExemption\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">\n<em>From The Mansion Tax?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">\u201c[W]hen interpretation of a taxing provision is in doubt, and there is no legislative history that dispels that doubt, the court should construe the statute in favor of the taxpayer.\u201d <em>Fedders Fin. Corp. v. Dir., Div. of Tax\u2019ll, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>376, 386, 476 A.2d 741 (1984). However, where a taxpayer is seeking a tax exemption, \u201c[t]hen the probable legislative intent is one of inclusion and exemptions are to be construed narrowly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386, 476 A.2d 741. Thus, because the meaning of \u201cfully executed\u201d is not clear, whether <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4 is an exemption is important in determining whether Wells Reit and Chicago Five are entitled to the Mansion Tax refunds.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Legislative intent may be derived \u201cfrom an overall understanding of the words utilized and their relationship to other related provisions.\u201d <em>Cooper Hosp. Univ. Med. Ctr. v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>510, 514, 876 A.2d 335 (App.Div.2005) (citing <em>State v. Afanador, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>162, 172, 631 A.2d 946 (1993)). \u201cIn other words, the meaning of the word or series of words may be ascertained by reference to a neighboring set of words or similar provisions in the same statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>State v. Mortimer, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>517, 536, 641 A.2d 257 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>970,115 <em>S.Ct. </em>440,130 L.Ed.2d 351 (1994)). Inferences about a statute\u2019s meaning can also be drawn from the its \u201ccomposition and structure.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>325, 333, 963 A.2d 281 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>An examination of the legislative history and the \u201cneighboring set of words or similar provisions\u201d reveals that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4 was not intended to be a tax exemption. Rather, as a matter of fairness, it is a provision that allows purchasers who already bargained for and signed their contracts before the law was enacted to receive a refund even though their deeds may have been filed after the law\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Little guidance on whether <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4 is an exemption is found in the law itself, as the word \u201cexemption\u201d is not used. In contrast, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.2(b)(2), which was also created by <em>L. </em>2006, c. 33, does specifically provide for an exemption to the Mansion Tax:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">The fee imposed by subsection a. of this section shall not apply to a deed if the transfer of real property is incidental to a corporate merger or acquisition and the equalized assessed value of the real property transferred is less than [twenty percent] of the total value of all assets exchanged in the merger or acquisition. A grantee shall claim this <em>exemption </em>from imposition of the fee at the time the deed is offered for recording by filing with the county recording officer such information, in addition to the affidavit of consideration filed by one or more of the grantee parties named in the deed or by the grantee\u2019s legal representative pursuant to subsection d. of this section, as the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of Treasury may prescribe as to constitute a filing of a protest of the assessment of the fee and by paying any other recording fees not <em>exempted </em>pursuant to this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>46:15~7.2(b)(2) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-8\"><em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.2(b)(2) (\u201cWhether or not the transfer is <em>exempt, </em>pursuant to subsection b. of this section____\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">We conclude that the Legislature intended to create exemptions in other portions of the bill, but made no exemption in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4. This conclusion is supported by the legislative history of the Mansion Tax. Guidance can be found in a prior amendment to the Mansion Tax, <em>L. </em>2005, c. 19, which also contains a refund provision similar to <em>N.J.S.A </em>46:15-7.4. There, Assembly Bill A.3302 \u201cadd[ed] the <em>exemption </em>for transferees that are federally tax-exempt organizations\u201d and \u201cestablish[ed] ... the date on which the legislation shall take effect and incorporate^ the <em>provision </em>for refund, which is structured explicitly to reflect that effective date.\u201d <em>Senate Budget and Appropriation Committee Statement to A3302 </em>(December 6, 2004) (emphasis added). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>language indicates that an exemption to the tax was made for charitable organizations, while a separate \u201cprovision\u201d refunded fees as a matter of fairness to purchasers \u201cwho paid the fee ... for a transaction occurring ... before [the bill\u2019s effective date] and who would not be required to pay the fee under ... [this bill] if the transaction had occurred on or after [the bill\u2019s effective date.]\u201d <em>L. </em>2005, c. 19, \u00a7 2; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Similarly, <em>L. </em>2006, c. 33 includes an exemption for certain transfers that are \u201cincidental to a corporate merger or acquisition.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.2(b)(2). It simultaneously contains a refund provision for contracts that were \u201cfully executed\u201d before the bill was signed into law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4. This refund provision operates as a matter of fairness, ensuring that purchasers of commercial properties who had bargained for and fully executed their contracts prior to the law\u2019s enactment would not face an additional tax simply because the official deed transfers took place after the Legislature expanded the Mansion Tax to include commercial properties. Thus, so long as the contracts were \u201cfully executed\u201d before July 1, 2006 (days before <em>L. </em>2006, c. 33 was enacted) and the deeds were transferred by November 15, 2006, purchasers were entitled to a refund of the Mansion Tax. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The Legislature is presumed to know that establishing an \u201cexemption\u201d would result in the judiciary construing the statute in the State\u2019s favor, <em>Johnson, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 276, 927 A.2d 1269, yet it chose not to call the refund provision an \u201cexemption.\u201d Based on the fact that the Legislature articulated specific \u201cexemptions\u201d in both amendments of the Mansion Tax and twice opted to refer to the section of the bills allowing refunds as \u201cprovisions,\u201d we hold that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-7.4 is a not a tax exemption. Therefore, we construe the statute in favor of the taxpayers. <em>Fedders, supra, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>at 384-86, 476 A.2d 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Accordingly, we hold that the plain meaning and common usage of the phrase \u201cfully executed before July 1, 2006\u201d in a real estate context means a contract that is signed and binding before July 1, 2006. Because all of the amendments to the Wells Reit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Chicago Five contracts repeatedly stated that they \u201cmodified\u201d the original contracts and left the original contracts in \u201cfull force and effect,\u201d we find no \u201cclear and definite intention\u201d by the parties to effect novations. <em>Sixteenth Ward, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>at 342-43, 5 A.2d 753. Therefore, the amendments were only contract modifications and both contracts were signed, binding, and \u201cfully executed\u201d before July 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Reversed in <em>Wells Reit, supra, </em>24 <em>N.J.Tax </em>98, and affirmed in <em>Chicago Five, supra, </em>24 <em>N.J.Tax </em>342.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-11\"><em> L. </em>2006, c. 33.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
