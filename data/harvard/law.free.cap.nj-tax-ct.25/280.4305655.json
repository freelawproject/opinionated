Judge Small found the sales properly excluded because they were part of a package deal with an arbitrary allocation of price, they constituted a non-useable assemblage of properties, and plaintiff failed to establish that the sales constituted a transaction between a willing buyer and willing seller, not compelled to buy nor compelled to sell, and knowledgeable of the market values of the properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">On appeal, plaintiff contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">THE TAX COURT ERRED WHEN IT AFFIRMED THE DELETION OF THE CHALLENGED SALES AS \u201cNON-USABLE\u201d IN THE SALES-RATIO STUDY, BECAUSE THE SALES WERE ARM\u2019S LENGTH TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN KNOWLEDGEABLE CASINO COMPANIES AND THE TESTIMONY INDICATED THE SALES PRICES WERE IN LINE WITH SIMILAR PROPERTY VALUES IN ATLANTIC CITY.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">We have considered this contention and reject it. We are satisfied from our review of the record that Judge Small\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial credible evidence, <em>see Rova Farms Resort,, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974), and that he correctly applied the controlling legal principles. We affirm substantially for the reasons set forth by Judge Small, whose opinion is reported at 24 <em>N.J.Tax </em>1 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
