West. The antecedent ruling is apparently based upon the opinion of the judge that there was nothing to amend by in the original exceptions of law, which were as follows: (1) \u201cIntervenor excepts to the finding that the tax deed divested the title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>of the fund under its security deed.\u201d (2) \u201cIntervenor excepts to the finding that regardless of the tax sale, the title of the fund (intervenor) under the security deed was extinguished and reverted by reason of its failure to begin foreclosure proceedings within 20 years from the maturity of the note.\u201d (3) \u201cIntervenor excepts to the finding that the insanity of Owens and the fact that he thereafter had no guardian and after his death his estate was unrepresented for many years did not have the' effect of tolling the 20-year period stated in Code section 67-1308, and that the statutes of limitation applicable to ordinary actions and provisions of law with respect to the tolling of statutes of limitations against unrepresented estates have no application to Code section 67-1308.\u201d (4) \u201cIntervenor excepts to the finding that the levy by the City of Atlanta was not excessive and that the description in the levy and in the deed, under all the facts, is sufficient to convey the tract in dispute.\u201d (5) \u201cIntervenor excepts generally to the findings of law of the examiner.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b190-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Duckworth, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AEgY\">1. The exceptions of law and exceptions of fact not being sufficiently clear and definite in setting out the exceptions and the evidence in support thereof, and in failing to clearly and distinctly specify and point out the errors committed by the examiner in reaching the conclusions reported by him, the court did not err in sustaining the demurrer filed to the exceptions of law, but did err in overruling the demurrer to the exceptions of fact. Code \u00a7\u00a7 60-304, 10-301; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Commissioners </em>&amp;c. <em>for Dekalb County, </em>104 <em>Ga. </em>35 (30 S.

E. 440).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">2. And the exceptions of law not being clear and definite in accordance with Code \u00a7 10-301, and as ruled above, there was nothing to amend, and for this reason the court did not err in sustaining the objections and demurrer to the exceptions of law as amended. See Code \u00a7 81-1301; <em>Clements </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>161 <em>Ga. </em>21 (129 S. E. 846); <em>Sizer &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>G. T. Melton &amp; Sons, </em>129 <em>Ga. </em>143 (58 S.

In order to expedite the submission of all exceptions of fact for determination by a jury, it was stipulated that the court would rule on the demurrers to and motion to dismiss the exceptions of fact filed by Simon Wolf Endowment Fund, Inc., without prejudice to a later ruling on the demurrer and motion to dismiss the exceptions of law. Cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>tain of the grounds of the demurrer and motion were then overruled, and the cross-bill of exceptions here is to this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">At a later date, the court sustained the renewed demurrer, objections, and motion to strike the exceptions of law, as amended and decreed title to be in Thomas B. West subject to certain tax liens. The main bill of exceptions is to this final judgment and to the antecedent ruling above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
