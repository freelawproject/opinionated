In determining whether the state has met its burden of proof for termination under ORS 419B.504, (1995)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court must consider all of the factors listed in that statute and any other relevant considerations. <em>See State ex rel CSD v.

Dept. v. Geist, </em>310 Or 176, 194, 796 P2d 1193 (1990). However, because our review is <em>de novo, </em>we must independently assess and evaluate the evidence. <em>Boren, </em>105 Or App at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Here, the trial court concluded that the state had met its burden to terminate the parental rights of both mother and father based on emotional illness, mental illness or mental deficiency of such a nature and duration as to render them incapable of providing proper care for these children for extended periods of time. The court also concluded that due to the parents\u2019 lack of effort to adjust their circumstances, conduct, or conditions to make the return of the children possible and their failure to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social agencies for such extended duration of time that it appears reasonable that no lasting adjustment can be effected under ORS 419B.504 (1) and (5). The trial court explained its conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">\u201c[Father] has threatened to kill [mother] on multiple occasions, at least once holding a firearm to her head while she held the child, Rose Marie Frazier. The suggestion that [mother] made these allegations up to get shelter at Womenspace is simply not credible in view of her numerous open disclosures at other times, including two sworn abuse petitions. Moreover, despite his consistent unsworn denials of abuse, [father] did not testify in the trial of these cases. Accordingly, he did not deny the allegations under oath, nor did he subject himself to the rigors of cross examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">\u201cI also find Dr. Ewell\u2019s assessment of [fatherfs mental state and outlook persuasive. [Father] is not a viable resource to raise either of these children. The evidentiary record abundantly supports this [finding]. Limited examples include [fatherfs electrification of the living room couch, setting roof traps for prowlers, and his unhealthy, threatening relationship towards [mother]. The totality of the evidence supports both a disturbing and pessimistic assessment. The petitioner offered [father] the intensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>psychotherapy services discussed by Dr. Ewell. [Father] rejected those services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\"><em>* </em>\u2756 <em>% </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\u201c[Mother]\u2019s circumstances were also credibly assessed by Dr. Ewell. Her parenting skills are weak, her intellect is limited, and she suffers from a personality disorder stemming from an unfortunate combination of causes which impair her chances to ever successfully parent children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">\u201c[Mother] has accepted homemaker and parenting training, but has rejected sexual abuse counseling, and does not comprehend her need to seek the long-term intensive treatment recommended by Dr. Ewell. The most troubling aspect of this case lies in SCF\u2019s failure to offer [mother] the intensive, individualized psychotherapy discussed in Dr. Ewell\u2019s report after it was received by the agency in April 1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">\u00edJ\u00ed if* \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">\u201cA significant variety of services were offered to [mother]. She even sought some services on her own. However, she refused one of the most critical services required in her case: sexual abuse treatment. Dr. Ewell\u2019s report makes clear that her prognosis for change is poor. [Mother] does not comprehend her need for intensive treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">\u201c \u2018Under the most optimistic scenario, [mother] will probably require a year to two years intensive intervention, followed by long-term monitoring and supervision. * * &gt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-12\">\u201cSignificantly, when the agency decided to petition for termination, it met with both parents in June 1995. [Father] was adamant that he wished to parent Rose. The agency made it clear that ongoing services would be provided if desired. On the other hand, [mother] was acquiescent, and offered to turn Rose over to [father]. Her wholly inappropriate reaction was not only consistent with Dr. Ewell\u2019s assessment, but also highlights the bleak outlook for services to a parent <em>who alternatively alleges, then denies violent abuse, and asserts then withdraws interest in parenting. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-13\">\u201cThere was no evidence that [mother] (who did not testify in trial) ever showed interest in therapy, even after she was represented by counsel in these proceedings. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>her absconding with Faith Sparks from May to August 1996, portends ominously. The fact that Faith was found with her mother in the company of a man who [mother] alleges sexually abused her as a minor shows a strong resistance to change which yields to pessimism.\u201d (References to the record omitted; emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">We will first address father\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in terminating his parental rights. The petition for termination alleged that father\u2019s parental rights as to Rose<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> should be terminated on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">\u201c[F]ather is unfit by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child and integration of the child into the father\u2019s home is improbable in the foreseeable future due to conduct or conditions not likely to change, including, but not limited to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">\u201c(a) Addictive or habitual use of intoxicating liquors or controlled substances to the extent that parental ability has been substantially impaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">\u201c(b) An emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of such nature and duration as to render the father incapable of providing care for extended periods of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">\u201c(c) Mental, emotional, or psychological abuse of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">\u201c(d) Physical and emotional neglect of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">\u201c(e) Lack of effort to adjust the father\u2019s circumstances, conduct or conditions to make return of the child to the father possible, or failure to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social agencies for such extended duration of time that it appears reasonable that no lasting adjustment can be effected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">We agree with the trial court that the state proved by clear and convincing evidence that father is unfit on the ground that he suffers from mental deficiencies that render him incapable of providing proper care for the children and that due to lack of effort to adjust his circumstances, conduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>or conditions to make the return of the children possible and his failure to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social agencies that no lasting adjustment can be made. ORS 419B.504(1) and (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">The evidence supporting our conclusion is as follows. At the time of trial, September 1996, mother was 21 and father was 51 years old. They are not married, but they began living together when mother was 18. Mother was sexually abused throughout her childhood by her mother\u2019s boyfriends. Father told a caseworker that he befriended mother and took her in to get her away from sexual abuse perpetrated by her mother\u2019s current boyfriend. Mother and father\u2019s first child, Rose, was born in April 1994. She was taken from them in January 1995. Faith was born in May 1996. The state immediately petitioned for termination of mother\u2019s parental rights as to Faith and obtained a warrant to seize her from mother. The state located and removed Faith from mother about three weeks before trial. Sometime during the period that father and mother lived together, father suffered a stroke. Mother and father separated for a period of time after Rose was removed. As of the time of the trial, they were once again living together.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Ewell, a psychologist who examined father and mother in April 1995, concluded that father suffers from a delusional disorder. He stated that people with a delusional disorder, who have persecutory delusions, sometimes act on those delusions, \u201cthinking other people are out to harm them, even their spouses, and react physically or in a violent way [toward] them.\u201d Ewell said that a delusional disorder was likely to remain with some degree of permanency or rigidity. His prognosis was that father needed \u201clong-term, intensive psychotherapy\u201d before he could become a viable resource for his daughter. He doubted that anger management training alone would be sufficient to \u201chave the necessary impact.\u201d In his report, he concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">\u201c[g]iven [father\u2019s] almost complete denial at this point, the prognosis for successful intervention is poor. In fact, I do not believe that services could be expected to produce the results of [father] becoming a safe, parental resource within any time-frame which would meet the needs of his almost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>one year old child. Without intensive intervention, his condition is not likely to spontaneously improve.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Dr. Grosscup, a psychologist who examined father in July 1995, testified that he suffered from a major depression disorder and a schizophrenic disorder, which she defined as the \u201cumbrella for the delusional thinking.\u201d She initially concluded that father\u2019s mental condition was related to his neurological problems that she thought were related to his stroke. However, after considering the evidence that father had significant mental problems that predated his stroke, she said that such evidence would rule out the stroke as a factor and would change her diagnosis to delusional persecutory. Further, Grosscup stated that <em>even if </em>father\u2019s problems were neurologically based, she would not change her prognosis, which was \u201c[ejxtremely poor.\u201d She testified that her tests showed a \u201cstrong streak of paranoid ideation\u201d that would make it very difficult for father to cooperate with therapy. Although Grosscup stated that she was \u201cin the gray area\u201d as to whether father\u2019s parental rights should be terminated, she also said that the best case scenario was that father could eventually evolve into unsupervised <em>visitation with monitoring. </em>Grosscup never indicated that she believed that father would ever be able to regain full custody without state monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">There is considerable evidence in this record about father\u2019s conduct that is consistent with the experts\u2019 assessment of him. All of the state\u2019s witnesses testified that father was obsessively concerned with prowlers on his property. At one point, father shot a bullet into the garage when he thought that he heard prowlers. To deter the prowlers, he hung fish hooks on the roof, greased gutter drainpipes, pounded nails into the top of fence slats then broke the heads off and placed boards around the yard into which he had hammered nails that were facing up. He sometimes stayed up all night in an attempt to catch prowlers. Prowlers were father\u2019s primary topic of conversation with the social workers who came to the parents\u2019 home. He also accused a caseworker of bugging his phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In mid-July, mother told Nancy Bischofs-Reeves, a homecare provider who had been providing services to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>family, that father went into a rage because he had run out of drugs. She said that in his rage he broke glass and dumped cereal on the floor. Several weeks later, mother told BischofsReeves that father had tried to strangle her and had put a gun to her head while she had Rose in her arms. Mother filed for a restraining order in which she related that, in addition to holding a gun to her head, father had earlier threatened her and that she feared for her life. On January 11, 1995, mother reported to a County Health Department worker that father had gotten angry and choked her, put a handgun to her throat and threatened to kill her if she left with Rose. On January 24, mother called Bischofs-Reeves and told her that father had again held a gun to her head, this time while the baby was present. At that time, the State Office of Service to Children and Families (SOSCF)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> personnel, with the assistance of police, removed Rose from the home and placed her in foster care. The police searched father and found a loaded handgun in his pocket, which he claimed to have forgotten placing there. On February 1, 1995, mother got a second restraining order against father. Ewell reported that mother told him that her relationship with father was \u201cemotionally and physically volatile\u201d and that she had told him that, on four different occasions, father had held a gun to her head and threatened to kill her. She said that although father never hit her, they threw things at each other, that they \u201cwrestle[d]\u201d on occasion and that she had knocked his front teeth out during one incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Father attempts to minimize the effect his behavior may have had on Rose by stating that the child was not, in fact, physically harmed when the parents fought. The dissent concurs with father stating th t, although father\u2019s conduct with respect to mother \u201ccould nave put Rose in danger of harm, it <em>was not directed at [the child].\u201d </em>152 Or App at 617 (emphasis supplied). However, the fact that father\u2019s violence may have been aimed at mother, not Rose, is of little relevance if the violence could potentially also harm the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The record shows, unquestioningly, that at least some of father\u2019s violent behavior put Rose at serious risk of harm. Mother told several people of an incident in which she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>was holding Rose when father assaulted her. On a later visit to the house, just four days before SOSCF removed Rose from the home, SOSCF caseworker Marshall was visiting the parents. She witnessed an interaction between the parents that she said scared her. She testified that when father found out that someone had reported the January 11 gun incident to SOSCF, he became angry and \u201cglared\u201d at mother.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\">\u201cHe asked her, \u2018Did you say that?\u2019 And that was regarding a gun incident, again, that had been reported.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">\u201cShe said, \u2018No\u2019 and moved away. She actually moved away from where she was sitting and placed herself on the floor beside Rose. And just so \u2014 and Rose was then between the two of them. She actually moved so Rose was in front of her, and she cringed and bowed her head.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Father continued on with this raging confrontation for several more minutes. The SOSCF caseworker testified that she was \u201cvery fearful\u201d because father was so angry and that she actually got up to check on father\u2019s whereabouts after he left because she was \u201cconcerned about what he was going to do next.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Although father did not become physically violent in the confrontation, the above incident shows that father did not stop his angry confrontation with mother even though mother exhibited signs of fear and even though the child was in their presence. Father\u2019s violence towards mother and mother\u2019s reaction to that violence \u2014 placing Rose between father and herself \u2014 put Rose in serious danger. Further, the intake person at Womenspace testified that Rose was \u201cnon-responsive\u201d when mother came to the shelter following one of father\u2019s violent outbursts and stated that such a reaction is not uncommon for children who have witnessed domestic violence. Evidence that father will not curtail his violent behavior, even if one of the children is positioned between him and the target of his anger, supports our view that father is a danger to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Father suggests that his mental condition, including his paranoia about prowlers and his violent behavior, is somehow related to his stroke, and that the court should wait to see if a medical procedure done to clear a major artery has changed his mental condition. The dissent apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>agrees, relying on the fact that Ewell\u2019s evaluation of father occurred before he was treated for his strokes and that Ewell testified that father\u2019s delusional disorder may have a neurological origin. However, there is clear and convincing evidence in this record that indicates that father\u2019s mental problems and behavior are not related to his strokes. As discussed above, the evidence shows that father\u2019s mental problems existed long before he had his strokes. All three of father\u2019s adult daughters testified that their father engaged in delusional and violent behavior throughout their childhood. They said that he was violent towards their mother while she was his wife. The physical violence included <em>pointing a gun at his wife, threatening to kill her, </em>ripping her earrings out of her ears, ramming her head through a wall, pushing her out of a moving car, burning her with a cigarette and forcing her to have sex with other men.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Father\u2019s violent behavior continued into his children\u2019s adulthood, including an incident where father attacked one daughter with a fork and ended up hitting a second daughter as she tried to intervene. After being removed from the house by one of the daughter\u2019s husband, father stood outside ranting at the daughter, calling her names and saying, \u201cGet out here. I\u2019m going to kick your ass.\u201d One daughter testified that she had seen father throwing stones at one of his girlfriends after father had left their mother. The daughter said that all of father\u2019s relationships with women with whom he was intimate involved violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Father\u2019s propensity toward violence did not end, as the dissent states, immediately following father\u2019s divorce from his wife and begin anew just after his strokes. The evidence is unrefuted that father had paranoid thoughts that resulted in violent behavior long before he had any strokes. Further, although there may have been periods when he did not engage in violent behavior, the evidence shows that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>violent conduct toward mother is similar to the kinds of violence that he perpetrated against other women with whom he had intimate relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The fact that there have been no further reports of domestic abuse since Rose\u2019s removal also is not significant because, although mother and father were living together at the time of trial, they lived apart most of the time after Rose was removed from their home. Further, there is evidence that suggests that father\u2019s tendencies toward violence against others have not diminished since the surgery, including SOSCF caseworkers\u2019 testimony that they were concerned about their safety when dealing with father during the pendency of the termination proceedings. One caseworker stated that father became \u201cenraged\u201d at SOSCF personnel numerous times after the children were removed and another testified that father had threatened him and his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The dissent asserts that \u201cit is uncontroverted that father underwent medical treatment for a health condition that apparently was related to his problems with anger after Rose was removed.\u201d 152 Or App 617-18. However, the dissent ignores the fact that <em>no </em>witness testified that there was a definite, or even a likely, correlation between father\u2019 abusive conduct and his medical condition or that there was an expectation that the treatment for the medical condition would cure his violent tendencies. Neither father\u2019s regular doctor, nor the doctor who operated on father, testified that father\u2019s violent tendencies were related to his stroke. Father\u2019s regular doctor, Hill, testified that father had emotional symptoms that could be related to the stroke, such as depression and frustration. However, he also said that the problems for which he was treating father did not include treatment for mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Father\u2019s surgeon, DuPriest, testified that father had the following symptoms of stroke when he examined him in the spring of 1995: a \u201cmoderate amount of difficulty expressing himself\u2019 and \u201cmild weakness of his hand.\u201d When asked whether father appeared to be frustrated with his communication difficulties, DuPriest replied yes and said that \u201c[t]hat is quite typical when people have trouble talking.\u201d He stated that it was not uncommon for people to experience anxiety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>when they have a stroke, particularly when it interferes with their ability to communicate. He testified that father did not appear to be delusional when he examined him and that he did not appear to be suffering from any sort of mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Finally, the purpose of the surgical procedure was not to eliminate father\u2019s mental disorder. DuPriest said that the purpose of the procedure, which involved clearing a blocked carotid artery in his neck, was \u201cto prevent [father] from having another stroke.\u201d He said that occasionally such surgery helps people improve from their strokes and that father had definitely improved because his speech is much better. He did not say that having a stroke caused father to become violent or that the surgery could be expected to cure father of his violent outbursts. In fact, he noted that, even after his surgery, when father spoke of the custody hearing, he became very upset, causing his symptoms to worsen a little. The doctor testified that the last time that he had seen father he had \u201cseemed like he was back to what I consider normal.\u201d His failure to comment on whether father could be expected to be less violent, however, was likely due to the doctor\u2019s lack of any knowledge that father had engaged in domestic violence before the surgery. DuPriest concluded his testimony by saying that there was \u201cno <em>medical reason </em>that I know of that [father] shouldn\u2019t be able to parent his child.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) However, the condition that is impeding father\u2019s ability to care for his children is psychological, not medical. Because DuPriest is neither a psychologist nor a neurosurgeon, there was no reason for him to be aware of father\u2019s psychological problems and, of course, no reason for him to treat father for those problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence that father\u2019s emotional and mental problems are of such a nature and duration as to render him incapable of caring for his children. We also conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence that father\u2019s lack of effort to adjust his conduct and circumstances after reasonable efforts by social agencies make it appear reasonable that no lasting adjustment can be effected by father. Although father does not specifically argue that the trial court erred in terminating his parental rights as to Faith, the evidence that father\u2019s emotional and mental problems render him incapable of being a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>parental resource to Rose and his failure to make a lasting adjustment to enable him to become a resource to Rose is evidence that father is equally incapable of caring for Faith. ORS 419B.523(2); <em>see State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Miglioretto, </em>88 Or App 126, 129, 744 P2d 298 (1987) (need not show harm to specific child if can show harm to another child).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Father\u2019s principal argument that his parental rights should not be terminated is that the state has failed to prove that a lasting adjustment is not going to occur because it has not shown that available social agencies made reasonable efforts to assist him. We disagree. The state is required to make reasonable efforts to assist parents in making the adjustments to enable them to become minimally adequate parents. <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Oseguera, </em>96 Or App 520, 526, 773 P2d 775 (1989). The type and sufficiency of efforts that the state is required to make and whether the types of actions it requires parents to make are reasonable depends on the particular circumstances. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Gohranson, </em>143 Or App 36, 47, 923 P2d 1259, <em>rev den </em>324 Or 395 (1996) (services included group counseling and individual counseling); <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. DeVore, </em>108 Or App 426, 429, 816 P2d 647 (1991) (\u201cMother agreed not to associate with known sexual offenders or alcoholics, to participate in parent training and to continue counseling.\u201d); <em>State ex rel Juv.

Offers of assistance to the parents began as early as mother\u2019s pregnancy with Rose. Mother was identified as an at-risk parent when she came to her first prenatal doctor visit while she was pregnant with Rose. The nurses noticed in the first few days of Rose\u2019s life that mother seemed to be lacking parenting skills. Because of that, a public nurse referred both parents to Healthy Beginnings, a program designed to provide services to first-time parents who have exhibited certain risk factors. BischofsReeves was assigned by Healthy Beginnings to visit the family and provide parenting and homemaking services. She visited weekly at the parent\u2019s home for orie-and-a-half to three hours per visit until August 1995, when she was told not to visit due to reports of domestic violence in the home. Thereafter, she met with mother outside of the home. She provided both mother and father with information on child development, education, safety, activities to do with the child, discipline techniques, and access to community resources. Although she noted that father seemed to have bonded with the child and was gentle when he held her, she also noted that father rejected all advice from her. Both parents seemed to believe that it was mother\u2019s role to care for the basic needs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>of the baby and that it was father\u2019s role to play with her. Father told the service worker that, as long as mother was alive, it was mother\u2019s duty to provide for the physical needs of the child. Father said he was not willing to take over that responsibility unless something happened to mother.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Usually, when Bischofs-Reeves would come to the home, father would leave. Mother and father went to a parenting class, but father quit after attending only one class, apparently because of his discomfort at seeing mothers breast-feeding during the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Bischofs-Reeves and others were also concerned about the unsafe conditions in the home. Bischofs-Reeves testified that father had wired the couch with electrical current to keep the dogs off the couch.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rose was allowed to wander around the living room in her walker with no protection from the gas heating stove despite suggestions that something be done to protect Rose from burning herself. Father eventually installed some PVC pipe on the floor around the stove to prevent Rose from getting too close in her walker. At other times, newspaper was strewn about near the gas stove. The evidence also shows that, on one occasion, a gun was left by the baby\u2019s crib. Another time, a gun was left on the kitchen floor with the safety off. It appeared to the care provider who observed this situation that Rose had been playing on the floor at that time because she had newsprint all over her. Once, Bischofs-Reeves noted a burn on Rose\u2019s arm that appeared to have been the result of a cigarette ash falling on her. Mother explained that it had happened accidentally while father was holding Rose and that this was the <em>third </em>time that she had been burned in that manner. Mother also told Bischofs-Reeves that father had spanked Rose for chewing on an electrical cord. Both parents refused to child-proof the house and mother stated that Rose would learn not to touch things that she was not supposed to touch.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>From October 1994 through January 1995, a contract employee of the Family Resources of Lane County was instructed to provide in-home services to the family as a \u201cparent aide.\u201d She explained that a parent aide \u201cgoes into the home and provides specific services according to the care plan for the specific family.\u201d She said that one of her responsibilities was to provide respite care to the family. She spent three hours each week at the home, providing respite care at no charge. When she told father that she was concerned about safety issues in the house, such as the fact that the couch was electrically charged and that guns were left around the house, father simply got angry and said he did not like the social services people coming to his house. The parent aide suggested other resources from which the parents could benefit, but mother refused them, stating that she didn\u2019t want anyone else involved in her life and that she was \u201cfine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Another service provider, Colleen Stewart, who is the program coordinator for South Lane Family Nursery, also came to the home to check on Rose in January 1995. The program also provides respite care as well as parent support groups. Stewart came to the home twice to counsel the parents and to check on how Rose was doing in regard to her physical development. She also had Rose picked up twice and taken to a nursery. Mother refused to stay very long, and father did not go at all. Stewart\u2019s intention was to enroll the parents in an intensive parent education program called Families Together that helps parents set parenting skills goals. However, Rose was removed from the home shortly after Stewart began to provide services for the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In August 1995, Libby Marshall of SOSCF called the parents and told them that she had received reports of domestic violence and methamphetamine use and that she was concerned that Rose was not being properly fed or kept clean. Marshall offered the parents homemaking services and access to a relief nursery. She provided services until Rose was removed. One public nurse testified that the parents received <em>more </em>than the average amount of services to help them learn to care for their child, because at that time there were abundant services to offer and a budget to pay for the services. Although the service providers said that they focused more on helping mother leam to care for Rose, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>said that they did so only after father rejected their suggestions that he participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">It is true that, after Rose was taken from the parents, father did regularly attend parenting classes. The classes were voluntary and \u201cself-directed,\u201d meaning that the participants determined what aspects of parenting they preferred to learn about. Among the specific questions that mother and father asked were how to develop a baby\u2019s mental skills, how to care for a baby having a \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d and how to work with a \u201cstubborn\u201d baby. Although the class addressed domestic violence, neither mother nor father admitted that domestic violence was an issue that they needed to work on, and they did not seek to obtain any training on that issue. The director of the program said that she could not say that the parents showed any improvement in their parenting skills because she had no way of knowing how they acted outside of class. Simply attending classes and parroting back the information taught in the class is not enough. There must be some evidence that father used that information to \u201cadjust [his] underlying belief system.\u201d <em>Gohranson, </em>143 Or App at 47. No such evidence was offered here.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Father also asserts that he took an anger management class after Rose was removed and that he did \u201cwell in it[.]\u201d Father did participate in an anger management class; he was required to by the terms of his sentence for an assault conviction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Father received a certificate of completion, but the certificate is given to anyone who attends a specified number of classes. There is also evidence that father was quite involved and animated in class. However, the facilitator of the class did not feel that father ever accepted responsibility nor felt remorse for his actions in assaulting a relative with a bat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\u201c[Father] seemed to be remorseful about it, but primarily because he was concerned about getting custody of his child * * *. So it wasn\u2019t as though he was remorseful because you don\u2019t hit people; it was because of the consequence of what would happen if he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>The facilitator testified that father \u201cpretty much minimized what he had done\u201d and that he \u201cminimized the violence.\u201d He testified that he did not believe that father acknowledged the severity of the violence, referring to hitting his brother-in-law as \u201ctapping\u201d him, despite evidence that he hit him so hard that there was some concern that he had broken the victim\u2019s legs. Father continually blamed mother for his problems and portrayed himself as the victim. As to how he dealt with his anger, his response was that he was able to \u201cstuff\u2019 it and \u201ccontrol\u201d it sometimes. Also, as noted above, father became \u201cenraged\u201d at SOSCF personnel numerous times after the children were removed. Finally, Ewell\u2019s report states that anger management training alone was not sufficient to deal with father\u2019s problems. In his opinion, father must participate in intensive psychotherapy in order to correct his delusional disorder, which Ewell viewed as the root of his violent behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">After the children were removed from the parents, SOSCF workers told father, and his attorneys, what he had to do in order to have the children returned. SOSCF did not have father sign a formal \u201cservice agreement,\u201d but caseworkers clearly and specifically informed father of what he needed to do. In fact, father did several of the things that he was told to do. He regularly visited the children, underwent a drug and alcohol evaluation and got a psychological evaluation. As noted above, he also attended parenting classes and anger management classes. However, when Marshall told father that she had concerns regarding domestic violence, father denied that he had a problem. Cynthia Fellez, a social services specialist who took over the case in March 1995, testified that, when she first approached father about changes that he had to make, he was willing to listen, but that when she told him that he would need to deal with the domestic violence, he became \u201cirate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Father also refused to do the one thing that Ewell recommended and that a SOSCF worker told him in April 1995, that he must do to get the children back \u2014 engage in intensive one-on-one psychotherapy. When father was first told by a caseworker that he needed to obtain intensive psychotherapy, he seemed receptive, saying that he would do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>within 30 days. The caseworker testified that as the termination proceeding approached, however, father became angry and said that he did not have to get the therapy and that instead he would hire a new attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\">\u201cAnd at that point, when the decision had come to file for a termination petition, I told him that he still had an opportunity to do what was recommended, that there are times when we get close to a termination hearing where we will pull back if you are in compliance: He needed to do the anger management. He needed to get himself involved in intensive therapies for, you know, his delusional thinking, I guess, you know, was what the diagnosis was. And he just said he would fight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The dissent takes the position that there was a \u201crush\u201d to seek termination in this case. We disagree. Rose was removed from the parents in January 1995. Almost a year later, SOSCF filed the petitions to terminate the parents\u2019 rights as to Rose. It was more than a year-and-a-half before trial was held on the petitions. Further, the evidence shows that SOSCF worked with the parents after Rose was removed. It was only after it became clear that the parents were not willing to get the mental health treatment that the experts said was needed that the agency filed to terminate their parental rights. Finally, and significantly, there is no evidence that father had, even up to the date of the trial, sought out mental health treatment or indicated any intention to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Father asserts, on appeal, that because the state did not help him find the required therapy at no cost, it failed to meet its duty to make reasonable efforts to assist him in becoming a minimally adequate parent. However, there is no evidence that father ever requested assistance in finding a psychotherapist, much less one provided by the state at no cost to him. To the contrary, the evidence shows that the reason father did not get therapy is because he believed that he did not need it, despite the psychotherapist\u2019s diagnosis and recommendation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In our view, not only has there been no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>\u201csignificant progress\u201d shown here, there is <em>no </em>evidence that father has made <em>any </em>progress toward adjustment of his behavior. Accordingly, we hold that the state has proven by clear and convincing evidence, based on ORS 419B.504(1) and (5), that father is unfit by reason of conduct or conditions seriously detrimental to his children and that integration of the children into his home is improbable in the foreseeable future because it is unlikely that the conduct or conditions will change.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Mother also contends that the trial court erred in terminating her parental rights. The petitions for termination alleged that mother\u2019s parental rights should be terminated based on the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">\u201c[M]other is unfit by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child and integration of the child into the mother\u2019s home is improbable in the foreseeable future due to conduct or conditions not likely to change, including, but not limited to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">\u201c(a) Addictive or habitual use of intoxicating liquors or controlled substances to the extent that parental ability has been substantially impaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">\u201c(b) An emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of such nature and duration as to render the mother incapable of providing care for extended periods of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">\u201c(c) Physical and emotional neglect of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">\u201c(d) Lack of effort to adjust the mother\u2019s circumstances, conduct or conditions to make return of the child to the mother possible, or failure to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social agencies for such extended duration of time that it appears reasonable that no lasting adjustment can be effected.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Mother argues that the trial court erred in terminating her parental rights because the state failed to meet its burden of proof on the issue of whether she was unfit and because the state failed to provide her with services necessary to reintegrate the children into her home. We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>that the state has proven by clear and convincing evidence that mother is unfit due to her mental deficiencies, her physical and emotional neglect of Rose and her inability to adjust her circumstances to make return of the children possible within a reasonable amount of time. ORS 419B.504(1), (4) and (5); <em>DeVore, </em>108 Or App at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">As discussed above, in the first few days of Rose\u2019s life, nurses expressed concern about mother\u2019s parenting skills, noting that she was behaving</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u201cin a very inappropriate manner, speaking gruffly to [the] baby * * *. At one point [mother] scolded [the] baby saying, \u2018No. You\u2019ve eaten already\u2019 and she covered the baby\u2019s face with her blouse. Another time she sternly said, \u2018Now go to sleep.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The medical staff also noted that mother handled Rose roughly. At trial, a public health nurse testified that mother\u2019s behavior was like \u201cred flags on the top of the flag pole. It doesn\u2019t get any brighter and redder than that.\u201d When Rose was one week old, another public health nurse visited the house. She, too, noticed that mother was very gruff with Rose and that she acted like she had no idea what to do with a baby. Before the month was over, the public nurse had referred the parents to Healthy Beginnings, a program designed to provide services to first-time parents who have exhibited certain risk factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">On her first visit, Bischofs-Reeves heard mother call Rose a \u201cbrat\u201d in a tone that was not at all playful. BischofsReeves and others noted that mother never seemed to bond with the child. Mother rarely cuddled Rose, played with her or spoke to her. When she did speak to her, it was often gruffly. She often asked other people to take the baby. She said that she thought that the baby \u201chated\u201d her. She stated that her job was simply to care for the baby, that it was father\u2019s job to play with her. Bischofs-Reeves testified that during the time that she worked with mother, mother\u2019s parenting skills showed little improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Rose often suffered diarrhea, vomiting, fevers and thrush in her mouth. Bischofs-Reeves testified that she tried to explain to mother that the problems were probably due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>inappropriate feeding, but mother rejected her advice. For example, when mother was feeding the baby tastes of pizza at seven-and-one-half months old, and Bischofs-Reeves explained that the child\u2019s digestive system was not ready to properly digest such foods, mother brushed her off, saying that Rose liked these foods and that she was going to continue to feed them to her. This was after Bischofs-Reeves had been telling mother for months that Rose should not be eating solid foods yet. Mother also did not feed the child for long periods of time, saying that she did not want to spoil her. At one point, she gave the baby only water at night. Although Bischofs-Reeves continually told mother that Rose\u2019s formula must be kept refrigerated, the service provider often found it sitting out, which could cause it to spoil. When mother did refrigerate the formula, she would not warm the formula before feeding it to the child. Despite warnings from BischofsReeves that switching brands of formula can cause infants stomach discomfort, mother continued to change Rose\u2019s formula haphazardly.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Often when Bischofs-Reeves visited, Rose was dirty. On a visit in August, when the child was four months old, Bischofs-Reeves found that Rose\u2019s clothes were completely soaked with \u201cspit-up\u201d and that her hair was matted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Mother told Bischofs-Reeves that she had not given Rose a bath that day or the day before. Several people stated that the house was very dirty, primarily from dog hair. On the other hand, there was other, conflicting, testimony that although the house was cluttered, it was not overly dirty. Bischofs-Reeves and others were also concerned about the unsafe conditions in the home as described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The record also shows that mother often exhibited her lack of understanding of child development. For example, the public health nurse reported that in October 1994, when Rose was about five or six months old, mother \u201cpopped\u201d Rose on the bottom because the baby was heading for a shoe that was at the edge of the blanket that she was playing on. Mother told Rose, \u201cThat\u2019s enough of that. You know better than that.\u201d When Rose began to cry, mother told her, \u201cDon\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>you pull that on me. You know that doesn\u2019t work with me\u201d in a tone of voice that the nurse said was inappropriate. The care provider that witnessed and described the situation likened it to a \u201cdrive-by\u201d because mother came out of nowhere and swatted the baby without warning. She also said that the discipline was inappropriate because the \u201cpunishment did not fit the crime\u201d and because \u201ca baby can no sooner stop its crying at five months than arrange for the sunset.\u201d The next month, the care provider witnessed an incident in which Rose pulled mother\u2019s hair while mother held her. Mother slapped Rose on the hand and started counting to three as if she expected the child to understand that she was being disciplined. Similarly, Dr. Holo, the doctor to whom parents took Rose for ear infections and a severe case of diaper rash, testified to the parents\u2019s inappropriate expectations of Rose in light of her age.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Mother generally was good about taking Rose to the doctor when she was ill or when she needed immunizations. The first time the doctor examined Rose, in November 1994, she had an upper respiratory tract infection and an ear infection that had \u201cfinally perforated,\u201d However, Holo testified that she was also concerned about \u201cobvious physical neglect of the child.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">\u201cQ: What was the condition of the child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">\u201cHolo: At that time the child appeared to be quite dirty and was not fed, had not been fed for about six hours, so it was very fussy and appeared to be very hungry. And I did see the baby in the office because the mother had nothing for the child to eat at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">\u201cQ: Did the mother tell you that the child hadn\u2019t eaten for six hours?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\u201cHolo: Yes, she did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">\u201cQ: What is the normal interval between feedings for a child of that age?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">\u201cHolo: For a six-month-old, probably three to four hours and they would be getting hungry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">\u201cQ: What statements did the mother make at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>\u201cHolo: She stated to me many times during that visit that she was burned out. She stated, \u2018This is not fun. I don\u2019t like this.\u2019 She said, \u2018I\u2019m tired\u2019 many times and she stated the dad won\u2019t do things for her, \u2018but he would never let me give her to someone else to care for.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Holo testified that the statement that \u201che would never let me give her to someone else to care for\u201d followed her question about whether mother had ever thought about placing the child in foster care or allowing her to be adopted, which she said she asked in light of mother\u2019s numerous comments about being burned out.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">During the next visit, on December 21, Holo saw further evidence that Rose was being neglected.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\u201cQ: What was the purpose of that visit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\u201cHolo: That was for a diaper rash. And what we noticed at that time was that the \u2014 and nurse noticed this also, that the child had dirt caked behind the ears, had a very bad diaper rash, as though she had not been changed, you know, frequently at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">\u201cQ: \u201cDid you notice anything about the condition of the child\u2019s walker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">\u201cHolo: Yes. It was very dirty, and there was \u2014 her clothing was very dirty also and covered with dog hair, and her hair was sticky and matted with food. The diaper was falling apart it was so wet, and she was covered with drying feces at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">\u201cQ: Did you make a comment about the child\u2019s being cute to the mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-12\">\u201cHolo: I did say that. I said she\u2019s very cute, and the mother said, You take her home then.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">Holo testified that she did not feel that mother was meeting even minimal standards for parenting. At some point in the visit, mother told the doctor\u2019s nurse that she always kept a loaded gun at her side and that a loaded gun was kept leaning against a wall in the house where the child was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">As noted above, in mid-July 1994, mother told Bischofs-Reeves that father had gone into a rage because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>had run out of drugs. She said that in his rage he had broken glass and dumped cereal on the floor. Several weeks later, mother told Bischofs-Reeves that father had tried to strangle her and had put a gun to her head while she had Rose in her arms. Bischofs-Reeves referred mother to Womenspace, a women\u2019s shelter for domestic violence victims. Mother went to the shelter and told the coordinator the same story that she had told Bischofs-Reeves. Mother filed for a restraining order in which she related that, in addition to holding a gun to her head at that time, father had threatened her before and that she feared for her life. However, she \u201cpulled\u201d the restraining order two days later. She said she did so because father was scheduled for trial on an assault charge, and she was afraid that the restraining order would influence the outcome. Despite Bischofs-Reeves\u2019 recommendation to the contrary, mother returned to father. Mother was offered, at no cost, services for battered women while at Womenspace, but she chose not to accept those services.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">SOSCF first became involved on August 17, 1994, when Marshall of SOSCF called the parents and told them she had received reports of domestic violence and methamphetamine use and that she was concerned that Rose was not being properly fed or kept clean. Mother admitted to Marshall that she and father had had a \u201cmajor\u201d fight, but denied that father had held a gun to her head, claiming that instead he was just handing it to her, not pointing it at her. Mother failed to keep an appointment with Marshall on August 26. Marshall then came to the parents\u2019 home on September 21. Marshall noted that mother did not hold Rose, asserting that it was \u201ctoo hot.\u201d Marshall offered the parents homemaking services and access to a relief nursery. The parents did occasionally take Rose to the relief nursery. On a subsequent visit, Marshall suggested counseling to mother because she was worried about the domestic abuse. Mother indicated that she would go see a counselor that she had seen in high school to help her deal with her sexual abuse issues. There is no evidence, however, that she did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In October 1994, the parent aide from Lane County Resources began providing weekly in-home services at no charge. As late as January, the respite provider noted that mother slept during most of her home visits. She said that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>when she would arrive, Rose\u2019s diaper would be soaked with urine. She said that mother would not allow her to put medicine on the baby\u2019s diaper rash. Mother also told her not to hold Rose during visits because it just made the child want to be held after she left. Mother \u201cdidn\u2019t respond positively\u201d to any of the respite provider\u2019s suggestions in caring for Rose. The respite provider testified that mother did not hold the baby much and that she handled Rose roughly, one time \u201cnearly throwing her in the crib.\u201d She had many of the same concerns that Bischofs-Reeves had testified to including mother\u2019s failure to warm Rose\u2019s bottle before feeding her (mother said that warming the bottle would \u201cspoil her and she was getting too used to it\u201d), leaving guns around the home (mother said that she had once shot at some people that were bothering her and father, but that she had missed the people but had hit their motor home) and other safety issues, such as having the couch wired with electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">A program coordinator for South Lane Family Nursery came to the home to check on Rose in early January 1995. She asked mother to take Rose out of her crib so that she could see how well Rose was doing developmentally. The program coordinator testified that mother picked Rose up with her arms held straight out away from her body and \u201ckind of plopped her on the ground.\u201d She said that mother did not show any interest in the child during the entire visit and exhibited no attachment to her. The program coordinator said that Rose\u2019s movements indicated that she had not had much opportunity to develop her large motor muscles. As the dissent points out, over the period of time that Rose was being evaluated, her social skills and language skills were in the \u201caverage\u201d range. However, there is also evidence that all of her skills were deteriorating. The dissent concludes that this evidence shows only that mother was in need of services and not that she is an unfit parent due to neglect. We agree with the dissent that the evidence shows that mother was in need of services. However, the evidence also shows that services were being provided and that, despite the services, mother\u2019s parenting skills were not improving.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">From July 1994 through January 1995, mother reported at least three incidents where father had threatened her with a gun, as described above. After the final incident in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>January, in which Rose was removed from the parties\u2019 home, the parties separated, with father remaining in the home and mother going to stay with an aunt for several months. While separated, each party accused the other of drug abuse and neglecting Rose.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Mother was offered counseling in March 1995, but she declined the offer. At the request of a caseworker at SOSCF, both parties underwent psychological examinations by Ewell in April 1995. Both also had drug and alcohol evaluations and attended regular visitations with Rose. At the recommendation of SOSCF, mother voluntarily attended parenting classes. However, Rose was not returned to mother at that time because, as the facilitator of the program testified, although mother attended the classes, she did not seem to be actually able to apply what she had learned and there was no noticeable improvement in her parenting skills. Also, the caseworker was concerned because she was uncertain about where mother was living and the status of the parties\u2019 relationship. Additionally, although mother at one point said that she wanted Rose returned and other \u201cnumerous\u201d times stating that she did not want to be a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">On June 23, 1995, the caseworker told the parents that they were going to seek termination of their parental rights. The caseworker said that mother seemed unaffected by the news and even stated that she would sign her rights to Rose over to father:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cA: And, you know, I \u2014 you know, I was trying to keep things, again, on track, trying to explain that we have \u2014 you know, we have concerns about both of them, this was not, you know, like hot potato, hot potato, you just pass it on, that he needed to do some things, she needed to do some things in order for them to be considered resources. I said, you know, \u2018Understand this question clearly: Are you then, therefore, saying you do not want to be a parental resource to Rose?\u2019 And she said, Tes, I don\u2019t.\u2019 And I said, Tou\u2019re clear, are you not? You don\u2019t want this?\u2019 And she said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t want this.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201cQ: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">\u201cA: And she would sign releases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>A new caseworker assigned to the case said that, after Rose was taken, she spoke to the parents\u2019 attorneys about 20 times about available services, but that the parents never requested anything other than a copy of the psychologist\u2019s report. On September 28, 1995, eight months after removing Rose from the parent\u2019s house, SOSCF petitioned to terminate the parents\u2019 rights in regards to Rose. At some point during this period, the parties had reconciled and were attending visits with Rose together. About the time that the state decided to seek termination, mother became pregnant with Faith. Mother did not attend visitations with Rose after Faith was born because she learned that SOSCF intended to take custody of the baby. Instead, mother absconded with Faith in an apparent attempt to prevent Faith\u2019s removal by SOSCF.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> During this time, the parties were again separated. When Faith was found, she was in the arms of the man that mother had said had sexually abused her as a child. Faith was removed from mother\u2019s custody about three weeks before trial. By the time of trial, the parties had again reunited.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">In concluding that there was not clear and convincing evidence that mother was unfit due to neglect, the dissent focuses on particular pieces of evidence and concludes that that particular evidence does not provide clear and convincing proof that mother was unfit. However, when all of the circumstances regarding mother\u2019s care of the children are considered, the evidence supports the conclusion that mother was unfit as a result of her neglect of the children. The trial court, in its explanation of why it was terminating mother\u2019s parental rights, identified a critical fact in this case: mother\u2019s behavior had shown a consistent pattern of alternatively alleging, then denying abuse by father and alternatively pursuing, then withdrawing interest in parenting. That pattern demonstrates that it is highly unlikely that mother will, within a reasonable amount of time, be able, or willing, to <em>consistently </em>care for the children in a safe environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>When the <em>entire </em>circumstances are considered here, there is no question that mother\u2019s unfitness has been established by clear and convincing evidence. The record shows that, despite an outpouring of services and attempts to help her learn to parent, mother did not bond with Rose, did little to provide her with the emotional support that she needed, fed her in ways that caused the child to be sick and that could have resulted in malnutrition,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> did not keep the child or the child\u2019s environment clean and, despite urgings from the service providers to correct some safety problems, she refused to make an effort to keep the house in a condition that was safe for an infant or a toddler. Although mother did go to parenting classes after Rose was removed, there was no indication that she benefitted from the classes. Simply attending classes is not enough. <em>Gohranson, </em>143 Or App at 42. Mother must absorb and apply the information to her own family to demonstrate that she has made efforts to adjust her behavior to allow the reintegration of the children into the home. <em>Id. </em>In other words, she must not only understand what behavior she must change, she must also \u201cadjust her underlying belief system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mother\u2019s failure to change or improve her parenting skills clearly shows her inability or unwillingness to adjust her underlying belief system. Mother\u2019s ambivalence about the potential termination of her parental rights as to Rose, even as termination was impending, is a telling indicator of her attitude toward her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Our conclusion that mother has physically and emotionally neglected her children is also supported by evidence that she is incapable of protecting her children from abuse and danger. The psychological and physical abuse father inflicted on mother, although perhaps not directed at the Rose, often placed the child in harm\u2019s way. In the situation described above in which father angrily confronted mother in front of the SOSCF worker, mother\u2019s action in placing Rose between herself and father and \u201ccowering\u201d demonstrates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>that mother is willing to shield herself from harm by placing the child between father and herself and that father, at a rmnrmnm, psychologically dominates mother. Mother\u2019s conduct clearly shows that she is unable to recognize the dangers presented to her children by father\u2019s behavior and does not know how to protect her children from violence in the home. Mother has continually reconciled with father and defended him.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Even after Rose was taken, mother demonstrated that she could not or would not protect her children. When Faith was finally located, a police officer had to restrain mother from assaulting the SOSCF worker who had accompanied him and, when he attempted to take custody of Faith, the man who mother said had sexually abused her throughout her childhood ran away with Faith in his arms. Without question, allowing a man who abused her to have access to her child shows an astounding inability or unwillingness to protect her child from abuse. <em>DeVore, </em>108 Or App at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The dissent emphasizes the fact that the state did not remove Rose until mother reported that father had pointed a gun at her, choked her and threatened to kill her. Certainly father\u2019s violent behavior served as a catalyst to remove Rose from the home. The dissent asserts that the state would not have petitioned the terminate the parents\u2019 parental rights but for father\u2019s violence toward mother. However, the evidence shows that Marshall of SOSCF first intervened because she had received reports of domestic violence and methamphetamine use <em>and </em>because she was concerned that Rose was not being properly fed or kept clean. Clearly, Marshall was concerned with issues of neglect relating to mother\u2019s inability to care for the child as well as with mother\u2019s inability to protect the child from violence in the home. Considering the totality of the evidence, we conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence that mother has physically and emotionally neglected Rose and is unable to protect her from harm. ORS 419B.504(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">With respect to Faith, mother argues that the only evidence regarding Faith is that she was \u201cwell fed and healthy, she was clean, and that there was a very loving bond between Faith and her mother.\u201d We assume that mother is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>attempting to argue that the state must show that Faith suffered abuse during her short time with mother in order for mother\u2019s parental rights to be terminated as to that child.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That is not correct. <em>See Miglioretto, </em>88 Or App at 129 (\u201cORS 419.523(2) does not require that [a] child remain in an abusive environment until the state can show that abuse of that particular child has occurred. If there is evidence of abuse of <em>any </em>child, the statute permits a court to remove a child permanently from a dangerous situation.\u201d) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, we may consider whether mother\u2019s behavior affected Rose negatively in our determination of whether her parental rights should be terminated as to Faith. We conclude that the evidence of mother\u2019s neglect of Rose, and the dangerous environment to which the child was exposed, support the termination of mother\u2019s parental rights to Faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The termination of mother\u2019s rights is also supported, standing alone, by clear and convincing evidence that mother\u2019s mental condition rendered her incapable of providing care to her children. Ewell concluded from his psychological examination of mother that she suffers from \u201cborderline intellectual ability, a personality disorder and [ ] psycho/ social confusion:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">\u201c[Mother\u2019s] cognitive deficiencies, her personality disorder and history of long-term sexual abuse within a highly dysfunctional family, all render her incapable of parenting at this time. Her level of social judgment, problem-solving and sensitivity are grossly impaired. Reasoning is highly concrete and nearly void of empathy. At the time of this assessment, [mother] did not seem to realize that any of these problems were in existence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\u201c[Mother] is in need of long-term, individualized psychotherapy. Intervention will need to be tailored to her own level of cognitive ability. I doubt that she would be able to benefit from group forms of intervention. The learning which took place within her childhood and the role models she had of how a family should function, were inadequate. In addition to insight oriented psychotherapy, [mother] will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>need to be taught basic skills of self-management and interpersonal communication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\">\u201c[Mother] will also require parenting classes and homemaker skill building. This case will necessitate long-term monitoring and supervising. The prognosis for change is poor. There is a high risk of [mother] entering intimate relationships with abusive, or otherwise domineering men.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">\u201c[T]he barriers [mother] faces in becoming an appropriate parental resource include borderline intellectual ability, a personality disorder and the psycho/social confusion caused by years of living within a dysfunctional, sexualized family environment. As a result, she does not currently comprehend the devastating nature of these conditions and her own need to seek treatment. Under the most optimistic scenario, [mother] will probably require a year to two years intensive intervention, followed by long-term monitoring and supervision. Without successfully completing this level of treatment, her condition is not likely to spontaneously improve.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Ewell\u2019s testimony was consistent with his report. The state met its burden of proof as to ORS 419B.504(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">There is also clear and convincing evidence that mother failed to make a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social agencies. ORS 419B.504(5). As did father, mother asserts that the state failed to provide her the services that would allow her to change her circumstances and conditions. However, the evidence is clear and convincing that mother was given opportunities for assistance. In addition to the numerous services provided to mother that are discussed above, mother rejected offers from Women-space for dealing with her current abuse problems and apparently did not follow up on promises that she would speak to her high school counselor about her past sexual abuse issues. SOSCF informed mother and her attorney that intensive psychotherapy was needed before the children could be returned. Mother did not seek such treatment on her own and she does not assert that she asked the state to assist her in finding the appropriate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">In light of the fact that mother continually refused to acknowledge that she needed psychological treatment, the state did all that was reasonable to assist her in effecting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>lasting adjustment by informing her and her counsel that she would need to complete intensive psychotherapy before the children could be returned. <em>Compare Charles, </em>123 Or App at 235-36 <em>with State ex rel CSD v. Brady, </em>135 Or App 332, 342, 899 P2d 691, <em>rev den </em>322 Or 360 (1995). A parent may not stand by passively when informed of the measures that must be taken to avoid termination of parental rights and then claim a lack of effort on the part of the state because of parental inaction. <em>See Boren, </em>105 Or App at 607 (termination appropriate where father failed to respond to present a plan for reintegrating child into home); <em>Robinson, </em>31 Or App at 1101-02 (termination appropriate where mother ignored or refused to participate in any programs suggested by CSD).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Further, while it is certainly in a child\u2019s best interest to be reintegrated into a family, if possible, there must be some probability that might happen. <em>Boren, </em>105 Or App at 610. Children should not be placed in foster care indefinitely in the face of evidence that the parent will not be able to become a minimally adequate parent in a reasonable period of time. <em>See Geist, </em>310 Or at 189 (termination is in the best interests of the children where parent is unable or unwilling to rehabilitate herself within a reasonable amount of time to provide a wholesome and healthful environment); <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. McDonald, </em>38 Or App 399, 401, 590 P2d 289, <em>rev den </em>286 Or 149 (1979). The evidence here is clear and convincing that treatment is necessary for both mother and father if there is to be <em>any </em>chance that either of them could become a resource for the children. We see no evidence that either of the parents was or is willing to get the necessary treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In sum, this is not a case where the parents were attempting to change their conduct or conditions but were thwarted by the state. The parents were given abundant resources with which to learn to parent and to maintain a safe and clean household. They rejected most advice and continued to treat recommendations from the state with indifference. Both parents denied that they needed help with serious psychological problems and rejected SOSCF\u2019s requirement that they obtain treatment. Any further efforts by the state to assist mother and father in regard to their need to receive therapy would have been futile. <em>See Miglioretto, </em>88 Or App at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>129 (where, rather than being willing to work to change his sexually abusive behavior towards children, father continues to deny that it occurred, testimony from psychologists that there is \u201clittle likelihood that he will change whatever behavior patterns he currently has\u201d supports holding that father is unfit).

Because we conclude that the state has proven more than one of the factors in ORS 419B.504 (1995) as to each parent, we do not decide whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>clear and convincing standard applies independently to each individual factor or may be met by considering the totality of all \u2022 if the circumstances even when no one specific enumerated factor is proven to a eli ,;r and convincing standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b610-12\"> The petition for termination of father\u2019s parental rights as to Faith is identical except that it alleges \u201c[m]ental, emotional, or psychological abuse of the child\u2019s sibling\u201d in paragraph (c) and it excludes paragraph (d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b613-6\"> Formerly Children\u2019s Services Division (CSD).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><em> </em>The emphasized portions are identical to the kind of behavior mother accused father of committing against her.

Nonetheless, it would be illogical and unconscionable to leave any child in a home where the parents are found to be unfit and that it appears that no lasting adjustment can be made, especially where the only reason for a lack of evidence is that the child was born after the first child was removed from the home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b620-5\"> Father told a caseworker, before Rose was removed, that he was \u201cincapable of changing a diaper\u201d because it made him ill.

At stake in this case is the application of a fundamental principle about the quantum of proof necessary to terminate parental rights. Because that principle transcends any termination case and because I believe that the evidence is lacking in this case to meet that standard, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">I begin with the axiom that the state must prove the allegations that it made in its petition, <em>see State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Jones, </em>290 Or 799, 810, 626 P2d 882 (1981), and that it must prove at least one of those allegations by clear and convincing evidence in order to prevail. ORS 419B.521. The state alleges that mother\u2019s parental rights ought to be terminated \u201cby reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child and integration of the child into the home of the parent or parents is improbable in the foreseeable future due to conduct or conditions not likely to change.\u201d ORS 419B.504.

The majority, on <em>de novo </em>review, goes beyond the trial court\u2019s conclusions and holds that the state also proved that mother is unfit because of physical and emotional neglect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Regarding the allegation of neglect, the majority concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">\u201cWhen the <em>entire </em>circumstances are considered here, there is no question that mother\u2019s unfitness has been established by clear and convincing evidence. The record shows that, despite an outpouring of services and attempts to help her learn to parent, mother did not bond with Rose, did little to provide her with the emotional support that she needed, fed her in ways that caused the child to be sick and which could have resulted in malnutrition, did not keep the child or the child\u2019s environment clean and despite urgings from the service providers to correct some safety problems, she refused to make an effort to keep the house in a condition that was safe for an infant or a toddler.\u201d 152 Or App at 598 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">In arriving at its conclusion, the majority overlooks a great deal of objective evidence, (often provided by the state\u2019s own witnesses), that, when considered in combination with the evidence recounted in the majority opinion, serves to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the state failed to meet its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Before Rose was born, mother obtained prenatal care. The County Health Department identified mother as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201cat-risk\u201d parent based on several factors, including her youth, the fact that she was a first-time mother and her apparent lack of a viable family support system. When Rose was born in April 1994, she was a healthy baby. After Rose was born, the staff at the hospital also expressed concerns about mother\u2019s behavior toward Rose. They referred mother to \u201cHealthy Beginnings,\u201d a voluntary program designed to help at-risk first-time mothers. Mother voluntarily participated in the program, which included frequent home visits by parenting counselors to provide instruction, regular assessments of the child\u2019s development and group support meetings for the parents. As a result, mother\u2019s care of Rose was regularly observed during the nine months that Rose was in her parents\u2019 custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Additionally, Rose was being seen by Dr. Holo, a pediatrician, during this time. She testified that mother brought Rose to her office for treatment for nine different visits. She noted concerns about Rose\u2019s cleanliness on two occasions but testified that she saw no signs of significant medical problems beyond an ear infection and diaper rash and that there was never any evidence of physical or sexual abuse. Contrary to the majority\u2019s speculation regarding mother\u2019s feeding practices, there is absolutely no evidence in the record to indicate that Rose suffered from malnutrition. In fact, Holo testified that, over the course of her treatment of Rose while she was in mother\u2019s care, \u201c[Rose] did appear to be generally in overall good health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Regarding evidence that mother had not bonded with Rose, the majority opinion neglects to note that Holo\u2019s partner, Dr. Geisler, who treated Rose for an ear infection, was of the opinion that mother had bonded with Rose. She also made the following note in Rose\u2019s chart: \u201cI spoke to Mom at great lengths. She is very loving and caring. Brought [Rose] in for concerns about the ear but had a poor understanding of child rearing.\u201d Furthermore, mother\u2019s aunt observed mother and Rose together before Rose was removed by the state. She testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">\u201cA They got along fine. [Mother] would bring her over before CSD had her to visit with me. She always made sure that she was clean. Whenever her diaper was wet, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>changed her. When she fussed, she seen if she was hungry, took care of that. She would hold her. She played with her. She had toys that she played with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\">\u201cQ Did she love the child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">\u201cA Yes, very much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">\u201cQ Did the child love her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">\u201cA Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The majority relates that the program coordinator for the South Lane Family Nursery visited the home in January 1995 and \u201csaid that Rose\u2019s movements indicated that she had not had much opportunity to develop her large motor muscles.\u201d 152 Or App at 595. It fails to point out, however, that Rose\u2019s development was being regularly evaluated by the Healthy Beginnings program. In September 1994 (when Rose was 21 weeks old), Rose\u2019s chart from the program\u2019s counselors states that her motor skills were normal. Furthermore, at the age of 21 weeks, its assessment reflects that Rose had the social skills of a 28-week old child and the language skills of a 30-week old child. The only area where Rose tested \u201cquestionable\u201d was in \u201cadaptive ability,\u201d where her score was between low normal and high questionable. The Healthy Beginnings worker who performed the assessment testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">\u201cAt this point I don\u2019t refer the child to see the RC.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] I don\u2019t call the doctor. I don\u2019t go through any big hoops except to say, \u2018Hmm. It looks like 85, 86 [borderline normal/questionable].\u2019 There\u2019s no, honest to God, difference between those two [scores] except that we need to start paying more attention to the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">\u201cSo let me give you some tricks to do with your kid. I want you to put a mobile above her bed. I want you to change her crib to the other side of her room. I want you to take her outside. I want you to dangle a toy and do this. 85, 86 doesn\u2019t matter. My role, when I get a score that\u2019s at that level, as I say, is \u2018Hmm. It\u2019s time to intervene. Do these things. I\u2019ll come back next time and test again.\u2019 And that\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>what happened at the 35 weeks\u2019 time, and it went up. <em>She came back to normal\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">A 35-week assessment was performed in December 1994 by the worker before Rose was removed from the home on January 24, 1995. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion that \u201call of her skills were deteriorating,\u201d 152 Or App at 595, Rose\u2019s adaptive score actually improved to the normal range. Furthermore, the worker\u2019s testimony admits to the inference that the improvement could be attributed to the parents following her advice after the 21-week assessment. As the majority correctly notes, all of the other areas that were assessed, while lower than the September assessment, remained in the normal range with the exception of Rose\u2019s gross motor skills, which had dropped into the questionable range. The service provider attributed the low gross motor skills score to the parents leaving Rose in her crib and walker too much of the time, which restricted her movements. On balance, the developmental assessment evidence serves to verify what the public health department and hospital staff suspected from the outset: mother was in need of services. It does not, however, prove that termination of mother\u2019s parental rights was necessary due to neglect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the majority to hold that mother\u2019s parental rights ought to be terminated because of neglect on this record is unprecedented in our case law, and its holding evidences a complete disregard of the need for evidence that is clear and convincing or highly probable to support that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The same deficit pervades the majority\u2019s analysis regarding the home environment. As the majority opinion concedes, the evidence regarding the cleanliness of the parents\u2019 home is conflicting. There are reports of concern about excessive amounts of dog hair present in the home. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>as late as October 1994, the State Office of Service to Children and Families (SOSCF) \u201cFamily Resource Worker Plan,\u201d under the category of \u201cStrengths and Supports,\u201d indicated that the parents\u2019 house was \u201cneat and clean.\u201d Rose was removed from the family home three months later. Despite SOSCF\u2019s findings, the majority concludes that mother was an unfit parent because she \u201cdid not keep * * * the child\u2019s environment clean.\u201d 152 Or App at 598. Apparently, in the view of the majority, evidence of excessive amounts of dog hair in the home is enough to carry the state\u2019s burden to prove its allegations by clear and convincing evidence. In sum, the evidence simply does not support the majority\u2019s conclusions. Again, the state has failed to prove that mother was unfit in this regard by the requisite standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Finally, the majority opinion relates concerns about the safety of the home environment as proof that mother was an unfit parent due to neglect. Although it is correct that father told the service providers that he had wired the couch with electricity to keep the dog off of it, he also told them that he disconnected the power when Rose was up and about. Even though father\u2019s action was unwise, there is no evidence that Rose experienced any harm from it. When the service providers expressed concern about Rose being able to push her walker against the gas stove, father built a PVC pipe barricade to prevent that occurrence from happening. Again, there is no evidence that Rose was ever harmed by the gas stove. There was a report about loaded guns being left around Rose. SOSCF investigated the report and concluded that it was \u201c \u2018unfounded\u2019 for threat of harm.\u201d Mother voluntarily acknowledged that Rose had been burned on one occasion when ash from father\u2019s cigarettes accidentally fell on her arm. Mother also reported that there were two similar accidents in the past, but those incidents were not investigated. Despite those reports, none of the professionals monitoring the home environment acted to remove Rose from the parents\u2019 home at the time. Their inaction is a significant comment on how they viewed the seriousness of the conditions of the home at the time of their observations. Their inaction also gives rise to the inference that their testimony at trial constituted a belated effort to support the state\u2019s allegations, an effort that proved unsatisfactory in the eyes of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>court. In all, the majority\u2019s conclusion that the state carried its burden of proof in regard to neglect is belied by the observations of Rose\u2019s physicians and the actions of those who were regularly monitoring the home environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">In <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. </em>Pennington, 104 Or App 194, 799 P2d 694 (1990), we held that even though another environment might maximize the potential of the children in that case, the parental rights of the mother could only be terminated when the state showed by clear and convincing evidence that the mother could not perform her role with minimal adequacy. Accordingly, we reversed the trial court\u2019s decision to terminate the parent\u2019s rights. That case also involved a parent who undertook diligent efforts to improve her parenting skills and did not have the opportunity to demonstrate her ability or inability in the foreseeable future. In contrast, the majority accuses me of \u201cfocus[ing] on particular pieces of evidence and concludes that that particular evidence does not provide clear and convincing proof that mother was unfit.\u201d 152 Or App at 597. To the extent that I have given weight to credible mitigating evidence that was before the trial court and evidence that did not find its way into the majority opinion, I stand guilty as charged. After all, <em>de novo </em>review requires a focus on particular evidence in light of all the circumstances as part of a dispassionate, balanced approach in adjudicating whether the allegations of the petition have been proven by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The majority cites <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Miglioretto, </em>88 Or App 126, 744 P2d 298 (1971), and then uses its holding as a springboard regarding its analysis about the care of Faith. As a result, it incorrectly concludes that under ORS 419B.504(d), evidence that mother neglected Rose is sufficient to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights in Faith on the ground of neglect in the absence of clear and convincing evidence of neglect of Faith. First, the majority\u2019s factual predicates are not supported by the record. The evidence from Rose\u2019s care providers during the time that mother had custody is that while there were some deficiencies in mother\u2019s care that were capable of correction, Rose was a healthy baby at the time that SOSCF took custody. Second, the majority paints a much bleaker picture of mother\u2019s care of Faith than the record supports. It is correct that mother was concerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>that Faith could be seized by SOSCF when she was born on May 3, 1996. The petition to terminate parental rights in Faith was filed on June 28,1996, and the warrant for her custody was issued on May 29,1996. At the time of Faith\u2019s birth, mother was under no legal obligation to surrender Faith to SOSCF. When SOSCF found Faith, she was being held in the arms of an individual who mother had accused of abuse of mother as a teenager. Mother was in the same building at the time talking to the police. There is no evidence that Faith had been entrusted to the \u201ccare\u201d of mother\u2019s abuser or that her abuser presented a risk of sexual abuse to an infant. Also, there is no evidence that mother had neglected Faith during the time that Faith was in her care and custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Finally, in this regard, the majority commits legal error when it holds that evidence that mother neglected Rose is sufficient evidence to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights to Faith. In <em>Miglioretto, </em>we held that where <em>former </em>ORS 419.523(2)(b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provided that parental rights in a child could be terminated if the state proved that the parent had engaged in \u201c[c]onduct toward <em>any </em>child of an abusive, cruel or sexual nature,\u201d (emphasis supplied) that evidence of such conduct need not have been directed at the child who was the subject of the termination proceeding. We reasoned that the statute did not require the return of the child to a parental home where sexual abuse of several young girls had occurred in the past without evidence that the abuser in the home would change in the future would put the child at risk. We said, \u201cAlthough a parent\u2019s emotional or mental incapacity or <em>physical neglect must be directly related to the child before the court, </em>that is not a requirement for termination based on sexual or physical abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129 (emphasis supplied). The majority makes an -unwarranted extension of our reasoning in <em>Miglioretto </em>in this case that is inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the statute and with what we said in that case about what the state must prove under ORS 419.504(4). The state did not allege and there is no evidence that Rose or Faith was ever abused physically or sexually by either parent. Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, SOSCF will be able to take custody of children and terminate parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>rights to them on the basis of the previous neglect of a child, even though the parents are presently providing proper care to the child before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">To recapitulate the evidence regarding alleged neglect: Rose\u2019s pediatrician testified that Rose was in good health; Rose\u2019s developmental scores were about normal and were not cause for alarm to the worker who conducted the assessment; one of Rose\u2019s treating physician\u2019s and mother\u2019s aunt believed that mother had \u201cbonded\u201d with Rose; SOSCF evaluated the home as \u201cneat and clean\u201d; some of the environmental safety concerns were adequately addressed by the parents and the report about a loaded gun was determined by SOSCF to be unfounded. In every particular, the state has failed to prove its allegations of neglect by clear and convincing evidence. The majority is wrong to depart from the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the state failed to prove that mother was unfit due to physical and emotional neglect of Rose.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">That leaves the allegations of emotional or mental illness or mental deficiency and the lack of effort to make the return of the children possible as potential grounds for termination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The key to understanding the import of the evidence regarding these allegations begins with the uncontroverted fact that the removal of Rose from the home was triggered by mother\u2019s report of father\u2019s acts of violent behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>against mother. SOSCF first became involved with the family in July 1994, when father threatened mother with a gun. When the state removed Rose from the home in January 1995, it was again as a result of a series of phone calls from mother to social workers reporting that father had \u201cstarted threatening to kill [her].\u201d But for these incidents, the state would never have petitioned to terminate the parental rights of the parties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a result, the proper inquiry is what connection, if any, the parents\u2019 mental conditions had to those incidents and whether the state has proven that those conditions are unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">As importantly, the evidence in regard to the remaining allegations must be considered in light of the following time line:</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">(1) April 1994: Rose is born;</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">(2) January 1995: Rose is removed from the parents\u2019 custody;</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>(3) March 1995: The Juvenile Court assumes jurisdiction over Rose;</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">(4) April 1995: SOSCF enters into a service agreement with mother and encourages father to engage in intensive and long-term therapy;</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">(5) June 2,1995: SOSCF decides to file a petition to terminate the parents\u2019 parental rights to Rose;</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">(6) November 17,1995: SOSCF files a petition to terminate parental rights as to Rose;</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">(7) May 3,1996: Faith is bom, and SOSCF immediately takes custody of her;</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">(8) June 28, 1996: SOSCF files a petition to terminate the parents\u2019 parental rights to Faith;</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">(9) September 1996: Trial is held on the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">In April 1995, both parents participated in a comprehensive psychological evaluation conducted by Dr. James Ewell, a psychologist. The SOSCF worker who referred the parents to Ewell requested that the assessment address the following specific concerns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-11\">\u201c1. What are the barriers to either of these parents becoming viable parental resources?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-12\">\u201c2. Can services be provided to meet the individual needs of these parents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-13\">\u201c3. Can these services be expected to produce the results of either parent becoming a safe parental resource in the time frame necessary for the almost-one-year-old child?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">During her interview with Ewell, mother reported that her father had left her mother when she was only three months old. When she was about five years old, her mother remarried and then divorced again when she was 12. After that, her mother began having a series of relationships with different men. Mother reported that one of those men sexually abused her from the time she was 14 years old until she was 18. Mother reported other instances of sexual abuse by an uncle and by one of her friend\u2019s boyfriends. Mother has never received any counseling regarding abuse, other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>talking to a school counselor. She admits to having a bad temper while in high school and that she would occasionally punch lockers or walls after becoming angry with other students. On at least one occasion, she was involved in a fist fight with another girl, and she was twice suspended from high school, once for fighting.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">When mother was 13 or 14 years old, she became acquainted with father and would go to his residence to ride horses. After she turned 18, she moved into father\u2019s house, and she became pregnant. Mother described her relationship with father as being mutually emotional and physically volatile. She reported that a great deal of yelling and arguing occurred between them and that, on four different occasions, father had held a gun to her head and threatened to kill her. She told Ewell that on one occasion, she knocked out two of father\u2019s front teeth. She also reported numerous instances of them throwing things at each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">At the time that Ewell interviewed mother, she was separated from father and reported that she did not intend to enter into any other intimate relationships within the near future. Based on his interview with mother, Ewell summarized in his written report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">\u201c[Mother] seemed very limited in her level of interpersonal understanding and perception. There was evidence of poor judgment and decision making. Throughout this evaluation interview, [mother] did not accept any responsibility for personal problems or wrongdoing. Her lack of understanding and insight went beyond that which could be explained by limited intellectual ability. Her extremely dysfunctional childhood and early life experiences have most likely combined to create a personality disorder, as well as cognitive impairment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Ewell also conducted a battery of psychological tests. Mother\u2019s full scale intelligence quotient score of 79 placed her at approximately the eighth percentile, which is within the borderline range of intellectual deficiency, and just below the low average classification. Ewell explained in his report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">\u201cIndividuals of [mother\u2019s] cognitive ability level often have difficulty with abstract forms of reasoning. They may also experience difficulty with social judgment and problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>solving. It would be expected that [mother] might be somewhat impaired in her ability to understand the needs of her child. This would be particularly true when considering the more emotional, less tangible needs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Ewell concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">\u201c[Mother\u2019s] cognitive deficiencies, her personality disorder and history of long-term sexual abuse within a highly dysfunctional family, all render her incapable of parenting at this time. Her level of social judgment, problem-solving and sensitivity are grossly impaired. Reasoning is highly concrete and nearly void of empathy. At the time of this assessment, [mother] did not seem to realize that any of these problems were in existence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">\u201c[Mother] is in need of long-term, individualized psychotherapy. Intervention will need to be tailored to her own level of cognitive ability. I doubt that she would be able to benefit from group forms of intervention. The learning which took place within her childhood and the role models she had of how a family should function, were inadequate. In addition to insight oriented psychotherapy, [mother] will need to be taught basic skills of self-management and interpersonal communication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">\u201c[Mother] will also require parenting classes and homemaker skill building. This case will necessitate long-term monitoring and supervision. The prognosis for change is poor. There is a high risk of [mother] entering intimate relationships with abusive, or otherwise domineering, men.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\">\u201cIn answer to [SOSCF\u2019s] specific questions, the barriers [mother] faces in becoming an appropriate parental resource include borderline intellectual ability, a personality disorder and the psycho/social confusion caused by years of living within a dysfunctional, sexualized family environment. As a result, she does not currently comprehend the devastating nature of these conditions and her own need to seek treatment. Under the most optimistic scenario, [mother] will probably require a year to two years of intensive intervention, followed by long-term monitoring and supervision. Without successfully completing this level of treatment, her condition is not likely to spontaneously improve.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">At the trial held 18 months after his evaluation, Ewell testified that none of mother\u2019s diagnosed conditions\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>personality disorder, past sexual abuse, or low IQ \u2014 would by themselves lead to a conclusion that mother was incapable of raising children. Significantly, Ewell never reevaluated mother or father after April 1995 and after they were involved in various personal or parenting enhancement programs. His testimony at trial was based on evaluations that occurred <em>before </em>mother completed her efforts to improve her parenting abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Mother offered evidence that after Rose had been removed from her custody in January 1995, she, on her own initiative, enrolled in a parenting class that was specifically designed to address the needs of parents with cognitive disabilities. The class lasted for approximately 30 weeks and was structured in three terms around a traditional academic schedule. It began in October 1995 and concluded in June 1996. Mother\u2019s evidence indicates that she attended regularly and participated fully and diligently until she gave birth to Faith in May 1996. At trial, Ewing testified that he found it significant that, on her own and without the compulsion of a court order, mother had voluntarily gone to parenting classes and completed them. Her SOSCF caseworkers testified, however, that even though she was attending the class, her parenting skills that they observed during supervised visits with Rose did not visibly improve. Of course, that testimony must be tempered by the facts that SOSCF had already decided to terminate mother\u2019s rights in June 1995 and that mother has never had custody of Rose and Faith since January 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Shortly after Rose was removed, SOSCF entered into a service agreement with mother that required mother to obtain a substance abuse evaluation, a psychological evaluation, to keep appointments with SOSCF workers and to maintain a regular visitation schedule with Rose. Mother complied with <em>all </em>of these requirements. Nevertheless, SOSCF decided to petition to terminate her parental rights before she completed the requirements. Even more indicative of SOSCF\u2019s approach is the fact that SOSCF did not seek to help mother deal with domestic abuse after Rose was removed; the very problem that had prompted Rose\u2019s removal from mother\u2019s custody. At trial, mother\u2019s SOSCF caseworker testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>\u201cQ. Well, realistically, you have control of her child. In fact, your agency has continued to have control of her child since January of 1995. So why couldn\u2019t you say to her, \u2018[Mother], we have a concern about domestic violence. We have groups that can help you. If you want the child back, go to those groups\u2019? I mean, you clearly had the power to do that, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">\u201cA. Yeah, I could have done that, and my response would have been that \u2014 you know, as far as the initial service agreement, it seemed to me like the things in the initial service agreement were the first steps. Domestic violence would be something that we\u2019d look at further down the road, when we had a psychological evaluation that \u2014 you know, it \u2014 I was looking for the big picture at first of wanting to know what I was dealing with this person and, you know, what would she need in the big picture rather than simply plugging her into a specific service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">\u201cQ. * * * did anybody at your agency ever offer [mother]\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">\u201cA. I really don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Finally, there is no evidence in the record that SOSCF ever made it clear to mother after Rose was removed, that the return of Rose and Faith was dependent on her demonstrating her ability to deal constructively with the potential of domestic abuse (the major problem in the home).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The defect in the majority opinion regarding neglect runs as a common thread in its treatment of the remaining issues. It declines to focus on what occurred between January 1995 when Rose was removed and the date of trial. In June 1995, SOSCF was aware of all the above circumstances. Yet, the agency\u2019s response to mother\u2019s efforts to get Rose back was its decision on June 2,1995, to petition to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights. The mandate of the statute is clear: the ability of the parent to change in the foreseeable future must be \u201cimprobable\u201d and that fact must be demonstrated by evidence that is clear and convincing. When the reason for the removal of Rose from the family home is properly considered along with what occurred within the relevant time period, it can hardly be said that the state has met its burden. As a matter of law, that\u2019s not the \u201cstuff\u2019 of which clear and convincing evidence is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>I turn to the evidence as to father regarding the remaining allegations. Although father\u2019s conduct could have put Rose in danger of harm, it was not directed at her. In fact, according to the home nurse who visited mother and father while they had custody of Rose, father interacted with Rose and had established a close bond with her before she was removed from the home. As will become apparent, the major thrust of the state\u2019s evidence comes from a time period that preceded father\u2019s participation in anger management and parenting classes. It is accurate that the conduct against father\u2019s ex-wife before 1975, as testified to by his daughters, his treatment of mother, and the baseball bat incident after his strokes suggest that he will continue to be abusive in the future. However, that evidence is offset somewhat by the fact that there are no reports of abusive conduct between 1975 and 1993. Moreover, it is uncontroverted that father underwent medical treatment for a health condition that apparently was related to his problems with anger after Rose was removed. Significantly, no witness testified to incidents of violence committed by father after his surgery, even though the trial was not held until September 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The medical evidence from father\u2019s physicians regarding father\u2019s condition is as follows: Father sought treatment in 1992 for symptoms that were later attributed to his having had a stroke. The stroke was caused by the restriction of one of father\u2019s carotid arteries, which in turn decreased the amount of oxygen reaching portions of father\u2019s brain. The restriction of the arteries predated the strokes by some unknown period of time and it is medically probable that he experienced \u201ctransient ischemic attacks\u201d (TIA\u2019s) before he had the stroke. The TIA\u2019s would have caused stroke-like symptoms without causing permanent brain damage. The loss of oxygen due to the stroke, however, caused organic brain damage, which provides a neurological explanation for father\u2019s stroke symptoms which included loss of cognitive ability, aphasia,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> frustration, depression and worry. His treatment included vascular surgery to relieve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>restriction. It is unclear from the record exactly when the surgery took place except that it occurred after Ewell evaluated father in April 1995 and before Grosscup\u2019s evaluation in August 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">The majority says that no witness testified that there was a correlation between father\u2019s abusive conduct and his medical condition and concludes that \u201cthere is clear and convincing evidence in this record that indicates that father\u2019s mental problems and behavior are not related to his strokes.\u201d 152 Or App at 578-79.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Both assertions are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The first assertion is contrary to the testimony of father\u2019s physicians as well as the testimony of the state\u2019s principle expert witness, psychologist Dr. Ewell. Ewell testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">\u201c[S]ome of those delusions, may in fact be neurologically caused. So I guess <em>the best I can say is that I think the relationship is that possibly some of these delusions have a neurological base, </em>but it is possible that they do not.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">In addition to his acknowledgment that father\u2019s delusions could have been caused by his neurological condition, Ewell testified that \u201cindividuals who have persecutory delusions or have paranoid kinds of thoughts do sometimes act on those thoughts, thinking other people are out to harm them, even their spouses, and react physically or in a violent way to them.\u201d Ewell also confirmed that he had experience treating \u201cindividuals who\u2019ve had neurological problems that have caused delusions, <em>and in those cases I believe that medication has been at least somewhat helpful.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Father\u2019s physician testified that in addition to the vascular surgery performed to improve the oxygen supply to father\u2019s brain, his treatment included medication and that father\u2019s symptoms of frustration, depression and worry had improved. Also, father\u2019s physicians testified that they believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>that there is no physical reason why father could not parent his children. Besides Ewell\u2019s and the physicians\u2019 testimony, Zaeklin, a retired military noncommissioned medical officer who was familiar with the family, testified that after the medical treatment, father ceased being \u201cdelusional\u201d and became \u201ca lot more calm, * * * a lot more under control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Additionally, Dr. Grosscup, who examined father after Rose was removed and after father had undergone surgery, presented equivocal testimony about father\u2019s present ability to parent. Grosscup testified that father has a schizophrenic disorder and a major depressive disorder, both related to his medical condition. She opined that his prognosis is \u201cextremely poor\u201d even if his difficulties are neurologically based. On the other hand, she also testified that she did not \u201csee anything to suggest [that father] should have no contact\u201d with his children. Ultimately, when asked, in substance, the \u201cbottom line\u201d question about whether his parental rights should be terminated, she replied, \u201cI\u2019m in the gray area.\u201d Opinions in the \u201cgray area\u201d hardly equate to \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence. For these reasons, the testimony of Grosscup and Ewell cannot legally suffice to meet the state\u2019s burden that it is highly probable that father is unable to parent now and in the future due to conduct or conditions not likely to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In summary, the evidence is uncontroverted that because of the TIA\u2019s, father probably experienced stroke-like symptoms for years before Rose was bom. Sometime in 1992 or before, father experienced a stroke that caused organic brain damage, which could have caused or contributed to the delusional behavior observed by many of the state\u2019s witnesses. After Rose was removed from his custody, father sought and obtained medical treatment, including vascular surgery and medication, and his symptoms improved. Significantly, Dr. Grosscup, the <em>only </em>psychologist to evaluate father <em>after </em>he obtained medical treatment, was not able to express an opinion in favor of permanently terminating his parental rights. Again, I am hard-pressed to understand how the state\u2019s evidence rises to the level of the clear and convincing standard that the law requires under the above circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>There is another factor regarding father that weighs against the conclusion that the state has carried its statutory burden: the absence of efforts by SOSCF to offer services to him after Rose was taken into custody. Father was told by SOSCF to obtain a psychological evaluation, to get a drug and alcohol evaluation and to participate in visitation with Rose. Thereafter, father and mother continued to visit regularly with Rose. In April 1995, their caseworker received Ewell\u2019s psychological evaluation, and she told father that she wanted him to undergo intensive psychotherapy as recommended in the evaluation. She also told him that he had a deadline to obtain the therapy. However, SOSCF did not offer in any way to facilitate the implementation of such a program for his benefit. Nonetheless, father agreed to commence therapy within 30 days. On June 23, 1995, the caseworker met with the parents and informed them that SOSCF was going to seek termination of their parental rights. After he was informed of that fact, father rejected the notion of therapy and told SOSCF that he would oppose its decision to terminate his parental rights. Three months had elapsed since Rose had been found within the jurisdiction of the court and 60 days had passed since the caseworker had demanded that father become involved in therapy. Apparently, SOSCF\u2019s decision created an adversarial relationship with father that stalled any efforts on his part to become involved in a therapy program. Nonetheless, father thereafter continued to be involved in other programs designed to help him.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Father\u2019s counsel aptly summarizes the effect on his client as a result of the above circumstances and SOSCF\u2019s hasty decision to terminate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">\u201c[Father] has taken an anger management class and done well in it; he has shown he has no problems with drugs or alcohol; he has obtained treatment for the neurological problems caused by his strokes. He has taken some 30 weeks of parenting classes; and he has consistently visited with Rose. No one knows how these changes have affected father\u2019s parenting abilities. With respect to Faith, a child father has hardly met (perhaps not met at all, the record is unclear), we have <em>never </em>seen how successful or inadequate his parenting is. But even if father has not effected changes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>he deserves the chance to make them.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">These kinds of cases are not easy to decide. Because children are involved, there is a temptation to overlook the policy of the law regarding termination of parental rights that transcends every case like this one. However, we must be mindful that the termination of parental rights severs the fundamental liberty of natural parents to care for and have the custody of their children. <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 US 745, 71 L Ed 2d 5999, 102 S Ct 1388 (1982). Termination of parental rights is forever. It is for that reason that the legislature has decreed that the state must prove the statutory requirements by clear and convincing evidence or, in this case, evidence that makes it highly improbable that the children can be returned to father and mother\u2019s home in the foreseeable future.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The burden that is on the state in this case exists to protect a fundamental right of all parents, and we should be circumspect about following the statutory requirement of proof in every case, regardless of the emotional pull to place the children in an environment more conducive to their well-being.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Otherwise, we establish a precedent that lowers the threshold standard for termination of parental rights and we, in effect, instruct SOSCF to act accordingly, to the detriment of all Oregon citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">I have examined separately the evidence of neglect and the conduct and mental and emotional conditions of father and mother for the purpose of determining whether the state has proven that those circumstances are not likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>to change in the foreseeable future. Although the majority has garnered volumes of evidence to support its position, all of that evidence suffers from the same flaw. It predates the 60-day period in the spring of 1995 within which SOSCF first offered services to the parties and then decided to terminate their parental rights. There is little or no evidence that is probative of the parents\u2019 condition after father\u2019s surgery and the parties\u2019 participation in numerous programs, even though the termination trial was not held until the fall of 1996. The proof regarding each allegation is inadequate when considered in light of the state\u2019s burden. Although it does not necessarily follow that the sum of the parts is also inadequate, the state is required to prove at least one of its alleged grounds for termination. It has not accomplished that task when all the evidence is considered in regard to the general allegation that parental rights ought to be terminated \u201cby reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child and integration of the child into the home of the parent or parents is improbable in the foreseeable future due to conduct or conditions not likely to change.\u201d Father\u2019s claim that he and mother have never had an opportunity to demonstrate their ability to meet SOSCF\u2019s concerns rings with accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Protection for the children would not end if we were to reverse the judgment in this case. They would remain under the jurisdiction of the trial court, and their care would be subject to its supervision. If it were highly probable that father\u2019s past abuse of others would repeat itself and endanger Rose and Faith\u2019s welfare in the foreseeable future, I would not hesitate to affirm the trial court. But, the state\u2019s \u201crush\u201d to seek termination prevented it from making that showing. In light of the constitutional implication that this decision has, I cannot hold in good conscience on these facts that the state has carried its statutory burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Accordingly, I must dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b659-6\">Warren and Armstrong, JJ., join in this dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-9\"> The majority agrees with the trial court that the state failed to prove that father was unfit due to substance abuse and neglect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-12\"> We are unable to determine from the record what the witness meant when she referred to the \u201cRC.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b643-6\"> The majority responds that, \u201cWe agree with the dissent that the evidence shows that mother was in need of services. However, the evidence also shows that services were being provided and that, despite the services, mother\u2019s parenting skills were not improving.\u201d 152 Or App at 595. That statement, even if correct, does not complete the analysis. The termination of parental rights for neglect requires more than the demonstration of deficiencies in parenting abilities. Moreover, the evidence demonstrates that mother became involved in several parenting improvement programs after Rose was removed, but never has had the opportunity to have custody of her children and to demonstrate that she has benefitted from her participation in them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b646-5\"> Now renumbered as ORS 419B.504(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b647-6\"> The majority said, \u201cOur conclusion that mother physically and emotionally neglected her children is also supported by evidence that she is incapable of protecting her children from abuse and danger.\u201d 152 Or App at 598. That single sentence speaks volumes about a consistent flaw in the majority\u2019s analysis. In order to support its conclusion that the state had proven its allegation under ORS 419B.504(4) that mother neglected Rose, the majority relies on the use of evidence that ignores the distinction that the statute itself makes between evidence of the physical neglect of a child and evidence about the ability of a parent to provide care for a child. The latter focuses on the parent\u2019s parenting abilities while the former focuses on the particular level of care actually given to the child. ORS 419B.504(1) provides that a court in determining whether the rights of parents should be terminated because they are unfit shall consider whether parents suffer from an emotional illness, mental illness or mental deficiency of such nature and duration \u201cas to render the parent incapable of providing proper care for the child for extended periods of time.\u201d In contrast, ORS 419B.504(4) says that the court shall consider any \u201c[pjhysical neglect of the child.\u201d The majority\u2019s statement is telling because it illustrates an analytical method that lumps all of the evidence together to create an effect rather than requiring the state to prove its specific allegations by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\"> The SOSCF caseworker assigned to the family testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\u201cWell there were two different reports of domestic violence.
