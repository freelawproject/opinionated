Replication that plaintiff had deposited with the Freedman\u2019s Savings and Trust Company the sum of $652.21, subject to his order, and on the 29th day of April, 1874, in pursuance of the rules of said company, he gave sixty days\u2019 notice to the officers thereof that he intended to draw or check out the entire amount, and at the end of said sixty days, which occurred before the suspension of the company, and before the defendants qualified and took possession of its effects, he demanded payment. To this the defendants demurred, on the ground that it is immaterial whether or not a notice was given to the Freedman\u2019s Savings and Trust Company before suspension, as the defendants could not pay out the funds in their hands except as the statute directs. These causes of demurrer were sustained by the court below, and the general term are of the same opinion. The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A7_\"><em>Moore &amp; </em>Newman, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A8qG\"><em>Enoch Totten, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
