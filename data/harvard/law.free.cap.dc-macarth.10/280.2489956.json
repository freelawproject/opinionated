And here the defendant rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-12\">And thereupon the plaintiffs gave evidence to the jury tending to show that the said George Cole, deceased, was the son-in-law of the said Sophia Jackson, the grandmother of the defendant; that prior to his departure for the Island of Hayti, after the year 1829, he attempted to sell the said real estate, failing in which, he left his wife\u2019s mother, the.said Sophia Jackson, in possession thereof, with the expressed wish that she should hold the same during her life, and that at her death it should pass to his (said Cole\u2019s) sister.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>And the plaintiffs gave other evidence to the jury tending to prove that in the month of October, 1875, the said defendant declared and stated at different times, and to different persons, but particularly to two of the plaintiffs in this suit, that he was not the owner of the said real estate, but that the same belonged to the heirs of George Cole; that his aunt had, just prior to her death, placed him in possession of said real estate, with the request that he should preserve it for the heirs of the said George Cole, and that he was now willing to surrender the same to the said heirs upon their refunding to him the amount which he had expended on said property by way of taxes and improvements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-6\">At the close of the testimony several instructions were asked, of which the following is the only one that was considered. It was a request of the counsel for the plaintiffs that the court instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-7\">\u201cThe declarations of the defendant made at any time are admissible against him to show that he did not claim ownership in the property, and if the jury believe from the evidence that the defendant William Brown has declared, either to any of the plaintiffs or other persons, that the property in question belonged to the heirs of George Cole and not to him, and that he would return it to them upon his being repaid what he had spent upon the property, then and in that case the defendant\u2019s holding was not an adverse possession within the meaning of the law, and the plaintiffs are entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-8\">But the justice presiding at the trial ruled as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-9\">\u201cI will give such instructions, subject to this limitation: that the jury must further find that the declaration was made within twenty (20) years after the defendant went into possession of the property, claiming title thereto.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-10\">To which refusal of the court to give the instruction as asked, and to the giving of the instruction as limited, the counsel for plaintiffs duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-11\">The verdict was in favor of the defendant, and the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>is nowhere upon a motion for a new trial in the first instance on a bill of exceptions!</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-6\"><em>Birney Birney </em>and <em>Edward A. Newman, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-7\">Testimony as to the declarations of a defendant in ejectment may always be introduced to prove a tenancy under the plaintiff or his'lessors; and such declarations are binding upon the defendant, unless he can show a paper title, which the law will not permit him to give away by parol. <em>(Davies </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>2 Term R., 63; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Dobson, </em>3 Johns. R., 223; <em>Jackson v. Scissam, </em>3 Id., 498; 6 Id., 21.) The defendant\u2019s declarations, and the other testimony offered by plaintiffs, show that the defendant entered upon this property as trustee for the heirs of George Cole. Where the entry is of such a character, the trustee is never permitted to set up a possession or title in himself adverse to the <em>cestui que trust.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-8\"><em>John H. Cook, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-9\">The third instruction was properly refused. Wm. Brown\u2019s defense of adverse possession began in 1842; if proved to the satisfaction of the jury, would ripen into perfect title in 1862. The court was asked in the third instruction to say to the jury that alleged statements of the defendant, as to the ownership of said property, made in 1875, thirteen years after the expiration of the statutory period, would prevent the jury, from finding \u2014 even if so proved \u2014 that the defendant, up to 1862, bad held uninterrupted possession of said property for twenty years, claiming title in himself.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b294-10\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">The ruling of the court below, that the declarations of the defendant were not to be considered, unless they were made within twenty years after he took possession of the premises in question, was a qualification of the instruction requested by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel which ought not to have been made. This view is now concurred in by the chief justice who tried the cause at the circuit. The statements of the defendant had been admitted in evidence, and ought to have been sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>mitted to the consideration of the jury. We do not say that the defendant was concluded by this testimony, for its reliability was a question for the jury. It went simply to explain defendant\u2019s possession. The proof that be confessed to the plaintiffs and others that he entered without title, and held possession only for the heirs of the owner of the legal title, would have a tendency to show that he had been holding all along as a tenant, and not adversely to the plaintiffs\u2019 rights. TTis admissions at any time to this effect were admissible as facts for the jury to decide. They might not have been sufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to a recovery; but as the jury was misdirected, the verdict must be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
