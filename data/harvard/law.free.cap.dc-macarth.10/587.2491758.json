June 1, 1878, the complainant, by his solicitor, made a motion to vacate said order, which mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>tion was supported by an affidavit of said solicitor that he had no notice that said answers had been filed, or that said cause had been dismissed, until within the ten days then last past. An order was thereupon passed vacating the decree of February 20, 1878, dismissing the bill and reinstating the cause. From this order the defendants Ceas and Corcoran have brought this appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-6\">Rule 61 prescribes that \u201c whenever the answer of the defendant shall not be excepted to, the plaintiff shall file the general replications thereto within ten days after notice of the filing of such answers,\u201d &amp;c. And the sixty-second rule provides: \u201cIf'the plaintiff shall omit or refuse to file such replication within the prescribed period, the defendant shall be entitled to an order as of course for a dismissal of the suit,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b600-7\"><em>J. Parker Jordan, </em>for complainants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b600-8\"><em>L. G. Sine, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-9\">The question is, had the court below jurisdiction to nullify said decree three months and seven days \u2014 two full terms\u2014 after its enrollment ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-10\">Equity rule 61 does not aid the plaintiff, because it prescribes the time for appearance and answer. The plaintiff having invited defendants into court, must be presumed to have had notice that answers were filed within the time prescribed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-11\">The rule does not, it will be observed, require that a copy of defendants\u2019 answer, or even notice of its having been filed, shall be served on the plaintiff or his solicitor, and such has not been the practice of this court since its organization. <em>(Bank U. S. </em>v. <em>Mosset et al., </em>6 How., 591; <em>Rower </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Otto, 149; Equity Rule 88.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b600-12\">By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b600-13\">\u00a5e decide in this case that the defendants were not entitled to have the plaintiffs\u2019 bill dismissed for want of prosecution, unless they had given ten days\u2019 notice to the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>solicitor of the filing of their answer. That notice may be given either at the time of filing the answer or at any time subsequently. The ten days are to be counted from the time of service of notice upon the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor. If the defendant has neglected to give the notice after having filed his answer, and the plaintiff chooses to set the cause down upon the bill and answer for hearing, he can do so, and the same privilege belongs to the defendant, and that without notice. The setting the cause down for hearing is notice itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The order appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
