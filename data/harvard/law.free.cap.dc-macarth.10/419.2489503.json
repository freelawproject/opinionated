The owner\u2019s consent to the appropriation of his property is to be inferred from his bringing an action to recover the damages.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-11\">STATEMENT OE THE CASE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-12\">By an act approved June 26,1878, the Legislative Assembly of the District of Columbia authorized the Board of Public Works to extend M street from New Hampshire avenue to Twenty-first street, aud to assess damages to the owners of property which may be taken for the extension, if any shall be sustained; and the amount necessary for payment of damage was thereby appropriated out of the general fund. The plaintiff brings this suit against tbe District to recover the sum of $893.65, tbe amount awarded to Mm by a jury for 1,190.82 square feet of ground condemned aud taken into said street from bis lot lettered G- in square numbered 72, in the city of Washington, and the further sum of $165 for 220.08 square feet taken for tbe same purpose from bis lot lettered B in said square. The plaintiff\u2019s declaration avers that, pursuant to said act of Assembly, on October 1,1873, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the defendant entered upon and took possession of said ground, and lias ever since retained such possession, whereby the said defendant became liable- to pay the plaintiff the sums of money awarded to said plaintiff by the jury aforesaid for said ground so taken into said street as aforesaid, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of $1,058.65. It is also stated that defendant, being so liable, promised to pay the same. The common counts are added. The survey or plan of M street as extended over the private property of plaintiff is annexed, as is also the surveyor\u2019s certificate, which states that the said street is now paved, graded, and curbed, and showing also the quantity of land taken and condemned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">The defendant interposed a demurrer on the ground principally that the condemnation of the land was <em>ultra vires </em>of the municipal corporation of the District of Columbia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-7\">On the 25th day of November, 1876, the demurrer was overruled and an appeal taken to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-8\"><em>L.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABM\">delivered the opinion of the court orally:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">The question which has been principally discussed in this case relates to the powers of the District of Columbia to extend M street through private property. It is material to consider that this objection is not raised by the owner of the property. Indeed, by bringing his action for damages, he has consented to the appropriation of his land. Besides, the District authorities have not only condemned this property and procured a jury to assess the damage, but they have taken possession of it, and dedicated it to the purpose of a.public highway, and curbed and paved it for the public use. The case, we think, ought to be decided in view of these circumstances. It is not necessary to pass upon the question of power in the Legislative Assembly to pass the act of June 26, 1873. The power of opening streets and extending them through private property is usually delegated by the State Legislatures to municipal corporations, and they are constituted the sole judges of how and when the power should be exercised; the limitation being, of course, that compensation shall be made to the owners. We are not inclined to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>whether Congress had invested the Legislative Assembly with this right of condemning private property. It is peiv haps inferable from their general legislative authority, and hence within the corporate powers of the District under the territorial government. But on that subject we do not desire to express an opinion. It is sufficient that the property in question has been appropriated for the purpose of a street. The plaintiff has been deprived of its use and occupation, and the defendant has dedicated it to the public use, and that dedication has been accepted and acted upon by the municipal authorities with the consent of the owner. It seems to us that these circumstances should relieve the case from any objection on the ground that the District had no right to appropriate this ground to the public use. The owner\u2019s consent ought to remove any objection of this kind, and the District should not be permitted to set up its own wrong or irregularity to defeat the award of a jury summoned at its own instance for the express purpose of condemning the land and assessing plaintiff\u2019s damage. A judgment in favor of the plaintiff will estop him from claiming any interest in the ground occupied by the street. There must be judgment in favor of the plaintiff' upon the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
