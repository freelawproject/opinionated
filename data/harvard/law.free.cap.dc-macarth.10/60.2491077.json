On the trial of the action it was stipulated by counsel that the only defense made by the said Ager is that there was not due notice of protest of the promissory notes in suit. The plaintiff introduced as a witness W. E. Howard, a notary public, who testified that he presented for payment one of said notes .and produced a certificate of protest, which recited that he delivered notice of protest at the residence of said Ager, on E street, between Ninth and Tenth streets, in the city of Washington. He further testified that before delivery of said notice he was advised said Ager resided at that place, and at the time of delivery was informed by the person who answered his inquiries at the door of said residence that Wilson Ager resided there. Witness never heard it intjmated, until very recently, that said Ager did not reside there at that time, and never, until the day of trial, heard it intimated that he did not reside at that place at the time of service of said notice. Witness kept a record of his acts as notary public, and read therefrom as follows, to wit: \u201c On the next morning I left a written notice of protest for J. M. Ormes at his residence, Ninth street, between E and F, and I left one for W. Ager at his residence, E street, between Ninth and Tenth streets northwest,\u201d and testifiedthat he made said entry at the tim\u00e9 mentioned therein, and that he had no further recollection in regard to the \u25a0matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-6\">On cross-examination said Howard testified that he had no recollection of the facts, aside from the record made by him; but had no doubt, from his general course of business, that he was informed as to the defendant\u2019s residence, and that on inquiry at the door he was then further informed that this was his residence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-7\">In regard to the other note, the plaintiff introduced as a witness Mr. McKenney, a notary public, who presented the other note for payment, and protested it. His certificate of protest was also in evidence without objection, reciting the fact that he had addressed notice of protest to each endorser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-8\">After plaintiff rested, the defendant Ager testified, on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>own behalf, that in March, 1872, he removed with his wife to New York city, leaving said house here in possession of his daughter and servants; that he boarded with His wife at a hotel in that city a month or six weeks, when he rented a house there, and he has resided in that city continuously since, and that he had not resided nor had a place of business in this city or District since he removed as aforesaid to New York, where was his place of business and of receiving his mail; that he left his daughter and servants in occupation of his house here, because lie had taken a lease of it for a year,.which did not expire until the following autumn.

C. Ager, whose testimony was substantially the same as that of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-8\">The defendant further testified that no notice w&gt;as served personally on him, and he had no recollection of having received the notice of protest of either of said notes. Whereupon the court charged the jury as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-9\">\u201cIf the jury find from the testimony that the defendant (Ager) had a residence in Washington previous to making the notes, and in March, 1872, moved to New York city for the purpose of a residence there, and continued to reside there until the present time, but left the tenement he had occupied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>in possession of his daughter and servants, and continued to maintain that branch of his family at such tenement, and stopping there from time to time when he came to Washington, and that the notary delivered notices of protest at this house in Washington, then the verdict must be for the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-6\">To which charge the defendant, by his counsel, excepted.

The defense interposed was that he had not received notice of protest. The notice of protest was left at the residence of the defendant in this city, where the defendant Ager had rented a house, and which, at the time of the maturity of the note, was occupied by his daughter and servant, and which he made his home when in Washington on business. On looking through the bills of exception in this case, we think it quite apparent that notice of protest was duly served, and the judgment of the court below must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
