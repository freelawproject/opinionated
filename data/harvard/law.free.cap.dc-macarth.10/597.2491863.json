S. Fowler &amp; Co., in favor of Rachel Pront, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>for the sum of $1,600, with interest from date, dated August 1, 1860, and payable on demand. It was admitted at the trial that the note was the note of the firm of Charles S. Fowler &amp; Co., and was wholly in the handwriting of Charles S. Fowler himself. For the purpose of showing that the defendant was a member of the firm of C. S. Fowler &amp; Co., the plaintiff gave in evidence an advertisement or public notice, published in \u201cThe National Intelligencer\u201d about the 1st of April, 1858, in these words: \u201cNotice! \u2014 M. Wm. Beveridge has interest in our establishment from the 1st instant. We trust, with his additional aid, &amp;c., we shall be able to offer further inducements in our business. C. S. Fowler &amp; Co.\u201d He also called the defendant as his witness to prove that at the time when said notice was published the defendant -was in the store of C. S. Fowler &amp; Co., and knew of its publication. On cross-examination defendant testified that before the publication referred to he was employed by the firm, then consisting of Charles S. Fowler and John F. Webb, as a salesman, at a fixed salary; and about that time entered into the following agreement:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-6\">\u201cWe, the undersigned, do hereby agree to associate with us the name of M. Wm. Beveridge, for the space of one year, for the purpose of conducting the crockery business in its various branches, under the name and style of C. S. Fowler &amp; Co.; the said M. Wm. Beveridge to receive for his services the rate of four per cent, on the gross amount of cash and credit sales; but in ho case shall the said M. Wm. Beveridge be considered bound for any debt or debts of the above-named firm.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-7\">And, further, that he had no more control in the business of said firm after than before said agreement; that he never signed the firm-name, purchased goods, nor contracted debts in its name; and was not acquainted, in any way, with its business or books except so far as was necessary in the discharge of his duty as salesman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-8\">At the conclusion of the testimony the defendant asked the court to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>First. That the publication offered in evidence was not a declaration of partnership, and had not the effect to make defendant responsible, as a partner, for the debts of the firm of C. S. Fowler &amp; Co., notwithstanding that it was authorized by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-6\">Second. That in the absence of actual proof of partnership, the plaintiff cannot recover from defendant in this action without proving that he, the defendant, held himself out to plaintiff\u2019s intestate as such partner, and that she gave the credit to said firm, out of which the note in suit grew, believing defendant to be a member thereof; that it is not sufficient to show that defendant held himself out to the world generally as a partner; but it must be pi\u2019oved that he so held himself out to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and that the publication was not such holding himself out to her, nor sufficient to make him liable as a partner in this action, unless the jury found that it came to her knowledge before the credit was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-7\">Third. That the publication is merely a circumstance which may be considered as tending to prove actual knowledge by plaintiff\u2019s intestate that defendant held himself out as a partner, but does not raise a presumption of such knowledge, to be rebutted by the defendant; and unless the jury are satisfied that such knowledge existed the defendant is not liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-8\">The cause is now here on a motion for a new trial in the first instance, upon exceptions to the refusal of the court to instruct the jury as requested.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-9\"><em>A.

In our opinion it was legally entitled to no such effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">It merely stated that \u201c from the 1st instant \u201d Beveridge had \u201c an interest in the establishment,\u201d which, in itself, furnishes no proof that he was to be a <em>member of the firm; </em>since a participation in profits, if the language necessarily implied even that, does not, in itself, constitute the recipient a partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">In Pollock\u2019s Digest of the Law of Partnership, page 2, it is declared that the nearest approach to a precise definition which has been given by judicial authority in England, is the statenrent that \u201cto constitute a partnership the parties must have agreed to carry on business and share the profits iu common, where <em>\u2018profits\u2019 </em>means the excess of returns over outlays.\u201d So far from conveying any such idea, the language of the advertisement would seem to repel it. It simply gives notice that from the date specified Beveridge \u201c has an interest,\u201d and it contains the further expressions, \u201c our establishment,\u201d \u201cour business,\u201d \u201cwe trust,\u201d \u201cwe shall,\u201d \u201chis addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>tional aid\u201d; and it is not signed by Beveridge or by the individual members, but with the old firm-name. For these reasons, we think the first prayer of the defendant should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In our opinion the second prayer of the defendant correctly embodied the law upon the point involved. Where the party sued in reality was not a partner, he cannot be held answerable to a creditor of the firm, unless it is proved in some satisfactory manner that the plaintiff, at the time the ci\u2019edit was given to the firm, had been induced to believe that the defendant was in fact a partner, by some act or declaration on his part which had come to the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, and upon the faith of which he gave the credit. This is succinctly stated in note 3 to section 65 of Story on Partnership. See, also, Pollock, p. 23. A person who is not really a partner may by act or declaration untruly, and without authority, represent himself as such to others, and thereby, under some circumstances, expose himself to liability as a member of the firm. (Pollock, 22.) Such act or declaration is known as \u201cholding out\u201d oneself as a partner; and upon the plain principle of houesty, such conduct estops a defendant from after-wards disclaiming the character he has thus voluntarily assumed. But such conduct will not entitle the plaintiff to recover against such a defendant unless it had previously \u201c been known to the person who seeks to make him liable; otherwise there is no duty towards that person.\u201d (Pollock, pp. 23-4; 1 Taylor on Evidence, sec. 773.) Whatever force, therefore, the advertisement might be supposed to have, if it had previously come to the notice of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, the prayer properly stated that it could have no such effect unless he had been so apprised of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The <em>third </em>prayer raises the question as to the <em>legal value </em>of the proof, that the advertisement \u201c had been published in 'The National Intelligencer,\u2019 a newspaper published in the city of Washington, and having a large circulation in Washington and its vicinity, three times \u201d; for there is no other evidence whatever upon the point presented to this court by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>the exception. There is, therefore, <em>nothing </em>before us to show that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate lived \u201cin Washington or its vicinity,\u201d or that she took the paper, or had the opportunity of seeing the notice; and in the absence of such proof, the mere fact of the publication, in our opinion, was entirely insufficient, in the words of the authorities, \u201c <em>to lead the jury to conclude </em>\u201d that she had any knowledge that it had been published at the time of this transaction. The very point has been settled by the authorities here and in England. (2 Taylor, sec. 1479; <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>McCann, 10 </em>Md., 118.)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The bare fact of publication, then, being insufficient to enable the jury to conclude that the notice had come to the knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, the defendant had a light to ask that the jury should be instructed that there was a total failure of evidence upon the point. The instruction, as asked, was less favorable to the defendant than he was entitled to claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">This position is fully sustained by the authorities, and we adopt as our own the language of the Court of Appeals of Maryland. (<em>Clarke </em>v. Dederich, 31 Md., 148.) \u201c The legal sufficiency of the evidence adduced to sustain the issue, or to establish any particular fact material to its determination, is a question of law and not of fact; and whenever it is so light and conclusive that no rational, well-constructed mind can infer from it the fact which it is offered to establish, it is the duty of the court, when applied to for that purpose, to instruct the jury that there is no evidence before them to warrant their finding the fact thus attempted to be proven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">We therefore reverse the rulings excepted to, and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
