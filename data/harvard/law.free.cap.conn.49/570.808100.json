After it was recorded the plaintiff took it from the town clerk\u2019s office and put it in a package of papers belonging to himself and his wife, and deposited the package with Stiles D. Sperry, then of Hartford, for safe keeping, where it remained until Sperry\u2019s death. He then took the package to the place where he then resided and put it in a drawer, where it had been kept a short time before it was deposited with Sperry. The wife of the plaintiff subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>quently and with his assent delivered the package to one of her sons, Benjamin Anderson, for safe keeping\u2014stating to him at the time that it contained papers which belonged some to her and some to the plaintiff, and a deed that belonged to Martha Giles. The plaintiff was present, and heard and understood the statement of his wife in respect to the contents and ownership of the package, and expressed no dissent or objection thereto. The package has ever since remained in the custody of Anderson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-5\">Martha Giles is an orphan, and was about tweflve years of age when the deed was executed. She was the grandchild of Eliza Moore, then the wife of the plaintiff, and had then lived with and been supported by the said Eliza and the plaintiff for about seven years next preceding. The plaintiff had no child; and long before the execution of the deed, he had intended to give the land by will to Martha. About two years previous to this, he and his wife had purchased another parcel of land in Hartford, subject to a mortgage to one Barrows, for two thousand dollars, which they then assumed and agreed to pay. Fearing that Barrows would attach the land now in question to secure the payment of that debt, the plaintiff determined to convey it to the said Martha, and thus place it, so far as he could, beyond the reach of an attachment by Barrows. And with that intent and purpose, as well as with the intent and purpose of giving to the said Martha his title to the land, the plaintiff executed the deed and caused it to be recorded. But the plaintiff expected when he did it that the said Martha would continue to live in his family after she became the owner of the land, as she had done before, and that he should be permitted to remain in possession of it and use it during his life, in the same manner as he might have done if he had retained the title. And he has had the possession of the premises and has taken the rents and profits thereof, and has paid the taxes thereon, ever since the execution of the deed. The said Eliza, the wife of the plaintiff, died on the 80th of September, 1880, and the said Martha remained with the plaintiff until the 15th of Oeto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>ber, </em>1880, when, there being no suitable person in his family to take care of her, she went, with his assent, to live in the family of her uncle, Montague Anderson, where she still remains.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\">.

The plaintiff brought the record before this court by a motion in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b574-6\"><em>H.

Of course he knew nothing of the law and could have no clear idea of the effects of his acts. From all the facts it is apparent that he never intended to do more than to execute a paper which might give the land to Martha Giles in case of his death, the same being revocable by him at any time if circumstances should change. If the land was conveyed it was conveyed by mistake, which a court of equity will correct. <em>Stedwell </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>21 Conn., 189.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-8\">2. He never delivered the deed to Martha Giles, nor to any person for her. The taking the deed to the town clerk\u2019s office to be recorded was not a delivery. He took the deed from the office, and with other papers of his and of his wife, placed them in the hands of Mr. Sperry <em>for safe beeping, </em>where they remained until Sperry\u2019s death. He then kept them in a bureau drawer at his house, where he had kept them a short time before they were delivered to Sperry. After they had been kept there a while, the wife of the plaintiff, in his presence, delivered them to her son, <em>for safe beeping, </em>telling him they were her papers, her husband\u2019s, and a deed that belonged to Martha Giles; and her husband expressed no objection. He did not now part with his right to control the papers and the deed, any more than he did when he deposited them with Sperry. The object was the same in both cases, to keep safely for him. From these facts it is not claimed that there was an actual delivery, and the court has not so found, but has found certain facts from which it is claimed there was a constructive delivery or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>delivery in law. The lodging of a deed for record is no delivery, or at most bnt <em>primd facie </em>evidence of it. <em>Maynard </em>v. Maynard, 10 Mass., 456; <em>Hawkes </em>v. Pike, 105 id., 560; <em>Younge v. Gilbeau, </em>3 Wall., 636; <em>Cannon </em>v. Cannon, 26 N. Jer. Eq., 316; <em>Commercial Bank </em>v. Reckless, 1 Halst. Ch., 430; <em>Carr </em>v.

Ch., 40; <em>Jackson </em>v. Phipps, 12 Johns., 418. There was nothing here sufficient to constitute a delivery. Cook v. <em>Brown, </em>34 N.

Hyde, Jr., </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b575-6\">Pardee, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmD\">It is essential to the validity of a deed that it should be delivered by the grantor and accepted by the grantee; but neither the presence of the latter nor his previous authority to a third person to receive it on his behalf, nor his subsequent express assent to it, is necessary to make the delivery valid. When there is no such previous authority to receive the law presumes his assent whenever the deed is beneficial to Mm, although his dissent may be proven. Proof only that the plaintiff recorded the deed is not \u25a0 conclusive against him. The legal effect of that act depends upon the intent with which he performed it; and that is purely a question of fact. The court finds that influenced by fear of a creditor, as well as by affection for the grantee, \u201c with the intent and purpose of giving to the said Martha Giles his title to said land, the plaintiff executed said deed and caused the same to be recorded; \u201d a finding, in language not to be misunderstood, that he delivered the deed for record to the town clerk with the intent thereby and then to divest himself of all title to the land. This act, .with this intent, concludes Mm. The proven facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>that a month elapsed between the execution and delivery of the deed to the town clerk, that the grantor did not place it in the hands of the grantee, and that he retained possession of the land, of necessity exhausted their force upon the mind of the court below, and are not to be considered by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">There is no error in the judgment complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
