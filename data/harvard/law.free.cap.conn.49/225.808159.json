Regarding this record, it was admitted that the premises of the Thames River Worsted . Co. and those of the plaintiff in this suit, were both on Franklin Street Brook a few rods from each other. It was also admitted that, the injury complained of by that company in that record, and .the injury complained of by the plaintiff in this suit, occurred at substantially the same time and from the same alleged cause, and was occasioned by the same alleged neglect of duty on the part of the city in reference to the same sewers and culverts. It was also admitted that in that case the parties were at issue as to whether the duty of maintaining and keeping in repair the sewers and culverts in question was on the city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">The defendants objected to the admission of the record offered in evidence as being immaterial and wholly inadmissible for any <em>purpose; </em>but the court overruled the objection and admitted it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-7\">The jury having returned a verdict for the plaintiff the defendants moved for a new trial for- error in this ruling of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-8\"><em>J.

He had a verdict, and the defendant moves for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The Thames Worsted Company had previously recovered a judgment for damages against the defendant for injuries resulting to its property from the same cause, and substantially at the same time. That judgment was based upon a finding that the defendant had converted the stream into a sewer and had assumed and. failed to perform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>duty of providing an adequate passage for water discharged into it. Upon the trial of the case below, the court, against the objection of the defendant, received in evidence the record of that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The general rule limits the reception of the record of a judgment as evidence to cases between the parties thereto and privies; to cases between parties upon both of whom it is conclusive. If in the second suit there is a plaintiff against whom it cannot be admitted, he cannot claim it \u2022against the objection of the defendant. The finding that the defendant had assumed duties pertaining to sewers in reference to a certain stream and had neglected them, can not be made to reach beyond the case in which it was made. The present plaintiff charging the same assumption and negligence, the burden was as fully upon him to prove them as if they had never been proven; and the defendant had as full a right to deny the charge and sustain its denial by proof as if no finding had been made against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">It is quite possible that in certain jurisdictions provision is made for the institution of special proceedings for the determination of the question as to whether a city is bound to repair a particular bridge or.culvert or other structure as a duty to the public, in which the public on one side and the corporation on the other are made parties in such manner that the determination concludes all; if it is adverse to the corporation it is not to be allowed thereafter to deny it; if in its favor, it is not to be harassed by repeated suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">But this does not affect the rule as it exists in this jurisdiction, that if an action is instituted by an individual against a municipal corporation for the recovery of damages alleged to have resulted from a defect in a way or bridge, a judgment against the defendant is neither conclusive nor persuasive evidence in behalf of another plaintiff, of any fact supporting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">A new trial is advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">\u2022 In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
