They also agreed that certain of the purpart should be charged with owelty. Purpart H was alloted to John H. Celia charged with certain owelties. The agreement above referred to contained this clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-12\">\u201c The said several payments to be made to the parties entitled thereto within six months from the date of the final decree of this honorable court, with interest thereon, and that the same shall remain a lien upon the respective shares or purparts of the parties until the same shall be fully paid and discharged.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>The agreement also provided for releases to be given upon payment of the owelties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-5\">The court made a decree in accordance with the agreement of the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-6\">Prior to the partition a judgment had been recovered against John J. Celia, which judgment became a lien against purpart H, when it was allotted to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-7\">In October, 1899, purpart H was sold by the sheriff on this judgment, and the price realized was insufficient to pay the owelties, which were not then due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-8\">Upon the falling due of the owelties, according to the terms of the articles of agreement between the heirs, demand was made upon F. W. Kreps, the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale referred to, for payment. Mr. Kreps refused to pay, alleging that the owelties were divested by the sheriff\u2019s sale. Whereupon, Louis Celia, Jr., and Andrew Celia presented a petition to the orphans\u2019 court, praying for a decree that their owelties be paid out of purpart H, notwithstanding the sheriff\u2019s sale, and making Mr. Kreps, J. A. Wakefield, Esq., and John J. Celia, parties respondent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-9\">The court entered the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-10\">And now, to wit: April 5, 1900, this cause came on to be heard before the court upon the petition of Louis Celia, Jr., and Andrew Celia, the answers thereto, replication and rejoinder, testimony taken and argument of counsel thereon, and upon consideration thereof it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that there is due the said Louis Celia, Jr., the sum of 1359.74, with interest thereon from June 21,1899, and to Andrew Celia the sum of 1367.44, with interest thereon from June 21, 1899, being the owelty charged on purpart H (and payable to them), allotted to John J. Celia in the matter of the partition of the estate of Louis Celia, deceased, at No. 4, March term, 1899, of this court; and that unless the said sums and costs of this proceeding be paid to the parties entitled thereto within twenty days from the date of this decree, a writ of levari facias shall issue for the collection of said owelty and costs out of said purpart H.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-11\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AB0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>July 25, 1901:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-4\"><em>S.

Green, 48 Pa. 97; Bonebrake v. Summers, 193 Pa. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The allotment of John J. Celia of the purport in the lands of his deceased father was subject to owelty, inter alia, to Louis Celia, Jr., \u00a7359.74 and to Andrew Celia, \u00a7367.44 with interest from June 21, 1899. The title of John J. Celia was derived through an agreement in writing filed in court and signed by all the parties in interest, in which it was provided that the owelty \u201c shall remain a lien upon the respective share or purparts of the parties liable until the same shall be fully paid and discharged.\u201d In the final decree by which the partition proceedings were approved, ratified and confirmed, and the several purparts set apart and alloted in severalty, the condition was incorporated as follows : \u201c Subject to the payment of the sums charged as owelty thereon, and which shall be and remain a lien thereon until fully paid and discharged.\u201d The title so founded in an agreement and decree of court is equivalent to a grant by deed. The owelty so charged on the land did not become due under the decree until December 21, 1899, and until maturity the parties entitled could not proceed to enforce its payment. In October this purpart was sold at a sheriff\u2019s sale on a judgment obtained against John J. Celia prior to the partition proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>for the sum of $583, which was applied to the payment of costs and taxes. The holder of the title secured through the sale by the sheriff contends that the lien of the owelty was divested by the sheriff\u2019s sale. From the record of the partition proceedings, \u201c it is plain, from the agreement of the parties, that the incumbrance was to run with the land.\u201d The proceeding was instituted by one of the heirs, and after an inquest was had by the sheriff and a jury, all the heirs of Louis Celia joined in a petition praying ratification and confirmation of the inquest, the allotment of purparts, and the fixing of owelties. This record was known by the real purchaser of the title of John J. Celia at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and he had both actual and constructive notice that John J. Celia had not given any recognizance since none was required by the decree in partition, and hence he had but an equitable title to the purpart allotted to him. He also knew that the owelty was secured to the allottees solely through the agreement of the parties in interest, all of which was incorporated in the decree confirming the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">This equitable title could only mature into a legal one upon the payment of the owelty charged upon the land, and the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale occupies the same position as the defendant in the execution who had neither paid nor secured the other heirs their owelty: Robisson v. Miller, 158 Pa. 183. The two parties interested in the payment of owelty charged upon, and liened against this purpart, presented their petition for a rule to show cause on John J. Celia and on the parties claiming title through the sheriff\u2019s sal\u00e9 why the money charged upon and payable out of the purpart should not be paid. This was made absolute by the orphans\u2019 court, which practice is fully warranted by Neel\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
