The arrangement was that he was to be paid by the trip. Plaintiff alleged that on March 16, 1897, he was wrongfully discharged. Between this date and the first of July, the boat made five trips, and he claimed to recover wages for these trips.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-7\">Defendant presented these points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-8\">1.

That if the plaintiff was offered employment as pilot he ought to have taken it, and can only recover the difference in wages per trip between what he would have gotten as master and as pilot. <em>Answer: </em>If the evidence leads you to believe that defendants offered plaintiff employment for. a year as pilot (the term plaintiff alleges he was employed for) and such employment was refused by plaintiff, your verdict should only be for the amount of the wages he would have been entitled to as master (excluding, of course, what he would have been entitled to as pilot). But upon this question, before you base your verdict simply upon the amount plaintiff would have received as master, the evidence must lead you to believe that the offer to keep plaintiff on and keep him on as pilot, was to continue for the year plaintiff alleges he was employed for by defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-10\">Mr. Smith: Will you say to the jury that if they believe the defendants wanted him to take that trip, they should allow, that single trip as a deduction of $125.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-11\">The Court: No, I do not think that has anything to do with the case the way I put it to the jury.

Defendant \u25a0 denied both the employment for the year and the discharge, alleging that plaintiff\u2019s services as master were unsatisfactory and that he was offered employment as pilot at least for one trip, which he declined and voluntarily quit defendant\u2019s service.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">The questions raised by the assignments of error were, first, was the plaintiff bound to accept employment as pilot tendered him by the defendant ? The plaintiff does not deny his duty to seek other employment, but insists that he was not bound to accept a lower position, either for a single trip or for the remaining period of his employment, even at the same wages. The court intimated that, if the defendant had offered the plaintiff employment as pilot for the entire period covered by his contract of employment, he would have been bound to accept it, but that he was under no obligation to serve for a single trip. No question as to the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s efforts to seek other employment is raised. The offer of other service, differing in character and for a different period, was of itself in the nature of a rescission of the contract which, if accepted by the plaintiff, would have been evidence of his \u00e1ssent thereto. He was not bound to put himself in such a position. In reference to the character of the employment, the rule laid down in Wood\u2019s Master and Servant, 242, is: \u201cBy other employment is meant employment of a character such as that in which he was employed, or not of a more menial kind. A person employed as a bookkeeper and wrongfully discharged would not be obliged to seek employment as a farm hand, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>a person employed as an actor to seek employment as clerk in a store, nor would he be obliged to accept a situation of a more menial character, though offered to him by his former employer. He is only required to engage in service of an equal grade and character of that from which he was discharged. A farm laborer or any person employed at general labor would be bound to seek general work but an engineer, a carpenter or person employed in any special department of business would only be required to seek such employment as is within his special line andas is equally reputable as that from which he was discharged. In a Scotch ease \u2014 Ross- v. Pender \u2014 what must be accepted as the true rule was adopted. In that case the plaintiff was employed as head game keeper for a term. The defendant discharged him from that position but offered to retain him as assistant game keeper at the same wages. This the plaintiff declined to accept and, in an action to recover damages for breach of the contract, the court held that the plaintiff was not bound to accept the offer of the defendant to take a subordinate or different position from that for which he was employed and that his refusal to accept such position did not operate to mitigate the damages.\u201d The plaintiff was, therefore, clearly justified in his refusal to accept a subordinate position, particularly when it was offered him, according to the defendant\u2019s testimony, for but a single trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The appellant raises a second question as to the duty of the court to give binding instructions on the ground that the discharge was justifiable. This, however, assumes the fact that the justifiability of the discharge was the issue in the case. The defendant, however, both in his affidavit and in the testimony, denied the fact of the plaintiff\u2019s discharge but insisted that he quit defendant\u2019s service voluntarily, upon an expression of dissatisfaction with his services. The question of discharge and not its justifiability was the real question of fact in the case which was affirmed by the plaintiff and denied by the defendant. The case could not, therefore, have been taken from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We find no error in the refusal of the defendant\u2019s point or in the general instructions of the court of which the defendant has a right to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
