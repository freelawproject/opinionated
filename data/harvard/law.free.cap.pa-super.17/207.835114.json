The plaintiff participated in that contest and claimed the whole balance as widow of the decedent, but claimed no part of it under the provisions of the Act of April 14, 1851, P. L. 613. She had made a former demand on the executor for her f300 widow\u2019s exemption under that act, but did not follow it up when the fund was in court for distribution. Had she asserted her claim under her exemption demand at that time, it would doubtless have been allowed by the orphans\u2019 court. Her contention for the whole fund was inconsistent with her widow\u2019s exemption claim, at least to the extent of the overpayment which had been made to her \u201c on account of her bequest under the will.\u201d These facts must have been well known at the time and she accepted the decision of the orphans\u2019 court as conclusive by not taking an appeal from its decree. By her acquiescence in this decree, it became a final adjudication of this estate and is a bar to her action of trespass against this defendant \u201c for refusing to set apart to her on demand the three hundred dollar exemption as required by the Act of April 14, 1851.\u201d While such a claim is regarded with favor by the courts, it is one which may be Yol. xvu \u2014 -14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>lost by laches, or waived by conduct which is inconsistent with the demand: Kerns\u2019s Appeal, 120 Pa. 523; Dorscheimer\u2019s Estate, 12 Pa. Superior Ct. 34. The loss of her claim is not due to any act of the executor but to her own neglect in not urging it when the whole estate was before the orphans\u2019 court for distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
