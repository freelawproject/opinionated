I do not understand that this offer goes so far that they did work on it, but that they may have done for the owner. At all events it does not showthat they owned it. The objections are sustained, the evidence is excluded and an exception noted for the defendant.

Some question has been raised by the defendant about the right of the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company and the suggestion that they may have put it there. There is no evidence of that whatever ; there has been no evidence given showing that the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company had any right to put it there, or that they did in fact put it there under any legal right. There has been no evidence given in the case as to the right of the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company through or along the street from their track from which this siding runs into the premises of the defendant. With their right on the street we have nothing to do in this case; it is not in question, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>suggestion that they may have had the right to build this siding or track across the street and into the premises of defendant cannot be accepted, because no evidence whatever has been given to show that they have any such right.] [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-5\">[You have thus a case on the evidence in which there is no reasonable doubt. You have a case of a public highway with a railway upon it; no right shown to construct that railway, and you have the uncontradicted evidence, including the evidence of the defendant himself, that he does use this track and that he maintains it in the sense of keeping it in operation and running his cars upon it. There is, therefore, gentlemen, no disputed question of fact in the case that bears upon the final result, and therefore there is nothing to be left to you in the case which would warrant you to come to a conclusion in any other way than one, and that is, the conclusion that the verdict must be a verdict of guilty of maintaining this nuisance, and therefore it is not necessary for me to charge you at any length.] [10]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-6\">Verdict of guilty upon which judgment of sentence was passed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-7\"><em>Errors assigned </em>amongst others were (3, 4) rulings on evidence, quoting the bill of exceptions.

Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The defendant has been convicted of maintaining a nuisance on a public street in the borough of Carlisle. The tracks of the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company'occupy longitudinally a part of one of the streets of the borough. From these tracks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>a \u201c turn out \u201d was, more than a quarter of a century ago, constructed, leading at a sharp curve across the unoccupied part of the street; .across the footway, and thence by a right of way owned by the defendant, to his mill. The evidence admitted does not show that the defendant originally constructed the \u201c turn out,\u201d nor, indeed, who built it. The commonwealth alleges that the defendant maintained it and, being without authority of law to maintain railroad tracks upon a public highway, that he thereby became guilty of the misdemeanor charged. The first matter of defense is that the defendant had the power to construct and maintain the \u201cturn out\u201d track (as above described), under the legislative grants contained in the charter of the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company. This we cannot concede. Section 19 of the act of April 2, 1831, creating-the franchise, is as follows: \u201c That the company shall not prevent any person or persons, being the owner or owners of any land bordering on said railroad, or adjacent thereto, from making such lateral railroads, and to connect them with said railroad from said lands, as the said person or persons may conceive. necessary, but so as not to interfere with or impede the use thereof.\u201d It may be that this legislation would have given to the defendant some right had he been able to connect with the tracks of the railroad without going upon the public highway, but it gave the defendant no right to lay or maintain railroad tracks upon the public highway. The right to .do this must be clearly conferred by the legislature: Commonwealth v. Erie, etc. R. R. Co., 27 Pa. 354. It is not conferred by the language quoted. Nor could the defendant procure by purchase, lease or transfer from the railroad company, the power to do that which involves the exercise of the right of eminent domain : Barker v. Hartman Steel Co., 129 Pa. 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The real question in the case was largely one of fact, namely, Did the defendant maintain the \u201cturn out\u201d on the public highway? He is not shown to have constructed it. He says that he drew cars over it and over his own right of way to his mill; that the track upon the right of way he kept in repair ; but that the \u201c turn out \u201d was reconstructed, repaired and maintained by the railroad. He was partially corroborated by an employee of the railroad who in\u201d effect said, that the railroad company had relaid the track of the \u201c turn out \u201d a few years before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>trial, and had made repairs to it, but added, that a report of the cost thereof was by him returned to the company as made to \u201c Greybill\u2019s siding,\u201d and that this he would not have done in the case of one of the company\u2019s own sidings. The witness further testified that he 'did not know whether the cost of the work which he did was charged by the company to Greybill or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">The facts that the defendant used the \u201c turn out \u201d as described, and that bills for some of the repairs to it made by the railroad company may have been rendered to the defendant and paid by him, did not shut off all inquiry as to the relation which the railroad bore to the maintenance, construction and reconstruction of the \u201c turn out \u201d as part of its trackage. The defendant\u2019s conduct might have been consistent with his claim of nonliability, if he had been permitted to show, by the chief engineer of the railroad company, that he, acting for the company, had \u201c changed the sidings on Main street as they now are with rails furnished by the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company; that he ran the sidings into the mill; \u201d especially as the defendant offered to follow this by proof that .the railroad company had subsequently repaired the sidings.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We think, therefore, that the learned trial judge should have admitted the evidence covered by the defendant\u2019s offers of proof, the rejection of which is made the basis of the third and fourth assignments of error. If the proof had come fully up to the offers, it would have aided the jury (to whom the question should have gone) in determining whether in point of fact the defendant or the railroad had constructed or reconstructed or was maintaining the piece of track constituting the alleged nuisance. If the jury should find that not the defendant but the railroad company (whether lawfully or not) reconstructed and maintained the \u201c turn out,\u201d there could be no conviction, even though the defendant may have moved cars over the \u201c turn out\u201d to his own right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Elaborate arguments have been presented by learned counsel upon the question whether the railroad, company has the right, under its charter, to construct and maintain the \u201c turn out,\u201d of which complaint is made. We do not think it necessary to pass upon this question now. The company is not indicted. If it had been set up that the defendant kept the <em>\u201c </em>turn out \u201d in re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>pair for and on behalf of the railroad company, the existenec of the power in the company to construct and maintain the \u201cturn out\u201d on the public highway would have become an important matter. As the case now stands, the proposition, thus presented, is not raised. The defendant has proceeded upon the theory that he neither constructed nor maintained the \u201c turn out,\u201d or failing to show this, that he himself had the right, under the powers contained in the original grant of franchise to the railroad company, to construct and maintain the \u201c turn out.\u201d The latter proposition, as we have seen, is not sustainable. The former is a question of fact. Were we to hold as matter of law that the railroad company under its charter had the right to construct and maintain such a \u201c turn out,\u201d the question of fact would still remain, namely, did the company construct and maintain it ? This being found affirmatively,' the defendant is relieved and the question of law becomes unimportant. We specifically sustain the third and fourth assignments of error, and such only of the other assignments or parts thereof, as may be affected by the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The judgment is reversed and a new venire is awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
