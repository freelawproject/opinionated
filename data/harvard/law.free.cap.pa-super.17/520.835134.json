Before Barker, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-5\">From the record it appeared that T. B. Allison made an assignment for the benefit of creditors to W. C. Brown. Brown entered a bond on which John Dorn was one of the sureties. Brown filed his final account as assignee, and J. A. C. Ruffner was appointed auditor. The auditor filed a report awarding distribution, and this report was confirmed by the court. Ruffner\u2019s fee was not paid, and he brought suit on the bond. Dorn claimed the benefit of the 1300 exemption law. Dorn\u2019s property was appraised for exemption, but subsequently the court in an opinion by Barker, P. J., specially presiding, set aside the appraisement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b557-7\"><em>J. </em>N.

The fraud that will prevent a defendant from claiming the benefit of exemption must exist in the transaction in which the levy is made. If the fraud is independent of the levy, or by a joint debtor, it will not be a bar to the defendant against whom the levy is made: Emerson v.

Whether the promise to indemnify against contingent loss from the default of the assignee is original or collateral or whether the consideration moving the surety is between him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>and Ms principal or between Mm and those who are to be secured against the default of the principal by him is of little consequence in the present case. The surety contracts to hold all who are or may become interested in tho estate harmless from or by reason of the default of the assignee. Whilst it may be true, as said by the court below, that \u201c neither the plaintiff nor any other creditor of the assignor was a party to it nor had they any knowledge of it or anything to do with it \u201d in the sense that they were not present when the bond was executed and did not give conscious consent to its terms nor approval of the sureties as such, it is, nevertheless, true that they were represented in the act of approval by the court, and by that approval each and every one of them became interested in the bond and had a right to pursue each of the sureties thereto. Although not consciously assenting to the contract of suretyship made when the bond was approved, they accepted it and assented to all that was therein contained, when any of them attempted to pursue the sureties for the default of the assignee. Then, if never before, the mind of any one interested in the estate, whether as a creditor at the time or as one who rendered service subsequently, as did the use plaintiff in the present case, met the mind of the surety, and the contract became in all respects complete. The liability of the surety depended upon a contingency and the right to use the bond for the purpose of securing compensation for Ms services by the plaintiff was also contingent upon the failure of the assignee to make proper compensation for the services to which he was entitled, but, when the contingency happened and the use plaintiff endeavored to use the bond, all the elements of a complete contract were present and the rules which govern in the enforcement of ordmary contracts would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">This being so, we are at a loss to understand why the surety in tMs case, who claimed the benefit of the Act of April 9, 1849, P. L. 533, exempting property to the value of |300 from levy and sale on execution, issued upon any judgment obtained upon contract, and distress for rent, should not be allowed to make good his claim. The court below properly distinguished between the assignee himself and his surety and said: \u201c The assignee could not have claimed the benefit of the exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>tion law, if the execution had been issued against him, although that of itself might not control the question of the right of a surety to do so.\u201d The distinction thus intimated rests upon substantial grounds. The default of the assignee is in the nature of a tort and, if there be bad faith on his part, this of itself would deprive him of the benefits of the exemption act. The surety, however, does not stand in the same relation to creditors of the assigned estate and, although called upon to make good the default of another arising out of a presumable breach of faith, he is not in anywise tainted therewith and should not be visited with any of the penalties which may justly be imposed upon the assignee,.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Reduced to its last analysis, the use plaintiff brings his suit against the surety of the assignee for services rendered in the matter of the assigned estate, after the bond was given. Admit that the services were rendered upon the faith of the bond. If so, the contract was made when the services were rendered and this would be the legal presumption; but, even if there were no conscious acceptance of the appellant\u2019s suretyship at that time, the contract surely became in every sense complete, when he attempted to enforce the provisions of the bond. We are, therefore, of opinion that the appellant was legally entitled to the benefit of the exemption law and the appraisement made by the sheriff, if in other respects regular and unexceptionable, should have been confirmed. The decree of the court below, setting aside the appraisement of personal property set apart for John Dorn, the appellant, is, therefore, reversed and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b560-6\">Orlady, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
