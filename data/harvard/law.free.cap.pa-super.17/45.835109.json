L. Brubaker and the defendant were dealing together in horses, and, in the course of their dealings, a note, dated August 23, 1898, for $55.00, was given by Brubaker to M. Pioso &amp; Sons. This note was for sixty days, and came' due on October 22, 1898. [Brubaker tells you that he had not kept a memorandum of the time of its maturity, and that, as he happened to pass Pioso\u2019s place, he was called in, or went in, and they spoke about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>renew; 1 of this note. He tells you he signed a new note in blank, which was to be filled up for the $55.00, and that Pioso was authorized to get some one to fill it up for that amount, as Pioso himself could not write, and he says he knew that fact;] [5] and Pioso, at the time, called his attention to the danger of signing a note in blank, and he, Pioso, then put on the corner the figures \u201c 55.\u201d This note was actually filled up for $355; is dated October 5,1898; made payable to M. Pioso &amp; Sons, and indorsed by them and Uriah Bitzer, and was purchased by the Lancaster Trust Company. Brubaker also tells you that he never authorized Pioso to fill up the note for $355. Some time after this, he asked for his old note, and Pioso informed him that it was in his other coat; but, shortly after, the note was given by Pioso to him, and is presented here before you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\">In some way or other, Brubaker says, he ascertained that there was a note of $355 in the Lancaster Trust Company, and he thereupon saw Pioso and spoke to him concerning it. He says that Pioso said to him: \u201c Don\u2019t say anything to Bitzer or the boys, I will lift it <em>to-day; </em>\u201d but he did not lift it. He also had a conversation with the Pioso boys the Tuesday before the note came due. He says: \u201c I met Cabe; I said: \u2018 What are you going to do with it?\u2019 He said: \u2018You don\u2019t owe it, and we are going to pay it.\u2019 \u201d It appears that Mr. Davis, counsel for the Piosos, went with Brubaker to the trust company to lift the note on the Saturday preceding the Monday on which the note fell due, but the trust company refused to give it to him, stating that Uriah Bitzer had instructed them not to do so. The note was protested at maturity, and was subsequently lifted by Uriah Bitzer, the indorser. Brubaker says he did not pay the discount on the renewal, nor the stamps, and that Pioso had said to him the discount was only fifty cents and that he would pay it, and Pioso corroborates him in that respect. He signed no other note except the one that was to be filled up for $55.00, he alleges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-6\">The defendant, on his part, admits that there was an original note for $55.00, which became due as has been stated, and that Brubaker came to his (Pioso\u2019s) place concerning the renewal of that note. It is alleged by the defendant that he, at that time, told Brubaker that he wanted $300 for himself, and, af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>ter having said something of the danger of making a note in blank, he put the figures \u201c 355 \u201d on the corner, and not \u201c55,\u201d as has been stated to you by Mr. Brubaker; and that, subsequently, by the defendant\u2019s direction, the note was filled in by his (Pioso\u2019s) daughter for $355, and was negotiated, as has been stated to you. That, of the $355, $300 was to be for Pioso\u2019s use, and $55.00 was to be used in lifting the $55.00 note, and that this was done, and it was agreed that, when the note became due, Pioso was to pay $300 on it, and Brubaker the $55.00. He says Brubaker understood the whole matter, and said that he would sign the note, as Pioso had done lots of favors for him. You will also remember the testimony of Harry White, that he heard Brubaker say something about a receipt for $300 in the beginning of October, 1898; and, also, that of the Pioso boys, that Brubaker came to them before the note became due, and a number of times stated he had signed a note for $355, of which $300 was for their father and $55.00 for himself, and that they then said that, if that were true, they would pay the note, and that, in pursuance of this arrangement, they went to the bank with Mr. Davis, as has been before stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-5\">You have listened attentively to the testimony in this case. You will take it all into consideration in arriving at your verdict. The credibility of all the witnesses is for you. You must determine who is telling the truth. If the defendant\u2019s statement of the understanding between Brubaker and himself is correct, that the note was only filled up for the amount which it was agreed it should be filled up for, in accordance with the figures placed upon the. note in Brubaker\u2019s presence, then the defendant would not be guilty of the crime charged in the indictment. But, if this note was prepared to renew the $55.00 note, and Mr. Brubaker\u2019s statement is correct, that the figures \u201c 55 \u201d were put by Pioso on the corner, and that the writing was to be filled in to correspond to those figures, and that Pioso subsequently changed the figures, or had some one to do it for him, to \u201c 355,\u201d and had the writing of $355 inserted by his daughter in the note, then the defendant would be guilty in manner and form as he stands indicted. Nor would it make any difference that, before the maturity of the note, his counsel went to the bank to lift the note. If a man forges a note, he. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>cannot escape the responsibility for bis crime by subsequently lifting it. The whole question reverts back to the original making of the note and his conduct at that time, and, if he forged the note, and it was discounted, as has been stated, any subsequent actions, when it is discovered, cannot relieve him from the consequences of his act. [Did he, therefore, in violation of his authority, fill in the blank note, or cause it to be filled in, for a larger sum than it was understood it should be filled in for, and change the figures from \u201c 55 \u201d to \u201c 355 \u201d ? If he did, you may find him guilty in manner and form as he stands indicted. If he did not, and his story is correct, your verdict should be one of not guilty.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">The counsel for the defendant has submitted certain points, which it is our duty to read and answer in your presence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\">1. Under the evidence submitted, the verdict should be in favor of the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>This point is refused. The jury must pass upon the guilt or innocence of the defendant. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-7\">2. The witness for the commonwealth, A. L. Brubaker, having testified that he signed the note in blank and did not tell defendant what amount it should be filled to, it was, therefore, not a forgery. <em>Answer: </em>This point is refused. We have already given what we believe to be the law in the case. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-8\">3.

Briefly summarized, they are as follows: Brubaker, being indebted to the defendant, gave him his promissory note for the sum of $55.00. Some time before its maturity, it was proposed to renew it. Brubaker signed a blank note but, before it passed from his possession and into the control of the defendant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>defendant voluntarily placed the figures 55, so as to prevent, as he said, the raising of the note to $355 or $455. With the note in this condition, the defendant was authorized to fill the blanks for the amount indicated in figures. The figure 3 was added before the figures 55, and the note was filled up by the defendant\u2019s daughter for the sum of $355. It was subsequently indorsed by Bitner and the proceeds placed to the credit of the defendant in the Lancaster Trust Company. The court below held that in law the altering of the figures and the filling of the note for the larger sum constituted the crime of forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Twelve specifications of error are presented for our consideration which may be disposed of under six separate propositions, as argued by the appellant:</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">1. It is seriously contended that, assuming the facts as found by the jury, they did not constitute in law the crime of forgery. To substantiate this proposition, it is assumed that the figures in a promissory note or bill of exchange do not constitute a part of the note or bill, and that, therefore, to alter them is not forgery. As authority for this assumption, Commonwealth v. Bailey, 1 Mass. 62, and Commonwealth v. Stevens, 1 Mass. 203, are cited. These cases, however, both related to bank bills, in which it was held that \u201c the number of a bank bill and the figures in its margin marking its amount are not parts of the bill and need not be set out in the indictment.\u201d These cases were quoted approvingly in Commonwealth v. Searle, 2 Binney, 332, in which it was alleged that the ornamental devices upon a bank bill are parts which it is material to set out in an indictment. All that the Supreme Court held in that case was \u201cthat it was not necessary to set forth the ornamental parts of the bill \u2014 the devices or mottoes.\u201d It will scarcely be doubted, however, that, if a counterfeit bill, containing the same number as a genuine were uttered, and the genuine bill, in order to avoid a conflict with the counterfeit, had its number changed or altered, such an alteration would be a forgery. In that case the number would become a material part of the bill. In a very important sense the figures in a promissory note, bill of exchange or check are part of it. They serve to avoid mistakes in the body of the instrument. Whilst it is true and has generally been held that where there is a variance between the amount written in the body and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>amount noted in figures, the written part, in the absence of fraud, will fix the liability of the maker or other party liable therefor, nevertheless the amount in figures, if varying from the amount written in the body of the instrument, serves to put takers upon inquiry. If the note in question had gone to the indorser, with the figures 55 and the words \u201c three hundred and fifty-five \u201d in the body of the note, it can scarcely be conceived, if he is a prudent man, that he would have indorsed the note, without making inquiry of the maker; and so as to the bank purchasing the paper. Such a variance would have raised the inquiry as to which amount was that for which the maker was to be held responsible, and inquiry from him would have at once disclosed the fraud. The case of Rex v. Hart, 32 Eng. C. L. R. 672 (7 Car. &amp; Payne, 652), cited by the court below and the appellant as from 1 Moody, 486, is an entirely pertinent authority. In that case the defendant secured the acceptance of a blank bill of exchange with the figures 200 thereon written, so as to limit thereby the amount to be entered in the body of the bill. These figures were removed by an acid and the figures, as well as the words in the body of the bill, made to read 500. The case was originally tried before Mr. Justice Littledale and Mr. Baron Bolland, but afterwards before a full bench, Lord Denman presiding. The contention of the defendant in that case, as in this, was that, whilst a fraud had been perpetrated, it was not a forgery. The conviction, all the judges concurring, was sustained. The authority of this case, based as it is upon sound reason, has not been shaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">2. The appellant claims, however, that there was not sufficient evidence, even if the facts would in law constitute forgery, to submit the question of the fraudulent alteration to the jury. His argument in support of this proposition is that, inasmuch as it requires the testimony of at least one additional witness, or corroborating facts which amount thereto, to support the testimony of the party interested, to reform an instrument, and that such testimony should be clear, precise and indubitable, the testimony necessary to convict in a criminal case should be at least equal both as to quantity and quality to what is required in civil cases. The answer to this proposition is twofold : (a) The rule does not apply in criminal cases for very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>obvious reasons. The commonwealth is the party interested and the witnesses in her behalf are not supposed to have a personal interest in the sense in which that term is used in civil cases. Motive, bias or prejudice, which may be supposed to influence a witness, are weighed by the jury and enter into their consideration in reaching a conclusion. The testimony of one witness, if believed by the jury, can convict a defendant in such a case as this. (i) As a matter of fact, the testimony in the case fully meets the requirements of the rule. In support of the testimony of the maker of the note is that of the indorser who testifies that the defendant expressly admitted to him that he had raised the note ,\u2022 and, in addition thereto, there is the testimony of the expert in regard to the ink employed, which, if believed, was practically conclusive of the question. The objections to the testimony of Bitner and of the expert, which are raised by other assignments of error, will be disposed of in their proper place. This is all that is necessary to be said upon this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">3. In the fifth specification of error it is alleged that the court misstated the evidence in regard to Brubaker\u2019s call at the office of the defendant, when the original note was renewed. We can see no practical divergence between what was said by the court and what is contained in the testimony of Brubaker. The jury was certainly not misled nor was the defendant in any way injured by what is complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">4. The sixth, seventh and eighth specifications relate to the relations between the defendant and his indorser, who was the prosecutor in this case, the court below sustaining the objections of the commonwealth to testimony relating to the payment of a portion of the proceeds of the note to the indorser and his alleged declarations as to the purpose for which he wished to hold the note after he paid it. This was wholly immaterial. The commonwealth is in no way interested in the fact of the payment to Bitner nor the object which he had in view in paying the note, as indorser, and holding it. The testimony was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">5. Brubaker, the maker of the note, being called by the commonwealth in rebuttal, was asked as to certain conversations which he had with the sons of the defendant in regard to the note and its payment. As explaining his attitude and inquiries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>upon this subject, he was asked whether or not he had heard at the time that the note had been raised from 155.00. This was not hearsay evidence and was not introduced for the purpose of establishing the fact of the alteration, but of showing what was in mind at the time of his conversations with the young men and the inducing cause thereto. The answer, however, was not that he had heard it but that he knew at the time it was altered, so that it was entirely unobjectionable from every point of view.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">6. The tenth, eleventh and twelfth specifications of error relate to the competency of Pyott, a witness called by the commonwealth as an expert in regard to inks. His competency depended upon facts' which were stated by him and which the court deemed sufficient to warrant his testifying as an expert. These facts clearly established his competency. He not only testified that he had been called in court as a witness a number of times in regard to the colors of inks but that he had been practically connected with their use for many years. His own opinion as to his competency as an expert had little to do with the question, although that was not disqualifying, when fairly interpreted. The court was to determine his competency from facts and, in such a case, it is the opinion of the court and not \u25a0that of the witness which governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The testimony in the case justified the verdict of the jury. Nothing was withheld from their consideration and nothing improperly submitted therefor which would have tended to change the result. Upon the facts as found by the jury, the defendant was in law guilty of the crime charged. The specifications of error are all overruled. Judgment affirmed and record remitted to the court below, to the end that its sentence may be carried into effect.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
