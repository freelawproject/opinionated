While that view was rejected <em>sub silentio </em>when this Court ordered the adoption of plans in 1964 and 1972, no opinion of the Court has addressed or decided the question whether the commission and this Court\u2019s authority under art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6 continues despite the partial invalidity, under the United States Constitution, of the apportionment rules set forth in the 1963 Constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nor has the Court definitively considered in any opinion what are \"the constitutional requirements\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The Court\u2019s actions in 1964 and 1972, taken without addressing or definitively considering fundamental questions, are not precedentially binding for it is well-established in this state that \"[a] point thus assumed without consideration is of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>course not decided\u201d. <em>Allen v Duffie, </em>43 Mich 1, 11; 4 NW 427 (1880); <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672, 722; 299 NW2d 304 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Upon receipt, on February 12, 1982, of advice that the commission had failed to agree upon a plan, and the submission by members of the commission to this Court of plans, this Court entered an order establishing a procedure for the filing of plans and requesting briefs and oral argument on the questions (1) whether the authority of the commission and this Court continues despite the invalidity under the United States Constitution of some of the apportionment rules, and (2) if the authority of the commission and this Court continues, what standards govern districting and apportionment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">We summarize our conclusions as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">1. It is this Court\u2019s duty under Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1, providing for the exercise of the judicial power, to determine what are the requirements of this constitution and to define the meaning of those requirements in specific applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">2. The term \"constitutional requirements\u201d means the provisions of art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6 concerning the number and terms of office of senators and representatives, establishing the commission, providing for the decennial districting and apportionment of the Legislature in accordance with apportionment rules there stated and declaring this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Court\u2019s function with regard thereto which are not violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">While the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, as elucidated in <em>Reynolds v Sims, supra, </em>requires equality of population in forming election districts, the term \"constitutional requirements\u201d, as used in art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6, does not refer to the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, the Equal Protection Clause of the Michigan Constitution (Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2), or any other provision of the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">3. The provisions of the second and third paragraphs of art 4, \u00a7 2 and of the second paragraph of art 4, \u00a7 3, establishing weighted land area/population formulae taking into account land area as well as population (thereby apportioning to less populous areas a larger number of senators and representatives than would be apportioned thereto based on population alone), are invalid under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution as elucidated in <em>Reynolds v Sims, </em>and subsequent decisions of the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">4. Standing alone and in the abstract, requirements that county, city and township lines be observed in districting and apportionment, and that election districts be compact, are not violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution as long as the resulting districts do not exceed the \"range of allowable divergence\u201d from the federal goal of equality of population.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">5. It appears from <em>Mahan v Howell, </em>410 US 315; 93 S Ct 979; 35 L Ed 2d 320 (1973), that the range of allowable divergence is at least 16.4%.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>6. The weighted land area/population formulae, invalidated by <em>Reynolds v </em>Sims, <em>supra, </em>and the remaining apportionment rules of art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6, are inextricably interdependent and therefore are not severable. Similarly, the function of the commission, which depends on those rules, and indeed the commission itself, are not severable from the invalidated rules.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">7. It is this Court\u2019s responsibility to provide for the continuity of government by assuring that the people will be provided the opportunity to elect a lawfully apportioned Legislature in the 1982 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">8. The Court directs the drawing of election districts in a manner compliant with federal constitutional requirements consistent with the constitutional history of this state, and the resulting redistricting and apportionment plan shall stand until the Legislature and the Governor or the people provide by law an alternative plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The two questions posed to the parties by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Court and stated above \u2014 severability and standards \u2014 are interrelated. In deciding whether the commission and this Court\u2019s authority under art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6 survive the partial invalidity, under the United States Constitution, of the districting and apportionment rules, the Court is obliged to examine the function of the commission in the wake of <em>Reynolds v Sims. </em>This in turn requires that the Court determine the standards by which the commission was governed before and after <em>Reynolds v Sims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The 1972 opinion of this Court declared, based on its understanding of <em>Reynolds v Sims </em>and subsequent decisions of the United States Supreme Court, that the apportionment plan with the least population differentials from the ideal was the one which most complied with the \"constitutional requirements\u201d of the 1963 Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The Court\u2019s perception of federal constitutional standards would shortly prove to be incorrect.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The following year, in <em>Mahan v Howell, </em>410 US 315; 93 S Ct 979; 35 L Ed 2d 320 (1973), the United States Supreme Court ruled that in state legislative apportionment, the state Legislature, or other body entrusted with the function of reapportioning, may within limits \u2014 the Court approved a maximum deviation of 16.4% \u2014 depart from the goal of population equality in order to achieve other rational, legitimate state goals such as preserving the integrity of political subdivisions of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The 1972 opinion of the Court declared that \"[t]he controlling criterion for judgment in legislative apportionment controversies, involving bicameral state legislatures, under the equal protection clauses of the Federal and state Constitutions is equality of population as nearly as practicable\u201d. <em>In re Apportionment of Legislature</em>\u20141972, <em>387 </em>Mich 442, 453; 197 NW2d 249 (1972). The opinion characterized the statement in <em>Reynolds v Sims, supra, </em>that a state may legitimately desire to maintain the integrity of political subdivisions as dictum. Instead, it relied on the stringent equality of population criterion set forth in <em>Kirkpatrick v Preisler, </em>394 US 526; 89 S Ct 1225; 22 L Ed 2d 519 (1969), where the Court rejected avoidance of fragmenting political subdivisions as a legitimate reason for departing from equality in congressional districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Although the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Reynolds, </em>had noted a difference between congressional and state legislative districting, the 1972 opinion of this Court declined to distinguish <em>Kirkpatrick </em>on that ground, stating that \"[pjrudence would counsel avoidance\u201d of the problem that might be presented by attempting to confine <em>Kirkpatrick </em>to congressional districting. \"In end analysis, mathematical exactitude re equality of population is the primary and controlling standard. As between competing plans with <em>identical </em>'equality of population\u2019 factors, attention may then be focused upon other considerations such as compactness, shape, etc.\u201d <em>In re Apportionment of Legislature</em>\u20141972, <em>supra, </em>456.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The refusal to give credence to what the 1972 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Court called the dictum of <em>Reynolds v Sims </em>can no longer be justified. In <em>Mahan v Howell </em>the United States Supreme Court said that the constitutionality of a state legislative redistricting plan was \"not to be judged by the more stringent standards that <em>Kirkpatrick </em>and <em>Wells [v Rockefeller, </em>394 US 542; 89 S Ct 1234; 22 L Ed 2d 535 (1969)] make applicable to congressional reapportionment, but instead by the equal protection test enunciated in <em>Reynolds v Sims\u201d </em>Referring to its decision in <em>Reynolds, </em>the Court said \"we reaffirm its holding that 'the Equal Protection Clause requires that a State make an honest and good faith effort to construct districts, in both houses of its legislature, as nearly of equal population as is practicable * * * [s]o long as the divergences from a strict population standard are based on legitimate considerations incident to the effectuation of a rational state policy, some deviations from the equal-population principle are constitutionally permissible with respect to the apportionment of seats in either or both of the two houses of a bicameral state legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mahan v Howell, supra, </em>410 US 324-325.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The Court, in <em>Mahan, </em>329, held that the maintenance of the integrity of political subdivision lines of local units of government is a rational state policy. It said that while the resulting 16-odd percent maximum deviation \"may well approach tolerable limits\u201d, the apportionment plan under review had not \"sacrificed substantial equality to justifiable deviations\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The reasoning of the 1972 opinion of this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>has thus been dislodged by the United States Supreme Court. <em>Kirkpatrick </em>and the companion case of <em>Wells, </em>which dealt with congressional districting, do not control state legislative districting.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We reject as clearly wrong the argument that this Court, having relied on its understanding of <em>Kirkpatrick </em>in the 1972 apportionment case, must adhere to that construction in the disposition of this case. The 1972 opinion expressly sought to elucidate and follow the decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Subsequent United States Supreme Court decisions reject the reading adopted by this Court in 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The Equal Protection Clause does not require that the states subordinate altogether a policy of preserving the boundary lines of local units of government to the one person-one vote principle. It can no longer be said that a plan which achieves absolute population equality is necessarily more compliant with the federal constitution than one which takes into account other justifiable state goals. It would be a misconstruction of the Equal Protection Clause for this Court, in the name of <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>to fail to implement a state policy of preserving the boundary lines of local units of government. It is our duty under the Supremacy Clause to fully implement, but not to extend beyond its ambit, the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The 1972 opinion failed to distinguish between the requirements of. the federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">We have considered whether the term \"constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>tional requirements\u201d means (i) provisions of the Michigan Constitution, (ii) only the provisions of art 4, \u00a7\u00a72-6 of the Michigan Constitution, (iii) provisions of the United States Constitution, or (iv) provisions of both constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">We conclude that the term \"constitutional requirements\u201d means the requirements set forth in art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6 of the Michigan Constitution which are not violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The pertinent language of art 4, \u00a7 6 is:</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\"The commission shall proceed to district and apportion the senate and house of representatives according to <em>the provisions of this constitution.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">If a majority of the commission cannot agree on a plan, each member may submit a proposed plan to this Court which \"shall determine which plan complies most accurately with <em>the constitutional requirements\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) and shall direct that the commission adopt it. \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Upon application of any elector filed not later than 60 days after final publication of the plan, this Court may review any final plan adopted by the commission \"and shall remand such plan to the commission for further action if it fails to comply with the <em>requirements of this constitution\u201d. </em>(Emphasis supplied.) \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">The first and third of the foregoing formulations expressly speak of \"this\u201d constitution. The commission is charged under the first formulation with districting and apportioning according to the provisions of the Michigan (\"this\u201d) Constitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>This Court is obligated under the third formulation to remand to the commission if it fails to comply with the requirements of the Michigan (\"this\u201d) Constitution. In that light, it was not intended to require this Court, in deciding which plan most accurately complied with \"the\u201d constitutional requirements, to consider federal as well as state constitutional requirements and then, on petition of an elector under \u00b6 8 of \u00a7 6, to be obliged to remand to the commission for failure to comply with the Michigan (\"this\u201d) Constitution\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">The 1963 Constitution did not contemplate that the commission would district and apportion the Legislature in accordance with the requirements of the United States Constitution and the concept that legislative districts should be equal in population. Rather it contemplated substantial population inequality between the districts resulting from apportionment according to the weighted land area/population formulae set forth in art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We acknowledge that the 1972 opinion offers support in dictum<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> for the argument that the provisions of art 1, \u00a7 2 of the 1963 Constitution are \"constitutional requirements\u201d and that thereby there was incorporated, as a constitutional requirement for the purposes of legislative apportionment, this state\u2019s Equal Protection Clause which elaborates upon the Fourteenth Amendment: \"no person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws; nor shall any person be denied the enjoy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ment of his civil or political rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of religion, race, color, or national origin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Nothing, however, could be clearer than that art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6 provides that senatorial and house districts were not to be equal in population. Land area as well as population was to be taken into consideration. Election district lines were to be drawn along county lines without regard to whether districts more equal in population might be achieved by a different methodology. Considerations of equality and the preservation of other constitutional rights, recognized and articulated in art 1, \u00a7 2 of the 1963 Constitution, were subordinated to the criteria set forth in art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6, insofar as apportionment of the Legislature was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The touchstone of art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6 was discrimination; discrimination in favor of less populated areas against the more populated areas. The Legislature was to be apportioned according to the criteria stated in art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6 without regard to the goals of achieving equality and the avoidance of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">In adopting the 1964 and 1972 plans, this Court erred in proceeding on the premise that the least population differential between legislative districts was the primary \"constitutional requirement\u201d within the meaning of art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6 of the Michigan Constitution. While that is the core concept of <em>Reynolds v Sims, </em>a concept emanating from the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, it is not a requirement of art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The term \"the constitutional requirements\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>means the requirements of art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6 of the 1963 Constitution, which are not violative of the United States Constitution, but does not include the requirements of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">We turn to a consideration of what are the criteria set forth in art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The apportionment factors and rules which take into account land area as well as population, because they produce divergence in population from the goal of equality exceeding the range of allowable divergence under the United States Constitution, can no longer be regarded as effectual constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">The other criteria set forth in the 1963 Constitution are (i) county, township and city boundary lines, (ii) equality in population within a range of 75%-125% of the ideal, (iii) preservation of existing senatorial districts, (iv) contiguity, convenience, compactness, rectangularity, uniformity and squareness.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">The basic building blocks of the apportionment rules are the counties. The Senate and the House are to be organized into contiguous, single-member districts drawn on county lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">House districts, in all counties (those entitled to less than one, to one, or to more than one representative) are to consist of compact and convenient territory contiguous by land..</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">Senate districts in counties entitled to less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>one senator, are to be compact, convenient, and contiguous by land, and as rectangular in shape as possible, preserving existing senatorial districts at the time of reapportionment unless to do so would result in the failure to comply with the other standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In counties entitled to more than one senator or representative, House and Senate districts (i) shall be as nearly equal as possible in population, not less than 75% nor more than 125% of the ideal, <em>and </em>(ii) shall follow city and township boundary lines \"to the extent possible\u201d (for the Senate) and \"where applicable\u201d (for the House), <em>and </em>(iii) shall be composed of compact and contiguous territory as nearly \"uniform\u201d (for the Senate) and \"square\u201d (for the House) in shape \"as possible\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">We are persuaded that all the foregoing criteria, excepting only the 75%-125% range of divergence for population, express rational and legitimate state policies which justify divergence from the federal goal of strict population equality, and which, therefore, can be implemented consistently with the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\"><em>Mahan v Howell </em>holds that following county, township and city boundary lines is a valid justification for divergence from population equality.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">Preservation of the integrity of \"political subdivisions, insofar as possible\u201d and the maintenance of \"compact districts\u201d were said, in <em>Reynolds v Sims </em>to be legitimate state goals.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> While that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>statement was dictum, we conclude that, absent a different statement by the Court, achieving election districts which are as compact as possible is a legitimate state goal. Rectangularity, uniformity and squareness in shape express essentially the same concept and are thus also valid state goals.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">It is implicit in the decisions of the United States Supreme Court that a state may legitimately opt for contiguous rather than floterial districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">An apportioning authority is justified in adopting only that degree of divergence from population equality essential to achieve the state goals. Once achieved, the flexibility is at an end. Accordingly, divergence from the federal goal of population equality is permitted only to the extent necessary to permit achievement of the state goals of observing the boundary lines of local units of government and compactness.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The range of divergence necessary to achieve the state goals shall be determined (i) separately for the state as a whole when apportioning senators and representatives to the counties, (ii) for each county, separately, when apportioning senators and representatives within a county, and (iii) for each city and township entitled to more than one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>senator or representative, separately, when apportioning senators and representatives within a township or city.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">We have considered the \"range of allowable divergence\u201d from the federal goal of population equality. Following the <em>Mahan </em>approval of a divergence of 16.4%, courts generally have concluded that 16.4% is the range of allowable divergence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Analysis of the structure of art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6 and of the record of the Constitutional Convention indicates that there is a hierarchy of the criteria:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">(a) All districts are required to be single-member districts and contiguous; no land may be detached or isolated from the rest of the district except where necessary because of a body of water.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">(b) The organizing principle of the apportionment process, both for the Senate and House, was county lines.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Senators and representatives were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>to be apportioned only to counties with the result that county lines could never be broken.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>(c) In counties entitled to more than one senator or representative, the same principle that was adopted by the people for the allocation of senators and representatives among the counties was adopted for the allocation of senators and representatives within a county. It is stated first that the districts shall follow city or township boundary lines \"to the extent possible\u201d (for the Senate) and \"where applicable\u201d (for the House); and second, that senatorial districts shall be compact, contiguous and as nearly \"uniform\u201d in shape as possible and that representative districts shall be compact and contiguous and as nearly \"square\u201d in shape as possible.__</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>While it is stated that the population of the districts shall be as nearly equal as possible within a 75%-125% range of divergence, that range was adopted so as to provide sufficient leeway to permit the organization of all election districts along city and township boundary lines, thereby indicating that the goal of following city and township boundary lines takes priority over the goal of population equality.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The criteria that city and township boundary lines be followed and that the districts be compact, uniform and square do not conflict. They are rather complementary, and reflect essentially the same concept. Cities are, in general, made up of all or parts of townships which are generally perfect squares. Many cities thus have a certain compactness and uniformity or squareness because they follow former township lines.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We are persuaded that following city and township lines takes prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>dence over compactness in the districting of counties entitled to more than one senator or representative.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">(d) The only criteria stated for cities and townships entitled to more than one legislator are population equality, as nearly as possible within a range of 75%-125% of the ideal, and compactness (uniformity or squareness) to \"the extent possible\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The goals of population equality and compactness may be readily harmonized. The range of 75%-125% was selected to facilitate drawing election district lines on city and township lines, not to facilitate greater compactness.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The goal of compactness seeks to avoid gerrymandering and is not an end in itself. Districting solely to achieve population equality \"may be little more than an open invitation to partisan gerrymandering\u201d. <em>Reynolds v Sims, supra, </em>377 US 578. It is therefore necessary to limit the pursuit of the goal of equality of population to achieve the goal of compactness.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">(e) An election district, circumscribed by a circle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>containing the least land area (excluding land outside of this state or under the Great Lakes) outside of the district, is the most compact.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">At the outset of this opinion, we said that the questions of standards and severability are interrelated. Until we could describe the commission\u2019s function after <em>Reynolds v Sims, </em>we could not decide whether the changes wrought by the United States Supreme Court have so changed the commission that it can no longer properly exercise the power delegated to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Having delineated the standards that govern, it is now necessary to stand back and look at the commission and ask ourselves whether this is the apportionment schema the people voted for?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">A commission guided by standards clearly delineated in advance and which are enforced is a different body than a commission left to its own devices restrained only by federal constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">While the commission could be made to work and the Legislature could, in the application of those rules, be redistricted and reapportioned, those rules necessarily operate differently than they would have if the weighted land area/population formulae were valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Persons living in less populous areas, who had a protected position under those formulae which assured a particular number of seats and an en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>larged voice in the Legislature, no longer have that advantage. To be sure they were denied that advantage by the <em>Reynolds </em>decision, but <em>Reynolds </em>does not require that the remaining apportionment rules be applied without a return to the political process for a decision on how the Legislature shall be apportioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The parties have cited case law concerning the severability of statutes, but art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6 is not a statute. This Court will not apply case law developed in the resolution of controversies concerning statutory invalidity where the issue presented concerns constitutional invalidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Nor is this a case of a single line item of the constitution being held violative of the federal constitution, for example, a provision of the finance article or one of the innumerable specific delegations of executive, legislative or judicial power.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The invalidity here declared goes to the heart of the political process in a constitutional democracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Constitutional democracies historically have not always been organized with separate but equal executive and judicial branches. A constitutional democracy cannot exist, however, without a legislature that represents the people, freely and popularly elected in accordance with a process upon which they have agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The issue here is.power \u2014 political power \u2014 in a constitutional democracy. The Legislature has the ultimate authority to make the laws by which the people are governed. Any change in the means by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>which the members of the Legislature are chosen is a fundamental matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The United States Supreme Court has declared that some aspects of the method chosen by the people of Michigan are violative of the federal constitution. That Court having so declared, the question before us is what is the responsibility of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">No one can say whether the 1963 Constitution would have been adopted without an apportionment commission and the apportionment rules of art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6. Nor can anyone say whether the 1963 Constitution would have been adopted with the apportionment rules which result by reason of the partial invalidity under the federal constitution of the rules adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Nor can anyone predict what the voters would do if presented with the severability question at a general election. Some voters might view with favor an apportionment commission that is governed by neutral principles, known in advance, and which redistricts and reapportions the state in a largely mechanical manner with little opportunity for partisan maneuvering. In many states, the most egregious gerrymandering is practiced by the Legislature with the aid of computers to achieve results which will pass muster under federal standards yet favor the partisan interests of the dominant political faction.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The people may prefer to have the matter returned to the political process or they may prefer plans drawn pursuant to the guidelines which are delineated in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>It is not for this Court to speculate on a matter of such enormous importance. This is a decision which the people should make.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">This Court\u2019s decisions in 1964 and 1972, reapportioning the Legislature by choosing a plan submitted by partisan interests, have lent some legitimacy to an apportionment system of which the people have not wholly approved. If this Court does not invalidate the apportionment provisions of art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6, in their entirety,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> many people may conclude that this Court, in simply making do with a doubtful situation, has lent its imprimatur to the bandaged formulae and that the burden is on those who would seek to have it changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The formulae which this Court has twice implemented are not what the people approved. What they approved they cannot have. And what they have, we cannot approve.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The matter should be returned to the political process in a manner which highlights rather than hides the choices the people should make.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">We have accordingly concluded that the apportionment provisions of art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6, cannot be maintained. When the weighted land area/population apportionment formulae fell, all the apportionment rules fell because they are inextricably related.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">The commission cannot survive without apportionment rules. Article 4 provides only for apportionment according to rules stated in the Michigan Constitution. This Court, under article 4, can only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>order the commission to comply with Michigan constitutional standards. It has no basis for choosing between alternative plans without Michigan constitutional criteria. The notion that the people of this state confided to an apportionment commission without apportionment rules absolute discretion to reapportion the Legislature and thereby reallocate political power in this state limited only by human ingenuity and by no federal constitutional standard that a computer cannot circumvent is unthinkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">We conclude that the apportionment rules are not severable and that the commission therefore also is not severable.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The power to redistrict and reapportion the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Legislature remains with the people. The people, however, can only exercise that power, as a practical matter, by amending the constitution, which, unless the Legislature proposes an amendment acceptable to the people, is a difficult and time-consuming process.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In the meantime, there must be a Legislature and federal constitutional requirements must be observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">It is this Court\u2019s responsibility in deciding the severability question to consider and choose among the alternatives for the continuing governance of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We recognize that the people cannot immediately indicate their preference. This Court must provide for the redistricting and apportionment of the Legislature in compliance with federal constitutional requirements and in a manner most consistent with the constitutional history of this state. The redistricting and apportionment plan resulting from this Court\u2019s determination will stand until the people act, or it is changed by the collective action of the other two branches of this government, composed of persons who are the most immediate representatives of the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Apart from population and land area, we see in the constitutional history of this state dominant commitments to contiguous, single-member districts drawn along the boundary lines of local units of government which, within those limitations, are as compact as feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">We accordingly direct that election districts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>shall be drawn in accordance with the following criteria:</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">(a) Senate and House election district lines shall preserve county lines with the least cost to the federal principle of equality of population between election districts consistent with the maximum preservation of county lines and without exceeding the range of allowable divergence under the federal constitution which, until the United States Supreme Court declares otherwise, shall be deemed to be 16.4% (91.8%-108.2%).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Where it is necessary to break county lines, because otherwise the range of allowable divergence would be exceeded, there shall be shifted the fewest cities or townships necessary to reduce the population divergence sufficiently to bring it within the range of allowable divergence.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Because of the narrowness of the range of allowable divergence, we anticipate that only one plan will organize the counties with the least breaking of county lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">(b) After the county lines are drawn, the election district lines within those counties to which there is apportioned more than one senator or representative shall be drawn on city and township lines with the least cost to the federal principle of equality of population between election districts consistent with the maximum preservation of city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>and township lines and without exceeding the range of allowable divergence.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Where it is necessary to break city or township lines, because otherwise the range of allowable divergence would be exceeded, there shall be shifted the number of people necessary to achieve population equality between the two election districts affected by the shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">(c) Within a city or township to which there is apportioned more than one senator or representative, election district lines shall be drawn to achieve the maximum compactness possible within a population range of 98%-102% of absolute equality between districts within that city or township.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The Court appoints Bernard J.

The clerk of the Court communicated with Mr. Apol; Mr. Apol met with the Court in conference and submitted progress reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The Court responded to Mr. Apol\u2019s inquiries, reiterating criteria set forth in the opinion and expanding on such criteria as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">1. The Senate consists of 38 districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">2. The House consists of 110 districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">3. All districts shall be contiguous, single-member districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">4. The districts shall have a population not exceeding 108.2% and not less than 91.8% of the ideal district which, based on the 1980 census, would contain 243,739 persons in the Senate and 84,201 persons in the House.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">5. The boundaries of the districts shall first be drawn to contain only whole counties to the extent this can be done within the 16.4% range of diver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>gence and to minimize within that range the number of county lines which are broken.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">6. If a county line is broken, the fewest cities or townships necessary to reduce the divergence to within 16.4% shall be shifted; between two cities or townships, both of which will bring the district within the range, the city or township with the least population shall be shifted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">7. Between two plans with the same number of county line breaks, the one that shifts the fewest cities and townships statewide shall be selected; if more than one plan shifts the same number of cities and townships statewide, the plan that shifts the fewest people in the aggregate statewide to election districts that break county lines shall be selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">8. In a county which has more than one senator or representative, the boundaries of the districts shall first be drawn to contain only whole cities and townships to the extent this can be done within the 16.4% range of divergence and to mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>mize within that range the number of city and township lines which are broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">9. If a city or township line is broken, there shall be shifted the number of people necessary to achieve population equality between the two election districts affected by the shift,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> except that in lieu of absolute equality the lines may be drawn along the closest street or comparable boundary; between alternative plans, shifting the necessary number of people, the plan which is more compact is to be selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">10. Between two plans, both of which have the same number of city and township breaks within a particular county, the one which minimizes the population divergence in districts across the county is to be selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">11. Within a city or township which is apportioned more than one senator or representative, election district lines shall be drawn to achieve the maximum compactness possible within a population range of 98%-102% of absolute equality between districts within that city or township.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">12. Compactness shall be determined by circumscribing each district within a circle of minimum radius and measuring the area, not part of the Great Lakes and not part of another state, inside the circle but not inside the district. The plan to be selected is the plan with the least area within all the circles not within the district circumscribed by the circle.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">On April 29, 1982, the Court received a House plan from Mr. Apol; it had received a Senate plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>on April 27. Both plans, and Mr. Apol\u2019s covering memoranda of April 27 and April 29, were released to the public on April 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">On April 30, the Court entered two separate orders directing that hearings be held on May 5, 1982:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u2014a hearing in the morning on the subject matter of the motion for rehearing which had been filed by the Democratic members of the apportionment commission,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u2014a public hearing in the afternoon on the question whether the plans submitted by Mr. Apol adhered to the rules and standards set forth in the Court\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Bills had been introduced in the Legislature providing for redistricting and reapportionment, but the Legislature adjourned on May 4 without agreeing on a bill.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">At the May 5 hearing, on the motion for rehearing, counsel for the Democratic members of the Commission on Legislative Apportionment argued that the criteria set forth in the opinion of the Court for the redistricting and apportionment of Senate and House were erroneous.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Counsel for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the Republican members argued that the criteria were valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">At the afternoon public hearing on May 5, the following persons appeared: Speaker Bobby Crim;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Jerold E.

Defebaugh;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Representative Debbie Stabenow.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The Court received written submissions from Speaker Crim, Senator Faust, Representative Stabenow, Mr. Kleiner, Mr. Weider, and a number of members of the Legislature who did not speak at the public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The Court engaged Ketron, Inc., to prepare computer-based districting plans. The Court received from Ketron preliminary plans for the Senate and the House.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">It appeared on comparison of the Apol and Ketron plans that the Apol plan was in some particulars more compliant with the criteria than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the Ketron plan, while the Ketron plan was more compliant in other particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The Court resolved that the provisions and features which were most compliant with the criteria, whether set forth in the Apol or the Ketron plan, should be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The Apol and Ketron plans were prepared independently.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Ketron plan was prepared mathematically by technicians located in another state who are unfamiliar with either the geography or the political history of this state and provides a measure of protection against the injection, however unintentionally, of subjective judgments by persons who have such knowledge. Having the plans prepared by two separate groups provides further assurance that the district lines will be more compliant with the criteria in light of the tight time span in which Mr. Apol and Ketron have been working.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Mr. Apol and Ketron have cautioned that plans complying more exactingly with the criteria no doubt could be prepared if more time were available.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">On May 13, 1982, the Court promulgated a revised Apol plan and stated that after the May 5, 1982, hearing the Court had</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">\"directed Bernard J. Apol to reconsider the plans submitted by him on April 27 and 29, particularly in light of the comments made at the public hearing on May 5, 1982, and the written materials submitted in lieu of or in support of oral presentations, and upon such reconsideration to recommend to the Court any and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>modifications to the plans submitted by him on April 27 and 29, which he considered would make the said plans more compliant with the rules and standards set forth in the Court\u2019s opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Mr. Apol incorporated into the revised plan modifications based on improvements which appeared upon examination of the Ketron plan, communications from Messrs. Kleiner and Weider and others, and improvements discovered on more complete examination by Mr. Apol. and his staff. The May 13 order further stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\"Several modifications having been recommended by Bernard J. Apol and considered by the Court, he was directed to prepare them in proper form for inclusion by substitution in the plans submitted for approval on April 27 and 29. Having received those modifications in appropriate form on May 12, 1982, it is hereby further ordered (1) that the clerk of this Court shall treat those modifications as \u00e1ny ordinary public record, and make their contents accessible to any and all interested persons; (2) that any and all interested persons may file with the clerk, until 12 noon on May 19, 1982, written arguments (a signed original and 8 copies) attempting to show that the modifications should not be accepted on the ground that they do not cause the plans submitted on April 27 and 29 to be more compliant with the rules and standards set forth in this Court\u2019s opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The Court received on May 19 written communications from various persons which were considered by the Court in conference on May 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The May 13 order further provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">\"After considering all written submissions filed with the clerk pursuant to this order, and in all events by 12 noon on May 21, 1982, this Court will cause to be delivered to the office of the Secretary of State an order directing that he publish as provided by law, and hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the legislative elections for this year in accordance with, the plans submitted to this Court by Bernard J. Apol on April 27 and 29, 1982, as amended by the modifications thereto submitted to this Court by him on May 12, 1982. If the Court is persuaded by submissions filed pursuant to this order that any of the modifications submitted to this Court by Bernard J. Apol on May 12, 1982, should not be implemented, the order to be issued by 12 noon on May 21, 1982, will so indicate.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Pursuant to the foregoing paragraph of the May 13 order the Court has today entered an order directing the Secretary of State to publish and to hold the legislative elections for this year in accordance with the redistricting and reapportionment plans thereby approved and described in the next paragraph:</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\"The plans approved are:</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\"1.

In the Senate, the maximum deviation is in a district 8.13% overrepresented and in a district 8.11% underrepresented for a total maximum deviation of 16.24%. In the House, the maximum deviation is in a district 8.19% overrepresented and in a district 8.15% underrepresented for a total maximum deviation of 16.34%.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">The March 25, 1982, opinion of the Court declared that \"[t]his Court must provide for the redistricting and apportionment of the Legislature in compliance with federal constitutional requirements and in a manner most consistent with the constitutional history of this state\u201d. The Court said that it saw \"in the constitutional history of this state dominant commitments to contiguous, single-member districts drawn along the boundary lines of local units of government which, within those limitations, are as compact as feasible.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>In directing that election district lines be drawn to preserve county, city and township lines within a maximum 16.4% range of divergence, the Court relied on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Mahan v Howell, </em>410 US 315; 93 S Ct 979; 35 L Ed 2d 320 (1973), where that Court had upheld a state legislative apportionment plan which, with a maximum percentage deviation of 16.4%, had departed from the goal of population equality in order to achieve what the Court said was the rational, legitimate state goal of preserving the integrity of political subdivisions of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The motion for rehearing filed by the Democratic members of the Commission on Legislative Apportionment asserts that this Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Mahan v Howell </em>is misplaced because in subsequent decisions, <em>Chapman v Meier, </em>420 US 1; 95 S Ct 751; 42 L Ed 2d 766 (1975), and <em>Connor v Finch, </em>431 US 407; 97 S Ct 1828; 52 L Ed 2d 465 (1977), the United States Supreme Court had limited <em>Mahan </em>to apportionment plans adopted by a state legislature and imposed higher and more restrictive standards for \"court-ordered\u201d plans. It is asserted that the Apol plan is a court-ordered plan subject to the <em>Chapman/Connor </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The motion for rehearing was filed before the Apol plan was released on April 29. During the May 5 oral argument on the motion for rehearing, counsel for the Democratic members of the Commission on Legislative Apportionment argued that <em>Mahan </em>is also distinguishable on the ground that the <em>average </em>percentage deviation under the <em>Mahan </em>plan was +3.89% while the average percent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>age deviation under the Apol plan when so released was +5.20%.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Counsel could not have been expected to have presented, before the March 25 opinion was released, the arguments concerning the applicability of <em>Mahan </em>made in the motion for rehearing and at the oral argument. The arguments require, in our opinion, a response in opinion form.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">It is contended that <em>Chapman </em>and <em>Connor </em>stand for the proposition that all \"court-ordered\u201d reapportionment plans are constitutionally suspect if they produce substantial deviations from population equality absent compelling justification. This reading focuses on the phrase \"court-ordered\u201d plan and goes on to assume that all plans drawn by criteria defined (ordered) by a \"court\u201d or by a person or body designated by a court automatically come within the <em>Chapman/Connor </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Such an assumption fails to take into account the source of the \"court-ordered\u201d plan doctrine and the factual context of <em>Chapman </em>and <em>Connor. </em>When these factors are introduced into the analysis, it appears that <em>Chapman </em>and <em>Connor </em>do not hold that all plans ordered by a court, regardless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>of source, must ordinarily approximate population equality, but rather stand for a narrower set of propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The higher standards announced in <em>Chapman </em>and <em>Connor </em>apply to plans ordered by <em>federal </em>courts to remedy a failure of a state to reapportion in compliance with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. The higher standards do not apply to a \"state-ordered\u201d plan promulgated by state authority pursuant to, or to bring about compliance with, state law. The rule of <em>Mahan </em>applies unmodified by <em>Chapman </em>or <em>Connor </em>to an apportionment plan ordered by a state court to effectuate compliance with state law as well as to a plan adopted by a state legislature or by a state apportionment board or commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"AAA\">When a federal court apportions a state legislature, there is a risk that legitimate state policies will be ignored or misunderstood. To limit encroachment by the federal judiciary on state sovereignty, the United States Supreme Court limited the discretion of the federal courts by requiring greater population equality in federal court-ordered plans. This concern is not present where the court ordering the plan is not a federal court but a state court which has declared and acts to enforce state policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The language and reasoning of the Court in <em>Chapman </em>indicate that by \"court-ordered\u201d plan, the United States Supreme Court means a plan devised by a federal court to implement the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment where, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>because there is no state policy, the federal court would have discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">As the Court explained in <em>Chapman, </em>p 19, \"[w]hen the plan is court ordered, there often is no state policy\u201d. \"Absent particularly pressing features calling for multi-member districts, a <em>United States district </em>court should refrain from imposing them upon a State\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Chapman, </em>by imposing higher standards on a United States district court when it is devising a remedial plan, with a view to confining the discretion of the federal courts where such discretion is not limited by state policy, does not limit the power of a state court to define state policy any more than it limits the power of a legislature or of a state apportionment board or commission to define state policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">In <em>Connor </em>the United States Supreme Court reasoned that federal court-ordered plans were subject to more rigid standards of scrutiny because the federal courts do not have the authority to resolve sensitive questions of state policy:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\"These high standards reflect the unusual position of federal courts as draftsmen of reapportionment plans. We have repeatedly emphasized that 'legislative reapportionment is primarily a matter for legislative consideration and determination,\u2019 <em>Reynolds v Sims, </em>377 US 533, 586; 84 S Ct 1362; 12 L Ed 2d 506 (1964), for a state legislature is the institution that is by far the best situated to identify and then reconcile traditional state policies within the constitutionally mandated framework of substantial population equality. The federal courts possess no distinctive mandate to compromise sometimes conflicting state apportionment policies in the people\u2019s name.\u201d <em>Connor, </em>414-415.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">In <em>Connor, </em>the Court considered whether there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>was sufficient justification for a plan drawn by a United States district court which assertedly had been drawn along the boundary lines of local political subdivisions. The Court ruled that the plan was, on two bases, defective. \"The district court failed here to <em>identify </em>any such 'unique features\u2019 of the Mississippi political structure as would permit a judicial protection of county boundaries in the teeth of the judicial duty to 'achieve the goal of population equality with little more than <em>de minimis </em>variation.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Connor, </em>420. That the \"judicial duty\u201d referred to is the duty of a court, generally a federal court, implementing the Fourteenth Amendment unguided by limitations on its discretion grounded in state policy, becomes clear from the other basis of decision. The Court said that the plaintifFs in that case had \"submitted to the District Court an alternative Senate plan that served the state policy against fragmenting county boundaries better than did the plan the court ultimately adopted, and also came closer to achieving districts that are 'as nearly of equal population as practicable\u2019 \u201d. The Court said \"[i]n the absence of a convincing justification for its continued adherence to a plan that even in state policy terms is less efficacious than another plan actually proposed, there can be no alternative but to set aside the District Court\u2019s decree.\u201d <em>Connor, </em>420-421.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Implicit in the <em>Chapman/Connor </em>rule, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>there are more stringent requirements for so-called \"court-ordered\u201d remedial plans, is that a state-ordered rather than a federal court-ordered plan can be drawn pursuant to criteria different than a federal court could employ in promulgating a plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Although a legislature is ordinarily given the power to reapportion itself, Michigan is among the states that has allocated the power to reapportion the Legislature to a body other than the Legislature. This Court has construed the Michigan Constitution and found within it the authority to declare the policies which should govern state legislative apportionment and to implement them.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In <em>Connor, </em>the United States Supreme Court spoke of the typical case (the legislature has the power to reapportion itself) that federal courts confront when they review state-initiated apportionment plans. There is no reason to suppose that the United States Supreme Court would regard a declaration by a state legislature of apportionment policy as more deserving of deference than a definitive construction by the state\u2019s highest court of the apportionment criteria that must be observed under the state\u2019s constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The Court concluded, in <em>Chapman, </em>with the observation that \"reapportionment is primarily the duty and responsibility of the State through its legislature <em>or other body </em>rather than of a federal court. <em>Reynolds v Sims, </em>377 US 586; <em>Maryland Committee [for Fair Representation] v Tawes, </em>377 US 676; 84 S Ct 1442; 12 L Ed 2d 595 (1964).\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The reference to <em>Maryland Committee v Tawes </em>has particular significance for the instant case because there the other state body was Maryland\u2019s highest court, the Court of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>peals. The United States Supreme Court thus put a state\u2019s highest court on the same level as a state\u2019s legislature for purposes of the so-called \"court-ordered\u201d plan doctrine applicable where a federal court may be proceeding to apportion in the absence of \"state policy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The United States Supreme Court clarified what it meant when it said, in <em>Connor, </em>414-415, that \"a <em>court </em>will be held to stricter standards in accomplishing its task than will a state legislature\u201d in the very next paragraph when it said \"[t]hese high standards reflect the unusual position of <em>federal </em>courts as draftsmen of reapportionment plans\u201d. In the same paragraph it spoke twice again of the federal courts: \"The <em>federal </em>courts by contrast possess no distinctive mandate\u201d, and \"a <em>federal </em>court is left with the unwelcome obligation\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">In <em>Gaffney v Cummings, </em>412 US 735, 751; 93 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Ct 2321; 37 L Ed 2d 298 (1973), the Court said that \"state reapportionment is the task of local legislatures <em>or of those organs of state governments selected to perform it\u201d, </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The use of the shorthand \"court-ordered\u201d plan, <em>Connor, </em>p 417, the failure to say <em>\"federal </em>court-ordered\u201d plan, cannot properly be read as imposing the higher court-ordered plan standard on plans drawn pursuant to state law, albeit law enunciated by a state court rather than a state legislature or apportionment board or commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">It is an axiom of federalism, recognized by the federal courts, that the federal government has no power to override state law unless it conflicts with the federal constitution. This Court\u2019s construction of the Michigan Constitution is state law as much as any legislative enactment or executive decree. Absent infirmity under the federal constitution, this Court\u2019s construction of the Michigan Constitution would be respected by the federal courts. To apply different standards of scrutiny to apportionment plans generated from state law depending on their institutional source would permit the very encroachment on state policy that <em>Connor </em>and <em>Chapman </em>were meant to preclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">In <em>Connor, </em>the United States district court found that Mississippi had violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court\u2019s discretion to mold a remedy was founded upon the need to vindicate a federal constitutional right. This Court\u2019s decision in contrast is grounded upon the Michigan Constitution. It represents a final declaration of state law. The reapportionment plan ordered by this Court has been drawn to comply with the requirements of the Michigan Constitution and not as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>temporary remedial expedient to remedy a failure to conform to the requirements of the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">When this Court decided that the provisions of the Michigan Constitution providing apportionment rules and for an apportionment commission were no longer maintainable, it was faced with the question what law would govern redistricting and apportionment until the people acted \u2014 whether there were any state law requirements or only federal law requirements. The Court concluded that there were state law requirements as well as federal law requirements. In directing that the redistricting and reapportionment be in accordance with the approved criteria, unless the Legislature and the Governor could agree on an alternative plan, the Court manifestly was articulating state law requirements as there are no such federal requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The source of the Court\u2019s authority to provide such requirements is its power to construe the Michigan Constitution. As part of its consideration in the instant case of whether the apportionment rules and the provisions for the apportionment commission are as a matter of Michigan constitutional law severable and survived the partial invalidity under the Fourteenth Amendment of the apportionment rules, the Court considered whether, if those provisions were not severable, a proper construction of the Michigan Constitution empowered this Court to determine how the apportionment and redistricting of the state shall be conducted in the interim before the people act.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">It was the conclusion of this Court that the Michigan Constitution empowers this Court to make such determination. Implicit in the Court\u2019s decision are firstly, that the rule authorizing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>drawing of a plan in accordance with the approved criteria and the rule authorizing the Legislature and the Governor to adopt a superseding plan, were both authorized by the Michigan Constitution; and secondly, whatever the source of those rules, they are requirements of state law rather than federal law. The Court, in the exercise of its art 6, \u00a7 1 judicial power, declared that these are state law requirements which are authorized by the Michigan Constitution.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Assuming that the Court\u2019s remedy seeking to preserve Michigan constitutional requirements is a \"court-ordered\u201d plan within the meaning of <em>Con-nor, </em>it does not follow that the Apol plan is invalid when subjected to more stringent review. In <em>Con-nor, </em>the United States district court had rejected an alternative plan that conformed more closely to the state policy against fragmenting county boundaries and produced less deviation from the ideal of population equality than the plan the district court ultimately adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">On its facts, <em>Connor </em>stands for the proposition that the neutrality of a court-ordered plan and the bona fides of a claim that the plan has been devised to adhere to a policy of observing local boundary lines will be questioned where alternative plans have been submitted to the court that accomplish this policy at less expense to federal interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The United States Supreme Court did not hold in <em>Chapman </em>that the 20% variance in maximum deviation in the plan formulated by the federal court was per se invalid. It held rather that \"a population deviation of that magnitude in a court-ordered plan is constitutionally impermissible <em>in the absence of signi\u00f1cant state policies or other acceptable considerations that require adoption of a plan with so great a varianceChapman, </em>24. (Emphasis supplied.) The Court then proceeded to consider whether there was a policy of maintain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ing local political boundary lines and concluded that the United States district court had erred in finding that North Dakota had such a state policy. The Court concluded that the \"court-ordered plan\u201d before it failed \"to meet the standards established for evaluating variances in plans formulated by state legislatures <em>or other state bodies\u201d. Chapman, </em>26. (Emphasis supplied.) In stating that a court-ordered plan \"must be held to higher standards than a <em>State\u2019s own plan\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied), the Court clearly distinguished between plans ordered by district courts and plans formulated by state legislatures \"or other state bodies\u201d. The Michigan Supreme Court is an \"other state body\u201d within the intendment of that distinction; this Court, in contrast with <em>Chapman, </em>has declared as a matter of state law that there is a state policy of preserving local political boundary lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The holding, in <em>Chapman, </em>was that a plan for the reapportionment of a state legislature, ordered by a court, must \"ordinarily\u201d achieve population equality with little more than <em>de minimis </em>variation, and, if there is more than a <em>de minimis </em>variation, it is the reapportioning court\u2019s responsibility to articulate precisely why a plan with minimum population variations cannot be adopted because of <em>\u2019important and signi\u00f1cant state considerations </em>[which] <em>rationally mandate departure from these standards\u201d. Chapman, </em>27. It is thus clear that even a federal court may depart from population equality to achieve a state goal. The federal court would not then be acting in the exercise of discretion but rather would be guided by the state goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">In conclusion, a plan is a \"state-ordered\u201d plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>for purposes of the <em>Chapman/Connor </em>rule, whether the plan is drawn by a legislature, an apportionment board or commission, or some other person, agent, or body who derives authority under state law, whether that authority is found in the state\u2019s constitution, a statute, or a judicial opinion of a state court. The critical question is whether the plan was drawn to comply with state and federal law requirements, or only with federal law requirements. To the extent that the plan is drawn to comply with state law requirements (as well as the federal law requirements enunciated in <em>Reynolds v Sims), </em>the higher <em>Chapman/Connor </em>standard does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The higher standard for \"court-ordered\u201d plans prescribed by the <em>Chapman/Connor </em>rule applies to the extent that a court-ordered apportionment is not guided or controlled by state policy. Where a court-ordered apportionment is guided or controlled by state policy, the same reviewing standard applies to a court-ordered plan as would apply to a plan drawn by the state legislature or other state body having apportioning authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">A federal court\u2019s determination that there is a state policy will be reviewed by a strict standard; to facilitate such review, it is the reapportioning court\u2019s responsibility to articulate precisely, and, presumably, to support with evidence, its determination that there are important and significant state considerations justifying departure from the higher standards applicable to a federal court-ordered plan drawn unguided by state policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The court-ordered plan doctrine does not, thus, preclude a federal court from ordering a departure from <em>de minimis </em>population variance to achieve a state goal.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The <em>Chapman/Connor </em>rule simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>requires that it be clear that there is such a state goal and that the departure be limited to what is necessary to achieve that goal. The court-ordered plan doctrine does not impose a different standard for court-ordered plans than for plans drawn by a legislature or other state body where there is in fact a legitimate, rational state goal and the plan seeks to achieve such goal at the least cost to the federal principle of equality of population.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The court-ordered plan doctrine imposes higher standards where, although the state has not clearly identified a state goal, a federal court finds that there is a state goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In the instant case, this Court has determined that there is a state goal. It has the authority, although a Fourteenth Amendment claim is involved, to make that determination absent evidence that the Court\u2019s determination is disingenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">No claim is made that this Court\u2019s determination is disingenuous. There clearly is adequate justification for its determination that there is a state policy of preserving political boundary lines.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">There is no evidence of a result impermissible under the federal constitution; it has not been asserted or shown that the result disadvantages minorities.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">At the May 5 hearing on the motion for rehearing, counsel for the Democratic commissioners pointed out that while the range of divergence in <em>Mahan </em>was 16.4%, there were other characteristics of the plan approved in <em>Mahan. </em>The average deviation in the <em>Mahan </em>plan for both houses was +3.89%, the corresponding figure for the revised Apol plan is +5.18%.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">While <em>Mahan </em>could be distinguished on that basis, it does not appear that the United States Supreme Court would distinguish the instant case from <em>Mahan </em>on that basis. No decision of the United States Supreme Court has turned on the average deviation and, therefore, the argument based on the average deviation is without precedential support.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">It appears that the primary concern or criterion emphasized in the decisions of the United States Supreme Court is the range of divergence from absolute equality of the districts with the greatest and least population. Whether that is a correct view of the matter may become clear if the United States Supreme Court issues opinions \u2014 as it has following each decennial census \u2014 enlarging upon the views which have been expressed by the Court in the opinions filed to date. Additional expressions from the Court may not, however, be forthcoming for weeks or even another year or so.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">In <em>Mahan, </em>following its earlier statements in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number><em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Abate,</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the United States Supreme Court, in approving a Virginia legislative districting plan drawn to maintain the integrity of political subdivisions, declared that this was a rational state policy, that \"[i]t can reasonably be said, upon examination of the legislative plan, that it does in fact advance that policy\u201d, that while the \"16-odd percent maximum deviation * * * may well approach tolerable limits, we do not believe it exceeds them\u201d, that Virginia had \"not sacrificed substantial equality to justifiable deviations\u201d and that the population disparities \"result in a <em>maximum </em>percentage deviation that we <em>hold </em>to be within tolerable constitutional limits\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">That language means that the controlling limitation is the \"maximum percentage deviation\u201d. In the March 25 opinion, this Court considered the \"range of allowable divergence\u201d from the federal goal of population equality, noted that following the <em>Mahan </em>approval of a divergence of 16.4% courts generally have concluded that 16.4% is the range of allowable divergence, and, recognizing that the decisions of the United States Supreme Court do not impose an absolute standard, declared that the range of allowable divergence under the federal constitution shall be deemed to be 16.4% (91.8%-108.2%) until the United States Supreme Court declares otherwise.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In adopting 16.4% as the range of allowable divergence, this Court said that \"[a]n apportioning authority is justified in adopting only that degree of divergence from population equality essential to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>achieve the state goals. Once achieved, the flexibility is at an end. Accordingly, divergence from the federal goal of population equality is permitted only to the extent necessary to permit achievement of the state goals of observing the boundary lines of local units of government and compactness.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">A corollary to the concept that \"an apportioning authority is justified in adopting only that degree of divergence from population equality essential to achieve the state goals\u201d is the concept that an apportioning authority may or must, to achieve the state goals, adopt that degree of divergence from population equality essential to achieve them.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The state goals identified in the March 25 opinion are rooted. in the constitution of this state. This Court directed that they be achieved to the maximum extent possible consistent with federal constitutional limitations. Since it was the Court\u2019s best judgment that the controlling criterion was the \"maximum percentage deviation\u201d, it directed that, until the United States Supreme Court declares otherwise, the maximum percentage deviation in <em>Mahan </em>(for a districting and apportionment plan drawn along the boundary lines of political subdivisions) would be deemed applicable to the districting and apportionment of the Michigan Legislature in the application of a similar criterion of following county, city, and township boundary lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">When this Court directed that the boundary lines be drawn to maximize the achievement of those state goals within the federal limitation it did not know what the average deviation would be. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Now that the plan has been prepared, it appears that the average deviation is greater for the Michigan plan than for the Virginia plan. This may be a consequence of the greater rigidity of the Michigan criteria which require that first county lines be drawn and only then (in the larger counties having more than one senator or representative) may the city and township lines be drawn. It appears that the Virginia plan was drawn along both county and city lines without seeking to maximize the preservation first of county lines. The effort to achieve the maximum adherence to the Michigan goals of preserving the boundary lines first of counties and second of cities and townships does tend to produce concentrations of population at both ends of the 16.4% range of divergence and a higher average range of deviation than the Virginia plan. This is a result of the adherence to the state goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The United States Supreme Court, having stated that preservation of political subdivision boundary lines is a rational state goal, would no doubt expect that states having such goals would seek to achieve them to the maximum extent possible consistent with federal constitutional limitations. To merely point out that the consequence of pursuit of those state goals is to bring about a higher average deviation is not to state a reason for departing from the state goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">For the United States Supreme Court to hold that average deviation is a limitation would be to add a limitation not expressed in <em>Mahan </em>on the legitimate pursuit of a rational state goal. There is no reason to anticipate that the United States Supreme Court will impose such a further limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>tion on pursuit of the state goal of preserving the boundary lines of local units of government.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">If the Court does impose such an additional limitation, it would allow the states adequate time to conform their plans to these new limitations as it would understand that, absent such a statement from the United States Supreme Court, the states would seek to maximize achievement of the state goal within the criterion that had been articulated by the Court in the body of the <em>Mahan </em>opinion. To state it differently, the United States Supreme Court would not expect that plans would be drawn in the application of limitations drawn from a description of other features of the Virginia plan which the court did not treat as determinative in <em>Mahan, </em>and if the Court were to elevate such other factors to constitutional importance it would provide adequate time to make required changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">We appreciate that the opinions of the United States Supreme Court do frequently mention average deviation as well as maximum deviation. We think that the Court might become concerned with average deviation if the plan were drawn without adherence to the kind of rigid constitutionally rooted state criteria of the kind required to be followed in the instant case. Clusters of population at extreme limits of the range of divergence might indicate a purposeful gerrymander to achieve some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>impermissible goal, to the advantage of one part of the body politic over another. Where the plan has been drawn either by a state legislature or a judge or a group of judges, in the exercise of a broad ranging discretion, the United States Supreme Court might require narrower margins of average deviation to protect against abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The criteria adopted by this Court, however, are intended to leave little room for the exercise of discretion. The population cluster at the outer limits of the 16.4% range of divergence is not the result of the exercise of discretion, it does not reflect a purpose to give advantage to one group over another, but rather is simply the consequence of the Court\u2019s adherence with a high degree of faithfulness to what it perceives to be the requirements of Michigan Constitutions regarding the exercise of the power to reapportion and redistrict legislative seats. In a case such as this where it cannot be asserted that the cluster at the outer limits of the range of divergence is the result of anything operating other than adherence to the state goal, average deviation is not a determinative factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In <em>Mahan, </em>the Court, in its description of the plan there before the Court, mentioned <em>average </em>percentage variance and also the minimum population percentage necessary to elect a majority and also the number of districts within 4% of perfection, 6%, and other like descriptive information.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">In its analysis of earlier decisions and generally, however, the Court spoke only of the <em>maximum </em>percentage deviation. It referred to the congressio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>nal reapportionment cases of <em>Kirkpatrick</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and Wells<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and the <em>maximum </em>percentage deviation in those cases. It also referred to the <em>maximum </em>percentage deviation in the state legislative apportionment case of <em>Swann v </em>Adams<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and the county apportionment case of <em>Abate v Mundt. </em>It spoke of the \"16-odd percent <em>maximum </em>deviation\u201d in <em>Mahan </em>itself. It concluded that \"[t]he population disparities that are permitted thereunder result in a <em>maximum </em>percentage deviation that we <em>hold </em>to be within tolerable constitutional limits\u201d (emphasis supplied). The dissenting opinion referred to the number of persons in districts in which the population deviation from the ideal was more than 5% and more than 3%. But none of the reasoning of the majority includes any consideration of average or median deviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In <em>Mahan, </em>the district court had modified the legislative plan, reducing the variance to slightly over 10%. The district court had divided the population of one county to the point where the Court could say that \"[t]he opportunity of its voters to champion local legislation relating to Scott County is virtually nil. The countervailing benefit resulting from the court\u2019s readjustment is the fact that the first district\u2019s deviation from the ideal is now reduced to 1.8%.\u201d Of another change ordered by the district court, the Court said that \"[i]n terms of practical politics, Virginia Beach complains that such representation is no representation at all so far as local legislation is concerned\u201d and that the people transferred to reduce the deviation \"have in that respect been effectively disenfranchised\u201d, p <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>324. It comes through quite clearly from a reading of the Court\u2019s opinion that the Court associated itself with those arguments, and that it found them persuasive in holding that the district court had erred in modifying the legislative plan to achieve a reduction in the deviation from 16-odd% to 10%.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In <em>Chapman, </em>the Court spoke only of the maximum range of deviation and did not mention in its description of the plan, let alone in the argument, the average or median deviation. The Court, without referring to average or median deviation, said that in <em>Gaffney </em>it had \"permitted a deviation of 7.83% with no showing of invidious discrimination. In <em>White v Regester </em>[412 US 755; 93 S Ct 2332; 37 L Ed 2d 314 (1973)], a variation of 9.9% was likewise permitted.\u201d The percentage deviations referred to were maximum percentage deviations.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The Court, in <em>Chapman, </em>p 24, spoke of the maximum deviation as <em>\"this measure </em>of acceptable deviation from population equality\u201d (emphasis supplied) stating that it had been \"developed in cases that concerned apportionment plans enacted by state legislatures\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In sum, median or average deviation has not been regarded by the United States Supreme Court as a relevant criterion where the deviation is justified by showing a state policy and adherence to that policy.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Where the deviation is justi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>fied on state policy grounds, a maximum deviation of 16.4% is permissible without regard to the median or average deviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">It is asserted that the Court has misstated Michigan history because Michigan has not used counties as the basic building blocks for legislative apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">While Michigan does indeed have a history of population-based apportionment, that principle has been expressed in Michigan Constitutions together with the principle that county, city and township lines should be followed in the design of election districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">No Michigan Constitution has provided for the allocation of legislative seats on a <em>purely </em>population basis. No Michigan Constitution has permitted the breaking of a single county line.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> One can of course disagree regarding the apportionment principles that should be extracted from this history and their relative merit, but one cannot deny that throughout its history Michigan has remained firmly committed to avoiding the fragmentation of county lines and, more recently, when the population of some counties reached the point where more than one legislator was apportioned to some counties, avoiding the fragmentation of city and township lines._</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>It is not asserted that there is not this textual historical commitment; the Court\u2019s decision is challenged because it reflects a theory of \"political unit or boundary representation\u201d. It is contended that such a theory finds no warrant in Michigan history and has been disparaged by federal decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">This contention mischaracterizes the Court\u2019s decision and the view that it has taken of the historical record. Concededly, Michigan does not have and never has opted for apportionment of the Legislature on a \"political unit\u201d basis. But to say that Michigan has not opted for \"political unit\u201d representation is not to say that it has not recognized the importance of political unit boundary lines and has not followed them in the drawing of election districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Michigan has a consistent constitutional history of combining less populous counties and subdividing populous counties to form election districts. As a result, county lines have remained inviolate. The reason for following county lines was not the \"political unit\u201d theory of representation but rather that each Michigan Constitution has required preservation of the electoral autonomy of the counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The argument confuses the political unit basis with drawing lines to preserve the autonomy of local political subdivisions. The United States Senate is organized on a political unit basis \u2014 every state receives the same number of senators as every other state without regard to population. The United States House of Representatives is apportioned on a population basis; although not organized on a political unit basis, the boundary lines of the states are nevertheless preserved \u2014 no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>state line is broken. No representative to Congress represents people living in two separate states.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">It is asserted that the Court did not provide the parties an opportunity to discuss what the proper remedy would be should the Court decide that Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6 were not severable and that this constitutes a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">On February 24, 1982, the Court indicated in an order addressed to the parties that it might conclude that the federal invalidation of the weighted land area/population formulae of the 1963 Constitution terminated the authority of the apportionment commission. Both parties chose to argue that the apportionment commission survived the invalidation of the formulae. Neither took the opportunity to express a view as to what the Court should provide if it concluded that the commission did not survive.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">One might argue that the Court asked only about the commission\u2019s survival and not about what would happen in the event the commission did not survive. This, however, would be to confine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the boundaries of the question posed in an artificial and narrow manner. The question of remedy follows so closely upon the question of the commission\u2019s survival that it is, in fact, virtually the same question.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In all events the Court has provided the parties with an opportunity for oral argument and has carefully considered the arguments advanced both in the motion for rehearing and at the hearing, and this opinion responds thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">It was contended, at the public hearing, that the Apol plan is defective because Wayne County is entitled to 9.591 senators and should, therefore, have been apportioned 10 senators.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Wayne could, within the population variance limits of 91.8%-108.2%, be allocated either 9 or 10 senators without breaking its boundaries. If 9 senators are apportioned to Wayne, the average Wayne district is 106.5% of the statewide ideal; if 10 senators are apportioned to Wayne, the average Wayne district is 95.9% of the statewide ideal.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Similarly, in the House, Wayne County can be apportioned between 26 and 30 representatives. If 26 representatives are apportioned to Wayne County, the average Wayne County district is 106.7% of the statewide ideal; if 30 representatives are apportioned to Wayne County, the average Wayne County district is 92.5% of the statewide ideal. Oakland County (immediately north of Wayne County) presents the same problem in the House, because either 12 or 13 representatives can be apportioned to Oakland County. If 12 represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>tatives are apportioned to Oakland County, the average Oakland County district is 100.1% of the statewide ideal; if 13 representatives are apportioned to Oakland, the average Oakland district is 92.4% of the statewide ideal.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The criteria approved by the Court do not address this apportionment question directly, but leave it to be decided implicitly by the other criteria. Whether Wayne County is apportioned 9 or 10 senators is determined by identifying the one Senate plan that breaks the fewest county lines statewide, or shifts the fewest cities or townships statewide, or shifts the fewest people statewide.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Wayne County is apportioned 9 senators in both the Apol and Ketron Senate plans. Although Mr. Apol was able to discover a Senate plan that apportioned 10 senators to Wayne and broke 4 county lines (the same number of county line breaks as in Mr. Apol\u2019s April 27 plan), that 10-senator plan was not the best plan because it required a shift of 9 cities or townships statewide, while Mr. Apol\u2019s April 27 plan, which apportioned Wayne 9 senators, required a shift of only 7 cities or townships statewide.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">In the House, both Mr. Apol and Ketron, Inc., working independently, generated House plans that broke 10 county lines, and both plans apportioned Wayne 29-1/2 representatives (the additional population to complete the 30th district in both plans was drawn from Monroe County) and apportioned Oakland 12 representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">In light of the political importance of this apportionment decision, consideration was given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>whether there is another, direct method of fairly resolving the apportionment question first; only after the apportionment question had been resolved would the search begin for the plan with the minimum number of county line breaks statewide.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The framers of the 1963 Constitution considered a similar problem, the precise number of legislators to whom the larger counties as a group and the smaller counties as a group are, in the application of the constitution\u2019s apportionment rules, fairly entitled. Although this Court has held that those apportionment rules do not survive the invalidity under the Fourteenth Amendment of the weighted land area/population formulae, the constitution does suggest a method for resolving the apportionment question.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">For the Senate, the constitution provided in art 4, \u00a7 2, that counties with 13 or more apportionment factors shall be entitled as a class to senators in the proportion that the total apportionment factors of such counties bear to the total apportionment factors of the state, \"computed to the nearest whole number\u201d. There were a total of 500 apportionment factors to be allocated to all the counties, 400 on the basis of county population and 100 on the basis of county land area.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The significance of the number 13 becomes clear if one multiplies it by 38 (the number of senators to be allocated). The result is 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The constitution thus provided that in determining the apportionment of senators between the counties, the counties shall be divided into two classes \u2014 those entitled to one or more senators and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>those entitled to less than one senator. It was recognized that in such a situation it would be necessary to decide whether the more populous or less populous counties, and which county among them, would be entitled to the odd senator. The constitution provided a simple and fair means of resolving that question, which is based in part on the \"method of equal proportions\u201d used in the decennial apportionment of congressmen among the states.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> If the nearest whole number gave it to the large counties, so be it; and if it gave it to the smaller counties, so be it.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Applying this formula (and, by dividing all the numbers by five,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> eliminating the weighted land area/population formulae), it appears that Wayne County was not entitled to a tenth senator:</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Number of Senators</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Number of Senators to Assigned in the April 27 Which Entitled Based and in the Revised</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">County on Population_ Apol Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Wayne 9.591 9</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Oakland 4.151 4</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">Macomb 2.849 3</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">Kent 1.823 2</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">Genesee 1.848 2</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">Ingham 1.130 1</p>\n<p id=\"b286-15\">Washtenaw 1.086 1</p>\n<p id=\"b286-16\">22.478 22</p>\n<p id=\"b286-17\">The constitution provided a different method of apportionment in the House, but that method cannot be applied after the invalidation of the weighted land area/population formulae.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>It would, however, be possible to apply the Senate apportionment method in both houses. In the Senate, Wayne County would be entitled to 9 senators. In the House, Wayne County would be entitled to 28 (not 29-1/2) representatives and Oakland County would be entitled to 12 (it was apportioned 12).<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The flaw in this method is that it artificially divides the counties into two groups, treating one group differently than another, thereby possibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>generating results at least as questionable as those generated by the method the Court had adopted in and pursuant to the March 25 opinion. For example, in the Senate, Kalamazoo County is entitled to 0.8713 senators. Because Kalamazoo County is entitled to less than one senator, it would be grouped with all the other counties entitled to less than one senator. Kalamazoo County\u2019s ultimate fate \u2014 whether Kalamazoo County residents will be slightly underrepresented or slightly overrepresented \u2014 will be decided by the indirect method of choosing the one plan that breaks the fewest county lines statewide, or shifts the fewest cities or townships statewide, or shifts the least population statewide. For the same reasons that Wayne County residents regard as crucial the decision whether Wayne County is apportioned 9 senators, making each Wayne County district slightly underrepresented, or 10 senators, making each Wayne County district slightly overrepresented, Kalamazoo County residents regard as crucial the size and character of the district they are ultimately placed in.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">While Kalamazoo County\u2019s representation is indeterminate, this method would guarantee to Genesee County, which is entitled to 1.848 senators, two full senators. Such a two-tier method of apportionment would be unjust. If Genesee County, at 1.848, is \"entitled\u201d to a second senator, why is Kalamazoo County, at 0.8713, not \"more entitled\u201d to a <em>\u00f1rst </em>senator?</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">It is no answer to say that the federal constitution does not permit the allocation to Kalamazoo County of a full senator. The Kalamazoo County line could be broken in such a way as to shift the necessary number of people from an adjacent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>county to bring the Kalamazoo County district just within the 91.8%-108.2% range. The Michigan rule of following county lines to the fullest extent this is possible statewide consistent with federal limitations would then have to yield to such a concept of justice and \"entitlement\u201d in the apportionment of legislators. The historical practice of following county lines never rose to the level of a principle of justice; it has always been simply a device for controlling gerrymandering, facilitating elections and preserving communities of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Once the rule of following county boundary lines yielded to the principle of \"entitlement\u201d, the Court could not pretend to have a neutral and objective set of guidelines. Subjective decisions would have to be made concerning which counties are most \"entitled\u201d to be overrepresented, and more subjective decisions would have to be made regarding how such an \"entitled\u201d county\u2019s preferential county line break should be accomplished.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The Court\u2019s adopted method of apportionment\u2014 indirect apportionment by minimizing the number of county line breaks statewide \u2014 yields admittedly arbitrary results. That is also, however, its principal virtue: it provides an objective and neutral resolution to an intractable problem. Perhaps the Court would not implement the results of this method if it had produced a different result \u2014 for example, if Wayne County were underrepresented in both houses \u2014 but given the actual result, with Wayne County overrepresented in one house and underrepresented in the other, the Court imple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ments the results of this admittedly imperfect method.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">At the public hearing and in written submissions it has been urged that the Court should amend the criteria to include the concepts of \"political fairness\u201d and preservation of existing legislative districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">There are many concepts of political fairness: partisan political fairness, racial political fairness, ethnic political fairness, sexual political fairness, and, for persons interested in particular issues, issue political fairness. Implicit in the decision of the Court and its failure to amend the criteria is its decision that the Michigan Constitution and state law does not comprehend the criterion of political fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">While continuity of representation is indeed a value, it is a value which finds expression in. the concept of preserving the autonomy of local political subdivisions. If preservation of existing political subdivisions had been more assiduously pursued in the 1972 legislative apportionment, there would, in the 1982 legislative apportionment, have been perforce greater preservation of existing legislative districts. It is again relevant that the 1972 apportionment, before <em>Mahan </em>was decided, was based on a mistaken reading of the reach of <em>Reynolds v Sims.</em><footnotemark><em>53</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">While the 1963 Constitution provides for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>preservation of existing Senate districts in the less populous parts of the state (where counties are combined to form a district),<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> it does not contain a like requirement for the more populous counties and contains no such requirement for the House, thereby implicitly rejecting preservation of existing districts as a factor for Senate districts in counties entitled to one or more senators and for all House districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The Court has retained jurisdiction with a view to ordering such changes in the plan as may be required to overcome errors or omissions and to provide for an orderly election and to make any changes required to comply with a superseding opinion.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Appendix A</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">County, City and Township Line Breaks</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">Senate</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\n<em>County Line Breaks</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">District 11</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The following one township of Washtenaw County was moved to create a district.

Two of the four justices who signed the 1972 opinion of the Court comprised part of the 1964 majority which had ordered the adoption of the 1964 apportionment plan and thus had, in a sense, already committed themselves on those issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b207-15\"> See Part II, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b208-10\"> The Court\u2019s order of February 24, 1982, establishing a procedure for the filing of further plans and scheduling briefing thereon, directed that briefs be separately and earlier filed on the following questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">\"a.

All that the federal court could properly hold was that the concept of this apportionment commission was not violative of the federal constitution. The question whether provisions of the Michigan Constitution are severable cannot be foreclosed by a decision of a federal court, even though affirmed by the United States Supreme Court, because the Michigan Supreme Court has the ultimate responsibility for determining a question of state law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b211-8\"> The following is a summary of decisions of the United States Supreme Court on apportionment:</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">In <em>Baker v Carr, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court considered a claim that the Tennessee legislature was unconstitutionally malapportioned. It had theretofore been thought that such a claim involved a \"political question\u201d and was not justiciable. The Court distinguished prior \"political question\u201d cases as involving claims arising under the provision of the United States Constitution guaranteeing every state a republican form of government. Because this action was brought under the Equal Protection Clause, the Court held that policy considerations pertinent to the Guaranty Clause were not involved and remanded the cause for further proceedings in the application of equal protection standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">After the adoption by the people of the 1963 Constitution, the United States Supreme Court held that Georgia\u2019s congressional districting was unconstitutional because it was violative of the provision of the United States Constitution requiring that the members of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>House of Representatives be chosen \"by the people\u201d. The Court ruled that \"as nearly as is practicable one man\u2019s vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as another\u2019s\u201d. <em>Wesberry v Sanders, </em>376 US 1, 7-8; 84 S Ct 526; 11 L Ed 2d 481 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"A3k\">In the landmark case of <em>Reynolds v Sims, </em>377 US 533; 84 S Ct 1362; 12 L Ed 2d 506 (1964), the United States Supreme Court, on June 15, 1964, invalidated Alabama\u2019s legislative apportionment. The Court held that the Equal Protection Clause requires that both houses of a bicameral state legislature be apportioned on a population basis, although some deviations would be permitted if based on legitimate considerations incident to the effectuation of a rational state policy.</p>\n<p id=\"A9B\">Five years later, in invalidating the Missouri congressional apportionment, the Court declared that \"the 'as nearly as practicable\u2019 standard requires that the State make a good-faith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality. See <em>Reynolds v Sims\u201d. Kirkpatrick v Preisler, </em>394 US 526, 530-531; 89 S Ct 1225; 22 L Ed 2d 519 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"AH8-\">In <em>Mahan v Howell, </em>410 US 315; 93 S Ct 979; 35 L Ed 2d 320 (1973), the Court, in upholding Virginia\u2019s reapportionment plan, drew a distinction between congressional and state legislative apportionment.

In speaking about the Senate plan, the majority report said,</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\"The plan * * * bases representation 80 per cent on population and 20 per cent on area. This is achieved by calculating the percentage of the state\u2019s population living in each county, multiplying the number by 4, and adding the percentage of the total area in the county to that figure. The resulting figure is the county\u2019s apportionment factor, and <em>the county unit becomes the major building block in creating senate districts.\u201d </em>2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 2036.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Insofar as the House plan was concerned, the majority report said:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">\u201cAll house districts will follow county boundary lines. This is recommended in order to assure citizens clearly identifiable and traditionally recognized voting districts, and to conform to the long established county organization patterns of many groups, including the political parties. Many states follow county lines in districting, and the weight of testimony heard by the committee overwhelmingly favored continuing this practice in Michigan.\u201d 2 Official Record, p 2036.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">The paramount importance of the county line principle was also discussed at length by delegate Dehnke, himself a member of the Committee on Legislative Organization, when he took the floor to defend the majority report.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">\u201cNow it has been recognized \u2014 it became clear early in our proceedings before the committee \u2014 that the delegates from both sides were agreed that it would not be advisable to permit the cutting of counties in forming legislative districts in either house. Practical considerations convinced both groups that this would not be advisable and should not be done if it could possibly be avoided. Counties, of course, are not sovereign entities. I don\u2019t know of anyone who claimed that they were. But, historically, our counties have been formed for the convenience of the state, to facilitate the administration of government. They may be said to be the agents of the state, as a convenient unit for the administration of state laws and the maintenance of law and order; for judicial administration, for welfare administration, for keeping records of deeds, probates and so on. * * * Nothing is more proved, however, than that the integrity of the counties was considered of more importance than the equality of population.\u201d 2 Official Record, p 2099.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">When comments such as these are taken into account, there can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>little room to doubt that the integrity of county lines was a principle of prime importance to the framers of the 1963 Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"AOH\">The primacy under the 1963 Constitution of the county-line requirement is such that it takes precedence over the other criteria of preserving city and township lines (in those few instances where they cross county lines), compactness, uniformity and squareness.</p>\n<p id=\"ABZ\">Counties entitled to less than one senator or representative are required to be combined into election districts in accordance with the only criteria stated in \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 for the organization of the less populous counties: (i) as to the Senate, compactness, convenience, contiguity, rectangularity and preservation of existing senatorial districts; and (ii) as to the House, compactness, convenience, and contiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"AeC\">In the organization of these less populous counties, the first and controlling criterion is, again, that no county line shall be broken unless required in order to comply with the federal constitutional limitation regarding the range of allowable divergence. If without violating that limitation it were possible to organize the counties in more than one way, the controlling criteria, in order of importance, would be (i) observance of existing senatorial districts at the time of apportionment (it appears that preservation of existing senatorial districts was regarded as having a higher priority than compactness, see the comments of Professor James K. Pollock, a delegate to the Constitutional Convention, 2 Official Record, pp 2092-2093), and (ii). rectangularity:</p>\n<p id=\"Acn\">(i) It may not be possible to observe existing senatorial districts because the invalidation of the weighted land area/population formulae may have so reduced the number of seats allocated to the less populous areas that this criterion cannot be implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"A4_\">(ii) The terms, compactness, convenience, contiguity and rectangularity, appear to be complementary, expressive of the same concept. See fn 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b227-6\"> This rationale was stated by delegate W. F. Hanna, a member of the Committee on Legislative Organization, on the convention floor:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\"[I]n our committee, those of us who worked diligently on attempting to draw maps, being as fair as we know how in counties like Wayne, Oakland, Muskegon, or any of them, whether you apply it to the senatorial districts or the house, if you wish to stay within city-township boundaries, we found that the 75-125 was a practical limitation, and this was substantiated by the testimony of election officials and other research. Now I submit to you that once you get them as nearly equal as possible you then only have to put a floor or a bottom before you start breaking city or township lines.\u201d 2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 2115.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The provisions of the 1963 Constitution requiring that election districts be organized along county, city and township lines to the extent possible (i) enable voters living in a particular community to combine their votes more effectively to elect a representative from that area, (ii) facilitate the conduct of the election by reducing the number of precincts and special ballots, (iii) tend to preserve existing political party organizations, and (iv) limit the potential for gerrymandering.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\"> Noteworthy is that the requirement that city and township lines be followed is not qualified by \"to the extent possible\u201d in the rules for districting the House.

His charge, however, was to exercise the state apportioning authority in compliance with the criteria found in this state\u2019s constitution.

Such a plan would necessitate the modification of the criteria in just one respect, the allowable population divergence. The Court had ample time to adopt an impartial plan which would not exalt district representation over people representation. 6</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Acting under its equitable judicial power,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Court established in its opinion of March 25 the following primary criteria:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\"Senate and House election district lines shall preserve county lines with the least cost to the federal principle of equality of population between election districts consistent with the maximum preservation of county lines and without exceeding the range of allowable divergence under the federal constitution which, until the United States Supreme Court declares otherwise, shall be deemed to be 16.4% (91.8%-108.2%).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\"Where it is necessary to break county lines, because otherwise the range of allowable divergence would be exceeded, there shall be shifted the fewest <em>cities or </em>townships necessary to reduce the population divergence sufficiently to bring it within the range of allowable divergence.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\"Because of the narrowness of the range of allowable divergence, we anticipate that only one plan will organize the counties with the least breaking of county lines.\u201d (Italicized language added after March 25.) <em>Ante, </em>p 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The allowable population divergence of 16.4% (+8.2%) was lifted from <em>Mahan v Howell, </em>410 US 315; 93 S Ct 979; 35 L Ed 2d 320 (1973). <em>Mahan </em>held that a plan for the Virginia House of Delegates which included an extreme allowable total deviation of 16.4% (+6.8%, \u20149.6%) was not unconstitutional. Written in the abstract, prima facie, such a deviation may be equitably and constitutionally acceptable. However, upon application in this state and in this case, the anticipated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>extreme divergence became commonplace. The perceived exception virtually became the norm.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">A factual analysis of the Court\u2019s plan reveals a devastating impact upon the principle of population equality. Application of the allowable population deviation in the Court\u2019s plan results in substantial dilution or enhancement of votes in many districts throughout the state. An allowable deviation of 16.4% as applied to Michigan Senate districts which have an ideal population of 243,739 is +19,987 persons (+8.2%). This amounts to a total potential deviation from the average of almost 40,000 persons among Senate districts. The 16.4% deviation as applied to Michigan House districts with an ideal population of 84,201 is +6,904. This results in a potential variance of almost 14,000 persons among House districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Under the plan drawn and now approved by the Court, the total deviation between the largest and smallest Senate districts is 39,626 persons (16.26%). The largest district in terms of population, <em>i.e., </em>where each vote is worth the least, has a deviation exceeding the ideal by 19,788 (+8.12%); the smallest, <em>i.e., </em>where each vote is worth the most, is 19,838 persons ( \u2014 8.14%) less than the ideal. A similar result is reflected in the House plan. The most populous district has a deviation of 6,870 (+8.16%); the smallest is 6,904 persons ( \u2014 8.2%) under the ideal-sized House district. The total maximum population deviation is 13,774 (16.36%).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">It becomes difficult to swallow the conclusion that a difference between Senate districts of 39,626 persons and House districts of 13,774 persons is equitable and does not impair the principle of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>equal representation. Yet, if these results truly were the exception and only occurred in the rare occasion, perhaps they would be equitably and constitutionally digestible.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">What is of special significance, however, is that a great number of districts have a substantial population deviation from the ideal-sized district and fall near the extremes of the allowable divergence.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Twenty-three of 38 Senate districts have a population deviation in excess of 10,000 persons (+4.1%). Eleven of these districts fall that far below an ideal-sized district. Twelve have more than 10,000 persons above a district with perfect equality of population. Considering another comparison, 22 of 38 districts have a population deviation in excess of 12,187 (+5%). Eleven districts have a greater than 5% deviation above the ideal, and 11 fall more than 5% below the ideal. In addition, 24 Senate districts out of 38 have a deviation in excess of 9,750 persons (+4%). Finally, the average deviation from the ideal-sized district of 243,739 is 12,265 persons (+5.03%).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">This is not the case where a substantial deviation from the norm is unusual. Unfortunately the plan, once unfolded, resulted in many population differentials which gravitated toward the extremes.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">A similar pattern is reflected as to House districts. The average percentage variation from the ideal-sized district of 84,201 is +5.07%. Translated into persons, this reflects that there is an average deviation of 4,267 persons per House district. Fifty-four of 110 House districts have a population <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>deviation in excess of 5,000 persons (+5.94%). Sixty-four of 110 have a population deviation in excess of 4,210 persons (+5%). Seventy-one have a deviation in excess of 3,368 (+4%).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">It becomes apparent that the application of the Court\u2019s criteria accentuates the extreme and not the norm. Restricting the allowable population divergence would in great measure establish population equality as the primary principle to be recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The plan of the Court fails to measure up to the constitutional requirement that a court-ordered reapportionment plan should formulate districts that are \"as nearly of equal population as is practicable\u201d. In <em>Mahan, </em>upon analyzing the reapportionment plan for the Virginia House of Delegates, the United States Supreme Court discussed several methods of measuring population equality. One measure, the population ratio between the largest and smallest district, is the same in the Michigan plan as in <em>Mahan, </em>1.18 to 1, since this plan was patterned after <em>Mahan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">However, applying other population relationships discussed in <em>Mahan </em>to the Michigan plan dramatizes its constitutional deficiency. In the Michigan Senate plan, the average percentage variation from perfect equality is +5.03%. (That is 12,265 persons from the ideal-sized district). In the House plan, the average percentage deviation is +5.07%. (That is 4,269 persons from the ideal district). In <em>Mahan, </em>the average deviation was only \u00b13.89%.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Also of significance, as has been emphasized, are the number of districts which fall near the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>treme of the allowable deviation. In the plan of the Court, 19 of 38 Senate districts (50%) and 52 of 110 House districts (47.27%) have a population deviation greater than 6%. Only 9 out of 52 districts (17.3%) had the same deviation in <em>Mahan. </em>Furthermore, only 14 of 38 Michigan Senate districts (36.84%) and 39 of 110 House districts (35.45%) fall within 4% of the ideal, whereas in <em>Mahan, </em>the figure was significantly higher: 35 out of 52 districts (67.31%).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Thus, the surface 16.4% standard of <em>Mahan </em>is but the tip of the iceberg of an appropriate constitutional evaluation. While the 16.4% standard of <em>Mahan </em>may be met, \"the fact that a 10% or 15% variation from the norm is approved in one State has little bearing on the validity of a similar variation in another State\u201d. <em>Swann v Adams, </em>385 US 440, 445; 87 S Ct 569; 17 L Ed 2d 501 (1967), quoted in <em>Mahan v Howell, supra, </em>328.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">An unfolding of the Court\u2019s plan reflects that close adherence to a percentage deviation that is at the outside limits of constitutionality cannot be squared with the overriding constitutional objective of substantial equality of population among districts. The reapportionment criteria should strive to create districts as equal, not as unequal, as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\"Simply stated, an individual\u2019s right to vote for state legislators is unconstitutionally impaired when its weight is in a substantial fashion diluted when compared with votes of citizens living in other parts of the State.\u201d <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>568. Such a conclusion becomes more self-evident when a substantial divergence from an ideal-sized dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>trict is present in the majority of Senate and House districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Today\u2019s plan follows the Court\u2019s opinion as closely as possible within self-imposed time constraints. Mr. Apol performed admirable service following the Court\u2019s directives. However, rigid adherence to the criteria concerning population deviation and county lines, written in the abstract, is not required, nor is it advised, when modifications may be made to comport substantially closer to the primary principle of population equality. The Court should profess no vested interest in a certain allowable divergence when experience shows it can be substantially improved to assure constitutional acceptability and still achieve an impartial plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Such a modified plan could have been devised following the same boundary line criteria outlined in the reapportionment opinion, but permitting only a <em>de minimis </em>deviation from population equality. <em>Cf. Gaffney v Cummings, </em>412 US 735; 93 S Ct 2321; 37 L Ed 2d 298 (1973); <em>White v Regester, </em>412 US 755; 93 S Ct 2332; 37 L Ed 2d 314 (1973); <em>Apportionment of Wayne County Board of Comm\u2019rs</em>\u20141982, <em>post, </em>p 289 (Blair Moody, Jr., J., <em>dissenting).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">A total allowable divergence of 5% (+2.5%) would certainly fall within permissible standards. Reducing the total allowable divergence to 8% (+4%) would eliminate much of the inequality extant in the present plan. Since the other criteria of the Court, particularly as interpreted by the majority, gravitates population differentials toward outside allowable limits, any further divergence would be potentially excessive. It is apparent more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>county lines would be broken than under the Court\u2019s plan. However, population equality within acceptable limits should take precedence over unbroken county lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The importance of moving to a quick conclusion of this problem is recognized. However, a \"rush to judgment\u201d may not fully serve the citizens of this state. Time was available<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to develop a plan allowing only a <em>de minimis </em>population deviation which follows the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause \u2014 one that does not include constitutionally unacceptable line-drawing.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Reasonable adherence to boundary lines is a legitimate and useful method in an effort to minimize deliberate gerrymandering and has a genesis in Michigan history. The Court in its opinion of March 25 adopted criteria with respect to boundary lines in order to aid in the drafting of a neutral reapportionment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\"But if, even as a result of a clearly rational state policy of according some legislative representation to political subdivisions, population is submerged as the controlling consideration in the apportionment of seats in the particular legislative body, then the right of all of the State\u2019s citizens to cast an effective and adequately weighted vote would be unconstitutionally impaired\u201d. <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>581. Thus, this Court cannot, under the guise of \"state policy\u201d, supersede the constitutional principle of substantial equality among election districts. <em>Connor v Finch, </em>431 US 407, 420; 97 S Ct 1828; 52 L Ed 2d 465 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>A substantial movement away from population equality in so many districts caused by excessive adherence to boundary lines turns the \"constitutional requirement of equality on its head and exalt[s] district representation over people representation\u201d. <em>Apportionment of Wayne County, post, </em>p 277 (Blair Moody, Jr., J., <em>dissenting).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">As was stated in <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>566, \"a denial of constitutionally protected rights demands judicial protection; our oath and our office require no less of us\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I dissent from the adoption of the Court\u2019s plan and would, in lieu of granting the motion for rehearing, reduce the allowable population divergence in the opinion of March 25 and direct the redrafting of a plan under such modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Order Denying Stay</p>\n<p id=\"Ayh\">Entered May 24, 1982. \u2014 Reporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">On order of the Court, the <em>ex parte </em>application by Commissioners Kleiner, Board, Brouillette and Lurvey for stay pending United States Supreme Court appeal is considered and is hereby denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b316-9\">Justices Levin and Fitzgerald concur and say:</judges>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">The Democratic members of the Commission on Legislative Apportionment have filed a motion for a stay of this Court\u2019s judgment of March 25 and order of May 21 pending their appeal to and decision by the United States Supreme Court, and have asked this Court in the interim to direct the continuation of the existing legislative districts or the adoption of one of the plans submitted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Democratic members of the apportionment commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">While this Court should ordinarily take whatever action will facilitate full exercise of the right to appeal from this Court\u2019s decision, this Court cannot in the instant case grant a stay without immediately ordering the implementation of some alternative for this year\u2019s election (either a further delay in the primary, an extension of the terms of legislators, a continuation of the 1972 apportioned legislative districts, an election at large, or adoption of another districting and apportionment plan) inconsistent with the decision of this Court, thereby granting, because an appeal has been taken, relief denied on the merits.
