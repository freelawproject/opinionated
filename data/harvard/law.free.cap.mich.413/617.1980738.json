An opinion initially was filed addressed to the issues briefed and argued by the parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> All proceeded by accepting the consistent rulings of the Tax Tribunal and the Court of Appeals that challenges to special assessments levied by a governmental unit for public improvements relating to real property are within the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal. The key issue was whether the claim for injunctive relief on this set of facts can remove the case from the tribunal\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">Now an opinion has been filed which turns upon a question neither briefed nor argued by the parties. It concludes that the Tax Tribunal has <em>no </em>jurisdiction over municipal special assessments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>such as herein concerned, so there is no question of removal. It is the opinion of my colleague that the words <em>\"ad valorem \u201d </em>must be read into the Tax Tribunal jurisdictional statute preceding the words \"special assessments\u201d. Otherwise, the words must be read as referring only to the ministerial acts involved in the <em>collection </em>of special assessments. Essentially, the argument is that the Legislature made a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">For purposes of structure, this opinion will address both the issues as briefed and argued and those raised by my colleague. We hold that the Tax Tribunal Act, MCL 205.701 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 7.650(1) <em>et seq., </em>grants the Tax Tribunal exclusive jurisdiction over this proceeding seeking direct review of the governmental unit\u2019s decision concerning a special assessment for a public improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The Tax Tribunal Act is a culmination of numerous attempts by the Legislature to secure the prompt and fair resolution of disputes concerning the collection of government revenues. The efficient resolution of such disputes is important to both the taxpayer and the government. In <em>Eddy v Lee Twp, </em>73 Mich 123, 129-130; 40 NW 792 (1888), this Court acknowledged this fact, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">\" 'The object of that law, as it is of this, is to enable the government to collect its revenues without delay. The obligations of the government must be met promptly, and it is better that the citizen should resort to his common-law remedies to secure his rights, so far as a mere payment of what he claims may be an illegal tax is concerned, than the government should be em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>barrassed in the collection of revenues necessary to defray its expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">\" 'Courts have frequently remarked upon the impossibility of the government calculating with any certainty upon its revenues, if the collection of taxes was subject to be arrested in every instance in which a tax-payer or tax collector could make out <em>prima facie </em>a technical case for arresting such collection, and it is justly said to be much better to let the individual pay to the government the demands it makes upon him, and, if he considers them in whole or in part illegal, apply for the refunding of the money, with interest afterwards.\u2019 Cooley, Taxation (2d ed), p 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">\"This same learned jurist remarks that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">\" 'So serious have been the embarrassments by an improvident employment of the writ of injunction, and other obstructive process, that the legislature has in some cases deemed it necessary to interpose and forbid the issue of injunction, replevin, or other specified writs, the tendency of which would be to embarrass collections.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">The significant public interest underlying the collection of revenues by the government resulted in limitations upon a taxpayer\u2019s ability to contest tax assessments and obtain refunds of general revenue taxes. Similar, although possibly less compelling, considerations imposed limitations on a landowner\u2019s ability to challenge a local special assessment for a public improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">In attempts to remove some of these limitations and provide a forum in which aggrieved taxpayers could obtain relief, the Legislature created statutory procedures for taxpayers to utilize in contesting the legality of their taxes. Statutes provided that a taxpayer could appeal to the State Tax Commission, see MCL 211.152; MSA 7.210, or pay the tax under protest and bring an action in circuit court for a refund, see MCL 211.53; MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>7.97.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Challenges concerning special assessments were governed by different standards. MCL 211.53; MSA 7.97,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provided that one could pay a special assessment under protest and sue for a refund in circuit court. However, the most common way to contest a special assessment was to sue to enjoin the collection of it, see <em>Brill v Grand Rapids, </em>383 Mich 216; 174 NW2d 832 (1970).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The proliferation of these available remedies created problems of forum shopping and increased the possibility of inconsistent decisions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>problems led to the passage of the Tax Tribunal Act with its provisions for exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The Tax Tribunal is a \"quasi-judicial agency\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> designed to provide a forum in which taxpayers may obtain relief from adverse agency decisions. The primary functions of the Tax Tribunal are to find facts and review the decisions of agencies within its jurisdiction. The Tax Tribunal specializes in reviewing these determinations. To assure that it possesses the necessary expertise to resolve these cases efficiently, the Tax Tribunal Act requires that certain members of the tribunal have special qualifications.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The facts in the instant case, except for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>substantive issue of whether plaintiffs property benefited from the public improvement, are not in dispute. On April 26, 1976, the Council of the City of Novi passed a resolution confirming special assessment rolls for the paving of a portion of Taft Road. Plaintiffs claim the tax bills for the special assessments were mailed on May 14, 1976. On June 9, 1976, plaintiffs, owners of properties abutting that portion of Taft Road, filed suit in circuit court seeking injunctive relief and claiming that the assessments were determined in an arbitrary and inequitable manner. Plaintiffs requested the court to preliminarily enjoin collection during the pendency of this case, to determine that their properties were not especially benefited, to adjudge the assessments null and void with any liens thereof discharged, and to grant any other relief the court determined just and equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The court issued a preliminary injunction. After a hearing, the court found that the properties received no additional benefit from the improvement not received by the general public and that the assessments were higher than the benefits received. The court declared the assessments void and permanently enjoined collection of them. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case to the Tax Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Because our first task is to resolve a question of Tax Tribunal jurisdiction, we look to the statutory provisions of this relatively new act (effective July 1, 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">MCL 205.731; MSA 7.650(31) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>\"The tribunal\u2019s exclusive and original jurisdiction shall be:</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">\"(a) A proceeding for direct review of a final decision, finding, ruling, determination, or order of an agency relating to assessment, valuation, rates, <em>special assessments, </em>allocation, or equalization, under property tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">\"(b) A proceeding for refund or redetermination of a tax under the property tax laws.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">A \"proceeding\u201d is defined as an \"appeal\u201d in MCL 205.703; MSA 7.650(3). The tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is based either on the subject matter of the proceeding <em>(e.g., </em>a direct review of a final decision of an agency relating to special assessments under property tax laws) or the type of relief requested <em>(i.e., </em>a refund or redetermination of a tax under the property tax laws). In the instant case, the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal is governed by the first subsection since plaintiffs are seeking to enjoin permanently the collection of a special assessment rather than to obtain a refund of a tax.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">Although neither party raises the issue, my colleague\u2019s opinion concludes that these municipal special assessments cannot be within the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">Whether the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal includes special assessments is an issue of statutory construction. The primary and fundamental rule of statutory construction is that it is the court\u2019s duty to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>and intent as expressed in the provision in question, <em>White v Ann </em>Arbor, 406 Mich 554; 281 NW2d 283 (1979). In reviewing such questions, the court first considers the language of the statute in order to ascertain the intention of the Legislature, <em>Kalamazoo City Education Ass\u2019n v Kalamazoo Public Schools, </em>406 Mich 579; 281 NW2d 454 (1979). Every word of the statute should be considered and no word should be treated as surplusage or rendered nugatory if at all possible, <em>Baker v General Motors Corp, </em>409 Mich 639; 297 NW2d 387 (1980), <em>State v Levenburg, </em>406 Mich 455; 280 NW2d 810 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Focusing on the language of the statute and applying the rules mentioned above, we conclude that the Legislature intended that the Tax Tribunal exercise jurisdiction over this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">MCL 205.731; MSA 7.650(31) grants the Tax Tribunal jurisdiction over proceedings challenging both assessments and special assessments. In the context of taxation, the word \"assessment\u201d denotes the determination of the share of the tax to be paid by each taxpayer, <em>Williams v Mayor of Detroit, </em>2 Mich 560, 565 (1853). For the purpose of collecting <em>ad valorem </em>taxes, or taxes based on the value of property, the word \"assessment\u201d means the determination of the value of property for tax purposes, MCL 211.10; MSA 7.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">MCL 205.731(a); MSA 7.650(31)(a) also expressly grants the Tax Tribunal jurisdiction over decisions relating to special assessments. These special assessments are different from the assessment decisions discussed above. Special assessments are not special procedures for determining the value of property for tax purposes. The words \"special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>assessments\u201d refer to pecuniary exactions made by the government for a special purpose or local improvement, apportioned according to the benefits received; see <em>In re Petition of Auditor General, </em>226 Mich 170; 197 NW 552 (1924), <em>Detroit v Weil, </em>180 Mich 593, 599; 147 NW 550 (1914), MCL 211.761(e); MSA 5.3536(l)(e). The impositions in the instant case are clearly special assessments as that term is used in MCL 205.731(a); MSA 7.650(31)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Although everyone agrees that these pecuniary exactions are special assessments, a difference of opinion has arisen over whether these special assessments are ones \"under property tax laws\u201d as that term is used in MCL 205.731; MSA 7.650(31). Justice Levin\u2019s opinion reasons that the term property tax laws must refer only to <em>ad valorem </em>property taxes because Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28 uses the same term in reference to <em>ad valorem </em>taxes and because such a construction is consistent with past practices. Therefore, the opinion concludes that the phrase limits the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to reviewing the ministerial acts involved in collecting special assessments pursuant to the <em>ad valorem </em>tax law.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">We agree that the phrase \"under property tax laws\u201d modifies the words \"special assessments\u201d. However, it does not exclude these local special assessments for public improvements from the Tax Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Rather, the phrase distinguishes between the special assessments involved in this case and other special assessments not levied under property tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">We recognize that significant differences exist between special assessments and other forms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>taxation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In fact, if the Tax Tribunal Act did not mention special assessments, we would agree that special assessments are not within the jurisdiction of the tribunal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, the jurisdiction of the tribunal is not limited to general taxes. It also expressly includes special assessments under the property tax laws. Special assessments and the property tax laws are not mutually exclusive concepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Most special assessments, like this one for a public improvement, are levied pursuant to the taxing power. In <em>Woodbridge v Detroit, 8 </em>Mich 274, 281 (1860), another road paving case, this Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">\"Taxes for purely local public improvements, like the one before us, more generally called assessments, are not mentioned in the constitution, nor is it necessary they should be to give the legislature power over them. The power to impose and collect such taxes, like all other legislative powers not mentioned in the constitution, is plenary, and in the exercise of it is subject to legislative discretion only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">See, also, <em>Weil, supra, Roberts v Smith, </em>115 Mich 5, 8; 72 NW 1091 (1897), <em>Motz v Detroit, </em>18 Mich 495 (1869), <em>Williams, supra, </em>566, 14 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed), \u00a7 38.01, p 10, 1 Cooley on Taxation (4th ed), \u00a7 31, p 107. Special assessments of this type have been described as a peculiar species of taxation, <em>Weil, supra, </em>599. 2 Cooley on Taxation (3d ed), p 1153.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>The special assessments in the instant case are clearly in the nature of a property tax, <em>Motz, supra, </em>523. They are assessed against real property according to the benefits received. They may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as other property taxes. If unpaid, they may become a lien on the property like other property taxes,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or may be collected by an action against the owner of the property.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Several recently enacted legislative definitions of the term \"property taxes\u201d suggest that special assessments may be included in the definition of \"property taxes\u201d unless otherwise excluded.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">In contrast to these special assessments which are levied under the taxing power, some special assessments are clearly not related to property taxes. Such special assessments are exacted through the state\u2019s police power as part of the government\u2019s efforts to protect society\u2019s health and welfare; see <em>Motz, supra, </em>MCL 103.4; MSA 5.1823. Also, special assessments may be collected in connection with a regulatory program to defray the cost of such regulation, see <em>Dukesherer Farms, Inc v Director of Dep\u2019t of Agriculture (After Remand), </em>405 Mich 1; 273 NW2d 877 (1979). Such assessments are not ones under the property tax laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>and are not within the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">However, special assessments levied against property owners for public improvements to realty which especially benefit their property are special assessments under the property tax laws for the purposes of the Tax Tribunal Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">These special assessments for public improvements, a form of taxation, are not outside the property tax laws simply because they are levied pursuant to a municipal charter and ordinance rather than a state statute. The power to levy special assessments for public improvements is a sovereign legislative power. Accordingly, the Legislature has the inherent power to levy such special assessments, Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 1, subject to any applicable constitutional limitations, see <em>Woodbridge, supra, </em>281, <em>Williams, supra, </em>70 Am Jur 2d, Special or Local Assessments, \u00a7 4, pp 845-846. The Legislature also has the ability to delegate such powers to the appropriate authorities, <em>Turner v Detroit, </em>104 Mich 326; 62 NW 405 (1895).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">However, in the absence of such delegation, a municipality does not have the power to levy special assessments, Special or Local Assessments, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6, p 847. Thus, any special assessment levied by a municipal corporation is levied under authority delegated by law from the Legislature. Therefore, such assessments are levied under the property tax laws even though the Legislature has chosen to exercise its power by delegating it to a municipal authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">The provisions of MCL 117.24; MSA 5.2103, also support this conclusion. They provide that after approval and filing, a city charter shall \"there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>upon become law\u201d. The assessments in the instant case were levied pursuant to a home-rule city\u2019s ch\u00e1rter. In other contexts, the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \"law\u201d has included municipal charters, see <em>Sykes v Battle Creek, </em>288 Mich 660, 663; 286 NW 117 (1939), Hudson <em>Motor Car Co v Detroit, 282 </em>Mich 69, 78; 275 NW 770 (1937).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that the word \"laws\u201d in MCL 205.731; MSA 7.650(31) encompasses both statutes and municipal charters and ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">This construction is supported by the multitude of references to special assessments in The General Property Tax Act and the chapter on taxation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because these provisions do not authorize any special assessments, they must refer to special assessments levied under other laws. We conclude that they refer to special assessments levied pursuant to statutes, municipal charters and ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">This construction is also supported by the Legislature\u2019s decision not to amend MCL 205.731; MSA 7.650(31) after the courts have held that the Tax Tribunal has jurisdiction over special assessments. Since the initial passage of the act, the Tax Tribunal and the Courts have consistently held that the Tax Tribunal has jurisdiction over special assessments; see <em>Emerick v Saginaw Twp, </em>104 Mich App 243; 304 NW2d 536 (1981), <em>Rogoski v Muskegon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>101 Mich App 786; 300 NW2d 695 (1980), <em>Anderson v Selma Twp, </em>95 Mich App 112; 290 NW2d 97 (1980), <em>lv den </em>408 Mich 946 (1980), <em>Sisbarro v City of Fenton, </em>90 Mich App 675; 282 NW2d 443 (1979), <em>Eggermont v City of Clawson, </em>88 Mich App 246; 276 NW2d 574 (1979), <em>Edros Corp v Port Huron, </em>78 Mich App 273; 259 NW2d 456 (1977), <em>Calder v DeWitt Twp, </em>75 Mich App 674; 256 NW2d 47 (1977), <em>lv den </em>402 Mich 819 (1977). This consistent construction of the act is entitled to respectful consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Furthermore, the Legislature has amended the act twice since the earlier decisions without changing this jurisdictional provision, see 1978 PA 439, 1980 PA 437. This silence or acquiescence is an indication that the Legislature agreed with the accuracy of these interpretations, <em>Magreta v Ambassador Steel Co (On Rehearing), </em>380 Mich 513; 158 NW2d 473 (1968), <em>In re Clayton Estate, </em>343 Mich 101; 72 NW2d 1 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Considering this acquiescence and the source, nature and effects of special assessments for public improvements, and contrasting them with assessments made pursuant to the police power, we conclude that the special assessments herein are ones under the property tax laws for the purposes of MCL 205.731; MSA 7.650(31).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Although we have no arguments or briefs from the parties on this issue, Justice Levin\u2019s opinion concludes that the term \"property tax laws\u201d must refer only to <em>ad valorem </em>property taxes because Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and another section of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Tax Tribunal Act, MCL 205.753(1); MSA 7.650(53X1),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> which have no application to special assessments, use that phrase. While we agree with our colleague that the noted sections have no application to special assessments, this nonapplication does not arise from the use of. the phrase \"property tax laws\u201d, but rather from the <em>context </em>of its use. Both provisions relate to the appeals of <em>valuation </em>and <em>allocation </em>decisions from a \"final agency provided for the administration of property tax laws\u201d. Since valuation and allocation are not issues in special assessment cases, there was no need for the delegates to the Constitutional Convention to consider whether the phrase \"property tax laws\u201d included or excluded special assessments. Thus, the Constitutional Record is silent on whether the phrase \"property tax laws\u201d includes special assessments. 2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, pp 3240-3243.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The silence of the Constitutional Convention Record certainly provides no indication that the meaning of \"property tax laws\u201d excludes special assessments. The argument that because valuation and allocation are said to be under the property tax laws, special assessments are not under the property tax laws, is analogous to arguing that because Great Danes and Dachshunds are said to be dogs, a Pekinese is not a dog. Therefore, we see no relevance of the use of \"property tax laws\u201d in the 1963 Constitution or MCL 205.753(1); MSA 7.650(53X1) to its use in the jurisdictional section.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Hence, we see no basis for concluding, as our brother does, that when the Legislature wrote \"special assessments * * * under property tax laws\u201d it was referring only to the ministerial acts involved in the collection of special assessments. If such was its intention, one would expect, at the very least, that it would have used the phrase \"special assessments * * * under <em>ad valorem </em>property tax laws\u201d. Since our brother\u2019s interpretation would drastically change the undisputed meaning of \"special assessments\u201d by the use of a phrase whose meaning in this context is far less clear, we decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">A more reasonable interpretation of the effect on \"special assessments\u201d of the phrase \"under property tax laws\u201d, which would not so drastically change its meaning, would be that the phrase distinguishes special assessments that are under the taxing power and that relate to real property from other types of special assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Also, we cannot accept the contention that the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal does not include special assessments because its predecessors did not review special assessments. The statutes creating and defining the functions of the Board of State Tax Commissioners,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the State Tax Department<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and the State Tax Commission<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> do not address or mention special assessments. In contrast, MCL 205.731; MSA 7.650(31) expressly grants the tribunal jurisdiction over special assessments. The conclusion that the Tax Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is more extensive than that of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>State Tax Commission is also supported by the provisions of MCL 205.741; MSA 7.650(41) and MCL 205.771-205.773; MSA 7.650(71)-7.650(73). These provisions implement the tribunal\u2019s broad-based jurisdiction over proceedings previously conducted before both the State Tax Commission and the circuit court. Because the tribunal has jurisdiction over matters formerly heard in circuit court, its jurisdiction is not limited to matters heard by the State Tax Commission. This reasoning is particularly applicable to special assessments, because many of the. actions challenging special assessments were heard in circuit court.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">We recognize that the Legislature\u2019s decision to include special assessments within the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal is one which changes past practices. However, in the absence of any constitutional objection, this is not a valid reason to frustrate the expressed intention of the Legislature. The decision whether to experiment with new procedures is a legislative one. The Court\u2019s role is to effectuate, if possible, that legislative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>The Legislature\u2019s decision to include special assessments within the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal is not unwarranted or unreasonable. Since before the turn of the century, the Legislature has been involved in supervising special assessments, see 1899 PA 39, 1895 PA 3. Currently, a substantial number of statutes address the various aspects of levying a special assessment for a public improvement.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The Legislature\u2019s decision to channel appeals from special assessments decisions to an administrative agency instead of the circuit court is consistent with similar actions in other contexts. The action did not create a new level of review, see <em>Emmet </em>County, <em>supra, </em>but only substituted one forum for another and broadened its jurisdiction. Ideally, this consolidation will foster standardization and equality in the levying of special assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">In contrast to the rational basis the Legislature demonstrated for channeling appeals from special assessments to the Tax Tribunal, the argument is unpersuasive that the Legislature intended only decisions relating to the collection of special assessments under the <em>ad valorem </em>tax law be within the jurisdiction of the tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">First, if the Legislature intended to provide for such limited jurisdiction, it could have clearly expressed this intention. MCL 205.731; MSA 7.650(31) could have been drafted to limit jurisdiction to \"decisions * * * relating to * * * the collection of special assessments * * * under the general property tax act\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Second, the suggested construction of the act could result in forum shopping and increase the possibility of inconsistent decisions in similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>cases. Under that interpretation, assessments collected by separate bills would not be within the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal while those collected with the regular tax roll would be. No justification for this difference has been advanced. The argument appears to elevate form over substance. Also, assuming that two forums would not always resolve the same problem the same way, this construction could lead a municipality into forum shopping via determining whether to collect special assessments on their regular tax rolls or otherwise. One of the main reasons underlying the creation of the Tax Tribunal was to reduce or eliminate forum shopping and the possibility of inconsistent decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The claim that the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over special assessments extends only to <em>ad valorem </em>taxes inaccurately described in a statute as \"special assessments\u201d is equally unpersuasive. No statute has been cited which inaccurately describes an <em>ad valorem </em>tax as a special assessment. The Drain Code, MCL 280.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 11.1001 <em>et seq., </em>does not incorrectly use the term \"special assessment\u201d. Rather, the revenues, whether special assessments or otherwise, are entitled drain \"tax\u201d or \"taxes\u201d.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> MCL 41.721 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2770(51) <em>et seq., </em>does not inaccurately describe an <em>ad valorem </em>tax as a special assessment, but authorizes the raising of revenue by both special assessments, MCL 41.725; MSA 5.2770(55), and by pledging the full faith and credit of the township, MCL 41.735; MSA 5.2770(65), which could lead to payment from other revenues. Neither does MCL 333.20346; MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>14.15(20346) inaccurately use the term \"special assessments\u201d. It authorizes paying the cost of ambulance service from available funds, fees for service, and special assessments. In OAG 1979-1980, No 5706, p 770 (May 13, 1980), the Attorney General opined that the cost of such service could not be imposed as a special assessment since no property was especially benefited. Thus, any levy upon property for that purpose must be exacted as an <em>ad valorem </em>tax. I interpret this opinion as indicating that the municipality should defray its costs from available funds (general taxes), see MCL 333.20346(1); MSA 14.15(20346X1), rather than indicating that the reference in subsection (2) to special assessments meant <em>ad valorem </em>taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Since no statute has been cited which inaccurately describes an <em>ad valorem </em>tax as a special assessment, there is no basis upon which to conclude that the words \"special assessment\u201d in the Tax Tribunal Act refer only to such non-existent statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Although an understanding of the Tax Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is necessary to the resolution of this case, the more immediate concern is the jurisdiction of the circuit court over these proceedings. The jurisdiction of the circuit court is governed by Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 13, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">\"The circuit court shall have original jurisdiction in all matters not prohibited by law; appellate jurisdiction from all inferior courts and tribunals except as otherwise provided by law; power to issue, hear and determine prerogative and remedial writs; supervisory and general control over inferior courts and tribunals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>within their respective jurisdictions in accordance with rules of the supreme court; and jurisdiction of other cases and matters as provided by rules of the supreme court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">MCL 600.601; MSA 27A.601 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">\"Circuit courts have the power and jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">\"(1) possessed by courts of record at the common law, as altered by the constitution and laws of this state and the rules of the supreme court, and</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">\"(2) possessed by courts and judges in chancery in England on March 1, 1847, as altered by the constitution and laws of this state and the rules of the supreme court, and</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">\"(3) prescribed by rule of the supreme court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">Historically, the circuit courts exercised jurisdiction over actions to enjoin the collection of special assessments. The courts continue to exercise this jurisdiction except as prohibited by the laws of this state. The divestiture of jurisdiction from the circuit court is an extreme undertaking. Statutes so doing are to be strictly construed. Divestiture of jurisdiction cannot be accomplished except under clear mandate of the l\u00e1w, <em>Leo v Atlas Industries, Inc, </em>370 Mich 400, 402; 121 NW2d 926 (1963), <em>Crane v Reeder, </em>28 Mich 527, 532-533 (1874).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">Even under these strict rules of construction, the Tax Tribunal Act clearly evidences a legislative intention that the circuit court not have jurisdiction over matters within the tribunal\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. The tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over proceedings under the property tax laws is \"exclusive\u201d, meaning to the exclusion of others, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed), p 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">MCL 205.741; MSA 7.650(41) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">\"A person or legal entity which, immediately before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>the effective date of this act, was entitled to proceed before the state tax commission or <em>circuit court </em>of this state for determination of a matter subject to the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, as provided in section 31, shall proceed only before the tribunal.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">MCL 205.774; MSA 7.650(74) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">\"The right to sue any agency for refund of any taxes other than by proceedings before the tribunal is abolished * *</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">We find that these provisions sufficiently express the Legislature\u2019s intent to make the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction exclusive and to prohibit the circuit court from exercising jurisdiction over matters within the tribunal\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Plaintiffs respond that these proceedings raise constitutional issues and seek equitable relief which the Tax Tribunal lacks the power to grant. Because the tribunal lacks the power to decide constitutional issues and to grant an injunction, plaintiffs conclude that the Tax Tribunal Act does not prohibit the bringing of this action in circuit court.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">Generally speaking, an agency exercising quasi-judicial power does not undertake the determination of constitutional questions or possess the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>power to hold statutes unconstitutional, <em>Dation v Ford Motor Co, </em>314 Mich 152; 22 NW2d 252 (1946). However, the constitutional claims in this case do not involve the validity of a statute. Rather, plaintiffs\u2019 claim is merely an assertion, in constitutional terms, that the assessment was arbitrary and without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The law requires that special assessments be made according to the benefits received, see <em>Dix-Ferndale Taxpayers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v Detroit, </em>258 Mich 390, 395; 242 NW 732 (1932). Plaintiffs\u2019 claim is that these special assessments were not made according to the benefits received as required by law. The resolution of this claim involves many fact determinations. The membership of the Tax Tribunal is structured to provide it with experience in resolving these fact issues. The tribunal\u2019s <em>de novo </em>review<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> gives it the opportunity to rectify any errors in the agency\u2019s determination. This review is sufficient to resolve any of the claims raised by the plaintiffs. Since the issues raised by plaintiffs do not involve the validity of the tribunal\u2019s action or a statute, they do not remove this proceeding from the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">We agree with plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the Tax Tribunal lacks the power to issue an injunction. The issuance of an injunction is an exercise of judicial power. The constitution limits the Legislature\u2019s power to transfer judicial power to administrative agencies, see Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2, <em>Johnson v Kramer Bros Freight Lines, Inc, </em>357 Mich 254, 258; 98 NW2d 586 (1959). Generally, quasi-judicial agencies lack judicial power, see <em>Dation v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>Ford Motor Co, supra, Michigan Mutual Liability Co v Baker, </em>295 Mich 237, 242; 294 NW 168 (1940), <em>Mackin v Detroit-Timkin Axle Co, </em>187 Mich 8; 153 NW 49 (1915). MCL 205.732; MSA 7.650(32) does not expressly grant the tribunal the power to issue injunctions, and such power will not be extended by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Although injunctive relief may not be directly available, the tribunal is empowered to issue \"writs, orders, or directives\u201d, see MCL 205.732; MSA 7.650(32), and nothing in the Tax Tribunal Act prohibits one from seeking equitable relief to enforce a tribunal decision, see <em>Edros, supra, Niedzialek v Journeymen Barbers, Hairdressers &amp; Cosmetologists\u2019 International Union of America, Local 552, AFL, </em>331 Mich 296; 49 NW2d 273 (1951), <em>Van Buren Public School Dist v Wayne Circuit Judge, </em>61 Mich App 6, 14; 232 NW2d 278 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Case law exists indicating that the constitution places some limitations on the Legislature\u2019s power to divest the court completely of equity jurisdiction and the judicial power to grant an injunction; see <em>Haggerty v City of Dearborn, </em>332 Mich 304; 51 NW2d 290 (1952). Thus, while there may be an extraordinary case which justifies the exercise of equity jurisdiction in contravention of a statute, this is not such a case. Where the Legislature has provided a plain, adequate remedy at law, it has the constitutional authority to impose limitations on other available remedies, <em>Eddy v Lee Twp, </em>73 Mich 123; 40 NW 792 (1888). The legal remedy available in this case is a proceeding before the Tax Tribunal. As indicated above, the tribunal has the jurisdiction and ability to resolve all the claims presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Although exceptions to statutes purportedly conferring exclusive jurisdiction on other administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>tive agencies and courts have been recognized by this Court, see <em>Emmet County, supra, Michigan Mutual, supra, </em>plaintiffs\u2019 requests for preliminary and permanent injunctions in these proceedings do not take them out of the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal pursuant to MCL 205.731; MSA 7.650(31), see <em>Eggermont v City of Clawson, </em>88 Mich App 246; 276 NW2d 574 (1979); <em>Edros Corp v Port Huron, </em>78 Mich App 273; 259 NW2d 456 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">While plaintiffs further argue that the circuit court is the proper forum for this proceeding because the Tax Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to resolve class actions, defendants state that, in effect, the tribunal has jurisdiction to decide suits affecting an entire class. This suit is a proper example. The further resolution of the issue is not necessary to the determination of this case. The tribunal\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction includes all proceedings for review of an agency\u2019s decision under the property tax laws. Allowing such class actions to be brought in the circuit court while prohibiting suits by a single taxpayer would elevate form over substance. In essence, \u00a7\u00a741 and 74 prohibit the circuit court from exercising jurisdiction in these proceedings. However, plaintiffs can obtain in the Tax Tribunal the same relief sought by another name in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Upon reversing the judgment of the circuit court, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Tax Tribunal pursuant to MCL 205.773; MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>7.650(73)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and GCR 1963, 820.1(7).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> On appeal, defendants contend that the Court of Appeals erred in remanding this case because the tribunal lacked jurisdiction \"over this equitable matter. MCL 205.735; MSA 7.650(35), the only provision establishing procedures for invoking the jurisdiction of the tribunal, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">\"The jurisdiction of the tribunal shall be invoked by the filing of a written petition by a party in interest, as petitioner, within 30 days after the final decision, ruling, determination, or order which he seeks to review or within 30 days after the receipt of a bill for a tax he seeks to contest. The unit of government shall be named as respondent. Service of the petition on the respondent shall be by certified mail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Defendants claim that a timely filing, within 30 days after the final decision is necessary to invoke the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal, 2 Am Jur 2d, Administrative Law, \u00a7 328, pp 150-151. The word \"shall\u201d has been construed to mean \"must\u201d, see <em>Sauder v Dist Board of School Dist No 10, Royal Oak Twp, Oakland County, </em>271 Mich 413, 418; 261 NW 66 (1935). The Tax Tribunal has applied a similar construction of the statute to determine that the 30-day limit is jurisdictional<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>construction of the statute is entitled to respectful consideration, <em>Magreta, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Defendants argue that MCL 205.773; MSA 7.650(73) does not apply because it applies only to cases heard in the circuit court or State Tax Commission before the creation of the Tax Tribunal and remanded after appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Although MCL 205.735; MSA 7.650(35) provides that the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction shall be invoked by a timely filing, the statute does not state the consequences of failing to file a timely petition. It does not contain any language prohibiting the tribunal from exercising jurisdiction in cases filed later than 30 days after a final ruling or receipt of a tax bill. It contains none of the prohibitive language normally present in statutory limitations.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In this respect, MCL 205.735; MSA 7.650(35) is not free from ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Although defendant\u2019s construction of MCL 205.731; MSA 7.650(31) might be persuasive if it were the only statutory pronouncement on this issue, other statutory provisions expressly set forth different limitations on actions brought by taxpayers seeking relief. In contrast to the absence of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>language in this section expressly creating a limitation or bar, some statutes within the jurisdiction of the tribunal contain clear expressions of limitations. Many of these periods of limitation are different from or longer than the 30-day period provided in the Tax Tribunal Act.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">If the provisions of the Tax Tribunal Act were intended to supersede these express limitation periods, the Tax Tribunal Act does not clearly indicate such an intention. The existence of these longer periods of limitation are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Tax Tribunal Act so as to be repealed by MCL 205.707; MSA 7.650(7).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Also, repeals by implication are not favored, see <em>Yarger v City of Hastings, </em>375 Mich 413; 134 NW2d 726 (1965). In such cases the canon of statutory construction is that:</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">\" '[I]f the courts can by any fair, strict or liberal construction find for the two provisions a reasonable field of operation, without destroying their evident intent and meaning, preserving the force of both, and Construing them together in harmony with the whole course of legislation upon the subject it is their duty to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rathbun v Michigan, </em>284 Mich 521, 544-545; 280 NW 35, 44 (1938), quoting with approval from <em>State ex rel Ellis v Givens, </em>48 Fla 165, 174; 37 So 308 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">In light of the existence of longer periods of limitations, the reasonableness of relying on such provisions and the severe consequence to aggrieved taxpayers from a determination that the limitation periods were repealed by implication, we hold that the provisions of \u00a7 35 do not supersede the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>other applicable periods of limitation. When a specific limitation for such actions has been established, the provisions of \u00a7 35 will not prohibit the tribunal from exercising jurisdiction in a proceeding brought within the specific time limitation. This construction of MCL 205.735; MSA 7.650(35), does not render it meaningless. It applies in cases in which a specific provision providing a longer period of limitation does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">In the instant case, the assessment rolls were confirmed on April 26, 1976. Suit was filed on June 9, 1976. Plaintiffs\u2019 filing would have been timely-under the City of Novi\u2019s Charter \u00a7 11.4 and Special Assessment Ordinance, No 69-01, \u00a7 26.01, because it was filed within 60 days after the confirmation of the rolls.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Considering the periods of limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>provided, plaintiffs\u2019 action was timely filed in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The timely filing in the circuit court was not sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal. However, through this action, the circuit court acquired jurisdiction over defendants. MCL 600.5856; MSA 27A.5856,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> provides that the statute of limitations is tolled whenever jurisdiction over the defendant was otherwise acquired.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Because the period of limitations was tolled and did not expire during the pendency of this suit, MCL 205.735; MSA 7.650(35) did not remove this proceeding from the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal. The Court of Appeals did not err in ordering that this case be remanded to the Tax Tribunal pursuant to GCR 1963, 820.1(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Affirmed.

The Court construed the term \"equalization\u201d in MCL 205.731; MSA 7.650(31) to refer only to intracounty equalization. This construction was based, in part, on the fact that the Legislature has never provided for administrative review of decisions relating to intercounty equalization.

The limiting term \"property tax laws\u201d describes that body of statutory law which had been and continues to be administered by the State Tax Commission:</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">\u2014The purpose of the Legislature in enacting the Tax Tribunal Act was to transfer the appellate jurisdiction of the State Tax Commission to the Tax Tribunal and to eliminate the alternative remedy in the circuit court. It was not part of the legislative purpose to transfer to the Tax Tribunal jurisdiction of subject matter which had not formerly been a matter of <em>state </em>supervision and the business of the State Tax Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">\u2014The legislative purpose is expressed in the language of the Tax Tribunal Act. The act limits the Tax Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to decisions made under \"property tax laws\u201d, the laws subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>administration by the State Tax Commission. Special assessments are not levied under The General Property Tax Act or other laws or provisions of law providing for the <em>state </em>tax on real and personal property (the \"property tax laws\u201d), which are subject to state administrative supervision by the State Tax Commission, but under separate legislation such as the home-rule cities act and the Drain Code authorizing the establishment of and providing for the powers of local units of government.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">\u2014The Tax Tribunal Act eliminates the circuit court remedy where a person had been able to proceed either before \"the state tax commission or the circuit court\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Persons seeking to challenge a special assessment levy had not theretofore been able to proceed either before the \"state tax commission or the circuit court\u201d, but only in the circuit court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">\u2014The Tax Tribunal Act was not directed to problems which had arisen in the establishment of special assessment districts and in the levying of special assessments by local governmental authorities which appeared to call for supervision at the state level of local governmental decisions to finance public improvements by special assessment but rather was enacted because the State Tax Commission had ceased to be an appropriate place to lodge administrative appellate jurisdiction respecting the state <em>ad valorem </em>property tax, and the dual remedy in the circuit court in property tax appeals had ceased to serve a useful purpose.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>\u2014While special assessments are, to be sure, authorized by state enabling legislation and are based on and subject to state law \u2014 as is all local governmental activity \u2014 the Legislature has not subjected to state supervision local governmental decisions to finance a public improvement by creating a special assessment district and levying a special assessment. The Legislature, consistent with the general policy of not supervising local governmental activities at the state level,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> has not authorized the State Tax Commission or any other state agency to exercise administrative supervision of or to review on appeal decisions of a home-rule city, of a drain commissioner, or of other local governmental authorities respecting local improvements and their financing through special assessments.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The General Property Tax Act and supplemental laws compiled in the chapter on real and personal property taxation contain a number of provisions concerning special assessments.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These provisions concern in the main<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the collection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>special assessments and the sale of property which has been specially assessed for nonpayment of the special assessment. Cities, drain commissioners and other governmental authorities levying a special assessment may and generally do utilize the established machinery for the collection of <em>ad valorem </em>property taxes to collect a special assessment. Special assessments are ordinarily billed by the <em>ad valorem </em>tax collector together with the <em>ad valorem </em>tax on real property.

(Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The recommendations of the committee on style and drafting respecting \u00a7 28 were considered, together with the committee\u2019s recommendations concerning a number of other sections of the constitution, and were accepted without further floor discussion.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">A \"property tax law\u201d is thus, at least for purposes of \u00a7 28 of article 6 of the constitution, a law subject to <em>administration </em>by the State Tax Commission.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The laws subject to administration by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>the State Tax Commission, then and even now after the establishment of the Tax Tribunal, are laws providing for the levying and collection of <em>ad valorem </em>property taxes. Then and now the State Tax Commission has had no authority to supervise (to \"administer\u201d) the levying of or to review on appeal a decision of a local governmental authority to finance a public improvement by levying a special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The Legislature, in designating, in \u00a7 53 of the Tax Tribunal Act, the Tax Tribunal as \"the final agency for the administration of property tax laws\u201d, in express implementation (\"for purposes\u201d) of the constitutional limitation set forth in \u00a7 28 of article 6, necessarily incorporated the meaning of that term as used in the constitution. The Legislature therefore comprehended by the term \"property tax laws\u201d, at least in \u00a7 53, the functions of the State Tax Commission and the statutes and provisions of law which had been subject to the State Tax Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">It has been said that \"[t]he connotation of a term in one portion of an Act may often be clarified by reference to its use in others.\u201d <em>United States v Cooper Corp, </em>312 US 600, 606; 61 S Ct 742; 85 L Ed 1071 (1941). This suggests that the sense in which the Legislature used the term \"property tax laws\u201d in \u00a7 53 (designating the Tax Tribunal as the \"final agency\u201d) connotes the meaning of that term in \u00a7 31 (establishing the Tax Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">The Legislature, in using the same phrase, \"property tax laws\u201d, in both \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 53 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Tax Tribunal Act,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> manifested a purpose to limit the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal to the appellate jurisdiction formerly exercised by the \"final agency\u201d \u2014 the State Tax Commission \u2014 \"provided for the administration of property tax laws\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The term \"property tax laws\u201d, in \u00a7 31 of the Tax Tribunal Act, as in \u00a7 53 of that act, rooted as it is in the constitution, means laws and provisions of law concerning <em>ad valorem </em>property taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">We do not argue, as put forth in the opinion of the Court, that \"because\u201d valuation and allocation are matters \"under the property tax laws\u201d that special assessments are not.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The argument is rather that the framers of the constitution used the words \"property tax laws\u201d to describe the body of law administered by the State Tax Commission, that the Legislature, in using those words in one section (\u00a7 53) of the Tax Tribunal Act in the very sense in which the framers of the constitution used those words and in another section (\u00a7 31) of the Tax Tribunal Act to describe its jurisdiction had in mind one and the same body of law, the laws formerly and still administered by the State Tax Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">Because \"property tax laws\u201d, subject to administration by the State Tax Commission, are all laws concerning <em>ad valorem </em>taxes, it is possible to explain what is meant by \"property tax laws\u201d by saying, as we have said in this opinion, that property tax laws are laws levying <em>ad valorem </em>taxes (taxes assessed on the value of real or personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>property) or, more descriptively, <em>ad valorem </em>property tax laws. Or one may explain, as we have also said, that they are the laws then and now administered by the State Tax Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Either explanation can be challenged with the empty argument that \"if the Legislature had meant\u201d to limit property tax laws to <em>ad valorem </em>property tax laws or to the business of the State Tax Commission \"it would have used\u201d those words.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Whenever one attempts to explain what a word means another word must be used. Whenever a court construes language and explains what words mean, it necessarily uses words other than the words being construed, as does the opinion of the Court in this case.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The alternative is to say, and all too frequently one does read arguments by lawyers and judicial opinions which say no more than, the word being construed means the word being construed: \"property tax laws\u201d means \"property tax laws\u201d. If one wishes to convey meaning, however, one must say that \"property tax laws\u201d means X or does not mean or include Y or does mean and include Z. The threadbare argument \"if the Legislature had meant, it would have\u201d should be exorcized._</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">To say that because the words \"special assessments\u201d appear in \u00a7 31, the context of the Tax Tribunal Act suggests or that the Legislature \"must have\u201d had in mind a broader purpose or intended that a broader meaning be ascribed to \"property tax laws\u201d would be wholly circular and would deprive the term \"property tax laws\u201d of meaning as a modifier of \"special assessments\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The context of the Tax Tribunal Act \u2014 the language of the act other than the language being construed \u2014 does not suggest a broader purpose for \u00a7 31 than providing for review of decisions relating to <em>ad valorem </em>property taxes.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> No language in other sections of the Tax Tribunal Act suggests that the Legislature used the term \"property tax laws\u201d in different senses in \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 53<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> or used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>the terms \"property\u201d, \"property taxes\u201d or \"taxes\u201d in different senses where those terms appear.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The opinion of the Court acknowledges that \"property tax laws\u201d are words of limitation. The opinion does not specifically define the term property tax laws, but the import of the opinion is discernible.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The opinion says that \"the phrase [property tax laws] distinguishes between the special assessments involved in this case and other special assessments not levied under property tax laws\u201d.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Putting aside that the examples suggested by the opinion of possible special assessments which would not be subject to Tax Tribunal jurisdiction are, to say the least, tenuous,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> the \"distinction\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>says no more than the words being construed serve to permit a distinction between this case and other cases. But the opinion fails to state the distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The \"distinction\u201d drawn in the opinion of the Court ignores that the . Legislature was not talking about special assessments alone but also about \"assessments, valuation, rates\u201d and \"allocation and equalization\u201d under \"property tax laws\u201d.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">\"Allocation and equalization\u201d are concepts peculiar to <em>ad valorem </em>property taxes. Because \"allocation or equalization\u201d arise only under the property tax laws, the Court could not say that \"the phrase [property tax laws] distinguishes between\u201d \"allocation or equalization\u201d arising under the property tax laws and \"allocation or equalization\u201d not arising under property tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">\"Property tax laws\u201d is a common denominator of and pertains to all the words being modified: assessment, valuation, rates, special assessments, allocation, and equalization. Manifestly, in speaking of property tax laws in the clause \"assessment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>valuation, rates, special assessments, allocation, or equalization, under property tax laws\u201d, the Legislature meant that body of statutory law pertinent to allocation and equalization and, as well, to assessment, valuation, rates and special assessments. That body of law is The General Property Tax Act, providing for the levying and collection of the <em>ad valorem </em>state tax on real and personal property, pursuant to which body of law special assessments, not levied under that body of law, may be collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The opinion of the Court defines \"property tax laws\u201d generically and does not recognize the phrase as a term of art which is rooted in the constitutional and statutory history of the state. One can isolate each word in the term \"property tax laws\u201d and make an argument that the term means any governmental exaction or perhaps even a non-governmental exaction authorized by government<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> levied on or in respect to \"property\u201d. Any governmentally authorized exaction can be regarded as a \"tax\u201d. The governmental authorization would be the \"law\u201d. The exaction is bound to be levied on or in respect to<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and be payable out of \"property\u201d. So defined, the words \"property tax laws\u201d cease to have meaning as words of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The corporation franchise tax law levies a value-based <em>(ad valorem) </em>tax measured by the book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>value of a corporation\u2019s property.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The intangibles tax law levies a value-based tax measured by the par value of securities that are not income producing.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The use tax is measured by the selling price of tangible personal property.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Defining property tax laws as simply laws imposing taxes on property would bring within the Tax Tribunal\u2019s \u00a7 31 jurisdiction the corporation franchise, intangible and use taxes although it is clear that the Legislature did not intend that they be covered by \u00a7 31. These and other state taxes were not within the Tax Tribunal\u2019s \"exclusive and original\u201d \u00a7 31 jurisdiction, and are within the Tax Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction by virtue of the provisions of \u00a7 79 of the Tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Tribunal Act and the 1976 and 1980 amendments.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Defining \"property tax laws\u201d as any law authorizing a tax on property would also support the conclusion that the income tax is a tax on property. Indeed, it is because the United States Supreme Court so declared that the Sixteenth Amendment was submitted to the states. In <em>Pollock v Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co, </em>157 US 429; 15 S Ct 673; 39 L Ed 759 (1895), the United States Supreme Court held that an act of Congress levying an income tax was unconstitutional insofar as it levied a tax on the rents or income of real estate because such a tax is a \"direct tax\u201d:<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">\"[I]t is admitted that a tax on real estate is a direct tax. Unless, therefore, a tax upon rents or income issuing out of lands is intrinsically so different from a tax on the land itself that it belongs to a wholly different class of taxes, such taxes must be regarded as falling within the same category as a tax on real estate <em>eo nomine. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The opinion of the Court states that the \"phrase [property tax laws] distinguishes special assessments that are under the taxing power and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>relate to real property from other types of special assessments\u201d.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Special assessments have indeed been sometimes denominated as \"taxes\u201d, and it has been said that the constitutional source of the legislative authority to provide for the levying of a special assessment is the \"taxing power\u201d. This Court, in the <em>Detroit Paving Cases </em>in the 1860\u2019s, faced with the claim that a special assessment was a taking in violation of the Eminent Domain Clause, said, with some difficulty in opinions which failed to command a majority,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> that the source of the legislative authority to provide for special assessments was the taxing power:</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">\"This involves the question, whether the money attempted to be raised by means of the assessment to defray the expenses of improving a public street, is sought to be taken by virtue of the right of <em>eminent domain, </em>or in the exercise of the sovereign power of taxation.\u201d <em>Williams v Mayor and City of Detroit, </em>2 Mich 560, 566 (1853). (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Faced with the same question today, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>might, in light of its subsequent decision in <em>Graham v </em>Saginaw, 317 Mich 427, 431; 27 NW2d 42 (1947), and having in mind its statements regarding the source of the authority to impose drain taxes and special assessments,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> locate in the police power the constitutional authority to provide for the levying of a special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Conceding, <em>arguendo, </em>however, that the constitutional source of the Legislature\u2019s authority to enact laws concerning special assessments in the taxing power, it does not follow that all laws enacted under the taxing power are property tax laws or even that every law enacted under the taxing power in respect to real and personal property is a property tax law. Conceding that the constitutional source of the Legislature\u2019s authority is the \"taxing power\u201d, the constructional issue (the meaning of \"property tax laws\u201d) under the Tax Tribunal Act remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">In <em>Graham, </em>the Court held that a special assessment is <em>not a \"tax\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>57</em></footnotemark><em> </em>within the meaning of the 15-mill constitutional limitation respecting \"taxes assessed against <em>property\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Thus, at least for the purposes of the 15-mill limitation, a special assessment is not a \"property tax\u201d. In light of <em>Graham, </em>this Court cannot prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>erly say that in the phrase \"property tax laws\u201d the word \"tax\u201d means a governmental exaction, that a special assessment for local improvements is a governmental exaction, that \"property\u201d refers to real or personal (as distinguished from intangible) property, and that a law authorizing such an exaction is a property tax law.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">By 1963 and 1974, when the present constitution and the Tax Tribunal Act were drafted, it was clear,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> whatever the constitutional source of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Legislature\u2019s authority, that a special assessment is not a <em>tax on property, </em>and that laws authorizing special assessments for local improvements are not property tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The \"property tax\u201d, as clearly appears from the language adopted on the floor of the constitutional convention (\"property tax purposes\u201d),<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> is the tax requiring \"valuation\u201d and subject to \"allocation\u201d, concepts which are, again, peculiar to the <em>ad valorem </em>tax on real and personal property. The \"property tax\u201d is not every governmental exaction in respect to property, or even every governmental exaction in respect to real or personal property, but only the <em>ad valorem </em>tax on real and personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">\"Property tax laws\u201d is a term of art and not a collection of words to which the Court is justified in giving its own meaning. Those words have a fixed meaning, and that fixed meaning is those tax laws administered by the State Tax Commission which are the <em>ad valorem </em>real and personal property tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The Legislature did not use the term \"property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>tax laws\u201d in different senses in \u00a7 53, concerning appellate review, and \u00a7 31, concerning jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The opinion of the Court ignores that the words \"property tax laws\u201d refers to a body of law still subject to administration by the State Tax Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The opinion fails to take into account that if the provisions of the home-rule cities act empowering a city to levy a special assessment is a property tax law for purposes of Tax Tribunal jurisdiction so too is it a property tax law for purposes of the continuing jurisdiction of the State Tax Commission. The State Tax Commission may thus, after today, have jurisdiction to supervise city and other local governmental units, in respect to special assessments in much the same manner as local <em>ad valorem </em>tax assessors are supervised.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">The opinion also fails to take into account that, applying the same reasoning to the Drain Code, the Tax Tribunal may now exercise quasi-judicial review of special assessments levied pursuant to the Drain Code<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> and the State Tax Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>may now be said to have the power and responsibility to supervise county drain commissioners in the administration of the provisions of the Drain Code concerning drain taxes and special assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The Court, in declaring that a law authorizing a local special assessment is enacted under the taxing power, states that a special assessment authorized under the police power would not be subject to Tax Tribunal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Because this case arises under the home-rule cities act and not the Drain Code, an effort will, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>doubt, be made on the bases of the distinction drawn by the Court between the taxing and police power and its earlier pronouncements on the source of the authority to provide for drain taxes and assessments, to except special assessments under the Drain Code from Tax Tribunal jurisdiction. The Court will then be called upon to reconsider the reasoning and language of the opinion of the Court filed today and whether to adhere to it or find a basis for withdrawing from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">H</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The opinion of the Court states that an argument set forth in this opinion is analogous to arguing that because Great Danes and Dachshunds are dogs, a Pekinese is not a dog.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The premise that all three are dogs is a matter of common knowledge; there is, therefore, no constructional issue. Here there is. \"That dog\u201d, Sam Rayburn would say, \"won\u2019t hunt\u201d; if the question were which dogs hunt and which dogs don\u2019t, we could be faced with a constructional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The question here is what governmental exactions are within the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal and which are not. Unless all governmental exactions are levied under property tax laws and were intended to be subject to Tax Tribunal jurisdiction, there must be some governmental exactions which are not property taxes although there cannot be dogs who are not dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">We know that all governmental exactions are not subject to Tax Tribunal jurisdiction, if for no other reason than because it took the 1976 and 1980 amendments to confer jurisdiction over other state taxes on the Tax Tribunal.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The history of legislation in respect to state and local taxes and assessments persuasively <em>suggests </em>\u2014concededly that history does not require the conclusion \u2014 that the Tax Tribunal has not been vested in only this one instance with jurisdiction of a local assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The Legislature conferred on the Tax Tribunal and its predecessors, the State Tax Commission (and its predecessors) and the Board of Tax Appeals (and its predecessors), the authority to review the levying of <em>state </em>taxes.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">While real and personal property tax assessment and review is at the local level and today all revenues are collected and expended locally,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> the state levied and received revenue from the property tax at the time the predecessors of the Tax Tribunal were established.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> <em>Ad valorem </em>property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>taxes are state taxes subject to statewide administration, while special assessments are local exactions not subject to statewide administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Although no portion of the property tax is now remitted to the state, the state is still concerned with the proper administration of the property tax.

The argument is rather that the Legislature has never provided a means of review by a state administrative tribunal of any tax or assessment other than a state tax or assessment and that suggests, although it does not require, that the Tax Tribunal Act should not, for this and other substantial reasons, be construed as providing in this one instance only a means of administrative review at the state level of a decision to levy a local tax or assessment, absent a clearer statement or evidence of a purpose to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">We agree that the Legislature could constitutionally subject local taxes and special assessments to Tax Tribunal or other state administrative .agency jurisdiction.

Some communities have the wherewithal to finance local public improvements with general tax dollars, in whole or in part, while others are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>more dependent on special assessments as a means of financing. A state administrative tribunal empowered to review local governmental decisions to finance through special assessments will find itself confronted with evidence that in other communities \"similar\u201d improvements have been financed with general tax dollars which, it will be asserted, indicates that the improvements in suit do not specially benefit property owners in the special assessment district. The Tax Tribunal will be reminded of the legislative purpose, enunciated by this Court, of \"foster[ing] standardization and equality in the levying of special assessments\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The Tax Tribunal will be called upon to confront the tension between the constitutional provision limiting <em>ad valorem </em>assessments to 50% of true cash value<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> and the constitutional limitation barring a special assessment unless there is a special benefit.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Especially where the community faces a declining property tax base, the Tax Tribunal will find it precariously difficult to hold to the constitutional line on both the issue of <em>ad valorem </em>property tax value and the issue whether a special benefit will accrue from construction of the public improvement proposed to be financed by special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">K</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">At the time the Tax Tribunal Act was enacted, the established practice to contest a special assessment was an equitable action in the circuit court to set aside the assessment and to restrain collection.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Subsequent to the enactment of the Tax Tribunal Act and as part of a revision of the enabling acts for villages<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> and fourth-class cities,<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> the Legislature, in 1974, prescribed the timing and procedure for actions instituted \"for the purpose of contesting or <em>enjoining </em>the collection\u201d of a special assessment.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>This provision for equitable actions challenging special assessments \u2014 the established means of contesting a special assessment \u2014 is not merely a reenactment of prior language. There was no counterpart to the added language in the village<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> and fourth-class city<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> enabling acts before the revision, nor is there a counterpart in other enabling acts.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">This language, added less than a year after the enactment of the Tax Tribunal Act, indicates a legislative understanding that contests of special assessments were still properly brought, as equitable actions, in the courts.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>L</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Construing \"property tax laws\u201d to mean laws concerning <em>ad valorem </em>property taxes is consistent with a prior decision of this Court. This Court has said that the Legislature intended to give the Tax Tribunal jurisdiction over matters formerly \"heard by the State Tax Commission as an <em>appellate </em>body.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Emmet County v State Tax Comm, </em>397 Mich 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">In <em>Emmet County, </em>this Court considered the same jurisdictional provision, \u00a7 31, of the Tax Tribunal Act that is now an issue. Section 31 confers on the Tax Tribunal jurisdiction to review a final decision relating to \"equalization, under property tax laws\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">While a literal reading would indicate that the Tax Tribunal has jurisdiction over all final decisions relating to equalization, this Court concluded that the provision was intended to give the Tax Tribunal jurisdiction over only <em>intracounty </em>equalization decisions and not, in addition, <em>intercounty </em>equalization decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">This Court considered the historical difference between intracounty and intercounty equalization proceedings, the apparent legislative intent to give the Tax Tribunal jurisdiction over matters formerly heard by the State Tax Commission as an appellate body, and the lack of any prior provision for administrative review of intercounty equalization decisions. This Court said that since there had not theretofore been <em>administrative </em>review of intercounty equalization decisions the Tax Tribunal was confined to reviewing intracounty equalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">So, too, here we should construe the \u00a7 31 language giving the Tax Tribunal jurisdiction to review a final decision relating to \"special assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>ments * * * under property tax laws\u201d in light of the historical treatment of actions challenging special assessments \u2014 which were maintained in the circuit court and not before the State Tax Commission \u2014 and the legislative intent to give the tribunal jurisdiction over matters formerly \"heard by the State Tax Commission as an appellate body.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The effort, in the opinion of the Court, to distinguish <em>Emmet County </em>on the ground that there it was proposed to insert an \"additional level of review in the process, thereby endangering the [state tax] commission\u2019s ability to function within the time limits established for the collection of taxes\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> is not persuasive. The Court today does precisely that: it inserts a new level of administrative review in the special assessment process. The levying of a special assessment was not heretofore subject to administrative review at the state level before a quasi-judicial tribunal. A special assessment levy, just as intercounty equalization (the issue in <em>Emmet County), </em>could be challenged only in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The opinion of the Court says that the \"review of special assessments by the tribunal will not endanger the timely and orderly collection of taxes or present the risks indicated in <em>Emmet County\u201d.</em><footnotemark><em>91</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Those statements are made on faith and without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>apparent recognition of the realities of the time frame involved in review by the Tax Tribunal or the consequences of an enlarged<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> scope of review <em>(de novo) </em>with a right of appeal, under the Tax Tribunal Act, to the Court of Appeals and a constitutional right to have the appellate court determine whether the judgment is supported by substantial evidence on the whole record.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In holding that the Tax Tribunal has jurisdiction, the Court has not simply construed the act to provide that actions formerly brought in the circuit court must now be brought before the Tax Tribunal. It has construed the act to provide for an entirely different kind of review, <em>de novo </em>review. See part VI below.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">There is much the same danger that interposing, at the state level, a level of administrative and enlarged review will impair the ability of local governmental units to levy special assessments as there would have been had this Court construed the Tax Tribunal Act to provide for review of intercounty equalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">M</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">We do not say or think that \"the Legislature made a mistake\u201d.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> The Legislature did just fine. It used words with a meaning fixed in the constitutional and legal history of this state and relied on this Court to discern that meaning. It is this Court that makes a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">The term \"special assessments\u201d appears, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>opinion of the Court points out,<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> in a number of places in the general property tax laws. That no doubt explains why the words \"special assessments\u201d were included in the \u00a7 31 jurisdictional statement. Otherwise, it might have been thought that administrative appeals from decisions relating to \"special assessments * * * under property tax laws\u201d, subject to the jurisdiction of the State Tax Commission, had not been transferred to the Tax Tribunal and remained subject to quasi-judicial review by the State Tax Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The opinion of the Court states, and we agree, \"[bjecause these provisions [referring to special assessments in The General Property Tax Act and in other laws collected in the chapter on real and personal property taxation] do not authorize any special assessments, they must refer to special assessments levied under other laws.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Although special assessments are <em>levied </em>under other laws, laws which are not property tax laws, \"these provisions\u201d (concerning [see part B below] the collection of special assessments and. the sale of property so assessed for nonpayment of special assessments) are laws or provisions of law which are property tax laws. Decisions respecting the <em>collection </em>of \"special assessments * * * under property tax laws\u201d are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">A decision to finance a public improvement by creating a special assessment district and levying a special assessment is not made under The Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>\u00a9ral Property Tax Act<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> or other <em>ad valorem </em>property tax laws or provisions of law which are subject to administration by the State Tax Commission. Rather, such a decision is made pursuant to authority conferred in the statutes defining the municipal powers of counties,<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> cities (home-rule<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>and fourth-class),<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> townships,<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> charter townships,<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> and other governmental bodies (county drain commissioners,<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> metropolitan districts<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> and villages)<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> which are not subject to administrative supervision by the State Tax Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The statutes authorizing the establishment of special assessment districts to finance local improvements and the levying of special assessments often give the assessing authority the option of either collecting the assessment or of turning the assessment roll over to the property tax collector.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> Thus, although special assessments are not <em>levied </em>\"under property tax laws\u201d, they may be <em>collected </em>by a tax collector under property tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The Tax Tribunal has said that the State Tax Commission had authority to exercise supervisory control over the actions of a tax collector respect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>ing special assessments,<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> for example a tax collector\u2019s refusal to collect a special assessment.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> An <em>ad valorem </em>property tax collector, when billing and collecting a special assessment, functions under procedures set forth in the property tax laws and his acts or failure to act have been regarded as decisions relating to special assessments under property tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Accordingly, action or non-action of a tax collec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>tor in respect to special assessments, although <em>levied </em>under laws or provisions of law which are not property tax laws, is subject to administrative supervision by the State Tax Commission when required to be <em>collected </em>pursuant to property tax laws and, since enactment of the Tax Tribunal Act, to the jurisdiction ov appeals transferred to the Tax Tribunal. The Tax Tribunal has jurisdiction under \u00a7 31 of decisions, formerly appealable to the State Tax Commission, relating to the collection of special assessments when required to be carried out \"under property tax laws\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The opinion of the Court argues that there is \"no basis for concluding\u201d that the Legislature meant to include within the Tax Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction only decisions concerning the \"ministerial acts involved in the collection of special assessments\u201d.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> The Legislature must have had a larger purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">We do not contend that when the Tax Tribunal Act was enacted the Legislature decided to subject decisions relating to the <em>collection </em>of special assessments to Tax Tribunal review but not decisions relating to the <em>levying </em>of special assessments, and that it therefore made a distinction between levying and collection. The distinction is not the result of conscious choice by the Legislature at the time of the enactment of the Tax Tribunal Act but rather follows from choices made long ago by the Legislature and the resulting circumstance that the State Tax Commission never had jurisdiction over decisions relating to <em>levying </em>but did have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>jurisdiction over decisions relating to <em>collection </em>pursuant to the property tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Since it was the Legislature\u2019s purpose to transfer to the Tax Tribunal jurisdiction over all the appellate business of the State Tax Commission, the Tax Tribunal Act was worded so that the Tax Tribunal would obtain jurisdiction of administrative appeals respecting special assessments. Administrative appeals were, however, limited to decisions under the property tax laws. The only decisions respecting special assessments under the property tax laws concern the collection of special assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The Legislature need not have had a larger purpose. The basic legislative decision, made long ago, was that local units of government may levy special assessments without state supervision and may use the existing <em>ad valorem </em>tax collection machinery, which is subject to state supervision, to collect the special assessment. The decision in 1974, when the Tax Tribunal Act was enacted, was simply to try to do a better job (by creating the Tax Tribunal) in an area of prior state involvement, not to expand that involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Merely because part of the business transferred was the infrequent review of a petition respecting collection, formerly appealable administratively, the Legislature need not have intended to transform altogether the review of local governmental decisions to levy special assessments by providing an administrative appeal at the state level in a relatively large number of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">The premise set forth in the opinion of the Court, that the Legislature would not have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>content with merely providing for review of the ministerial acts involved in the collection of special assessments, overlooks the difference between reviewing decisions of the governing body of a city or of a drain commissioner to finance a public improvement by a special assessment and apportioning such an assessment and reviewing the decision of a tax collector whether to bill and collect an assessment or to refuse to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Nor is it likely that the different means of review of the different decisions will, as argued in the opinion of the Court, \"result in forum shopping and increase the possibility of inconsistent decisions in similar cases\u201d.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> The jurisdiction of the State Tax Commission and of the Tax Tribunal with respect to <em>collection </em>does not extend to whether there is a special benefit to the property proposed to be specially assessed, the issue which is generally litigated in special assessment cases. The only issue that could be raised before the Tax Tribunal in regard to collection would be the rarely litigated one of whether the local unit of government had duly adopted, in accordance with procedural requirements, a special assessment roll which the tax collector is required to bill and collect.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> The danger of forum shopping or of inconsistent decisions in regard to matters of that kind, which infrequently are a matter of serious dispute, is small.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In construing a statute, a court properly looks at the results which will follow from alternate constructions. We do not therefore take issue with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>opinion of the Court for advancing \"policy\u201d arguments and considering, for example, whether the different means of review of the different decisions appear to be consonant with reason. Our difference of opinion does not concern methodology. We both pay homage to the same jurisprudential gods. We simply see different truths.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Section 41 of the Tax Tribunal Act provides that persons who were theretofore entitled to proceed before \"the state tax commission <em>or </em>circuit court\u201d for determination of a matter <em>\"subject to the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction </em>* * * shall proceed only\u201d before the tribunal.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">A'</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">For reasons already stated \u2014 a decision levying a special assessment is not made \"under property tax laws\u201d \u2014 a challenge to a special assessment is not a matter \"subject to the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">The history and antecedents of the Tax Tribunal Act \u2014 consistent with a literal reading of \u00a7 41\u2014 indicate a legislative intent to divest the circuit court of jurisdiction over matters which could be brought either before \"the state tax commission <em>or </em>the circuit court\u201d (emphasis supplied), not of mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>ters which could be brought only in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Before the enactment of the Tax Tribunal Act, a taxpayer had two means of obtaining relief from <em>ad valorem </em>property tax assessments. An administrative appeal could be filed with the State Tax Commission under \u00a7 152 of The General Property Tax Act.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> If the tax was paid under protest, an action could be commenced in circuit court for refund under \u00a7 53 of that act.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> The two remedies were not mutually exclusive; taxpayers could, and occasionally did, pursue both.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Although both remedies could be pursued, challenges to <em>ad valorem </em>property taxes asserting improper valuation were invariably made before the State Tax Commission, not the courts. The courts had exercised only a limited review of property tax assessments and had disavowed any power to set assessments. Almost without exception the courts had refused to disturb valuations set by tax agencies and would, at most, set aside a palpably erroneous assessment subject to proper reassessment. A taxpayer could obtain effective and final relief only before the State Tax Commission.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>The Tax Tribunal Act was enacted to create a specialized, full-time body to hear all property tax appeals.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> The combination in one body, the State Tax Commission, of both the supervisory and the review function was eliminated; henceforth, taxpayers would have an administrative appeal to a tribunal not directly involved in the assessment process, and the State Tax Commission would devote itself solely to administrative supervision of the assessment and collection process. To provide a unified procedure, it was necessary to vest the tribunal with exclusive jurisdiction of all property tax challenges. The Tax Tribunal Act thus established a forum, the Tax Tribunal, to hear appeals formerly reviewed administratively by the State Tax Commission under \u00a7 152 and judicially through circuit court refund actions under \u00a7 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Because a challenge to a special assessment levy on the ground that there was no special benefit was not formerly heard by the State Tax Commission, the jurisdiction exercised by the circuit court to hear a challenge to a special assessment levy was not alternative or supplemental to an administrative appeal to the State Tax Commission. The judicial remedy was the only remedy and, in the limited kinds of cases where judicial relief was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>granted, the courts provided, in contrast with <em>ad valorem </em>property tax appeals, an effective remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In eliminating the duplicative and essentially ineffectual jurisdiction of the circuit court in <em>ad valorem </em>property tax appeals, there was no purpose to eliminate circuit court jurisdiction where the judicial remedy had no administrative parallel and the circuit court had provided an effective remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Indeed, where an action for refund in a court had been an effective remedy, the Legislature, in subsequent legislation affecting the Tax Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, continued court jurisdiction <em>although the court remedy was duplicative </em>of administrative review by the Tax Tribunal. Court jurisdiction was continued notwithstanding the \"proliferation\u201d of remedies, \"problems of forum shopping\u201d and \"possibility of inconsistent decisions\u201d.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> In the final resolution, in 1980, of the legislative process adding administrative appeals concerning <em>state </em>taxes formerly heard by the Board of Tax Appeals to the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal, the Legislature preserved the taxpayer\u2019s alternative judicial remedy by providing that a taxpayer who pays an asserted deficiency under protest may commence an action for refund in the Court of Claims.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>The language of \u00a741 of the Tax Tribunal Act (\"before the state tax commission <em>or </em>circuit court\u201d) (emphasis supplied) refers quite clearly to contests concerning <em>ad valorem </em>property taxes which, uniquely, could have theretofore been brought either as an administrative appeal \"before the state tax commission\u201d under \u00a7 152 of The General Property Tax Act \"or ['before the\u2019] circuit court\u201d for a refund of taxes paid under \u00a7 53 of that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Persons who theretofore challenged the levy of a special assessment were <em>not </em>entitled to proceed \"before the state tax commission <em>or </em>circuit court\u201d (emphasis supplied). A property owner seeking to challenge a special assessment levy could proceed <em>only </em>in the circuit court.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The opinion of the Court states that \u00a7 41 \"implemento] the tribunal\u2019s broad-based jurisdiction over proceedings previously conducted <em>both </em>before the State Tax Commission and the circuit court\u201d<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied). Challenges to the levying of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>special assessment were not, however, \"previously conducted both before the State Tax Commission and the circuit court\u201d but only in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The last quoted statement in the opinion of the Court was the predicate of the argument, \"[because the tribunal has jurisdiction over matters formerly heard in circuit court, its jurisdiction is not limited to matters heard by the State Tax Commission. This reasoning is particularly applicable to special assessments, because many of the actions challenging special assessments were heard in circuit court\u201d.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> The argument ignores that everything \"previously conducted both before the State Tax Commission and the circuit court\u201d was formerly heard in the State Tax Commission as well as formerly heard in the circuit court. It does not follow that matters (appeals from special assessment levies) <em>not </em>formerly heard in the State Tax Commission, matters which formerly could only be heard in the circuit court, are now within the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal simply because they were formerly heard in the circuit court. Only matters \"previously conducted both before the State Tax Commission and the circuit court\u201d are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">This Court has said that it is to be presumed, in reviewing a claim that a statute has divested a court of original and general authority of a measure of its jurisdiction, that the court retains its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>authority.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> It is assumed that if divestiture of jurisdiction is intended the Legislature will express itself \"with clearness and leave nothing for the play of doubt and uncertainty\u201d.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> There is a parallel rule of strict construction applicable where, as here, it is claimed that language of a statute is in derogation of the jurisdiction of the circuit court.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">For reasons already stated at length, an intent to divest the circuit court of its jurisdiction over an action to set aside and enjoin the collection of a special assessment on the ground that no special benefit will be conferred by the improvement has not been stated in the Tax Tribunal Act in unambiguous terms, \"with clearness * * * leav[ing] nothing for the play of doubt and uncertainty\u201d. An intent to divest general jurisdiction must be indicated with greater clarity and certainty than is evidenced by this act.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">Today\u2019s holding, that the Tax Tribunal has jurisdiction, works a significant substantive enlargement of the scope of review of special assessments. It does not merely change the forum in which review will occur. The enlarged scope of review provides additional opportunities for objectors to employ delaying tactics with resulting increases in the cost of local improvements if bonds to pay for the cost of the improvement cannot be sold during the pendency of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">In circuit court challenges to special assessments levied by cities, drain commissioners and other local governmental authorities, the courts of this state have confined the judicial inquiry to the lawfulness of the special assessment and whether there is a special benefit and have generally refused to review the apportionment of benefits.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Section 35 of the Tax Tribunal Act provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>\"[a] proceeding before the tribunal shall be original and independent and should be considered de novo\u201d.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">As a result of today\u2019s decision, persons protesting special assessments levied under the home-rule cities act, the Drain Code or other enabling legislation can obtain a Tax Tribunal redetermination of the apportionment of benefits in an \"original\u201d, \"independent\u201d, <em>\"de novo\u201d </em>proceeding \u2014 contrary to the sense of the Drain Code and to well-established judicial precedents regarding special assessments generally \u2014 with appellate review as of right, under the Tax Tribunal Act, by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Because a decision of the Tax Tribunal relating to special assessments is, we all agree, not a \"decision relating to valuation\u201d<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> the appellate review would include, as a constitutional minimum, a determination of whether the Tax Tribunal\u2019s decision is \"supported by competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record\u201d.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">In an effort to avoid the delays of judicial proceedings, the Drain Code provides that proceedings to establish a drain shall be subject to review on certiorari in the circuit court within ten days after a copy of the final order is filed in the office of the drain commissioner and, if no certiorari be brought within the time prescribed, \"the drain shall be deemed to have been legally established, and the taxes therefor legally levied, and the legality of said drain and the taxes therefor shall not thereafter be questioned in any suit at law or equity\u201d.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">This Court has held that review on certiorari is limited and that complaints concerning the apportionment of the benefit are not subject to review in certiorari proceedings; absent fraud (actual or constructive) the determination of the board constituted by the probate court<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> for the apportionment of benefits is final.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> Generally, a court of equity will intervene only when it is demonstrated that there is no special benefit at all or that the assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>ment or levy was made without statutory authorization.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">This Court has similarly so held in actions brought in the circuit court complaining of special assessments by cities and other local units of government. The rule is that a court of equity will not substitute its judgment and \"weigh the benefits, if, in truth, there are benefits to be weighed\u201d, <em>Fluckey v Plymouth, </em>358 Mich 447; 100 NW2d 486 (1960), and will intervene only where there is an absence of benefit. <em>Fluckey, supra; Brill v Grand Rapids, </em>383 Mich 216; 174 NW2d 832 (1970); <em>Johnson v Inkster, </em>401 Mich 263; 258 NW2d 24 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The Drain Code provides that if certiorari proceedings are brought and the proceedings are \"sustained, the party bringing the certiorari shall be liable for the costs thereof, and if they be not sustained, the parties making application for the drain shall be liable for the costs\u201d.<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> Presumably, this provision of the Drain Code is now also superseded upon substitution of Tax Tribunal review for certiorari review. This Court having scrapped the sections of the Drain Code concerning judicial review and the time for review may find it difficult to justify a holding that the Tax Tribunal has authority to apply a provision applicable to a procedure which this Court has ruled has been eliminated by the Tax Tribunal Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Under the practice prevailing before the adop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>tion of the Tax Tribunal Act, a city or a drain commissioner could seek summary disposition or early trial, and, because the courts did not provide independent, <em>de novo </em>review, insubstantial claims were disposed of readily.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">But now, a property owner who formerly could not challenge the apportionment of benefits by a board constituted by a probate court under the Drain Code, who formerly was limited to certiorari review in the circuit court, who could challenge a local assessment made by a city only if he could show an absence of benefit or that the special assessment was not lawfully made, will be able to obtain an independent, <em>de novo </em>review of the apportionment of benefits as well as of a claim that there is no benefit at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Substituting Tax Tribunal review for circuit court review is not likely to reduce, and is more likely to facilitate, further appeals to the Court of Appeals and to this Court. Decisions of the Tax Tribunal not related to valuation or allocation must, under the minimum constitutional standard, be reviewed by the Court of Appeals to determine whether they are supported by competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Providing for review of apportionment of benefits works a profound change in the appellate procedures respecting decisions levying drain and other local special assessments. The cost of most local improvements is funded through bond issues. The pendency of litigation may prevent the sale of bonds. Providing additional avenues for litigation may thus result in significant delays in the sale of bonds with attendant additional construction and other costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>The Legislature desired to facilitate the speedy construction of drain projects and to protect against unfounded litigation by imposing tight time limits and restrictions on appellate review and by providing for the assessment of costs. There is no reason to suppose that in adopting the Tax Tribunal Act to address problems in the administration of the property tax laws the Legislature wished to so alter the scope of review and to work such a dramatic change in the levying and collection of special assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">In the instant case, Novi expects that if it succeeds in persuading this Court that the Tax Tribunal has jurisdiction that it will prevail because this action was not commenced before the Tax Tribunal within the 30-day time limit provided for filing an appeal.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> In a case where the property owners are seeking to have the amount of a special benefit reapportioned, cities may rue the day on which it was established that property owners have the right to independent <em>de novo </em>review of the apportionment of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The opinion of the Court argues that because the Court of Appeals has consistently decided, beginning five years ago in a conclusory opinion,<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>that the Tax Tribunal has jurisdiction of a petition to review the levy of a special assessment, and because the Legislature did not, when amending the Tax Tribunal Act in 1978 or 1980, respond to the Court of Appeals decisions, there has been legislative approval of those decisions.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Some statutes are frequently amended, <em>e.g., </em>the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act of 1969, The General Property Tax Act, the Revised Judicature Act of 1961, the Revised Probate Code, the Insurance Code of 1956, and the Michigan Penal C\u00f3de, to name just a few. This Court cannot seriously regard a failure to incorporate in an amendatory act corrective action in respect to a judicial decision as bicameral and gubernatorial approval of such judicial decision, especially where the sections affected by the amendatory act were not those construed in the judicial decision, only three years intervened between the judicial decision and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>the enactment of the amendatory act affecting other sections, and the judicial decision is of the Court of Appeals and not of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">There are other argued cases awaiting decision in this Court which could readily be disposed of by this Court if all that we need to do is to look at the passage of time since a judicial pronouncement (not of the Court of Appeals <em>but of this Court) </em>and the Legislature\u2019s failure to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The opinion of the Court refers to an \"initially\u201d circulated opinion which preceded the filing of a responsive opinion by the writer of this opinion<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> and states that the initially filed opinion addressed the issues briefed and argued by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">An issue briefed and argued by the parties was whether the circuit court has jurisdiction. In arguing that issue, the Wikmans and the other plaintiffs contended that a proceeding challenging the levy of a special assessment sounds in equity and therefore the circuit court continues to have jurisdiction. They did not make the argument advanced in this opinion concerning the meaning of \"property tax laws\u201d as words limiting the jurisdiction of the Tax Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">One can say that the issue was raised or one can say that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">The initially filed opinion provided, as did the Court of Appeals, for remand of this cause to the Tax Tribunal. Implicit in that decision is that the Tax Tribunal has jurisdiction. The initially filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>opinion so declared and the opinion of the Court so declares.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The opinion of the Court relies (as did the initially filed opinion) on decisions of the Court of Appeals declaring that the Tax Tribunal has jurisdiction and cites decisions of that Court as authoritative. To have ignored the proposed action to remand to the Tax Tribunal because the Wikmans and the other plaintiffs did not make the argument for circuit court jurisdiction advanced in this opinion, but only the argument that the circuit court has jurisdiction as a court of equity, would be to add to that body of \"precedent\u201d by default. The jurisdiction of the circuit court over special assessments would then, as a practical matter, be ousted by the consent of the litigants in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The decision of this Court in this cause, remanding the cause to the Tax Tribunal, will be read by the Tax Tribunal, by the circuit courts, and by the Court of Appeals as dispositive of the question of whether an action challenging a special assessment levy may or, indeed, must be brought before the Tax Tribunal or whether it. can continue to be brought and maintained in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">This Court has an obligation, when construing a statute concerning the jurisdiction of the circuit court and an administrative tribunal, to consider all the language of the statute \u2014 in the instant case, the term \"property tax laws\u201d \u2014 although the briefs of counsel fail to advert to all the language. The Court is not limited by counsels\u2019 presentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">This is not ordinary litigation in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Court can rest decision upon omissions of counsel or of the parties in the course of litigation. The Court has a responsibility to the other persons who will, as a practical matter, be governed by this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The issue goes to the jurisdiction of the circuit courts and the Tax Tribunal. It cannot be waived by the parties or their counsel.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> Indeed, the defendants, Novi and its treasurer, did not raise the jurisdictional issue until after the trial and the matter was on appeal to the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The question of the meaning of \"property tax laws\u201d could be posed to the litigants and amicus briefs could be invited from the Michigan Association of Counties, Michigan Municipal League, Michigan Townships Association, county drain commissioners and others before deciding or appearing to decide the question. I would favor that course because I agree with the view expressed in the opinion of the Court that we should not decide a question without providing an opportunity for adversary presentation. Despite the long delay in deciding this issue, it is of far greater importance that it be decided correctly than that it be decided today.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>IX</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The circuit judge found that the Wikmans and the other plaintiffs would receive no special benefit from the proposed improvements to Taft Road over and above those enjoyed by the public at large.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> In a number of cases, this Court has held that such a finding entitles property owners to equitable relief from a special assessment although they failed to observe statutorily prescribed procedures for contesting a special assessment.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">If it were necessary to decision \u2014 although as we would construe the Tax Tribunal Act it is not \u2014 we would nevertheless be inclined to agree with the opinion of the Court that an equitable remedy is not available in the instant case.<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> .</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The general rule heretofore has been that courts will not review the judgment of a governmental authority establishing a special assessment district or the apportionment of benefits, but that such deference to the finding of a governmental authority is not warranted and equitable relief is available where the property owner shows that the governmental authority acted without a factual predicate \u2014 without lawful authority or in the absence of special benefit.<footnotemark>145</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">The holding, in the opinion of the Court, that the Tax Tribunal has jurisdiction means that re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>view of the entire matter, factually, on the merits, in an independent, original <em>de novo </em>hearing,<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> is obtainable in a quasi-judicial proceeding. The Tax Tribunal will presumably approach its reviewing responsibility with care. Concern about the adequacy of factual determinations where they are made upon a hearing conducted by the city or other governmental authority levying the special assessment is not likely to provide a basis for equitable intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Nor does it appear that there is any need to enjoin collection of a special assessment in order to provide an adequate remedy. While the Tax Tribunal Act requires payment of <em>ad valorem </em>property taxes as a precondition to a hearing, there is no such requirement for other matters within the Tax Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have no need for temporary injunctive relief unless their property is about to be sold, before final decision of the Tax Tribunal and on any appeals therefrom, for nonpayment of the special assessment. A favorable decision by the Tax Tribunal or on appeal would have the effect of a permanent injunction against collection of the special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">There is no need to decide in this case whether a class action can be maintained in equity to enjoin a special assessment. This is not a class action. Plaintiffs, 45 persons owning 34 separate homes, joined together to bring this action. While it appears that each property owner may be required to pay $50 to commence a proceeding before the Tax Tribunal, it has not been asserted that in the circumstances of the instant case the Tax Tribunal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>remedy is for that reason inadequate. In <em>Romulus City Treasurer v Wayne County Drain Comm\u2019r, post, </em>p 728, decided today, we explore the class action question.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">We would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the cause to it for consideration of the other issues raised by the city\u2019s appeal and the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b821-7\">Kavanagh, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-5\"> The plaintiffs first contested the special assessment in public hearings held by the Novi City Council. They asserted that the affected property owners would not be specially benefited by the proposed improvement and that its cost should be spread against the entire city.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The city treasurer notified the plaintiffs by letters dated May 14, 1976, that the city council had confirmed the special assessment on April 26, 1976. The letters also stated the amount of the special assessment apportioned to the addressee property owner and that the first installment would be reflected in the 1976 city tax bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The plaintiffs filed this action in circuit court on June 9, 1976, reiterating the objections raised at the public hearing. They asked that the special assessment be adjudged illegal and void, .that their property be discharged of any liens, and that an injunction be entered restraining all efforts to assess and collect the special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">The defendants, Novi and its treasurer, contend that an appeal from a special assessment must be brought within 30 days (see fn 134) of confirmation of the assessment roll before the Tax Tribunal, and that plaintiffs\u2019 asserted error \u2014 not noticed by defendants until the cause reached the Court of Appeals on appeal by the defendants from an adverse determination on the merits \u2014 in bringing their appeal in the wrong forum bars any relief because the 30-day time limit has long ago expired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-9\"> The verdict of an advisory jury was that the paving of Taft Road did not confer additional benefit upon the property of the plaintiffs over and above that conferred upon the general public of Novi.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">The circuit judge entered the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">\"I. Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">\"1.

That these total improvements changed the character of this essentially rural road to that of a through road or a thoroughfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-14\">\"3.

I don\u2019t think this property is worth $10,000. I think it\u2019s worth $9,500.\u2019 That is just impossible if you\u2019re going to have a property tax law that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>will work. And that is all that we were trying to get at. Never, never in the world can we have a judge substitute his opinion for the opinion of the assessors and have tax machinery that you can live with. Now, when there is a matter of bad faith, when there is a matter of fraud, an illegal tax, the remedy in the court is ready any time. You always can get in court on those things. All we\u2019re talking about is the matter of fixing the value upon which property is to be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ads\">\u201cIf the assessment is illegal, you don\u2019t wait until you\u2019ve gone through the state tax commission. You have a remedy immediately on an assessment that is illegal, in the circuit court of your own county. This is just a matter of the fixing of the value \u2014 nothing else\u2014 for the decision of the tax allocation board. I. think our wording excludes everything else.</p>\n<p id=\"A8q\">\"Mr. <em>Allen: </em>Mr. President, I would also dispute Mr. Hatch\u2019s point. I think he feels that somehow or other we\u2019re limiting, by this amendment, the right of appeal from the state tax commission that now exists. All we\u2019re trying to do in this is to say that on state tax commission matters we preserve all the rights that already exist but we are not going to go further and allow the court to substitute its judgment and become an assessor.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag2\">\"We also are concerned about the question of time that is involved; in the inability of local units to spread their rolls where you first have the appeal to the state tax commission and then another appeal. The amendment is s designed to protect all the existing rights, and I haven\u2019t heard complaints on appeals from the state tax commission. I don\u2019t think we have a problem there.

The findings of fact of the state tax commission are normally highly technical determinations of valuations for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>either assessment or equalization purposes. They should not be disturbed except in the case of fraud. No evidence has been given to demonstrate any abuse of this power on the part of the tax commission and therefore this constitution should not contain a restrictive provision which will result in costly delays in the proceedings for the assessment and collection of property taxes to the detriment of all local units of government. The property tax is and will remain the single most important revenue source for such local units, and unless appeals on matters of assessment and equalization can be handled in an expeditious manner, the furnishing of local services will be interfered with and our citizens will suffer. To open up full review of determination of facts on assessments and equalization will only serve to establish the supreme court of Michigan as a super assessor and will result in disturbing the uniform application of assessing principles by the state tax commission.

In OAG, 1979-1980, No 5706, p 770 (May 13, 1980), it was determined that a so-called special assessment against all of the property within a municipality to finance a municipal ambulance service would be, in effect, a general tax subject to the voter approval requirements of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 31. The reason for the conclusion was that a municipal-wide levy for such a purpose is not a special assessment since it would be for the benefit of all of the residents thereof and would confer no special benefit on the property assessed.\u201d OAG, 1981, No 6018 (December 22, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"AHm\">While the Drain Code provides that \"[a]U apportionments of benefits under the provisions of this act shall be upon the principle of benefits derived\u201d, MCL 280.152; MSA 11.1152, it permits a levy of an entire municipality\u2019s share of a special assessment against the municipality, MCL 280.151; MSA 11.1151, which must then levy the same amount against all individual property owners in the municipality <em>ad valorem, </em>MCL 280.263; MSA 11.1263.
