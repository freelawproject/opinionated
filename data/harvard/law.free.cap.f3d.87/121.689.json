In challenging his sentence, Flanagan asserts error by the district court in (1) basing his sentence on penalties for cocaine base instead of powder cocaine and in relation thereto in refusing to consider scientific testimony from another district court case in another circuit; and (2) refusing to consider Flanagan\u2019s eligibility for the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 which permits departure below the statutory minimum sentence. Although, based on binding precedent, we reject Flanagan\u2019s contentions regarding the cocaine base/powder cocaine dichotomy, we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing in light of \u00a7 5C1.2, which the district court mistakenly believed it was precluded from applying, due to the mandatory minimum sentence requirements of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b200-17\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b200-18\">After initially pleading \u201cnot guilty,\u201d Terrance Merrill Flanagan entered into a plea agreement in which he pleaded guilty to Count XXI of a 23-count indictment, in which he and 10 co-defendants were charged with various cocaine-distribution offenses. In his plea agreement\u2019s factual recitation, Flanagan admitted that he and Wesley Harris transported 425 grams of crack cocaine from Houston to Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-19\">The Presentence Report (PSR) contains the following recommendations: Flanagan\u2019s base offense level is 34 because he was responsible for 425 grams of crack cocaine. He is entitled to a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The result of Flanagan\u2019s total offense level (32) and his criminal history score (Category I; Flanagan had no criminal history points) produces a guideline sentencing range of 121-151 months. The statute under which he was convicted required a minimum prison term of 10 years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-20\">Flanagan objected, contending that he was entitled to a third point for acceptance of responsibility. The Probation Office did not oppose this objection and observed that the additional one-point reduction lowered his total offense level to 31 and his guideline range to 108-135 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-21\">Flanagan also insisted that he \u201cshould be sentenced based on the penalty for powder cocaine, rather than the penalty for crack cocaine.\u201d By motion he urged the court to adopt the sentencing hearing transcript of defendant Jerry Jones (\u201cthe Jones transcript\u201d) from <em>United States v. Davis, </em>864 F.Supp. 1303 (N.D.Ga.1994), in which four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>scientific experts purportedly testified that cocaine powder and cocaine base are chemically indistinguishable. Flanagan maintains that the Jones transcript was admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 201(b)(2), in that the accuracy of the testimony therein \u201ccannot be reasonably questioned.\u201d He argued that, under the rule of lenity, the penalties for cocaine powder should be applied; they would produce a total offense level of only 21 and a guideline range of only 37-46. months.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Recognizing that the statutory mandatory minimum sentence was 10 years, Flanagan also urged the court to depart downward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 (\u201csafety valve\u201d) or U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0. He contended that he met all five criteria set forth in \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Without giving an explanation the district court denied Flanagan\u2019s motion to adopt the Jones transcript, but permitted him to \u201cproffer the transcript at sentencing in anticipation of the appeal of this matter.\u201d At the sentencing hearing two days later, Flanagan proffered the testimony from the Jones transcript, but the court refused to consider it, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">[L]et me just say for the record, in case this case is taken up on appeal, I want the court\u2019s position known ... that if they want to equalize it, that if fine. We will adopt the crack cocaine standard rather than the powder cocaine standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The court did not address Flanagan\u2019s contention regarding the chemical equivalency of the two types of cocaine. Additionally, the court denied Flanagan\u2019s request for \u201cthe lowest possible sentence available,\u201d stating, \u201cI don\u2019t have that freedom,\u201d then sentenced him to 120 months in prison and a five-year supervised release term. Flanagan timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">A <em>Penalties for powder cocaine and cocaine base and district court\u2019s denial of motion to introduce Jones transcript</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">Acknowledging that we have already rejected Equal Protection challenges to the disparity in penalties for offenses involving powder \u25a0 and crack cocaine, Flanagan contends that his argument concerning the chemical eongruity of the two types of cocaine presents a different issue. He maintains that the expert testimony reflected by the Jones transcript shows- that \u201ccocaine\u201d and \u201ccocaine base\u201d are interchangeable. He argues that because this identity creates an ambiguity in the law, the rule of lenity requires the court to apply powder cocaine\u2019s lesser penalties. Flanagan insists that the Jones transcript should have been admitted under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1), as an exception to the hearsay rule, because the declarants were unavailable as witnesses and hearsay evidence is admissible during sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">After an evidentiary hearing \u201cat which four experts were qualified and testified,\u201d the <em>Davis </em>court found that cocaine base was synonymous with cocaine within the scientific community and that there \u201cwas also unanimous agreement among all four experts that the term \u2018crack\u2019 as it relates to cocaine substances does not have a fixed meaning in the scientific community.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>864 F.Supp. at 1304-05 (footnote omitted). That court concluded, as a matter of law, that it must \u201capply the lesser statutory penalties for cocaine rather than hundred-fold greater penalties for the possession of cocaine base,\u201d because the ambiguity \u201cabout the reach of a criminal statute or the penalties to be imposed\u201d requires the application of the rule of lenity. <em>Id. </em>at 1305-06 (citing <em>Bifulco v. United States, </em>447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 2252, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980)). Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-14\">based on the total unanimity of opinion of the four experts, ... there is unquestioned ambiguity on the face of the statute, and, unless it could be said that the legislative history or public policy concerns alter the outcome, the rule of lenity must be applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-15\"><em>Davis, </em>864 F.Supp. at 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-16\">We have not yet published an opinion addressing the contention, based explicitly on either the <em>Davis </em>testimony or other expert scientific testimony, that \u2014 because the chem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>icals are chemically indistinguishable<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 the penalty provisions for cocaine base and powder cocaine are ambiguous. We have, however, rejected such challenges in several unpublished opinions. <em>See e.g., United States v. Lewis, </em>No. 95-60131, at 1-2, 70 F.3d 1268 (5th Cir. Oct. 19, 1995) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Lampkin, </em>No. 95-30131, at 2-4, 68 F.3d 467 (5th Cir. Aug. 25, 1995) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Martin, </em>No. 95-30335, at 4 &amp; n. 6, 79 F.3d 1143 (5th Cir. Feb. 5, 1996) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>No. 95-30946, at 5-6, 85 F.3d 625 (5th Cir. May 1, 1996) (unpublished). <em>Lewis </em>and <em>Lampkin </em>were issued before January 1, 1996, and are precedent. <em>See </em>5th Cir. Rule 47.5.3. As these opinions constitute binding precedent, they foreclose Flanagan\u2019s argument based on <em>Davis, </em>so we need not and therefore do not address his contention that the district court should have admitted the Jones transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">B. <em>Refusal to Depart Downward Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Flanagan contends that he was entitled to a downward departure from the mandatory minimum sentence because he meets all five \u201csafety valve\u201d criteria set forth in <em>U.S.S.G. </em>\u00a7 5C1.2, and observes that the district court failed to make factual findings regarding the application of \u00a7 5C1.2. Although he does not explain how he met each <em>of </em>the five criteria, he argues that \u201cit is not necessary\u201d to make such arguments now because he raises the issue only to \u201cpreserve its viability on remand to the Trial Court.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Flanagan has not abandoned his \u00a7 5C1.2 claim, but he has abandoned his claim that he was entitled to a departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.0. <em>See id.; Yo-hey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The government counters by urging that we lack jurisdiction to address the \u00a7 5C1.2 claim unless Flanagan shows that the \u201cdistrict court violated some law or erroneously believed [it] was without authority to depart downward.\u201d Flanagan did not orally renew his request for a \u00a7 5C1.2 reduction at his sentencing hearing. He did, though, raise the issue in his sentencing memorandum, and that was sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal. We apply the \u201cplain error\u201d standard when a defendant \u201cfail[s] to object to the PSR <em>or </em>at the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>See United States v. McCaskey, </em>9 F.3d 368, 376 (5th Cir.1993) (emphasis added), <em>certdenied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 1565, 128 L.Ed.2d 211 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">\u201cU.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 is a \u2018safety valve\u2019 provision which allows qualified defendants to escape the applicable statutory minimum sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>65 F.3d 430, 433 (5th Cir.1995) (citation omitted). A defendant convicted of an offense under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 shall be sentenced \u201cin accordance with the applicable guidelines\u201d without regard to any statutory minimum sentence, if the court finds that he satisfies five criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-12\">(1) the defendant does not have more than 1 criminal history point, as determined under the sentencing guidelines;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-13\">(2) the defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection with the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-14\">(3) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-15\">(4) the defendant was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense ...; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-16\">(5) not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the fact that the defendant has no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the Government is already aware of the information shall not preclude a determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><em>See id.; </em>\u00a7 5C1.2. We review a sentencing court\u2019s legal interpretation of the guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Rodriguez, </em>60 F.3d 193, 195 (5th Cir.) (applying \u00a7 5C1.2), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 542, 133 L.Ed.2d 446 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Flanagan\u2019s guideline sentencing range was 108 to 135 months. There is no indication in the record that Flanagan fails to meet any of the five \u00a7 5C1.2 criteria.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, if he meets all five, the court had authority to reduce Flanagan\u2019s sentence to 108 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">We \u201cuphold a sentence unless it is imposed in violation of law, results from a misapplication of the guidelines, or is an unreasonable departure from the applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. Akin, </em>62 F.3d 700, 701 (5th Cir.1995). Although we lack jurisdiction to review a defendant\u2019s challenge to his sentence based on mere dissatisfaction with the court\u2019s refusal to grant to a downward departure, we may do so if the court\u2019s refusal was the result of a violation of law. <em>United States v. Burleson, </em>22 F.3d 93, <em>94-95 </em>(5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 115 S.Ct. 283, 130 L.Ed.2d 199 (1994). A refusal to depart is a violation of law only if the court mistakenly assumed that it lacked the authority to depart. <em>Id. </em>at 95; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">Here, the district court noted that Flanagan\u2019s involvement was \u201csubstantial,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-13\"><em>[I]f I had any freedom </em>in the matter, I might be inclined [to depart downward] because of [Flanagan\u2019s] youth and all, not to sentence him to that much time, but ... <em>I don\u2019t have that freedom. I have got to be bound by the law. The law says that the minimum is hundred and twenty months.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">This language confirms that the court did not consider the criteria listed in \u00a7 5C1.2, and mistakenly believed that it was bound by the mandatory minimum sentence set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Clearly it was not; that is what the safety valve provision is all about. The court\u2019s mistaken belief satisfies the <em>Burleson </em>test for a violation of law in refusing to depart downward for incorrectly assuming that it lacked authority to do so. We therefore vacate Flanagan\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing following a full exploration of the applicability of \u00a7 5C1.2 to Flanagan\u2019s situation. <em>See United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-15\">VACATED and REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-7\">. We have stated that, \"when cocaine is changed into cocaine base, it becomes a different chemical substance.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>932 F.2d 1085, 1090 (5th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 1038, 112 S.Ct. 887, 116 L.Ed.2d 791 (1992). It cannot be determined from reading the <em>Thomas </em>opinion whether scientific testimony was introduced or proffered, however. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-17\">. Although this statement suggests that Flanagan is effectively abandoning this contention because he is not adequately briefing it on appeal, <em>see Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 225, the statement also reflects Flanagan\u2019s awareness that we cannot make the required factual findings for the first time on appeal anyway.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b203-11\">. Recently we held that, under \u00a7 5C1.2(5), the defendant has the affirmative burden of providing the government with all information and evidence regarding the offense; the government is not required to solicit such information. <em>United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 146 (5th Cir. 1996) (no apparent relationship to Defendant-Appellant herein). Flanagan may have satisfied this criterion when he \"acknowledged his participation and involvement in the instant offense\u201d in connection with accepting responsibility-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b203-17\">. The Government notes this statement by the court, apparently implying that the court was finding that Flanagan's \"substantial\u201d involvement disqualified him from receiving the \u00a7 5C1.2 reduction. <em>See </em>red brief at 16. However, none of the \u00a7 5C1.2 criteria addresses whether a defendant had \"substantial\u201d or minimal involvement in the offense. See \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
