Upon such examination they have become convinced, upon the authority of Donald Wade v. Nathan Mayo, 1948, 68 S.Ct. 1270, not only that the certificate should issue, but that the judgment should be reversed. It is, therefore, ordered that a certificate of probable cause issue, and that the judgment be reversed and the cause remanded for trial of the issues tendered on appellant\u2019s application for the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
