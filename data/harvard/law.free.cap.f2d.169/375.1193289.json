The corporate appellant was fined $3,000, and the appellant Bavouset was placed on five years\u2019 probation, imposition of sentence upon him having been suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">The trial was without a jury, a jury trial and special findings of fact having been specifically waived in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">1. The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"AHJ\">(a) \u201cIndoform\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">It was stipulated as to Counts I and II that a number of vials of \u201cIndoform\u201d were shipped by the appellants on or about September 17, 1945, from Pasadena, California, to Dr. Joseph C. Bunten, Cheyenne, Wyoming. One vial was picked up as a sample by Ralph M. Davidson, a Federal Food and Drug Inspector, on or about January 24, 1946, from Dr. Bunten, and was sealed and mailed to the Food and Drug Administration at Washington, D. C., hereinafter referred to as the Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">The vials carried labels announcing that each cubic centimeter of the drug contained three International Units of posterior pituitary and one grain of \u201cthyroid substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">On February 18, 1946, Arnold E. Mason, at that time employed by the Administration as pharmacologist and analyst, examined the contents of the sample vial. He testified that he \u201cfound practically no posterior pituitary in that product, an almost immeasurable quantity.\u201d After conducting the test, Mason replaced the bottle into a locked refrigerator until the next day, when he wrapped it and put a seal on it. The vial was sent to San Francisco, according to his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">Mason was asked hypothetical questions, objected to by the appellant, as to whether the drug had contained three international units on the date of shipment, September 17, 1945. The questions assumed that the product had not been exposed to the \u201cdestructive temperature\u201d of 212 degrees, had been handled in \u201ca normal and careful manner,\u201d and had been tested as Mason had already stated on the stand. Mason answered that it was his opinion that on the date in question \u201cthere was a quantity of posterior pituitary which was not measurable by the standard methods of measuring it, or there was none.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">On March 27, 1946, Andrew G. Buell, a chemist for the Administration, stationed at San Francisco, broke Mason\u2019s seal on the paper wrapper around the vial and examined the product for \u201cthyroid content.\u201d He testified that \u201cThere was no thyroid present whatsoever.\u201d After he made his examination, he \u201cimmediately\u201d put his seal on the bottle. The seal was dated March 28, the day after he examined the contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-17\">(b) The Deficient Pluri-B</p>\n<p id=\"b441-18\">As stipulated, a number of vials that form the basis of Counts III and IV were shipped by the appellants to Dr. Clement Swaim, Reno, Nevada, on July 16, 1945. Inspector Frank A. Griebling, of the Administration, picked up two of these vials, which contained Pluri-B, from Dr. Swaim, on August 30, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-19\">The inspector sealed the vials and contents with official seals, and forwarded them by, mail to the Vitamin Division of the Administration at Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-20\">Hubert H. Capps, a chemist of the Administration, examined one of the vials on September 24, 1945. Although the label on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the vial sets forth that this \u201cSterile Solution of Pluri-B\u201d contains 50 milligrams of Thiamine Hydrochloride, per cubic centimeter, Capps testified that he found it contained approximately only 33 milligrams per cc.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The Government chemist also stated that at the time he received the vial, it had the same cap that it had at the time when he was testifying, \u201cor one very similar to it,\u201d adding that \u201csince this does not appear to be broken, I think that, it did have that identical cap.\u201d He also said, however, that he did not make any examination of the cap to determine whether or not it was punctured in any way, \u201cother than just looking at it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">During the direct examination of Capps, he was asked the following hypothetical question, which the appellants contend was improper because it assumed facts none of which \u201care supported by any evidence whatever\u201d :</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u201cNow, assuming that the product received ordinary and reasonable care, and was not exposed to excessive heats, such as heats any more than would be normal from shipping and the weather, and basing upon what you found on September 24, 1945, tfye amount of the B-l or thiamine chloride that you found, have you an opinion as to what percentage or what amount that product, substance, or solution had on or about July 16, 1945, the date it was originally shipped?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Capps replied that he believed that it did not contain more than 33 milligrams of thiamine hydrochloride per cubic centimeter.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">(c) The Contaminated Pluri-B</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">According to the stipulation, a number of vials with labels, which form the subject-matter of Count VII, were shipped by the appellants on June 18, 1946, to Dr. P. M. Ryerson, Phoenix, Arizona. The vials contained \u201cPluri-B,\u201d and, according to the labels, the contents were \u201cfor intramuscular or intravenous use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">On or about July 12, 1946, Maurice P. Kerr, an inspector for the Administration, collected a sample consisting of six vials and their contents, each at random from different boxes of the shipment in Dr. Ryerson\u2019s possession. The inspector marked the labels, sealed the vials with official seals,, and forwarded them by express to the Administration at Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">Dr. Frank H. Wiley, chief of the chemical section of the medical division of the Administration, holding a doctor\u2019s degree in biochemistry, testified that he received the sample on July 23, 1946. He put the vials up to a light and found \u201cwith the naked eye\u201d that all six of them \u201cwere very badly contaminated with undissolved material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-13\">Dr. Wiley was asked the following hypothetical question, which the appellants assert was \u201cbad and improper because it did not include a sufficient factual basis to support an opinion\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-14\">\u201cQ. * * *' Dr. Wiley, taking the two vials, * * * which I understand you examined about six weeks after the shipment in question here, from your knowledge of sterile solutions and from your observation of sterile solutions, your experience, are you able to express an opinion to this court as to whether or not the contents of those two vials, * * * did contain the undissolved particles you noticed there then as of the date they were shipped, namely, on or about June 18, 1946? Your answer is yes or no. A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-16\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b442-17\">\u201cQ. * * * Will you please relate your opinion?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-18\">The appellants object that in the foregoing questions \u201cno mention whatever was made of the conditions to which the drug had been subjected after shipment by appellants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-19\">Dr. Wiley\u2019s answer to the question was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-20\">\u201cA. From experience with these materials and from general information of so-called supersaturated solutions, of which this is an example, I would say that this undissolved material was undoubtedly present on June 18th when the material was shipped. There is only one external factor of which I know that would hasten or increase the crystallization of this material, and that would be refrigeration. I doubt very much if the mail bag in which this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>material was transmitted to Washington was in a refrigerator car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The appellants comment that \u201ceven if the question was proper Wiley\u2019s opinion given in response thereto is not entitled to any weight whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Other evidence relating to the drugs in question will be referred to in appropriate places in the discussion that follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">2. The Canon of Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The Act is remedial, and should be liberally construed so as to carry out its beneficent purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">In United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U. S. <em>277, </em>280, 64 S.Ct. 134, 136, 88 L.Ed. 48, the Court said of this statute:</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">\u201cThe purposes of this legislation thus touch phases of the lives and health of people which, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection. Regard for these purposes should infuse construction of the legislation if it is to be treated as a working instrument of government and not merely as a collection of English words. [Cases cited]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">As we will point out hereafter, we are here being asked to accept defensive refinements that we believe are as gossamer-like as the traditional \u201cshadow of a shade\u201d of the ancient legal commentators. We have recently had occasion to construe this same statute and have endeavored to do so in the liberal spirit commanded by the Supreme Court. Research Laboratories, Inc., v. United States, <em>9 </em>Cir., 167 F.2d 410, 421. In the instant case, we do not feel disposed to depart from that same generous norm of interpretation, which we believe accords with public policy and with the spirit of the law itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">3. The Government\u2019s Burden and the Appellate Function</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">The appellants seem <em>to </em>be laboring under a fundamental misconception regarding (1) the degree of proof required from the appellee and (2) the duty of this court in the evaluation of the evidence. Because these misapprehensions are basic, we will endeavor to clear them away at the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">(a) \u201cReasonable\u201d versus \u201cPossible\u201d Doubt</p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\"> While the appellants professedly recognize the rule that the <em>Government </em>must prove its case beyond a <em>reasonable </em>doubt, their briefs are replete with expressions which seem to indicate that in reality the standard actually insisted upon is that \u25a0the appellee\u2019s evidence should remove all <em>possible </em>doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">For example, we are twice told that \u201cThe Government failed to eliminate the possibility of the drugs having lost their strength * * * or having undissolved material formed or introduced in it * * * between the dates of shipment and the dates of the Government tests.\u201d Again, after enumerating many dire vicissitudes through which the drugs in question might have passed \u2014 such as improper handling, the use of hypodermic needles containing certain chemicals, and the like \u2014 the appellants suggest: \u201cAnyone of the above things <em>may </em>have occurred even while in the inspector\u2019s hands, or during shipment by the inspector to Washington, D. C.\u201d [Emphasis supplied]</p>\n<p id=\"b443-17\">Elsewhere we find a variation of the same theme: \u201cFurthermore, there was no evidence <em>precluding the possibility </em>that the drugs became adulterated and misbranded <em>at some time </em>after they had been shipped by appellants from Pasadena, California.\u201d [Emphasis supplied] Finally, in the reply brief we find the statement that \u201cstill the Government cannot prevail because the Government introduced no evidence to show that any of the above things did not happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-18\">While in other portions of their briefs the appellants do complain that the Government failed to adduce certain affirmative evidence, their insistence also upon the lack of <em>negative </em>evidence indicates that they are holding the appellee to too strict a standard of proof; namely, the proof of several negatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-19\">In Henderson v. United States, 9 Cir., 143 F.2d 681, 682, we said:</p>\n<p id=\"b443-20\">\u201cThe proof in a criminal case need not exclude all doubt. If that were the rule, crime would be punished <em>only by </em>the criminal\u2019s own conscience, and organized socie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>ty would be without defense against the conscienceless criminal and against the weak, the cowardly and the lazy who would seek to live on their wits. The proof need go no further than reach that degree of probability where the general experience of men suggests that it has passed the mark of reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">See also Rose v. United States, 9 Cir., 149 F.2d 755, 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">(b) The Weight of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In the second place, the appellants\u2019 briefs contain frequent references to the <em>\u2022weight </em>of the evidence. For example, complaint is made that \u201cThe finding of guilty by the Trial Court is, therefore, contrary to the weight of the evidence\u201d ; that certain allegedly contradictory testimony by Mason \u201cdoes nothing more, it is submitted, than detract from the weight of any of Mason\u2019s testimony\u201d <em>; </em>that \u201cthe findings of guilty by the Lower Court are contrary to the weight of the evidence\u201d ; that \u201cMason was biased and gave contradictory testimony\u201d ; and that \u201cthe best evidence is the testimony of Bavouset,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">While as to this question, too, the appellants elsewhere in their briefs assert a <em>total </em>lack of evidence to support the Government\u2019s case, their constant insistence on the irrelevant question of the <em>weight </em>of the evidence indicates that a certain confusion on this subject exists in their minds.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">To clarify the matter for once and for all, we wish to restate plainly that this court is not concerned with the <em>weight </em>of the testimony adduced below. \u201cQuestions of credibility were for the trial court.\u201d Newman v. United States, 9 Cir., 156 F.2d 8, 10, certiorari denied sub. nom. Cain v. United States, 329 U.S. 760, 67 S.Ct. 115, 91 L.Ed. 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">(c) The Presumption Supporting the Trial Court\u2019s Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">As a corollary to the above proposition, there need be only briefly mentioned the equally familiar doctrine relative to the weight that even in a criminal case should be given to the judgment or the verdict in the trial court. The rule, with its necessary implications, was thus succinctly stated by this court in Henderson v. United States, supra, 143 F.2d at page 682:</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">\u201cIt is a familiar principle, which it is our duty to apply, that an appellate court will indulge all reasonable presumptions in support of the rulings of a trial court and therefore that it will draw all inferences permissible from the record, and in determining whether evidence i-s sufficient to sustain a conviction, will consider the evidence most favorably to the prosecution. [Cases cited] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">4. The Identity of the Samples</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">The appellee \u201chas no quarrel\u201d with the proposition that the burden is on the Government to establish that in reasonable probability the testimony of its witnesses regarding the condition of the drugs as of the date of analysis substantially reflects their condition on the date of shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">The controversy between the parties arises in the application of this familiar principle to the facts at bar. The appellants seem to insist on what would amount to a mathematical demonstration that there was no tampering with the vials anywhere along the line, from the date the products left the custody of the appellants \u25a0 to the date when the drugs were examined and analyzed in Washington or San Francisco. The appellee, on the other hand, asserts that it has undertaken \u201cto establish the identity of the samples <em>as of the time of shipment, </em>by circumstantial evidence relating to their interstate shipment, the identity of the consignees and the condition of the drugs when received by the Government chemists, together with the reasonable inferences flowing from such evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-16\">We will now examine these divergent assertions in greater detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-17\">(a) \u201cThe Chain of Possession\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-18\">The appellants contend that the opinions of the Government\u2019s witnesses, based on tests made after the drugs had been shipped to Washington are \u201cabsolutely worthless because the expert witnesses had no knowledge that the alleged adulteration or misbranding did not occur enroute to the doctor\u2019s office, or in the doctor\u2019s office, or in the hands of the Government inspectors who picked up the drugs, or en-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>route to Washington, D. C., when shipped there by the Government inspectors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Carried to its logical conclusion, this \u201cchain of possession\" theory would require the Government to prove affirmatively that <em>each </em>one of the many mail clerks, Administration clerks and experts, doctors, nurses, express company employees, \u201cand others,\u201d handled and cared for the goods so that changes could not occur while the drugs were in their custody. It must also be shown that the products \u201cwere not tampered with,\u201d say the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Such a rigorous exaction regarding proof is supported neither by reason nor by authority. If the Government were obliged to establish the absence of \u201ctampering\u201d by every one who had any contact whatsoever with the drugs, the Act would be incapable of enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">In Lestico v. Kuehner, 204 Minn. 125, 283 N.W. 122, 125, the court derided \u201cthe unique theory\u201d that it was incumbent to show the \u201cchain of possession\u201d of a punctured tire casing offered in evidence after it had been repaired, \u201cduring the whole period from accident to trial.\u201d The court said :</p>\n<p id=\"AdI\">\u201cThe tire had been removed and repaired in Minneapolis. The thought of objections and sustaining rulings was that no sufficient foundation could be laid except by testimony not only as to genuineness, but also the absence of tampering, from every person through whose hands the casing had passed in the meantime.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\"><em>\u201cThere is no such rule and never has been.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied]</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">In quoting authorities to support their position, the appellants significantly omit two pertinent passages from their excerpts. From the opinion in United States v. S. B. Penick &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 136 F.2d 413, 415, they delete the following sentences:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">\u201cBut there is no hard and fast rule that the prosecution must exclude all possibility that the article may have been tampered with. [Citing Lestico v. Kuehner, supra.] * * Here the samples were taken in the ordinary course of business for the very purpose of being retained as samples; they were put in'the usual place where samples were kept to remove them from accident or meddling and there they remained, so far as appear[s], undisturbed. We think this showing was sufficient to justify admission in evidence of the bottles and their contents and that it was for the jury to decide how likely it was that some other substance had been substituted for what was originally put in the bottles. [Cases cited] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">Similarly, the appellants omit the following sentences from the very middle of their quotation from 32 C.J.S., Evidence, \u00a7 607, at pages 457, 458:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">\u201cHowever, it is not necessary that the article be identically the same as at the time in controversy. It is unnecessary to show an absence of tampering on the part of every person through whose hands the article has passed; as long as tire article can be identified it is immaterial in how many or in whose hands it has been. A direct statement that the article was in the same condition at the time of an occurrence as at a subsequent time is not required if it sufficiently appears that it must have been in substantially the same condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">(b) The Presumption of Regularity</p>\n<p id=\"b445-16\"> Buttressing the natural and reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the stipulations and the testimony regarding the marking, sealing and opening of the vials in question, there are certain well-established presumptions regarding the regularity not only of the acts of public servants but also of the acts of private individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-17\">I. Of the Acts of Public Servants</p>\n<p id=\"b445-18\">In United States v. Chemical Foundation, 272 U.S. 1, 14, 15, 47 S.Ct. 1, 6, 71 L.Ed. 131, the familiar rule as to the acts of public officers is thus stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-19\">\u201cThe presumption of regularity supports the official acts of public officers, and <em>in the absence of clear evidence to the </em>contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties. [Cases cited \u201d [Emphasis supplied] <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>In the instant case, this presumption of official regularity would apply not only to the methods used by the Government chemists and analysts in handling the vials, but \u2022also to the care and to the absence of tampering on the part of the postal employees through whose hands the shipments passed. Boerner v. United States, D.C.N.Y., 30 F.Supp. 635, 637, affirmed, <em>2 </em>Cir., 117 F.2d 387, certiorari denied 313 U.S. 587, 61 S.Ct. 1120, 85 L.Ed. 1542.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">II. Of the Acts of Private Individuals</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">While the appellants reluctantly concede that there \u201cmay\u201d be a presumption supporting the official acts of public servants, they insist that \u201cthere is no presumption whatever\u201d with respect to \u201cshippers\u201d, doctors, nurses,- \u201cand others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">In United States Bank v. Dandridge, 25 U.S. 64, 69, 70, 12 Wheat. 64, 69, 70, 6 L.Ed. 5521, Mr. Justice Story said:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u201cBy the general rules of evidence, presumptions are continually made, in cases of private persons, of acts even of the most solemn nature, when those acts are the natural result or necessary accompaniment of other circumstances. In aid of this salutary principle, the law itself, for the \u25a0purpose of strengthening the infirmity of evidence, and upholding transactions intimately connected with the public peace, and the security of private property, indulges its own presumptions. It presumes, that every man, in his private and official \u25a0character, does his duty, until the contrary \u2022is proved [cases cited]; it will presume that all things are rightly done, unless the circumstances of the case overturn this \u2022presumption, according to the maxim, omnia presumuntur rite et solemniter esse \u2022acta, donee probetur in contrarium.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">This early decision and the doctrine that it enunciates were referred to with approval in International Shoe Company v. Federal Trade Commission, 280 U.S. 291, .302, 50 S.Ct. 89, 93, 74 L.Ed. 431, where reference was made to \u201cthe familiar pre\u25a0sumption of rightfulness which attaches to human conduct in general.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">This presumption that even private individuals do their duty and exercise due care should apply a -fortiori to doctors and nurses, whose professional training and traditions teach them to be meticulous in the handling of preparations that are to -be administered to their patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">Indeed, in the instant case, this presumption is supported by the affirmative testimony of one -of the appellants\u2019 own witnesses. Dr. Roland N. Icke, director of research at the appellants\u2019 laboratories, said while under cross-examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-15\">\u201cQ. * * * It -has been your practice and observation of most doctors that they try to keep their bottles in proper places, has it not, Doctor? A. I believe most of them do; yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-16\">\u201cQ. And it is rare -that you find a doctor but what he adheres to the cautions that he has been instructed; isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d A. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-17\">The appellants have not pointed out, nor have we been able to find, a single scintilla of evidence in the record to indicate that any of the vials were mishandled by a single postal clerk, expressman, doctor, nurse, -Government analysts, Administration mail clerk, or <em>any one else </em>who had any connection with the \u2019 sealing, labeling, consignment, transmission, unwrapping, unsealing, or testing of the products in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-18\">The only suggestions of mishandling are in the form of <em>dire possibilities </em>conjured up by resourceful counsel. But possibilities are not proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-19\">5. The So-Called \u201cDisclaimer\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-20\">(a) Should \u201cThyroid Substance\u201d \u2022Contain Iodine?</p>\n<p id=\"b446-21\">It will be recalled that, although the label on the vials of \u201cSterile Indoform\u201d announced that each cubic centimeter of the contents carried one grain of \u201cthyroid substance,\u201d Buell, the Administration\u2019s chemist, found \u201cno thyroid present whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-22\">The appellants seek to avoid the impact of Buell\u2019s testimony by pointing out -that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>according to his own statement, the only thing that he examined the product for \u201cwas for the therapeutically active ingredients of thyroid, which were the organically combined iodine products.\u201d In other words, he examined \u201conly for iodine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A0x\">Buell also testified, however, that the label statement regarding \u201cthyroid substance\u201d means that each cubic centimeter contains \u201cone grain of the active constituent of the thyroid,\u201d \u201cas organically combined iodine.\u201d \u201cThe activity of thyroid,\u201d he explained, \u201cdepends on the organically combined iodine present in the thyroid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYo\">The appellants freely admit that there never was any iodine in \u201cIndoform.\u201d They point to Buell\u2019s own testimony, however, that there would be present in a thyroid gland \u201cother things\u201d besides iodine. From this the appellants argue that the words \"thyroid substance\u201d do not necessarily imply that the preparation contains iodine.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">(\u25a0b) At Best the Label Tells Only a Half-Truth</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The appellants seek to bolster up this argument by pointing out that the label itself contains the notation:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\u201cThis preparation does not contain any known therapeutically useful constituent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Since iodine is a therapeutically useful ingredient, they say, the label itself indicates that iodine is not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">There are two answers to this argument. In the first place, this so-called disclaimer itself is untruthful. The appellant Bavouset himself admitted on the stand that posterior pituitary, which, as we have seen, is one of the ingredients of \u201cIndoform,\u201d <em>does </em>have therapeutic value. He also testified that he \"didn\u2019t manufacture\u201d whole ovarian, another constituent, to be a meaningless product. The appellants seek- \u2014 without avail, we think \u2014 to weaken the effect of this testimony by Bavouset\u2019s later lame and somewhat cryptic explanation that \u201cIn this particular solution, this form would not be measurable.\u201d In any event, we cannot say that the court erred if it believed from the evidence- \u2014 as we do \u2014 that posterior pituitary and whole ovarian <em>do </em>have some therapeutic value.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">Assuming, however, for the sake of the argument, that the \u201cdisclaimer\u201d does tell the truth, it cannot cure the vice of the half-truth -or equivocation in the use of the expression \u201cthyroid substance\u201d in a preparation that contains no iodine. Section 321 (n) of 21 U.S.C.A. provides that <em>omissions </em>as well as representations shall be taken into account in determining whether the labeling is misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">In Research Laboratories v. United States, supra, 167 F.2d at page 418, we held that \u201cthe scientific half-truths in the labeling alone make out a case of actionable misbranding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">Specific reference to self-contradictory labels is found in H. N. Heusner &amp; Son v. Federal Trade Commission, 3 Cir., 106 F.2d <em>596, </em>597:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">\u201cAccordingly, the petitioner, a Pennsylvania manufacturer of cigars which contain only Pennsylvania tobacco, but are branded \u2018Havana Smokers\u2019, has been ordered to cease and desist from using the word \u2018Havana\u2019 to designate its product. We are asked to modify this order so as to permit the retention of the word \u2018Havana\u2019 with an appropriate \u2018qualification\u2019, i. e., the legend: \u201cNotice. These Cigars are made in the United States and only of United States tobacco.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b447-17\">\u201cThe difficulty of petitioner\u2019s position lies in the fact that the implication of the word \u2018Havana\u2019 is totally false. <em>The purchaser can be guided by either label or legend, but not by both.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.] <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-18\">So here, the purchaser of \u201cIndoform\u201d could <em>be </em>guided by either the labeling-\u201cthyroid substance,\u201d which implies the presence of a therapeutic ingredient, or by the \u201cdisclaimer\u201d of the presence of <em>any </em>such ingredient. Obviously, the implication of presence and the negation of presence cannot both be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-19\">In the language of the -day, this \u201cIndoform\u201d label strikes us as a bit of scientific \u201cdouble-talk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>The Supreme Court has repeatedly denounced equivocation and evasion by those who come within the reach of a statute that enunciates Governmental policy. Whether the subterfuge is accomplished by suppression or contradiction, the vice is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Referring to the Food and Drugs Act of 1906, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1 et seq., the Supreme Court, in United States v. 95 Barrels of Vinegar, 265 U.S. 438, 442, 443, 44 S.Ct. 529, 531, 68 L.Ed. 1094, used the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u201cThe statute is plain and direct. Its comprehensive terms condemn every statement, design, and device which may mislead or deceive. Deception may result from the use of statements not technically false or which may be literally true. The aim of the statute is to prevent that resulting from indirection and ambiguity, as well as from statements which are false. It is not difficult to choose statements, designs, and devices which will not deceive. Those which are ambiguous and liable to mislead should be read favorably to the accomplishment of the purpose of the act.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">So here, it would have been \u201cnot difficult to choose statements\u201d that would not deceive. The simple legend, \u201cThis preparation does not contain iodine,\u201d would have been sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">6. The Hypothetical Questions</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The appellants object to certain hypothetical questions that were propounded to three of the Government\u2019s experts. These questions. have already been quoted by us, either verbatim or in substance, in our outline of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">(a) The Questions Presented Sufficient Facts in Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">The appellants\u2019 first two attacks upon these hypothetical questions may be considered together. They are (1) that the question addressed to Dr. Wiley did not contain sufficient facts to afford ground for a reasonable conclusion or opinion, and (2) that the question asked of Mason and Capps assumed facts not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">From the facts already stated, supplemented by the reasonable inferences flowing therefrom and by the presumptions of regularity that, as we have seen, are firmly recognized in the law, it is clear that the hypothetical questions referred to were not objectionable. We need not labor the factual aspects further.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">Moreover, it should be remembered that the rule requiring a factual basis for a hypothetical question is not applied with iron rigidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">In Permanente Metals Corporation v. Pista, 9 Cir., 154 F.2d 568, 569, we said:</p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\">\u201cMoreover, it has been held in California, as elsewhere, .that where a witness answers a hypothetical question not founded on all the facts of the case, the defect goes not to the competency of the evidence but merely affects its weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-16\">And in the earlier case of Travelers Ins. Co. v. Drake, 9 Cir., 89 F.2d 47, 50, this court used the following language regarding the factual latitude that might be allowed :</p>\n<p id=\"b448-17\">\u201cThe question may be framed upon any theory of the interrogator, which can reasonably be deduced from the evidence; any assumptions may be indulged on any fact within the evidence, upon which opinion is desired by the interrogator; and facts not deemed material may be omitted. [Many cases cited.] The truth of facts assumed by the hypothetical question as within the probable range of the evidence, as a basis to support the hypothetical question', is a question of fact for the determination of the jury to find with the other submitted facts upon a fair submission of the issue, and it must determine whether the basis upon which the hypothetical question rests has been established. [Authorities cited.] When the question assumes a state of facts which the evidence directly, fairly and reasonably tends to establish, and does not transcend the range of the evidence, it is not objectionable. [Cases cited.]\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>(b) The Questions Did Not Deal With \u201cUltimate Issues\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">The appellants further urge that all the hypothetical questions violated the \u201crule of law\u201d \u201cexcluding the opinions of experts as to the ultimate issues of fact to be determined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">This objection is not well grounded. A glance at the questions discloses that in none of them is there any reference to \u201cmisbranding\u201d or \u201cadulterating,\u201d which are the ultimate issues in this case. Dr. Wiley was asked whether he thought that the two vials of Pluri-B contained the undissolved particles on June 18, 1946, the date on which they were shipped. The question addressed to Mason was whether the \u201cIndoform\u201d contained three international units of posterior pituitary on September 17, 1945. The hypothetical question directed to Capps related to the amount of thiamine hydrochloride in the Pluri-B on the date when it was shipped by the appellants, July 16, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">All these questions dealt with <em>supporting </em>or <em>evidentiary </em>facts, and not ultimate issues. It is true that the facts inquired about were <em>related </em>to the ultimate issues; else the hypothetical questions would have been irrelevant, and the appellants would now be clamoring that the questions were improper on the ground of immateriality.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">In Travelers Ins. Co. v. Drake, 9 Cir., supra, 89 F.2d at page 49, this court said:</p>\n<p id=\"AEi\">\u201cWhile the jury is the sole judge of the facts as to the issue of death and cause of death, that does not, however, make objectionable the opinion of a medical expert in aid to the jury to find the ultimate fact. [Many cases cited.]\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Furthermore, this court has repeatedly held that the fairness of a hypothetical question is largely a matter that lies within the discretion of the trial judge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">(c) The Trial Judge Is Presumed To Consider Only Competent Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">Even if certain deficiencies had crept into any of the hypothetical questions \u2014 which we most certainly do not concede \u2014 in this and in other circuits it is presumed that the trial judge considered only competent evidence in arriving at his judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">In Hoffman v. United States, 9 Cir., 87 F.2d 410, 411, we said:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-16\">\u201cThis case was tried by the judge and presumably he would consider only material and competent testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-17\">7. The Appellants\u2019 Admitted Lack of Testing Equipment</p>\n<p id=\"b449-18\">Capps said on the stand that he tested the contents of one of the vials in evidence for thiamine hydrochloride, and that he used a \u201cThiachrome procedure.\u201d This test was made on September 24, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-19\">Immediately following Capps as a witness was the appellant Bavouset. The latter was cross-examined at some length regarding a hearing of the Administration conducted by a Mr. Rowe on November 7, 1945. The record shows the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-20\">\u201cQ. And did you not likewise state to Mr. Rowe at the hearing on or about November 7, 1945, with regard to the Pluri-B and the thiamine deficiency, that you did not have the equipment to make the thiachrome determination for thiamine and that you would have to, therefore, revise your manufacture and procedure? A. We did not have the equipment. Now, about the revision of manufacturing procedure, that goes on almost every day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AlC\">The appellee refers to this lack as constituting \u201cpoor manufacturing controls.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>In resisting this charge, the appellants, in their reply brief, run into another admission :</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u201cWhen the Government uses the term \u2018poor manufacturing controls\u2019 it undoubtedly refers to the <em>fact </em>that appellants did not always test their products at the conclusion of the manufacture.\u201d [Emphasis supplied]</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">All this, we think, further supports the trial court\u2019s judgment that the appellants\u2019 products in question were so deficient or contaminated as to result in a violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">8. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">While in the foregoing discussion we have copiously referred to the transcript, we have not attempted to give a complete summary of the evidence. To have done so would have unduly lengthened this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Our careful study of the entire record, however, has convinced us that there was no error in the judgment below, and it is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-11\"> See also Bowles v.
