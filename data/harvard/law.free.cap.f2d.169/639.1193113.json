We thought this failure created confusion in the trial and hence reversed the court\u2019s order. When the complaint is amended to state the exact character of the condemnation sought, the new trial may be for a condemnation with some of the many restrictive conditions considered in Coos Bay Logging Co. v. Barclay, 159 Or. 272, 79 P.2d 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-24\">The motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
