It creates an inference of fact and casts upon the opposite party the duty of going forward with evidence or risking that the jury will infer negligence from the occurrence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-22\">In his closing argument to the jury, counsel for the Bratts said:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-23\">\u201cA violent effort was made to convince you folks that we have charged Captain Loeffler with terrible disregard of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-24\">\u201cWhy, I can picture in my mind those last terrific moments; I can see that plane shooting down out of the air to destruction, to death; I can see that valiant boy in there fighting his heart out. Captain Loeffler went to his death simply because Western Air Lines violated the same duty to him that they violated to everyone else in that plane.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-25\">\u201cWe do not charge Captain Loeffler with a violation of duty. We do not charge him with stunting. We do not charge him with engaging in activity that was likely to cause death just to gratify any whim or caprice that might have actuated his activity at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-26\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b279-27\">\u201cThis proof demonstrated that this plane crashed to -the ground bringing death to the occupants of that plane because of a structural weakness and failure \u2014 that is brushing all the rest of the cobwebs of this case aside and looking at it as it is. That is what this case <em>it </em>[is], a case of structural failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>* *****</p>\n<p id=\"AUyh\">\u201cNow that is the only answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">5&gt;c jjs # <em>% </em>H1 \u2666</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u201cNow, it might be \u2014 -it might be that after these boys \u2018had lost or were losing tihe control of the plane because of structural failure they did exert superhuman strength as described by . these witnesses, to pull it out of the nose dive, pull it out in a zoom-up and caused th'e structural failure of the wing -tips. But if that did happen, then the preceding conditions that brought them into that perilous condition was the failure of the right horizontal stabilizer which failed because the inspection had revealed not the existence of the structural defect. Now, let\u2019s see if that isn\u2019t the evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">$ <em>% </em># jji <em>% </em>jfc</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u201cEvery part and parcel of that testimony bespeaks of structural failure and the only defense is, \u2018We didn\u2019t discover it.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">The trial court properly instructed the jury on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. After the completion of the general charge, in the course of a colloquy with counsel respecting a request that the court charge on the presumption that a person killed in an accident exercised ordinary care, the court said: \u201cThere is a rule undoubtedly that a person who is dead is presumed to have been in the exercise of due care, but of course it can be overcome by evidence.\u201d One of counsel for tihe Bratts then stated: \u201cWe agree with Your Honor on that.\u201d The court then 9tated: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I ought to give that or not.\u201d Counsel for the Bratts then stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Your Honor. I think we would take an exception. * * * \u201d Counsel for Western then thereafter stated: \u201cYour Honor, I don\u2019t know whether the Court \u2014 what the Court\u2019s conclusion was with reference to the presumption that a deceased person such as the pilot here exercised reasonable care for his own concern. Will the Court give that law or not?\u201d The court then stated: \u201cYes, I think that ought to be the rule, supplemented by the statement in connection with it that negligence may not be inferred or presumed against it.\u201d Counsel for the Bratts then excepted on the ground that the last statement of the court was inconsistent with the rule of res ipsa loquitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">It is a well-settled principle that the instinct of self-preservation and the disposition of men to avoid personal harm constitutes a basis for the presumption that a person killed in an accident was in the exercise of ordinary care.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Counsel for the Bratts contend that an instruction on the presumption last adverted to is improper in a res ipsa loquitur case, citing Smith v. Hollander, 85 Cal.App. 535, 259 P. 958, 959; Moeller v. Market Street R. Co., 27 Cal.. App.2d 562, 81 P.2d 475; Waite v. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., 56 Cal.App.2d 191,. 132 P.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">Whether the doctrine of the California cases should have been applied in: the instant case we need not determine. That portion of the instruction \u201cthat negligence may not be inferred or presumed against it,\u201d rendered the instruction clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">However, we think the error is harmless. Counsel for the Bratts in his closing argument expressly absolved the pilot from any negligence and stated: \u201cWe do not charge Captain Loeffler with a violation of duty,\u201d and that \u201cLoeffler went to his death simply because the Western Air Lines violated the same duty to him that they violated to everyone else in the plane.\u201d Moreover, counsel for the Bratts in his closing argument repeatedly stated that the sole cause of the accident was a structural failure and bottomed their case wholly on the contention that the jury should infer that Western had negligently failed to discover and repair the structural defect. In view of that argument, there was no issue for the jury to determine with respect to any negligence on the part of the pilot, Loeffler. It was affirmatively removed from the case. No instruction should have been given on that issue. An instruction on an immaterial issue which could not have misled or confused the jury constitutes no ground for reversal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Conceivable, in the light of the closing argument of counsel for the Bratts, that the jury would have returned a verdict for the Bratts on the theory that the pilot was guilty of negligence, had the challenged instruction not been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The sole occupant of the airplane who survived the crash was Arthur F. Gardner. He testified as a witness for Western. On his cross-examination, counsel for the Bratts asked this question; \u201cNow you yourself made a claim against the company which was settled by the payment of a certain amount of money, isn\u2019t that true?\u201d Counsel for Western objected. The trial court ruled that if the question was asked for the purpose of showing a settlement of \u00a1the claim, it was improper, but that if it was asked for the purpose of showing that the claim was paid for the purpose of influencing Gardner\u2019s testimony, it was proper. Counsel for \u2019the Bratts disclaimed the latter purpose and asserted it was to show motive, bias, or prejudice. The ruling of the trial court was correct. Where several persons are injured in the same accident, a compromise with one cannot be shown in an action by another. The policy of the law is to favor settlement of controversies and not to discourage settlements by subjecting a person who has compromised a claim to the hazard of having the settlement proved in a subsequent lawsuit by another person asserting a claim arising out of the same accident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Proof of a settlement made as a cover to obtain favorable testimony from Gardner would have been admissible, but any such purpose was disavowed by counsel for the Bratts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the court permitted the witness to answer the question and his answer was in the affirmative, and, clearly, the Bratts suffered no injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">During the trial, counsel for Western made an offer to permit the court and jury to inspect a DC-3 airplane, which was the type of airplane involved in the crash. The trial court ruled that the inspection might be had. There was much technical testimony in the case and certainly an inspection of the airplane would have aided the jury in understanding that evidence. We fail to see how an offer to permit the jury to fly in an airplane in anywise prejudiced the Bratts. The suggestion that it \u25a0terrified the jury would have reacted, it would seem, to the disadvantage of Western, not the Bratts.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">The final contention of the Bratts is that counsel for Western was guilty of misconduct during the trial and in his argument to the jury. We have carefully examined the record. The conduct of counsel for both parties, during the trial, was not wholly exemplary or free from criticism. However, we are not convinced that such conduct on the part of counsel for Western either aroused the passion or prejudice of the jurors so as to prevent a fair trial or otherwise improperly influenced their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">\u25a0The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-16\"> Hereinafter\u2019 called Western.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b279-17\"> Atchison, T. &amp; S.
