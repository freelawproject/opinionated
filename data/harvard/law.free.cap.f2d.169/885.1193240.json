Robert I. Rosenschein, contests the right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>his remarried widow, the appellee, to the proceeds of his National Service Life Insurance policy. He was killed in an airplane crash in July 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Appellant was named beneficiary in the policy. But the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940 authorizes the insured to change the beneficiary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the policy was issued the insured was unmarried. In February 1943 he married appellee. She testified that they went ten days later to the Finance Office of an Army post in New Mexico and he asked a clerk for \u201ca form to change his beneficiary in his National Life Insurance\u201d; that the clerk gave him a form, which appellee identified at the trial; and that they then went to the Post Exchange, where her husband filled out the form in her presence. She identified his signature. It was witnessed, apparently some days later, by a personnel officer. The form found its way to the files of the Adjutant General.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">The form was W.D., A. G. O. Form No. 41, headed \u201cDesignation of Beneficiary.\u201d As filled out and signed it named appellee \u201cbeneficiary\u201d but did not refer expressly to any particular policy or benefits. The Army intended the printed form for a purpose <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that was not the one Rosenschein had in mind. But the form did not disclose the Army\u2019s purpose<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and was often used, as Rosenschein used it, for the purpose of designating a life insurance beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">The trial court without a jury found that the insured changed the beneficiary of the policy in suit. We think the evidence supports the finding. Courts dispense with technicalities to carry out a soldier\u2019s intention to change the beneficiary of his life insurance policy. The intention and an act done for the purpose of accomplishing it are enough.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cIt is most unlikely that when [the insured] signed Form No. 41 * * * he could have intended any other act than to change the beneficiary of his insurance policy. Not only was there compelling oral testimony to support this view, but the form actually signed was adequate in its language for that purpose.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-16\">Though a regulation of the Veterans Administration required that notice of the change be forwarded \u201cby the insured or his agent,\u201d the appellee is not barred by the fact that notice did not reach the Veterans Administration until after the death of the insured.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-17\">Appellant contends that by D.C. Code 1940, \u00a7 14 \u2014 302, 41 Stat. 567, appellee\u2019s account of her husband\u2019s conversation with the Finance Office clerk should have been excluded. But the cited statute \u201cseeks to protect only persons \u2018legally representing the deceased\u2019 against claims which may be fraudulent.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No one is legally representing the deceased in this suit. The statute is inapplicable for the further reason that the change of beneficiary was not a \u201ctransaction\u201d between the insured and his wife but between him and his insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-7\"> 54 Stat. 1010, \u00a7 602(g), as amended, 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 802(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b950-9\"> Designation of beneficiary of a \u201csix-months gratuity\u201d payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b950-10\"> The War Department afterwards adopted a different and unambiguous Form No. 41.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b950-11\"> Roberts v.
