The District Judge, after hearing the evidence, made findings of fact and set out appropriate conclusions of law. These, on all important points, were uniformly unfavorable to the plaintiff-appellant herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-17\">Conclusion of law number one was:</p>\n<p id=\"b840-18\">\u201cThe title of A. E. Waller to tract No. 3 was not impressed with any trust in favor of J. B. Waller, as alleged in the complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-20\">Conclusion of law number two' was:</p>\n<p id=\"b840-21\">\u201cWhatever rights accrued to J. B. Waller by virtue of A. E. Waller\u2019s promise to convey tract No. 3 to him upon his payment of his portion of the original indebtedness have been lost, and the plaintiff is barred of any right of action thereon by reason of his failure -to make any. payment tO' A. E. Waller, and by his delay in bringing this action for more than ten years after the registration of deed for tract No. 3 from A. E. Waller to J. M. Turner and Neva Turner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-22\">These conclusions, which are more than ample to .dispose of the case, were, we think, clearly correct and they found ample support in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-23\">The judgment of the District Court is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
