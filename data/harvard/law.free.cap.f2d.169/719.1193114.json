Metropolitan objects to the Commission\u2019s order of November 7, 1944, as amended, in two major particulars. It asserts that the provisions of Paragraph (A) (viii) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are not in conformity with the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 791a et seq., and that the provisions of Paragraph (B),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> dealing with rate of return and amortization reserves, require clarification. It contends also that that portion of the Commission\u2019s Opinion No. 160, also filed November 17, 1947, finding Metropolitan \u201cin trespass\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at York Haven is not justified by the law or the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">As to the Provisions of Paragraph (A) (viii).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">Metropolitan takes the position that since Section 3(13) <footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of the Act, 16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>796(13), defines \u201cnet investment\u201d in a project as \u201cthe actual legitimate original cost thereof as defined and interpreted in the \u2018classification of investment in road and equipment of steam roads, issue of 1914, Interstate Commerce Commission\u2019 \u201d, the Commission was without authority to order in subparagraph (viii) that depreciation be employed as a factor in estimating value. Metropolitan further asserts, as indeed does the Commission,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the valuation determined by the formula prescribed by Paragraph (A) (viii) as a starting base will fix the maximum for which the United States will be held responsible on recapture, if such be effected subsequently, under the requirements of Section 14 of the Act, 16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 807.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We think it is clear that the valuation imposed upon the York Haven Project by Paragraph (A) (viii) will serve as the base, throughout the period of regulation, for the establishment, inter alia, both of a reasonable rate of return and amortization reserves pursuant to Section 10(d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this connection we refer to the provisions of Section 4(b) and (e), 16 U.S. GA. \u00a7 <em>797(h) </em>and (e), which provide respectively that the Commission is empowered to determine \u201cthe actual legitimate original cost of and the net investment in a licensed proj ect * * and to issue licenses \u201cfor the purpose of constructing, operating, and maintaining\u201d projects. Section 4(b) and (e) seems to be directed to new projects to be licensed under the Act, long in existence but never licensed such as York Haven. We refer also to Section 23 (a), 16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 816 which provides for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>the licensing by the Commission of projects operating pursuant to purported authority of existing law or under \u201cpermit\u201d and which states that \u201cthe fair value\u201d of such projects shall \u201cbe deemed to be the amount to be allowed as the net investment of the applicant * * * \u201d. Admittedly the provisions of Section 23 are not applicable to the York Haven Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">To put it bluntly, there are hiatuses and inconsistencies in the Federal Power Act and, as was stated by Judge Learned Hand in Niagara Falls Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 2 Cir., 137 F.2d 787, 795, \u201c * * * it is necessary * * * to break through the band of verbal logic at its weakest spot.\u201d In construing Section 3 (13) little aid is procured from the Interstate Commerce Commission \u201cclassification\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> though it would appear generally that \u201caccrued depreciation\u201d on road, equipment and miscellaneous property of a railroad must be set up on the general balance sheet in conjunction with operating reserves.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This might be more persuasive than it is if we were not convinced that by definition Section 3(13) was intended to operate only in the period following the issuance and acceptance of a license. That this is so is made plain by the actual text which speaks of additions of costs minus certain items which shall \u201chave been accumulated during the period of the license * * */&gt; it follows therefore that the definition of \u201cnet investment\u201d as \u201cactual legitimate original cost * * * \u201d of Section 3(13) cannot be employed to determine the base of the York Haven Project or to test the legality of the formula of Paragraph (A) (viii).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">What statutory sanction then can the Commission find to justify the formula set out in Paragraph (A) (viii) ? Section 6, 16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 799, as the Commission points out, provides that each license \u201cshall be conditioned upon acceptance by the licensee of all the terms and conditions of this Act and such further conditions, if any, as the Commission shall prescribe in conformity with this Act * * *.\u201d But these provisions do not authorize the formula of Paragraph (A) (viii) for there is nothing in the Act which expressly authorizes the Commission to employ the formula of the \u201cactual legitimate original cost and accrued depreciation\u201d in respect to the York Haven Project which, as the record shows, was completed approximately thirty-three years ago and is now, for the first time, seeking a license. Section 10(g), 16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 803 (g), does, however, authorize the Commission to prescribe in a license \u201cSuch other conditions not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act as the Commission may require.\u201d Can this section be deemed to authorize Paragraph (A) (viii) ?</p>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">It is clear from the Act that Congress contemplated the licensing of new projects: see Section 3(13); and of old projects in existence under permit; see Section 23(a). Congress must also have had in mind the fact that there were many projects already in existence, not under permit. We think it was the Congressional intent by the enactment of Section 10(g) to give to the Commission wide latitude and discretion in the performance of its licensing and regulatory functions and that Congress must have contemplated the licensing by the Commission of old projects, such as York Haven, not under permit, under the provisions of Section 10(g).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We think it is clear that the conditions of Paragraph (A) (viii) are not inconsistent with the Federal Power Act, are not in the least arbitrary or unreasonable, and that therefore the Commission possessed the author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>ity to impose them on Metropolitan. Our reasons follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The \u201cactual legitimate original cost and accrued depreciation of the project\u201d, the formula imposed by Paragraph (A) (viii) will effect the \u201cfair value\u201d required of \u201cpermit\u201d projects by Section 23 (a). We may not conclude that an existing project, not under permit, should be put in a better position as to value for regulatory purposes under a federal license than an existing project under permit. On the other hand we can see no substantial reason why an existing project without permit should be in a worse position than an existing project under permit insofar as federal licensing is concerned. In any event, it cannot be asserted plausibly that the provisions of Paragraph (A) (viii) of the order sub judice are inconsistent with the provisions of Section 10(g). On the contrary by analogy the paragraph of the Commission\u2019s order finds a basis in Section 23. The Act must receive a practical construction, one which will enable the Commission to perform the duties required of it by Congress.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See Clarion River Power Co. v. Smith, 61 App.D.C. 186, 59 F.2d 861, 863. We think that Section 10(g) authorized the Commission to impose the formula of Paragraph (A) (viii) and we so rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The formula set out by the Commission in Paragraph (A) (viii) will form the basis for the application of the Commission\u2019s regulatory functions in respect to the York Haven Project but we cannot and do not decide that the base created by the formula of the paragraph will, as the Commission contends and as Metropolitan fears, \u201cfix the maximum\u201d for which the United States will be held liable on recapture under Section 14. That question is not before us and we may not give an advisory opinion respecting it. Section 14 provides expressly that \u201cThe net investment of the licensee in the project or projects so taken and the amount of such severance damages, if any, shall be determined by the Commission after notice and 'opportunity for hearing.\u201d The recapture provisions of Section 14 may never be exercised by the United States. We think it is clear that they cannot be exercised in fact without further authorization by Congress and under appropriations which have not yet been made. But it is clear that the meaning of the phrase \u201cthe net investment of the licensee in the project or projects taken\u201d employed in Section 14 cannot be properly before us on the instant review.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">To sum up our conclusions upon this aspect of the case to the end that there may be no misunderstanding we state again that the formula prescribed by Paragraph (A) (viii) will supply the base on which the York <em>Haven </em>Project may be regulated by the Commission under license. We do not hold that the base of the formula is \u201cthe net investment\u201d of Section 14. That question must await future determination as prescribed by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">As to the Provisions of Paragraph (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">The provisions of Paragraph (B) of the Commission\u2019s order of November 7, 1944 were amended by its order of November 17, 1947. Metropolitan asserts that the provisions of the paragraph as amended require further clarification. We do not agree. The Commission\u2019s Opinion No. 160, read in conjunction with the letter of November 25, 1947 of Mr. Leon M. Fuquay, Secretary of the Commission, to Mr. Harold J. Ryan, attorney for Metropolitan, leaves no doubt that the question raised by Metropolitan, as to whether the earnings from which amortization reserves are to be set aside would be annual earnings or tlr ose earnings accumulated over a given period, remains open for future determination by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>As to the Objection of Metropolitan to the</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Finding by the Commission that the York Haven Project Is \u201cin Trespass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The statement objected to is, as we have stated, in the opinion of the Commission. This court possesses no power to correct a statement in an opinion of the Commission albeit it would be within our province to state that the Commission\u2019s finding upon a pertinent point was in error if we so concluded. The Commission\u2019s statement, however, is not germane to any substantial issue presented for our determination. It is clear and conceded by all that the York Haven Project was erected in 1904 and has had neither permit nor license. The Commission has not attempted to impose any penalty on Metropolitan by reason of the facts last mentioned. We therefore find it unnecessary to discuss the statement in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The order of the Commission of November 7, 1944, as amended by that of November 17, 1947, will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-11\"> The Commission on March 12, 1940 served on Metropolitan a rule to show cause why Metropolitan should not apply for and secure from the Commission a license with respect to the York Haven Project situated in and on the right bank of the Susquehanna River at or near the Borough of York Haven, Pennsylvania, or in the alternative, cease and desist in the operation and maintenance thereof or, as a further alternative, why the Commission should not request the Attorney General to institute appropriate proceedings against Metropolitan with respect thereto. The show cause order averred that the Susquehanna River is a navigable stream of the United States and that the York Haven Project was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>constructed, operated or maintained under valid federal authority and that the construction, operation and maintenance of the project was in violation of the Federal Power Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">An answer was filed by Metropolitan setting up inter alia the defense that the Susquehanna River was not navigable water of the United States at York Haven and that the project therefore required no permit or consent from the United States. Prior to hearing before the Commission the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia handed down its decision in Pennsylvania Water &amp; Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 74 App.D.C. 351, 123 F.2d 155, and certiorari was refused by the Supreme Court, 315 U.S. 808, 62 S.Ct. 610, 86 L.Ed. 1205. Metropolitan then concluded that since the Susquehanna had been hold to be navigable water of the United States at Holtwood, Pennsylvania, it would be held to bo navigable water at the York Haven Project, a distance upstream from Holtwood of about 27 miles. Metropolitan then decided that it should make application for a license to the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b785-8\"> As follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">\u201c(A) A major license for a period effective January 1, 1938, and terminating June 30, 1970, be issued to Metropolitan Edison Company for the operation and maintenance of the project subject to the provisions of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, such license to contain the usual conditions and provisions of licenses issued under Section 4 (e) of the Act for such projects and the following special conditions:</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\"># if: #</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">\u201c(viii) The actual legitimate original cost and accrued depreciation of the project as of the effective date of the license, namely January 1, 1938, shall be determined in accordance with the Act and the Commission\u2019s rules and regulations, and the Licensee hereby agrees to accept such original cost less such accrued depreciation, so determined, as being the net investment in the project as of such effective date;\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b785-16\"> As follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b785-17\">\u201c(B) After the first 20 years of operation of the project under this license, namely after December 31, 1957, six (6) percent per annum shall be the specified rate of return on the net investment in the project for determining surplus earnings in accordance with the provisions of Section 10(d) of the Act for the establishment and maintenance of amortization reserves to be held until termination of the license, or in the discretion of the Commission, to be applied from time to time in reduction of the net investment in the project, and one-half of all surplus earnings in excess of six (6) percent per annum received in any calendar year shall be put into and held in such amortization reserves;\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b785-18\"> The statement is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b785-19\">\u201cSince the project was built in a navigable water of the United States, it has been in trespass from the time of its original construction.
