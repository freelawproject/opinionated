He seeks to recover compensation at the \u201ccurrent\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rate of pay at the Chatillon plant from June 12, 1946 to August 7, 1946. He gained other comparable employment immediately after the date last mentioned. He does not seek reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-21\">The facts are as follows. Kemp entered the Army of the United States on March 1, 1944 and was discharged therefrom on February 10, 1946. Prior to his induction he had been employed as a welder by Chatillon at the rate of $1.13 an hour for a period of about 4 months. At this time and at all pertinent times thereafter the Chatillon plant was operated under a \u201cclosed-shop\u201d 5**<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contract with Metal Produc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>tion and Novelty Workers Union Local 28A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is agreed by the parties and there is no question but that the \u201cstandard\u201d closed-shop provisions of the contract in operation at the times when Kemp was first employed by Chatillon and when he was inducted into service provided that no workman should be employed at the plant who was not a member of the Union except individuals employed during a preliminary trial period whom the Union authorized as workmen by the usual system of \u201cworking permits\u201d. Under this system Kemp paid 50fS a week, or approximately $2. a month, to the shop steward for working permits. Kemp also paid $22. to the shop steward as a union initiation fee. This sum, however, was returned to him by the shop steward prior to Kemp\u2019s induction. It appears also that upon Kemp\u2019s reemployment by Chatillon he was paid $1.22 an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The record indicates and the parties seem agreed that a new contract was executed between the Union and Chatillon while Kemp was in service and under this contract an increase in wages and other benefits were received by the workmen at the plant including Kemp. It is clear and subj ect to no dispute that the new contract between the Union and Chatillon continued in effect the closed-shop provisions of the contract which was in effect when Kemp first entered Chatillon\u2019s employment and when he was inducted into the Army.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Kemp continued in the employ of Chatillon after his reinstatement on February 14, 1946 until June 12, 1946 when he was discharged by Chatillon because he would not join the Union. It is clear also that repeated attempts to have him join the Union were made both by union officials and by officers of Chatillon. He refused because he was of the opinion that the Union rendered no substantial service to Chatillon\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The court below found that the \u201cunion contract\u201d requring union membership was in existence between Chatillon and the Union prior to his induction into service and during his absence therein and at the time of his reinstatement. This finding, subject to the qualifications set out in note 2 supra, is supported by the evidence. It found also that Kemp was reinstated \u201cin his former position as a welder\u201d at the wage of $1.22 an hour. This finding finds full support in the evidence. The court also determined that Kemp was not entitled \u201cto the benefits in the petition\u201d because he was not a member of the Union and he refused to join the Union. The learned trial Judge found also that Kemp was not a \u201ctemporary employee\u201d of Chatillon. The court below did not find that Kemp was discharged either for cause or \u201cwithout cause\u201d within the purview of Section 8(c) of the Act. Kemp has appealed from the adverse judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Section 8(b) (B) of the Act provides that the returning veteran shall be restored to his former position or to one of like seniority, status and pay, and Section 8(c) states that upon his return to employment the veteran shall not be discharged from his position \u201cwithout cause\u201d within one year of his restoration. The prime question for our determination therefore is whether the discharge of a veteran for failure to join a union in a plant subject to the closed-shop provisions of a contract between the union and the employer is a discharge \u201cwithout cause\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Conversely, of course, if the ruling of the court below is to be sustained, we must hold as a matter of law that the discharge of Kemp under the circumstances of the case at bar is a discharge for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">What the legal rights of a veteran would be if a company had no closed-shop agreement with a union prior to his induction into the service and negotiated such an agreement while the veteran was in the Army or after his return need not be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>cussed in view of the facts of the instant case. But in the case at bar one of the conditions of Kemp\u2019s employment at Chatillon\u2019s plant was union membership. This was a condition at the time when Kemp was first employed, remained such during his absence in the Army of the United States, and continued as a condition of employment at the time when he was reinstated on June 12, 1946. Kemp himself recognized this condition as binding on him during his original employment before he entered the Army for he paid 50{\u00ed a week for working permits and the Union\u2019s initiation fee. While the initiation fee was returned to him, this was by favor of the shop steward as Kemp himself recognized.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Insofar as the closed-shop provisions were concerned the escalator of employment had not changed its position in any wise, either to the benefit or to the detriment of Kemp or his employer. Cf. Fishgold v. Sullivan Corporation, 328 U.S. 275, 284, 66 S.Ct. 1105, 90 L.Ed. 1230, 167 A.L.R. 110. There is no question but that the Union was the bargaining agent for Chatillon\u2019s employees or that the contract (or contracts) entered into between the Union and Chatillon was a bona fide agreement and one intended to be effective and binding upon the parties. Closed-shop provisions were then legal. Cf. the Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158, which did not become effective until August 23, 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">No legislative history has been cited to us and we can find none which is helpful in determining the intent of Congress when it employed the phrase \u201cwithout cause\u201d in Section 8(c) of the Act. If the word \u201ccause\u201d be given its ordinary and usual definition, as we think it must, it may be deemed to mean \u201cthat which occasions or effects a result * * * Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2d Ed. But if we define the word \u201ccause\u201d in such broad terms we state nothing but an abstraction. The words \u201cwithout cause\u201d as used in Section 8(c) were defined in Hoyer v. United States Dressed Beef Co., D.C.S.D., Cal., C. D., 67 F.Supp. 730, 732, as meaning \u201c * * * the absence of any legal ground or excuse in the performance of a person\u2019s work, which would warrant his being laid off.\u201d Cf. Grubbs v. Ingalls Iron Works Co., D.C.N.D., Ala., S.D., 66 F.Supp. 550. But see Feore v North Shore Bus Co., D. C.E.D.N.Y., 68 F.Supp. 1014, 1017, in which it was held that compelling an employer to breach a union contract in order to restore a veteran to a position of like seniority, status and pay was not \u201cunreasonable\u201d within the purview of Section 8 (b) (B) of the Act. The decision last cited, however, was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 161 F.2d 552, and in any event, must be read insofar as the law of this circuit is concerned, in the light of the decisions of this court in Gauweiler v. Elastic Stop Nut Corporation, 3 Circuit., 162 F.2d 448, and DiMaggio v. Elastic Stop Nut Corporation, 3 Cir., 162 F.2d at page 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\"> We think that the word \u201ccause\u201d as used in the statute does not necessarily mean \u201clegal\u201d cause; that is to say, a cause which would furnish the employee with a cause of action against his employer because of a dismissal or discharge. On the other hand we are of the opinion that the cause may not be a mere excuse or an arbitrary action on the part of the employer to avoid the impact of the statute. We think that the word \u201ccause\u201d as used in the Act was well defined by Judge Minton, delivering the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Keserich v. Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corporation, 163 F.2d 889, 890. Judge Minton<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> said: \u201cThe cause intended by the statute does not have to be a legal cause. It may be such cause as a fair minded person may act upon, and where such action is not arbitrarily taken with a purpose or as an excuse to avoid the statute, it is cause within the meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>thereof.\u201d In short, the test which must be applied is whether or not the discharge by the employer was a reasonable one under the circumstances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Upon consideration of all the circumstances of the instant case and applying the test indicated we are of the opinion that Kemp\u2019s discharge was not \u201cwithout cause\u201d within the purview of the statute. Chatillon had entered into a binding and legal closed-shop agreement with the Union. The Union insisted that Kemp join its membership or be discharged. If Chatillon had insisted upon retaining Kemp in employment it would have breached the terms of its contract with the Union. Moreover, it would have run a substantial risk of disrupting its labor relations and it might reasonably have anticipated a strike at its plant. Prior to his induction into the Army, as has been stated, Kemp recognized the closed-shop provisions as binding on himself and Chatillon since he secured working permits from the Union and paid his initiation fee to it. He also received the benefits of the increased wages negotiated by the Union. By these statements we do not intend to say that Kemp is es-topped from asserting his rights under the Act but as indicated he subjected himself to the closed-shop provisions of the Union\u2019s contract with Chatillon. While the Act must be construed liberally for the benefit of the veteran, we may not hold that a condition of employment to which the veteran himself has in fact subscribed may be disregarded either by him or by his employer. This, we think, is the plain intendment of the decision of the Supreme Court in Fish-gold v. Sullivan Corporation, supra. It follows that Kemp\u2019s discharge was for cause. The judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-11\"> This is the term employed in the petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b268-12\"> Neither the exact provisions of the closed-shop contract nor the contract it\u25a0self were put in evidence. The parties refer to the closed-shop provisions of the contract as \u201cstandard\u201d and treat them as prohibiting employment by ChatiUon of any worker who does not join the Union. During Kemp\u2019s absence in the service it appears that a new contract .requiring an increase in wages and other benefits was negotiated by the Union with Chatillon. The parties are in agreement that the new contract did not change or alter the closed-shop provisions in effect at the times when Kemp was first employed by Chatillon and when he was inducted into the Army.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-23\">Under these circumstances and in the interest of expedition we think it unnecessary to remand the cause for the specific purpose of requiring these contracts to be received in evidence by the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>below. We take this occasion, however, to point out that in every ease such as that at bar it will be of substantial assistance to the trial court as well as to this tribunal if all pertinent contracts are introduced in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b269-8\"> The Union is also referred to in the record and briefs as \u201cMetal Producers and Novelty Workers Union\u201d; the \u201cMetal Polishers\u2019 Union, Local 28\u201d; and \u201cMetal Polishers Union, Local 28-A\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b269-13\"> The court below made no direct findings of fact upon this point but did find: \u201cj.
