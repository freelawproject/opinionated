MILLER, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b1027-24\">This appeal requires us to decide between conflicting claims to the proceeds of a policy of insurance on the life of James Burns Homing. By the terms of the policy, which was issued January 12, 1926, the insurer agreed to pay, upon receipt of due proof of the death of .the insured, the sum of $5,000 to \u201chis wife, Mary Margaret Horning, if living; otherwise to his executors, administrators or assigns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-25\">Mrs. Horning died in November, 1945. Her husband lived some sixteen months thereafter, and died without having changed the language of the beneficiary clause just quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-26\">Horning\u2019s executors, who are the appellants, claimed the proceeds of the policy on the theory that, as Mrs. Horning was not living when her husband died, they are the designated beneficiaries. Under a statute, the text of which -is shown in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mrs. Horning\u2019s administratrix, who is the appellee, also claimed the proceeds. The District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia awarded summary judgment to the beneficiary\u2019s administratrix. The executors of the insured appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-27\">Mrs. Horning\u2019s administratrix relies upon our construction of the statute in Kin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>dleberger v. Lincoln National Bank* **<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to sustain the judgment of the Distriot Court. But the policies involved in that case unqualifiedly designated the wife of the insured as the beneficiary; there was no limiting expression such as the words \u201cif living\u201d which are in the policy now before us. And, although in that case the beneficiary died before her husband\u2019s death, he did not designate a successor beneficiary, as he had .the right to do. We held that, in such circumstances, the statute gave the proceeds to the beneficiary\u2019s estate, regardless of a policy provision to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">In the present case, however, the wife was not designated unconditionally as the beneficiary. She was to be such only if she were living when the insured died. The statute does not apply here because Mrs. Horning was.not \u201cthe lawful beneficiary\u201d of which the statute speaks. She was only contingently and potentially the beneficiary. Horning deliberately had written in the policy the designation of other beneficiaries should his wife precede him in death. Consequently, as she died prior to his death and so <em>never became the beneficiary, </em>title to the proceeds of the \u2022policy never vested in her and the designation of the insured\u2019s executors, administrators or assigns as beneficiaries became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">It is pointed out by the appellee that in his application for the insurance, which by statute and by express provision of the policy is made \u00e1 part of the contract, Horning requested that Mary Margaret Horning be named as beneficiary and that the words \u201cif living; otherwise to his executors, administrators or assigns\u201d do not appear in the application. She argues that the wording of .the application prevails over that of the policy; that her decedent was therefore designated as .beneficiary without condition or limitation; and -that the statute is applicable, as it was in the Kindleberger case. The appellee proceeds ' from an unsound premise, for where a provision of an application and a policy are in irreconcilable conflict, the language of the policy controls. McMaster v.
