Alvarez appeals the district court\u2019s order that found his notice of appeal timely and entered a separate judgment order as to its dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. We previously denied a certificate of appealability and dismissed Alvarez\u2019s appeal of the court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>No. 02-6276, 2004 WL 249572 (4th Cir. Feb.11, 2004) (per curiam). Because Alvarez seeks review of the same order in this appeal, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
