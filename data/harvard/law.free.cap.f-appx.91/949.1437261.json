For the reasons discussed below, Ferrell\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is GRANTED. Ferrell\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel on appeal is DENIED. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">The district court was correct in its determination that there is no constitutional basis for Ferrell\u2019s assertion that he was transferred from a local prison to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice \u2014 Institutional Division (TDCJ-ID) in violation of state law, thereby subjecting him to cruel and unusual punishment and involuntary servitude. <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Malchi v. Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953, 957 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Madison v. Parker, </em>104 F.3d 765, 767 (5th Cir.1997) (citation omitted). This portion of the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-19\">Contrary to the conclusion reached by the district court, this court has recognized that prisoners have a right to bodily privacy. <em>Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 745-46 (5th Cir.2002) Even though \u201cany such right is minimal, at best,\u201d the intrusion on the inmate\u2019s right to bodily privacy must be balanced against the state\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987)). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Ferrell\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous on this issue is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">IFP GRANTED; APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b982-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
