Tommark, Inc., </em>227 F.Supp.2d 454 (D.Md.2002), which we now affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-21\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) provides that a summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing all facts and inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Mgt., Inc., </em>354 F.3d 277, 283 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-22\">In ruling on Tommark\u2019s summary judgment motion, the district court recognized that likelihood of confusion is a necessary element of each of Sterling\u2019s claims, and it evaluated the seven factors commonly utilized in this circuit for determining likelihood of confusion. 227 F.Supp.2d at 460 65. The district court found on the record presented that although three of these factors favored Sterling, the other four factors favored Tommark. <em>Id. </em>The district court further found that the four factors that favored Tommark were entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>more weight than the three factors that favored Sterling and that \u201c[t]he cumulative weight of all seven factors favors [Tom-mark].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466. In light of these findings, the district court concluded that \u201ca reasonable jury could not on the record [presented] find that there exists a likelihood of confusion between [Sterling\u2019s] registered trademark and [Tommark\u2019s] mark,\u201d and it accordingly granted Tom-mark\u2019s summary judgment motion. <em>Id. </em>at 461.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">We have carefully considered the district court\u2019s order in light of the record, the controlling law, and the parties\u2019 briefs and oral arguments. For the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s order, we conclude that the district court correctly determined that Sterling failed to present sufficient evidence on the issue of likelihood of confusion to withstand Tommark\u2019s summary judgment motion. Because likelihood of confusion is a necessary element of each of plaintiffs causes of action, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Tommark. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-16\">. Sterling asserted three claims against Tom-mark, Incorporated in its amended complaint: (1) federal trademark infringement (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114); (2) false designation of origin (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)); and (3) common law infringement and unfair competition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b912-23\">. The district court also granted in part Tom-mark\u2019s motion to strike portions of certain affidavits submitted by Sterling. <em>See </em>227 F.Supp.2d at 459-60. Sterling has not appealed that ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b913-8\">. The district court alternatively granted summary judgment in favor of Tommark because Sterling failed to present evidence to establish that it would be entitled to actual damages, an accounting, or injunctive relief. 227 F.Supp.2d at 466-68. In light of our determination on the issue of liability, we need not decide whether Tommark was also entitled to summary judgment on these grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
