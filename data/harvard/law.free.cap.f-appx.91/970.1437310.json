Lann\u2019s styled his action as one brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-20\">Because the district court did not enter a judgment on a separate document as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 58, Lann\u2019s notice of appeal, filed more than two months after the district court signed the order dismissing the action, is timely as to that order. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-21\">Lann\u2019s pleadings and exhibits reveal that his complaint did not allege a constitutional violation or otherwise establish a federal question that would confer federal jurisdiction on the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. <em>See Rheuark v. Shaw, </em>628 F.2d 297, 302-03 (5th Cir.1980). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-22\">Lann\u2019s motion to amend the record is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-23\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1002-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
