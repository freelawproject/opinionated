The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended that Golson be sentenced as a career offender based on the instant offense and his prior felony convictions. The district court adopted the findings in the PSR and sentenced Golson to 263 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Golson\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising one issue: whether Golson received ineffective assistance of counsel. Golson was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Golson\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be brought, if at all, in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), because the record in this appeal does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Golson\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
