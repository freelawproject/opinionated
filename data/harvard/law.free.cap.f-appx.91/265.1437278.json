Hyman argues the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress a statement given to a Durham police officer. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), a defendant may waive his constitutional rights to remain silent and to have counsel if he does so \u201cvoluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444. This Court reviews the totality of the circumstances in concluding that a defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights were properly waived. <em>See United States v. Cristobal, </em>293 F.3d 134, 140 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 963, 123 S.Ct. 396, 154 L.Ed.2d 319 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Hyman avers due to his pain from the gunshot wound, he was unable to make a reasoned decision to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Pain alone generally does not invalidate a <em>Miranda </em>waiver.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Cristobal, </em>293 F.3d at 142. While, in some circumstances, medication may render an individual incapable of making a reasoned decision to waive his rights, the record developed in this case did not indicate that the medication administered to Hyman had that effect. <em>See id. </em>We have reviewed the transcript of the suppression hearing and find under the totality of the circumstances, the district court did not err in finding Hyman knowingly and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">Accordingly, we affirm Hyman\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-12\"> Hyman does not argue his waiver was involuntaiy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
