We have reviewed the record and the tax court\u2019s orders and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the tax court. <em>See Tiffany v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>Tax Ct. No. 03-2921 (U.S.T.C. May 16, 2003 &amp; July 16, 2003). Additionally, we deny Tiffany\u2019s motion for a stay of proceedings and deny the Commissioner\u2019s motion for sanctions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
