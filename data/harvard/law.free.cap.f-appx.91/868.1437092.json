Powell filed her petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). However, because she was convicted by a Cherokee Tribal Court and not a state court, we find that the proper jurisdictional basis for her habeas corpus application is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000). Therefore, a certificate of appealability is not required. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). Accordingly, we deny as unnecessary Powell\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinions and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Powell v. Ogle, </em>No. CA-03-168-2 (W.D.N.C. July 9, 2003). Although we grant the Appellees\u2019 motions to file additional material, we deny their motions to dismiss and for damages and costs. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
