At the revocation hearing, Sutton admitted the violations. The district court departed from the recommended guideline range of twenty-one to twenty-four months and imposed a twelve-month term of imprisonment, to be followed by thirty months of supervised release. Sutton timely appeals. On appeal, his attorney has filed an <em>Anders</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>brief, raising two issues: (1) whether the district court erred by originally imposing a five-year term of supervised release and (2) whether the district court erred by imposing an additional term of supervised release upon revocation. Sutton has filed a pro se supplemental brief, further discussing the issues raised by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-20\">Sutton first argues that the supervised release term in his original sentence was an erroneous application of the applicable statutes and guidelines. However, this question is not properly before us. In an appeal from the revocation of supervised release, we lack jurisdiction to examine the sentencing proceeding in which the term of supervised release was imposed. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>138 F.3d 115, 117-18 (4th Cir.1998). If Sutton found the supervised release term to be objectionable, he should have raised this claim in his direct appeal. Consequently, we decline to review the merits of this challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-21\">Sutton next contends that the district court lacked the authority to impose another term of supervised release upon the revocation of his original term. Although 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) (2000) explicitly permits the imposition of such a term, Sutton asserts that the 1994 amendments to \u00a7 3583(h) should not apply to him, as his original offense was committed in 1990. While the Supreme Court agreed that \u00a7 3583(h) does not apply retroactively in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000), the Court held that imposition of supervised release following reimprisonment was authorized by the former 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (1994). <em>Johnson, </em>529 U.S. at 702-03, 713, 120 S.Ct. 1795. Because the statute in effect at the time of Sutton\u2019s offenses permitted a sentencing court, upon the revocation of supervised release, to impose a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>sentence of imprisonment followed by an additional term of supervised release, the district court\u2019s sentence in this case was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Sutton\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny Sutton\u2019s motion to stay the appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-18\"> <em>Anders v.
