Kebe claimed that the officers,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> particularly Corporal Parke Brown, violated her daughter\u2019s rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and that he committed common law battery and common law defamation, Counts I \u2014 III, respectively. The district court granted partial summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>judgment in favor of Kebe on Count I, holding that the officers\u2019 stop of K.J. violated her rights under \u00a7 1983, and the court granted summary judgment in favor of Corporal Brown on Counts II and III, holding that he was immune from suit. The issues of whether Corporal Brown frisked K.J. and whether the frisk caused her any damages were tried by jury. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found in favor of Kebe and awarded nominal damages in the amount of $1, and the jury declined to award punitive damages. Kebe now appeals. As explained below, we affirm the district court in all aspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Corporal Parke Brown and his partner, Officer Gerald Knight, of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, responded to a 911 dispatch call on June 14, 1999. The call indicated that four or five young black males, one of whom was carrying a large chain as a weapon, were chasing another black male in a residential area in Beltsville, Maryland. After arriving in the vicinity where the boys were allegedly seen, Brown and Knight stopped and exited their police vehicle with their guns drawn. They encountered another group of youths immediately thereafter. Knight frisked a young man who allegedly fit the description of one of the suspects, ran a background check on him, and eventually released him. Then, Brown pointed his gun at the three remaining youths and ordered them to the ground, frisking each for weapons. One of the remaining three youths was K.J. The officers had not received any information about a female being among the group of the alleged perpetrators, yet they proceeded to stop and search her for weapons. At the time of the stop, K.J. was wearing silk boxer shorts, a form-fitting tank top, and ballerina shoes, under which no reasonable officer could have believed a weapon was hidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Kebe appeals on the following four grounds: (1) the jury instructions misstated the law and misled the jury, because they inferred that Corporal Brown\u2019s liability was undecided; (2) the district court erred by refusing to award Kebe\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees in response to the parties\u2019 cross-motions for sanctions; (3) the district court erred by denying Kebe a hearing on her motion for a new trial; and (4) the district court erred by denying Kebe\u2019s post-trial motion for attorney\u2019s fees. We reject each ground for appeal and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Kebe first challenges the district court\u2019s jury instructions. Kebe contends that the jury instructions, regarding the state of mind required to establish Corporal Brown\u2019s liability for the frisk, were erroneous because the issue of liability had already been decided in Kebe\u2019s favor when the Court partially granted her motion for summary judgment. Kebe\u2019s contention assumes that because she was awarded partial summary judgment on the unlawfulness of the stop, which presumes that Corporal Brown acted with the requisite mental intent, that Corporal Brown also necessarily acted with the requisite intent regarding the frisk.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">Corporal Brown maintains that the jury instructions were not erroneous because the \u201cdistrict court made clear that the issue of liability was limited to the frisk as the court had already determined the [sic] Brown was liable as to the stop.\u201d (Br. for Appellee, at 6.) Moreover, Corporal Brown argues that any error caused by the jury instructions was harmless, because the jury ultimately ruled in Kebe\u2019s favor. We agree with Corporal Brown, and hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>the instructions neither mis-stated the law nor misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">We begin our analysis by noting that the accuracy and adequacy of jury instructions are reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Momson, </em>991 F.2d 112, 116 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 881, 114 S.Ct. 225, 126 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993). It is the reviewing court\u2019s responsibility to determine whether the instructions as a whole, \u201cadequately informed the jury of the controlling legal principles without misleading or confusing the jury to the prejudice of the [appellant].\u201d <em>Spell v. McDaniel, </em>824 F.2d 1380, 1395 (4th Cir.1987). In reviewing the \u201cadequacy of [a trial court\u2019s] ... choice of jury instructions,\u201d appellate courts accord trial courts considerable discretion. <em>United States v. Hassouneh, </em>199 F.3d 175, 181 (4th Cir.2000); <em>see also Bailey v. County of Georgetown, </em>94 F.3d 152, 155 (4th Cir.1996) (same); <em>Teague v. Bakker, </em>35 F.3d 978, 985 (4th Cir.1994) (same). Moreover, a \u201cjudgment will be reversed for error in jury instructions \u2018only if the error is determined to have been prejudicial, based on a review of the record as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sturges v. Matthews, </em>53 F.3d 659, 661 (4th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Wellington v. Daniels, </em>717 F.2d 932, 938 (4th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">In the instant matter, the district court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">In this case, it has already been decided that Corporal Brown did not have reason to stop [K.J.], nor cause to frisk her. It is uncontested that the defendant <em>stopped </em>[K.J.] and, thus, violated her Fourth Amendment right in that regard. You will have to decide whether he also <em>frisked </em>her and, thus, violated her Fourth Amendment [right] in that fashion also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-10\">Finally, to establish a claim under Section 1983 <em>with regard to the frisk </em>against the defendant, the plaintiff must also show that the defendant acted <em>intentionally </em>or <em>recklessly. </em>If you find that the acts of the defendant were merely negligent, then, even if you find that the plaintiff was injured as a result of those acts, you must return a verdict for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-11\">An act is <em>intentional </em>if it is done knowingly, that is, if it is done voluntarily and deliberately, and not because of mistake, accident, negligence or other innocent reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">(J.A. 237-38) (emphasis added). The court also defined the <em>mens rea </em>elements for \u201creckless,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u201cnegligent\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> behavior in the instructions to the jury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">We find no error in the instructions given to the jury. In fact, this Court upheld similar jury instructions in <em>Sturges v. Matthews, </em>53 F.3d 659 (4th Cir.1995). In <em>Sturges, </em>the personal representative of a suspect, who died after losing control of his vehicle while being chased by the police, brought a \u00a7 1983 action against the deputy sheriff, the county, and the county sheriff. At the trial, the jury was instructed, in part, as follows: \u201cIn the event you find based upon a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff has not proved that the defendant ... acted intentionally or willfully and thereby violated the constitutional rights of the decedent, then you would find for the defendant.\u201d <em>Sturges, </em>53 F.3d at 662. The personal representative appealed, challenging the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>portion of the jury instructions that required the jury to find that the government actor had committed an <em>intentional </em>or <em>willful </em>act. <em>Id. </em>at 661. We upheld the instructions on appeal, concluding that they \u201cwere not misleading and contained an adequate statement of the law to guide the jury\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662. In fact, we noted that the district court\u2019s instructions \u201crepeatedly emphasized the <em>Brower </em>requirement....\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Brower v. County of Inyo, </em>the Supreme Court held that in order to find a Fourth Amendment violation, \u201can <em>intentional </em>acquisition of physical control\u201d is required, because \u201cthe Fourth Amendment addresses \u2018misuse of power,\u2019 not the accidental effects of otherwise lawful government conduct.\u201d 489 U.S. 593, 596, 109 S.Ct. 1378, 103 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989)(emphasis added)(quoting <em>Byars v. United States, </em>273 U.S. 28, 33, 47 S.Ct. 248, 71 L.Ed. 520 (1927)). Based upon that principle, we affirmed the jury instructions in <em>Sturges.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Because the instructions in <em>Sturges </em>are very similar to the instructions given by the district court in the present case, we likewise conclude that it was not error for the court to instruct the jury in that manner. Moreover, the district judge made clear in the instructions that the necessary intent pertained <em>only to the issue of the frisk, </em>by stating that Corporal Brown had already been found liable for the unreasonable <em>stop </em>of K.J. (J.A. 237.) The Court also noted that no determination had previously been made regarding Corporal Brown\u2019s mental state as to the <em>frisk, </em>and that it was, therefore, the jury\u2019s responsibility to determine if Corporal Brown wrongfully <em>frisked </em>KJ. Accordingly, we conclude that the jury instructions pertaining to the requisite intent for Kebe\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim were not erroneous, because they did not mislead or confuse the jury nor misstate the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Kebe also argues that the district court erred by failing to award her attorney\u2019s fees as requested in her motion for sanctions, filed pursuant to Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In her motion for sanctions, Kebe alleged that Corporal Brown\u2019s counsel committed discovery violations concerning one of his key witnesses. Therefore, she requested, as one possible sanction, that Appellee be made to pay her attorney\u2019s fees. A magistrate judge conducted a hearing pertaining to the parties\u2019 cross-motions for sanctions, and the judge denied both motions, finding no factual support for either. Kebe never filed an objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Rule 72 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that a party must file and serve a written objection to a magistrate judge\u2019s order on a nondispositive matter within ten days after being served with a copy of the magistrate judge\u2019s order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 72. Thereafter, \u201ca party may not assign as error a defect in the magistrate judge\u2019s order to which objection was not timely made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The magistrate judge\u2019s order disposing of Kebe\u2019s Rule 37 motion for sanctions is undoubtedly a nondispositive matter covered by Rule 72. Therefore, because Kebe failed to file a written objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s order, any issues Kebe may have regarding that order have been waived and may not be raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Next, Kebe contends that the district court erred by denying her request for an evidentiary hearing in connection with her motion for a new trial. Although Kebe frames this issue as a challenge to the court\u2019s denial of her request for an eviden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>tiary hearing, she is essentially arguing that it was error for the district court to deny her motion for a new trial. We review the denial of a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>Bristol Steel &amp; Iron Works, Inc. v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>41 F.3d 182, 186 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">This Circuit has specifically recognized three instances in which an appellate court must set aside a jury verdict and grant a new trial: \u201c(1) the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence, or (2) is based upon evidence which is false, or (3) will result in a miscarriage of justice even though there may be substantial evidence which would prevent the direction of a verdict.\u201d <em>Knussman v. Maryland, </em>272 F.3d 625, 639 (4th Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted); <em>see Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc. v. Crane Nat\u2019l Vendors, Inc., </em>99 F.3d 587, 594 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">As grounds for her motion, Kebe asserts the \u201cprejudice associated with the fact that [her] counsel was forced to spend the weekend immediately preceding trial responding to Brown\u2019s motion seeking to bar Kebe from putting on its [sic] evidence of emotional damages, rather than otherwise preparing for trial.\u201d (Br. for Appellant at 33.) Kebe refers to Brown\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>which was filed less than a week before trial, in which his counsel sought to bar expert testimony regarding K.J.\u2019s mental state after the June 14, 1999 incident. Kebe\u2019s argument most closely falls under the third ground for a new trial; that is by responding to the motion <em>in limine, </em>her counsel was taken away from trial preparation, which resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Kebe\u2019s argument is without merit for several reasons. First, it appears from the record that the district court apparently denied Brown\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>because Kebe\u2019s witness, Ms. Judith Laverne Conway, was permitted to testify regarding KJ.\u2019s emotional state before and after the June 14, 1999 incident. (Tr. at 28-40, March 6, 2002). Therefore, the court decided the motion <em>in limine </em>in Kebe\u2019s favor. Second, Kebe has not demonstrated how she was prejudiced by having to respond to Brown\u2019s last-minute motion. Kebe fails to detail how her trial preparation was detrimentally interrupted by responding to the motion <em>in limine. </em>For those reasons, we conclude that the district judge neither abused his discretion by denying Kebe\u2019s motion for a new trial nor her request for an evidentiary hearing regarding the motion. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">Lastly, Kebe contends that the district court erred by denying her post-trial motion for attorney\u2019s fees, which was filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. We review the denial of a motion for attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Johnson v. City of Aiken, </em>278 F.3d 333, 336 (4th Cir.2002). We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Kebe\u2019s motion, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">The very statute under which Kebe filed her motion states that \u201cthe court, <em>in its discretion, may </em>allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (emphasis added.) In denying Kebe\u2019s motion, the district court relied upon <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992), and <em>City of Aiken. </em>In <em>Farrar, </em>the Supreme Court held that a party who receives only nominal damages is still deemed to be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the context of awarding attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. 506 U.S. at 113, 113 S.Ct. 566. However, the Court also held that, although the nominal damages does not affect the \u201cprevailing party\u201d analysis, \u201cit does bear on the propriety of fees awarded under \u00a7 1988\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>because the \u201cdegree of the plaintiffs overall success goes to the reasonableness of a fee award under <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The petitioners in <em>Farrar </em>received only nominal damages, and the Supreme Court affirmed the denial of attorney\u2019s fees, holding that \u201c[a] plaintiff who seeks compensatory damages but receives no more than nominal damages\u201d is the type of prevailing party that is entitled to \u201cno attorney\u2019s fees at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115, 113 S.Ct. 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">In <em>City of Aiken, </em>the jury awarded the appellees nominal damages in the amount of thirty five cents, yet awarded \u201c$81,994.61 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d 278 F.3d at 336. When the fee was challenged on appeal, we held, based on the reasoning of <em>Farrar, </em>that the \u201c \u2018success\u2019 [of the appellees] was not sufficient to justify a \u00a7 1988 award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338 (quoting <em>Farrar, </em>506 U.S. at 115,113 S.Ct. 566). When a party seeks primarily to recover monetary damages, and is awarded only nominal damages, that party \u201chas succeeded in only a technical sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we vacated the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees in <em>City of Aiken. </em>Because Kebe sought only monetary damages in her civil rights claim, as opposed to also seeking some form of injunctive relief,4 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> she falls squarely within the mandate of <em>Farrar, </em>which holds that plaintiffs who seek compensatory and punitive damages, but are only awarded nominal damages, may be denied an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Kebe\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">For the reasons discussed above, we find no reversible error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-12\">.
