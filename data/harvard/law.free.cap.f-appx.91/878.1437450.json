In Rice\u2019s presentence report, the probation officer recommended that the offense level be increased by three levels pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(b) (2002). The district court expressly adopted the findings of fact contained in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-26\">Though Rice did not raise any objections to the presentence report at the time of her sentencing, she now contends that her offense level should not have been increased because the district court failed to recite its findings to support the adjustment. After careful review of the record, we find that Rice\u2019s challenge fails to demonstrate plain error. <em>See United States v. Wells, </em>163 F.3d 889, 900 (4th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Terry, </em>916 F.2d 157, 162 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-27\">We accordingly affirm Rice\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>gument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
