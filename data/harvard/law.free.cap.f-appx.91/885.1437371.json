Lopez-Vera\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Lopez-Vera was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-21\">Counsel questions whether the district court erred in sentencing Lopez-Vera to a sixty-five-month term of imprisonment. We find that the district court properly computed Lopez-Vera\u2019s total offense level and criminal history category and correctly determined the applicable guideline range of fifty-seven to seventy-one months. The court\u2019s imposition of a sentence within the properly calculated range is not reviewable. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>18 F.3d 1145, 1151 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-22\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Lopezr-Vera\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
