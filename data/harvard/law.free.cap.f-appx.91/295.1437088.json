Spotts previously sought the same relief in his appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. We denied the request for a writ of mandamus in that action. <em>United States v. Spotts, </em>No. O3-7794 (4th Cir. Feb. 25, 2004). Accordingly, Spotts\u2019 mandamus petition is denied. We grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
