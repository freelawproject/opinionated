Sondley, currently federal prisoner number 70389-080, appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights complaint brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court dismissed the complaint as a sanction, finding that Sondley committed perjury by failing to list in his complaint a prior lawsuit making similar claims that Sondley had filed in the Abilene Division of the Northern District of Texas six months before he filed the instant suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-23\">In addition to challenging the dismissal, Sondley argues that the district court erred by 1) failing to permit him to engage in discovery past the deadlines set in the pretrial order, 2) denying his aecess-tocourts claim and request to amend the complaint, 3) denying him a default judgment against the medical defendants, 4) denying his cross-motion for summary judgment, 5) denying his request for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>pretrial conference, 6) empaneling a juror that he had struck, and 7) permitting the defendants to cross-examine him about his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We conclude that there is no merit to any of Sondley\u2019s issues. The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the complaint as a sanction against Sondley. <em>See Hatchet v. Nettles, </em>201 F.3d 651, 654 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Mercury Air Group, Inc. v. Mansour, </em>237 F.3d 542, 548 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Sondley\u2019s appeal is without merit and is frivolous. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of the appeal counts as a strike against Sondley for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Sondley is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Sondley\u2019s motion to file his reply brief out-of-time is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED. SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED. MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
