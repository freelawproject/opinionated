INS, </em>963 F.2d 1376, 1379 (10th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Rivera-Cruz v. INS, </em>948 F.2d 962, 969 (5th Cir.1991)). To establish such eligibility, Khan must show \u201cpast persecution so severe that repatriation would be inhumane.\u201d <em>Id.; see Matter of Chen, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 16, 19 (BIA 1989). We have held that \u201c[eligibility for asylum based on severity of persecution alone is reserved for the most atro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>cious abuse.\u201d <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 544 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Even if Khan was severely mistreated while detained in Pakistan, his case is simply not \u201c\u2018the rare case where past persecution is so severe that it would be inhumane to return the alien even in the absence of any risk of future persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Vaduva v. INS, </em>131 F.3d 689, 690 (7th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Khan alleges on appeal that, even in the absence of a well-founded fear of persecution, he is entitled to asylum because \u201cthere is a reasonable possibility that he ... may suffer other serious harm\u201d on removal to Pakistan. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii)(B). As Khan did not raise this claim before the immigration judge or the Board, he has waived the issue and may not present it to this court. <em>Gonahasa, </em>181 F.3d at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">We uphold the Board\u2019s denial of Khan\u2019s application for withholding of deportation. The standard for receiving withholding of deportation is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution based on a protected ground. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Kahn has failed to establish refugee status, he cannot satisfy the higher standard for withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">We deny Kahn\u2019s motion for stay of deportation and the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
