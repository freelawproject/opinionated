See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b342-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b342-22\">John Joseph Nosse appeals his sentence following his guilty plea to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (2000). Nosse\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although counsel states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, she raises the issue of whether the district court abused its discretion by sentencing Nosse to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment and imposing a $5000 fine. Although informed of his right to do so, Nosse did not file a pro se supplemental brief. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have considered the briefs and examined the entire record for meritorious issues. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-23\">It is well-settled that a sentence within a properly calculated sentencing guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>range is not appealable. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>18 F.3d 1145, 1151 (4th Cir.1994) (holding \u00a7 3742(a) precludes a criminal defendant from seeking review of court\u2019s sentence anywhere within properly calculated sentencing range); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) (2000). Because Nosse\u2019s 210-month sentence falls within the properly calculated guidelines range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment, it is not reviewable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Moreover, Nosse waived his right to appeal any fine imposed not in excess of the appropriate guidelines range. A defendant may, in a valid plea agreement, waive the right to appeal under \u00a7 3742(a), as long as it is the result of a knowing and intelligent decision to forgo the right to appeal. <em>United State v. Wessell, </em>936 F.2d 165 (4th Cir.1991). Because Nosse\u2019s fine was not in excess of the $15,000 to $150,000 range established by the guidelines, and because his waiver was knowing and intelligent, he may not appeal the imposition of the fine to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case, including the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 and sentencing transcripts, and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Nosse\u2019s sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court to withdraw from representation at that time. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Nosse.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
