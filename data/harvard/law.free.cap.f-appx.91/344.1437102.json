Warren pleaded guilty to bank fraud. By fraudulently keeping for his own enrichment the proceeds of used car sales, Warren failed to repay money loaned under a financing arrangement between the bank and Warren\u2019s used car dealership. Warren also failed to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>state sales taxes he collected as part of the same sale proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Warren appeals the district court\u2019s determination of relevant conduct that increased his sentence by including the unpaid sales taxes in the amount of loss attributed to the crime. Warren fails to show that the unpaid taxes were not part of the same course of conduct that included defrauding the bank. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a) <em>&amp; </em>comment, (n.9). Warren also fails to establish that his failure to pay the sales tax was not \u201ccriminal conduct\u201d as is required to constitute relevant conduct for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>124 F.3d 655, 665 n. 10 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
