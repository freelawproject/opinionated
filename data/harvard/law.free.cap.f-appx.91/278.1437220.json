On appeal, he maintains that: (1) the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (2000) for obstruction of justice; and (2) the court\u2019s application of USSG \u00a7 3C1.2, reckless endangerment during flight, and USSG \u00a7 2Pl.l(b)(l), threat or use of force against a person during escape, constituted impermissible double counting. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">The district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error, and its application of the sentencing guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). The district court determines issues related to sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Engleman, </em>916 F.2d 182, 184 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">We have reviewed the briefs and materials submitted in the joint appendix in light of Patillo\u2019s arguments and find no error in Patillo\u2019s sentencing. We therefore affirm his sentence based upon the reasoning stated by the district court at Patillo\u2019s sentencing hearing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
