Garcia contends, for the first time on appeal, that his sentence violated the relevant statutory maximum of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and that the district court erred by imposing the 16-level crime-of-violence adjustment of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because he was not actually convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in Minnesota in 2000. He also contends, for the first time on appeal, that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">A sentence that exceeds the statutory maximum is illegal and constitutes plain error. <em>United States v. Sias, </em>227 F.3d 244, 246 (5th Cir.2000). Garcia was deported before his scheduled sentencing date in Minnesota, and he has never been sentenced on his Minnesota guilty plea. He was never formally adjudicated guilty in Minnesota. <em>See State v. Hoelzel, </em>639 N.W.2d 605, 609 (Minn.2002). Garcia was not convicted in Minnesota for federal immigration law purposes. <em>See Moosa v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 994, 1001-02 (5th Cir.1999). As the government concedes, the district court therefore erred by imposing the 16-level adjustment and by sentencing Garcia to more than two years\u2019 imprisonment. Because the district court erred by sentencing Garcia under the \u201caggravated felony\u201d provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), we do not reach the issue, raised for the first time on appeal, of the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
