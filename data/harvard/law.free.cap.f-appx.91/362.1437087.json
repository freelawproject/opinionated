No timely notice of appeal was filed from the original judgment, and the amended and re-entered judgments that made only clerical changes pursuant to Fed. R.Crim. P. 36 did not extend the time for filing a notice of appeal. <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>921 F.2d 563, 565 (5th Cir.1991); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b).
