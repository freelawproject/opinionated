On appeal, the district court reversed by an order dated October 11, 2002, and we now affirm that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Prior to bankruptcy, in 1991, Weitz sold his ownership interest in CMC to two former employees of CMC by means of a complex transaction involving a promissory note and collateralization of the note with the stock of CMC. When payment under the note became in default, the parties instituted multiple litigations in Maryland and in Virginia, each involving claims and counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">In February 2000, CMC filed a petition in bankruptcy under Chapter 11, and thereafter the trustee hired Bardyl Tirana, who had represented CMC in its other litigation against Weitz, to represent CMC\u2019s interests in bankruptcy-related litigation. Tirana filed this adversary action on behalf of CMC, which Weitz alleged was the fourth suit in which CMC asserted the same or similar claims. On Weitz\u2019 motion, the bankruptcy court dismissed most of CMC\u2019s claims on the ground that they were barred by <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel and imposed sanctions against Tirana in the amount of $83,000 because Tirana filed the complaint \u201cin the face of a clear bar based upon the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel.\u201d The bankruptcy court rejected Weitz\u2019 alternative ground for sanctions based on the argument that the claims were barred by the <em>Colorado River </em>doctrine. <em>See Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976). The bankruptcy court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-9\">Defendant\u2019s reliance upon the <em>Colorado River </em>doctrine in support of this motion is inappropriate. The doctrine is a type of abstention that is discretionary. Therefore, this court will not consider the application of the <em>Colorado River </em>doctrine as a basis for the imposition of sanctions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">On appeal to the district court, the district court reversed the bankruptcy court\u2019s imposition of sanctions, concluding that CMC\u2019s claims were not clearly barred by <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. Having not been presented with the alternative argument under the <em>Colorado River </em>doctrine, it did not review the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling on that doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">In this appeal, Weitz does not challenge the district court\u2019s ruling that CMC\u2019s claims were not clearly barred by <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. Instead, he relies on the alternative ground presented to the bankruptcy court that CMC\u2019s claims against Weitz were barred under the <em>Colorado River </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">Without resolving the complex question <em>of </em>whether the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling on the <em>Colorado River </em>doctrine is before us, <em>see Schering Corp. v. Illinois Antibiotics Co., </em>89 F.3d 357, 358 (7th Cir.1996); <em>Crocker v. Piedmont Aviation, Inc., </em>49 F.3d 735, 741 (D.C.Cir.1995), we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Weitz\u2019 alternative argument that sanctions should be imposed because the claims were barred by the <em>Colorado River </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">Under the <em>Colorado River </em>doctrine, a federal court may, in rare cases, abstain from exercising jurisdiction over a federal action when a parallel state suit exists. 424 U.S. at 818-19, 96 S.Ct. 1236. Abstention, however, is \u201cthe exception rather than the rule,\u201d with the balance of factors \u201cheavily weighted in favor of the exercise of [federal] jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Al-Abood v. El-Shamari, </em>217 F.3d 225, 232 (4th Cir.2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Weitz contends that sanctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>were warranted because Tirana filed duplicative pleadings and should have known that the bankruptcy court would invoke the <em>Colorado River </em>doctrine and refuse to exercise jurisdiction. However, given the discretionary nature of the <em>Colorado River </em>doctrine and the heavy presumption in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction, application of the doctrine would rarely, if ever, be so certain as to warrant sanctions for the filing of a parallel action in federal court. Certainly, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting this ground for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the October 11, 2002 order of the district court denying sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
