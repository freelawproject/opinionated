Trinidad argues that the district court erroneously denied him a sentence reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 safety valve provision, U.S.C.G. 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-19\">We review the decision to deny the application of U.S.C.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 for clear error. <em>United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 145 (5th Cir.1996). The safety valve provision, in pertinent part, requires that a defendant, at or before sentencing, provide the Government with all the information and evidence he has concerning his offense. U.S.C.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-20\">We ordinarily do not disturb a district court\u2019s credibility determinations and see no reason to do so in the instant case. <em>See United States v. Ridgeway, </em>321 F.3d 512, 516 (5th Cir.2003). After reviewing the record, we are convinced that the district court did not clearly err when it denied Trinidad the reduction afforded by the safety valve provision. <em>See Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-21\">Trinidad also challenges the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. 841(a) and (b) in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Trinidad concedes, his <em>Apprendi </em>argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
