Davidson\u2019s principal contention is that the defendantsappellees violated his constitutional rights in refusing to treat his hepatitis B and C by medicating him with interferon. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), a district court may dismiss an IFP complaint as frivolous or for failure to state a claim. A complaint is frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis in either law or fact. <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-13\">Prison officials violate the constitutional proscription against cruel and unusual punishment when they are deliberately indifferent to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs, as doing so constitutes unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). To prevail on such a claim, a plaintiff \u201cmust allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). Deliberate indifference encompasses only unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain repugnant to the conscience of mankind. <em>Id. </em>at 105-06. \u201cThe legal conclusion of \u2018deliberate indifference[ ]\u2019 ... must rest on facts clearly evincing \u2018wanton\u2019 actions on the part of the defendants.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Treen, </em>759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>A showing of deliberate indifference requires the inmate to submit evidence that prison officials \u201c \u2018refused to treat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Johnson, </em>759 F.2d at 1238). Unsuccessful medical treatment, ordinary acts of negligence, or medical malpractice do not constitute a cause of action under \u00a7 1983. <em>Stewart v. Murphy, </em>174 F.3d 530, 534 (5th Cir.1999). Absent exceptional circumstances, a prisoner\u2019s disagreement with his medical treatment is not actionable under \u00a7 1983. <em>Banuelos v. McFarland, </em>41 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Davidson supports his claim of entitlement to relief by referring to authorities who advocate interferon therapy for persons with psychiatric disorders by use of controlled trials, nocturnal administration, dosage reduction, biweekly psychiatric checkups, and psychoactive drugs. Other than the fact that on occasion his alanine aminotransferase (ALT) readings have been somewhat elevated, however, Davidson has not shown any basis for concluding that his hepatitis is or has been severe enough to mandate such extraordinary medical intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Davidson faults appellee Dr. Revell for not having referred him for determination of the degree of his liver inflammation, fibrosis, or cirrhosis, as to which several authorities recommend a biopsy. Davidson\u2019s ALTs were approximately normal as of April 2002, however, when he was transferred from Dr. Revell\u2019s unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">Davidson recognizes that, as the magistrate judge observed, TDCJ-ID Policy B-14.13 provides that \u201c[sjevere depression or other active neuropsychiatric disorder is classified as an \u2018absolute contraindication\u2019 to interferon therapy.\u201d Davidson nevertheless argues that appellees Dr. Crawford and Dr. Clayton should have referred him to a psychiatrist to determine whether <em>severe </em>depression or some other <em>active </em>psychiatric syndrome made him ineligible for such treatment. Even if these allegations proved true, however, these psychiatrists\u2019 acts or omissions would amount to nothing more than malpractice or negligence, which are not actionable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Stewart, </em>174 F.3d at 534. Thus, the magistrate judge did not err in concluding that Davidson failed to show that the denial of interferon therapy amounted to \u201cdeliberate indifference to his serious medical needs,\u201d as such denial was done in compliance with generally accepted medical standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">Davidson also contends that the magistrate judge erred by dismissing his claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). He argues that he is disabled by mental illness and that unspecified appellees violated Policy B-14.13 by not providing qualified personnel to determine the degree of severity or activeness of his mental illness and by not providing him with controlled trials of medication with interferon.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Davidson\u2019s ADA claim lacks merit because he has not alleged or shown that he was adversely treated solely because of his handicap of mental illness. <em>See Judice v. Hosp. Serv. Dist. No. 1, </em>919 F.Supp. 978, 981 (E.D.La.1996). As the magistrate judge concluded, \u201c[t]he refusal to administer drugs which are medically contraindicated by a medical disorder does not constitute \u2018discrimination\u2019 because of this disorder; rather, such refusal is proper and responsible medical conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">Davidson asserts further that he is entitled to relief because the magistrate judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>denied his motion for appointment of counsel. The magistrate judge denied the motion prior to the district judge\u2019s authorization for further proceedings to be conducted by the magistrate judge, subject to later appointment of counsel if necessary. Davidson did not, however, appeal the magistrate judge\u2019s ruling or again request that counsel be appointed. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review this denial of Davidson\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. <em>See Colburn v. Bunge Towing, Inc., </em>883 F.2d 372, 379 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Davidson has filed a motion requesting that we grant a mandatory injunction directing the appellees to administer interferon to him immediately. He argues that his life is in danger because he has both hepatitis B and hepatitis C. As Davidson is not likely to prevail on the merits of his claims he is not entitled to such relief at the appellate level. <em>See Libertarian Party of Texas v. Fainter, </em>741 F.2d 728, 729 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Davidson also seeks leave to amend his motion for injunctive relief to include a request that we order his transfer to federal protective custody for service of the remainder of his sentence. He assert that the appellees may cause his death to avoid monetary liability and public exposure. This motion is denied as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">In addition, Davidson seeks authority to supplement the appellate record. The motion is denied because Davidson has not shown that the additional documents are necessary to the proper disposition of his appeal. <em>See Harvey v. Andrist, </em>754 F.2d 569, 571 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">Finally, we deny Davidson\u2019s motion for leave to file a supplemental or letter brief. <em>See </em>5th Cir. <em>R. </em>28.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">AFFIRMED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b996-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b996-14\">. The parties consented to proceed before the magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c). The magistrate judge also held that dismissal was justified because Davidson failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, a ruling that we need not examine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
