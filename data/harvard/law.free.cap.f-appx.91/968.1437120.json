The district court properly considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>the statutory factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(2), and its supporting factual findings were not clearly in error. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>487 U.S. 326, 337, 108 S.Ct. 2413, 101 L.Ed.2d 297 (1988). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the original indictment without prejudice and in permitting reindictment. <em>See United States v. Blevins, </em>142 F.3d 223, 224 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Perkins also contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) unconstitutionally extends federal power to reach firearm possession that does not substantially affect interstate commerce. He concedes that this argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent, and he raises it to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) did not invalidate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). See <em>United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242 (5th Cir.1996). Moreover, evidence that the firearm Perkins possessed was not manufactured in Texas is sufficient to maintain a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 &amp; n. 12 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">Therefore, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1000-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
