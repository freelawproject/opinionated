Worley has filed a petition for writ of mandamus asking this court to dismiss the state criminal charges pursuant to which he is incarcerated and to grant any other appropriate relief. Mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court for the Northern District of California, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). Mandamus relief is available only when there are no other means by which the relief sought could be granted, <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987), and may not be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>In re Catawba Indian Tribe, </em>973 F.2d 1133, 1135 (4th Cir.1992). The party seeking mandamus relief carries the heavy burden of showing that he has \u201cno other adequate means to attain the relief he desires\u201d and that his entitlement to such relief is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980). Worley has not made such a showing. Accordingly, we deny Worley\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, deny his motion to expedite, and dismiss his petition for a writ of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-19\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
