Balderas contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions because it proved, at most, that he provided illegal aliens with temporary shelter. Because Balderas did not move for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the evidence, our review is limited to determining whether there was a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice\u201d. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>87 F.3d 133, 136 (5th Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 U.S. 1192, 117 S.Ct. 1482, 137 L.Ed.2d 693 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-25\">An individual violates 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iii) if he knowingly \u201cconceals, harbors, or shields from detection\u201d an illegal alien. Because affording shelter to an illegal alien is conduct which by its nature tends to substantially facilitate the alien\u2019s remaining in the United States illegally, providing shelter to illegal aliens constitutes harboring illegal aliens under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iii). <em>See United States v. Cantu, </em>557 F.2d 1173, 1180 (5th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1063, 98 S.Ct. 1236, 55 L.Ed.2d 763 (1978); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>United States v. Acosta De Evans, </em>531 F.2d 428, 430 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 836, 97 S.Ct. 103, 50 L.Ed.2d 101 (1976); <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>521 F.2d 437, 440 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 995, 96 S.Ct. 421, 46 L.Ed.2d 368 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">There was no manifest miscarriage of justice, because the record is not \u201cdevoid of evidence\u201d pointing to Balderas\u2019 guilt nor is the evidence so tenuous that Balderas\u2019 convictions are shocking. <em>See United States v. Laury, </em>49 F.3d 145, 151 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 857, 116 S.Ct. 162, 133 L.Ed.2d 105 (1995). For example, there was evidence that: next to Balderas\u2019 residence was a red light that could function as a signal to aliens; Balderas\u2019 wife let a group of aliens into their home; she informed Balderas that there were illegal aliens staying there; and he told her he did not care.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
