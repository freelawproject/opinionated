The district court sentenced him to 120 months in prison. Ramey timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-23\">Ramey\u2019s counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. However, he raises the issue of whether the district court complied with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in accepting Ramey\u2019s guilty plea. After reviewing the transcript of the plea proceeding, we conclude that the district court fully complied with the requirements of Rule 11 in accepting Ramey\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-24\">Ramey has filed a pro se supplemental brief. We have considered his claims and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-25\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Ramey\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
