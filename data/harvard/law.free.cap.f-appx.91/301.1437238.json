Our review of the record shows that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hardy\u2019s motion, as Hardy failed to make a particularized showing. Thus, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
