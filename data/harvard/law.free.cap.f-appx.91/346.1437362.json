INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Because Ahmed\u2019s brief does not address the IJ\u2019s findings on withholding of removal or withholding under the provisions of the Convention Against Torture, we do not review them. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-22\">Ahmed argues that the IJ erred in determining that he did not have a well-founded fear of persecution based on his past membership in a now-defunct political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>party and his refusal to join the Congolese military. Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s ultimate determination is supported by substantial evidence and is reasonable. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350 (5th Cir.2002). Ahmed has not shown that the evidence compels a finding that he would face persecution on a protected ground. <em>See Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 667, 669 (5th Cir.2002); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (a refugee is unwilling or unable to return because of persecution \u201con account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
