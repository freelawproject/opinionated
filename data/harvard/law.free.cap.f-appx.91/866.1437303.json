For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">Renu disputes the IJ\u2019s negative credibility finding and asserts that he established his eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Renu fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Moreover, we find that Renu\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s negative credibility finding is without merit. <em>See Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that Renu seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">Additionally, we uphold the IJ\u2019s denial of Renu\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for granting asylum. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because Renu fails to show he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We deny Renu\u2019s motion to strike and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
