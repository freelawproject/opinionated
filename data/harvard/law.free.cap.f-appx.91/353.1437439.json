The FPD did not file a timely notice of appeal, nor seek a timely extension of the time for filing a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1) &amp; (4). Instead, five months after the revocation, the FPD filed a motion for the \u201cjudicial remedy\u201d of an out-of-time appeal. The district court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-22\">\u201c[A] district court does not have the authority to create appellate jurisdiction simply by ordering an out-of-time direct criminal appeal. Compliance with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure is imperative.\u201d <em>United States v. West, </em>240 F.3d 456, 459 (5th Cir.2001). <em>West </em>did not create a new remedy, but addressed only the proper procedures for granting an out-of-time appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>at 459-61 (\u201cSince the 1960s, our court, pursuant to a \u00a7 2255 motion, has permitted an out-of-time appeal when a defendant was denied assistance of coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>sel on appeal, through counsel\u2019s failure to perfect an appeal.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">We VACATE the district court\u2019s order granting the \u201cjudicial remedy\u201d of an out-of-time appeal, and we REMAN'D the case. The district court should determine, in light of <em>Castro v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 786, 792, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003), whether it will construe the motion for \u201cjudicial remedy\u201d as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and, if so, whether Martinez received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. If the district court construes the motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion and finds ineffective assistance, then the constructive \u00a7 2255 motion should be dismissed without prejudice and the judgment reentered. The district court may accept any pleadings or conduct any hearings necessary for compliance with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">ORDER VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
