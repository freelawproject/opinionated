Any distinction in the isomers is immaterial to Beltran\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>Sentencing Guidelines, Amendment 518; <em>United States v. Domino, </em>62 F.3d 716, 719-720 (5th Cir.1995). Further, Beltran fails to show that the district court erred when it attributed 292.12 grams of Methamphetamine (actual) to him. <em>See United States v. Medina, </em>161 F.3d 867, 876 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Lowder, </em>148 F.3d 548, 552 (5th Cir.1998). Beltran\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s ruling on his motion for a downward departure was ambiguous is without merit inasmuch as Beltran does not argue that the departure was in violation of the law or unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Hashimoto, </em>193 F.3d 840, 843 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>989 F.2d 180, 183 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
