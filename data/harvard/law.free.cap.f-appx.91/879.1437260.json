On appeal, Mammo challenges the immigration judge\u2019s ruling that Mammo failed to establish her eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying asylum, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Mammo\u2019s evidence does not compel a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-24\">In addition, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Mammo\u2019s application for withholding of removal. To qualify for withholding, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution\u201d on a protected ground. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430-31, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Based on our review of the record, we find that Mammo has faded to meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-25\">Accordingly, we deny a petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-26\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
