Villarreal contends that there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he intentionally possessed, or that he conspired with co-defendants Ramon Perez-Martinez (Perez) and Rosa Idalia Trevino (Trevino) to possess with the intent to distribute, more than 500 grams of cocaine. Villarreal argues that the Government\u2019s case was primarily based on the unreliable testimony of Perez and Trevino. He contends that the co-defendants\u2019 testimony was inconsistent and failed to prove the essential elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-22\">Because Villarreal moved for a judgment of acquittal in the district court, we review the sufficiency of the evidence to determine whether, considering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>226 F.3d 340, 343 (5th Cir.2000). In cases involving a conspiracy, the \u201cconviction may be based upon the uncorroborated testimony of a co-conspirator, even when that testimony is from one who has made a plea bargain with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>government, provided that the testimony is not incredible or otherwise insubstantial on its face.\u201d <em>United States v. Gadison, </em>8 F.3d 186, 190 (5th Cir.1993). A witness\u2019 testimony may be inconsistent, but sufficient, nonetheless. <em>United States v. Greenwood, </em>974 F.2d 1449, 1458 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Considering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to prove that Villarreal intentionally possessed, and that he conspired with Perez and Trevino to possess with the intent to distribute, more than 500 grams of cocaine. The Government introduced telephone records showing a pattern of telephone activity corroborating the testimony of Trevino. Perez and Trevino\u2019s testimony was also corroborated by other witnesses at trial, including the surveillance officers and the confidential informant. Accordingly, Villarreal\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
