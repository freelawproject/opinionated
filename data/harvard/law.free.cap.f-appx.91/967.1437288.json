Guzman appeals his sentence following his guilty plea conviction of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Guzman argues that the district court clearly erred in finding by a preponderance of the evidence that he had used or possessed the firearm in connection with another felony offense, specifically, the kidnaping of Sally Moncevais. Guzman urges that the district court thus improperly increased his offense level by four levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">A review of the record shows that the district court correctly found that Guzman committed kidnaping as defined by Texas law. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 20.01(1); 20.03. A preponderance of the evidence also shows that the gun was used \u201cin connection with\u201d the kidnaping. <em>See United States v. Fadipe, </em>43 F.3d 993, 994 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
