Judge contends on appeal that the district court plainly erred in sentencing him as a career offender. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Judge maintains that his three prior felony drug convictions were related cases because they were part of a single common scheme or plan, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n.3), and should have been counted as one prior conviction. Thus, in his view, he lacked the two predicate convictions necessary to qualify him for a career offender sentence. Judge overlooks the fact that his prior offenses were separated by intervening arrests. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the district court did not plainly err in counting each offense separately in Judge\u2019s criminal history or in sentencing him as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
