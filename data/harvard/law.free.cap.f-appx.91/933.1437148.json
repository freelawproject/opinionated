The AME Church has not challenged on appeal the district court\u2019s denial of its Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-24\">The AME Church asserts that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants because the court did not have before it verified and authenticated documents or expert testimony. Because the AME Church did not challenge the lack of authentication before the district court during the time the summary judgment motion was pending, the district court did not abuse its discretion in considering the evidence. <em>See Eguia v. Tompkins, </em>756 F.2d 1130, 1136 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-25\">The AME Church also contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because the evidence submitted by the defendants establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding who in fact owns the property. The AME Church has not established that the two deeds, which describe property in different townships of Yazoo County, Mississippi, created a \u201cgenuine issue of material fact.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). For the first time on appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>AME Church indicates that it may have a superior interest in the property based upon its history of possession. Because the AME Church did not file a response to the motion for summary judgment, it cannot raise a new theory for relief. <em>See John v. Louisiana (Bd. of Trustees for St. Coll. and Univ.), </em>757 F.2d 698, 710-11 (5th Cir.1985). The AME Church has presented no argument in support of its assertion that the district court failed to consider the defendants\u2019 seizure of the AME Church\u2019s personal and movable property. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). The judgment of the district court granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">In their appellate brief, the defendants move for sanctions on the basis of the frivolity of the AME Church\u2019s appeal. This motion is DENIED. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1912, 1927; Fed. R.App. P. 38; <em>Edwards v. General Motors Corp., </em>153 F.3d 242, 246 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR SANCTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b965-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
