California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). DiazCamarillo has filed a response in which he raises several claims, including claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The record has not been adequately developed for us to consider in this direct appeal the ineffective assistance claims raised by Diaz-Camarillo. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987); <em>see United States v. Price, </em>95 F.3d 364, 369 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-22\">Our independent review of counsel\u2019s brief, Diaz-Camarillo\u2019s response, and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-23\">MOTION GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-16\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
