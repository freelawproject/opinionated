The first is whether a delayed appeal authorized pursuant to App.R. 5(A) is the same as a timely filed direct appeal. The second is whether our decision in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, applies to a delayed appeal filed subsequent to that case. We hold that <em>Foster </em>applies only to delayed appeals that were pending at the time that we released it.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">{\u00b6 2} William Silsby appeals from a decision of the Eleventh District Court of Appeals affirming his sentence that followed a plea of guilty to obstructing official business.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">{\u00b6 3} A Geauga County grand jury indicted Silsby on counts of domestic violence and obstructing official business. In exchange for his plea of guilty to obstruction of official business, entered on October 6, 2005, the state dismissed the domestic-violence charge. At his sentencing hearing, conducted on October 19, 2005, the trial court acknowledged Silsby\u2019s prior criminal record and imposed a 12-month prison sentence consecutive to the sentence imposed by the Lake County Court of Common Pleas for Silsby\u2019s conviction of attempted murder, having a weapon under a disability, and grand theft of a motor vehicle, each with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>a firearm specification. Pursuant to App.R. 4(A), Silsby had until November 18, 2005, to file a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">{\u00b6 4} On February 27, 2006, we held unconstitutional Ohio statutes requiring judicial fact-finding before imposing maximum and consecutive prison terms. <em>Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, paragraphs one and three of the syllabus. Our holding followed the holdings in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435, and <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403. In <em>Foster, </em>we held that \u201ceases * * * pending on direct review must be remanded to the trial courts for new sentencing hearings * * 109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, \u00b6 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">{\u00b6 5} On August 2, 2006, Silsby filed a pro se motion seeking a delayed appeal pursuant to App.R. 5(A). The Eleventh District Court of Appeals granted Silsby\u2019s motion. His merit brief, which contained three assignments of error, included a claim that the trial court had made impermissible findings of fact during sentencing, in violation of <em>Foster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">{\u00b6 6} The Eleventh District Court of Appeals affirmed Silsby\u2019s sentence. <em>State v. Silsby, </em>Geauga App. No. 2006-G-2725, 2007-Ohio-2308, 2007 WL 1395516. It implicitly acknowledged a Sixth Amendment violation, but reasoned that the \u201ccase was not pending on direct review at the time of the <em>Foster </em>decision\u201d and that Silsby\u2019s conviction and sentence, despite the granting of his motion for delayed appeal, \u201chad become final long before <em>Foster </em>was announced.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14. According to the appellate court, \u201c \u2018[djelayed appeal is not the same as direct appeal.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State v. Lewis, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-327, 2006-Ohio-2752, 2006 WL 1495105, \u00b6 10, citing <em>State v. Bird </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 400, 741 N.E.2d 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">{\u00b6 7} The appellate court certified that its decision conflicted with a decision of the Second District Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>Clark App. No. 2006 CA 37, 2007-Ohio-1742, 2007 WL 1098665, and the decision of the Third District Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Corbin, </em>Allen App. No. 1-06-23,2006-Ohio-6092, 2006 WL 3350642. In those cases, the defendants\u2019 delayed appeals, though accepted after the decision in <em>Foster, </em>resulted in remands to the trial courts for resentencing. The courts of appeals considered those cases \u201cto be pending on direct appeal within the meaning of <em>Foster.\u201d Jenkins, </em>2007-Ohio-1742, 2007 WL 1098665, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">{\u00b6 8} We are asked to consider two issues: \u201cWhether a delayed appeal under Ohio Rule of Appellate Procedure 5(A) is identical to a direct appeal under Ohio Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(A) for purposes of appellate review as to whether a defendant was sentenced upon the basis of an unconstitutional statute under the guidelines of <em>State v. Foster\u201d; </em>and \u201cWhether a defendant\u2019s sentence must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>reversed on the basis of <em>State v. Foster </em>when: a) the defendant was sentenced prior to the announcement of <em>State v. </em>Foster; b) the defendant was sentenced under the statutes found to be unconstitutional in <em>State v. Foster; </em>c) the defendant does not pursue a direct appeal but rather files a delayed appeal; d) and raises the issues of unconstitutional sentencing on the basis of <em>Foster </em>for the first time on delayed appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Silsby, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 1406, 2007-Ohio-4884, 873 N.E.2d 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 9} We recognized the conflict between appellate jurisdictions and accepted the conflict questions for review. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">{\u00b6 10} The Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure provide two distinct means by which a criminal defendant may appeal from a final order of a trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 11} App.R. 3(A), which grants an appeal as of right, provides that such an appeal \u201cshall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the trial court within the time allowed by Rule 4.\u201d App.R. 4(A), in turn, requires an appealing party to file within 30 days of the judgment or order appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">{\u00b6 12} But if an appealing party does not comply with App.R. 4(A), App.R. 5(A) provides for an appeal by leave of the court. These appeals, which apply in only three classes of cases, according to App.R. 5(A)(1), require the movant to \u201cset forth the reasons for the failure of the appellant to perfect an appeal as of right.\u201d App.R. 5(A)(2). If a movant establishes sufficient reasons justifying the delay, the appellate court may, in its discretion, grant the motion, and the case proceeds as it would have if timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">{\u00b6 13} The issue in this case, then, is whether an appeal by leave of court allowed subsequent to our decision in <em>Foster </em>is an appeal \u201cpending on direct review\u201d for purposes of applying the remedy we prescribed in <em>Foster. </em>Id., 109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, \u00b6 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">{\u00b6 14} App.R. 5(F) provides that if a motion for delayed appeal is sustained, \u201cthe further procedure shall be the same as for appeals as of right in criminal cases * * *.\u201d Once granted, a delayed appeal proceeds as any timely appeal would proceed, and the assertion of error is virtually the same as it would have been but for the delayed filing. See, e.g., <em>State v. Haynes </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 244, 245, 675 N.E.2d 1332. Substantively and procedurally, there is no discernable difference between a direct appeal and a delayed appeal. They differ only in the timeliness of the filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">{\u00b6 15} Delayed appeals differ from other forms of postconviction relief. App.R. 26 applications for reconsideration and reopening, petitions for postconviction relief, and petitions for writs of habeas corpus all challenge various aspects of the proceedings or confinement, but do not necessarily implicate the trial court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>App.R. 26(B) applications, for example, do not assert trial errors, but instead assert claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">{\u00b6 16} Also, a petition for postconviction relief \u201cis not an appeal of a criminal conviction but, rather, a collateral civil attack on the judgment,\u201d <em>State v. Calhoun </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 714 N.E.2d 905, in which a claimant asserts that either actual innocence or deprivation of constitutional rights renders the judgment void. See R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a). These actions require the filing of a civil complaint, which again differs from a delayed appeal. Finally, actions in habeas corpus deal with individuals \u201cunlawfully restrained of * * * liberty.\u201d R.C. 2725.01. Generally, nonjurisdictional errors that could have been brought via a direct appeal are not cognizable in habeas actions. See, e.g., <em>Thornton v. Russell </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 93, 94, 694 N.E.2d 464. In each of these postconviction actions, a criminal defendant is seeking something other than a standard review of alleged trial court errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">{\u00b6 17} We therefore answer the first certified question in the affirmative. A delayed appeal granted pursuant to App.R. 5 is treated the same as a direct appeal under App.R. 4(A), and the case proceeds as if it had been timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">{\u00b6 18} This answer does not end our inquiry, however, because we limited application of <em>Foster </em>to those cases <em>\u201cpending </em>on direct review.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, \u00b6 104. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cpending\u201d as \u201c[remaining undecided\u201d or \u201cawaiting decision.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 1169. Accordingly, for a criminal action to be \u201cpending on direct review\u201d for <em>Foster </em>purposes, it must have been filed in the court at the time we announced <em>Foster </em>and must have been awaiting an action or a decision at the time of our decision in that case. <em>Foster, </em>\u00b6 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">{\u00b6 19} The record in this case reveals that the trial court convicted and sentenced Silsby on October 19, 2005. Silsby did not file a direct appeal from that judgment, and the time to do so expired on November 18, 2005. We issued our decision in <em>Foster </em>on February 27, 2006, and prior to that date, Silsby had not filed a request seeking a delayed appeal. Thus, Silsby had nothing \u201cpending\u201d as of the date we released our <em>Foster </em>decision. <em>Foster </em>therefore does not apply to Silsby\u2019s delayed appeal, as it was not pending on the date we released <em>Foster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">{\u00b6 20} Regarding the second certified question, we recently decided <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 1, holding that the failure to raise <em>Foster </em>errors at sentencing constitutes a forfeiture of the issue necessitating application of the plain-error doctrine by reviewing courts. An appellate court, therefore, is not <em>required </em>to reverse a sentence that violates our holding in <em>Foster </em>if no objection was made in the trial court; it may instead review the sentence for plain error. Accordingly, we answer the second certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>question in the negative on the authority of <em>Payne </em>and affirm the judgment of the Eleventh District Court of Appeals.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b482-9\">David Joyce, Geauga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Craig A. Swenson, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A9X\">Derek Cek, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b482-5\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AK4\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b482-6\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-D\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">{\u00b6 21} Today this court affirms the judgment of the trial court, holding that a delayed appeal authorized pursuant to App.R. 5(A) is the same as a direct appeal and that <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, applies only to delayed appeals that were pending at the time of the release of our decision in that case. I agree that a delayed appeal according to App.R. 5(A), once granted, should be treated the same as a direct appeal under App.R. 4(A) and that the case proceeds as if it had been timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">{\u00b6 22} However, the majority holds that because Silsby had not filed for leave to file a delayed appeal before our decision in <em>Foster </em>was issued, his appeal was not \u201cpending on direct review\u201d when <em>Foster </em>was released. <em>Foster </em>at \u00b6 104. Thus, the majority concludes that <em>Foster </em>does not apply to Silsby\u2019s delayed appeal. I respectfully disagree and would hold that Silsby\u2019s appeal is considered to be pending at the time that a direct appeal would have/should have been filed \u2014 i.e., it relates back to November 2005, before we issued <em>Foster. </em>Therefore, I would hold that Silsby\u2019s appeal was \u201cpending\u201d when <em>Foster </em>was released. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the second portion of the majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
