Upton Jr.\u2019s eligibility for temporary total disability compensation. Upton was a truck driver for appellant, Crown Battery. Between March 5, 2003, and September 26, 2005, Upton was involved in five motor-vehicle accidents while operating a Crown Battery vehicle. The fifth accident seriously damaged the truck, destroyed the cargo, and resulted in a hazardous-waste spill. Upton was cited for that accident, which also resulted in his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">{\u00b6 2} After investigating the incident, Crown Battery concluded \u2014 as did law-enforcement officers \u2014 that the accident was caused by operator error. On September 30, 2005, Crown Battery fired Upton:</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cOn September 26, while driving Crown\u2019s vehicle, you hit a guardrail causing significant damage to the truck and an acid spill. Additionally, the product you were carrying was destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cBob, you have had 5 vehicle related mishaps or accidents in less than 3 years. This is an unacceptable safety record and performance; therefore, you are being terminated from Crown Battery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-15\">{\u00b6 5} Upton filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for the injuries he sustained in the accident, and his claim was allowed. His accompanying request for temporary total disability compensation was more contentious. A district hearing officer for the Industrial Commission of Ohio awarded temporary total disability compensation, but a staff hearing officer reversed. In a lengthy order, the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>concluded that Upton\u2019s firing constituted a voluntary abandonment of the former position of employment that precluded temporary total disability compensation. Further appeal was refused.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b570-11\">Gallon, Takacs, Boissoneault &amp; Schaffer Co., L.P.A., and Martha J. Wilson, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ayv\">Eastman <em>&amp; </em>Smith Ltd., James B. Yates, and Mark A. Shaw, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 6} On petition for a writ of mandamus, the Court of Appeals for Franklin County held that the commission had abused its discretion in finding that Upton\u2019s firing had been a voluntary abandonment of the former position of employment. Compensation was accordingly approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">{\u00b6 7} Crown Battery now appeals to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 8} The court of appeals decision was issued before <em>State ex rel. Gross v. Indus. Comm., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 249, 2007-Ohio-4916, 874 N.E.2d 1162 <em>(\u201cGross II </em>\u201d). <em>Gross II </em>held that if a claimant is injured by the same misconduct that led to his or her termination, eligibility for temporary total disability compensation is not compromised. <em>Gross II </em>controls and renders the court of appeals reasoning moot. Compensation is therefore payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">{\u00b6 9} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b570-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
