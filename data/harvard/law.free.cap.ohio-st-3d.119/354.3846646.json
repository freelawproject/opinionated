We answer that it is not and hold that the time to file a notice of appeal does not begin until the plaintiff has exercised the choice or until the time for choosing has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">{\u00b6 2} This case began as an action for breach of contract filed by appellee VIL Laser Systems, L.L.C. (\u2018YIL\u201d) against appellant Shiloh Industries, Inc. (\u201cShiloh\u201d). The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the trial court granted summary judgment to VIL on liability. After a jury trial to determine damages, the jury awarded $2.29 million plus interest to VIL and against Shiloh.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">{\u00b6 3} Shiloh filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial or, in the alternative, remittitur on the grounds that the jury\u2019s damage award was not supported by the evidence. On December 15, 2006, the trial court entered an order setting aside the jury\u2019s damage award and granting a new trial on damages or, in the alternative, reducing the judgment to VIL to $2,016,416.22 (including interest). The trial court\u2019s order gave VIL 14 days to accept the remittitur.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The order also stated that it was \u201can appealable order under R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>2505.02(B)(3),\u201d the section of the statute that deems orders granting a new trial to be final. On December 29, VIL filed a written acceptance of this remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">{\u00b6 4} After the acceptance of the remittitur, Shiloh filed a motion for an order nunc pro tunc to correct a mathematical error in the court\u2019s calculation of prejudgment interest. On January 16, 2007, the trial court entered an amended judgment, worded similarly to the earlier order, again giving VIL the choice of a remittitur, this time of $709,431.48 (for a total judgment of $1,881,396.16), or, in the alternative, a new trial on damages. The trial court\u2019s order also imposed a new 14-day window of time for VIL to make its choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">{\u00b6 5} Shiloh appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment on January 25, 2007. VIL responded with a motion to dismiss the appeal on the basis that Shiloh\u2019s appeal had not been filed within 30 days after the trial court entered its order of December 15, 2006. The Third District Court of Appeals granted VIL\u2019s motion to dismiss Shiloh\u2019s appeal as untimely, holding that the 30-day appeal period began to run when the trial court filed the order granting a new trial on damages or, in the alternative, remittitur. We accepted this case as a discretionary appeal. Shiloh proposes that the order giving VIL a period of time to choose between remittitur and a new trial <em>on </em>damages was not a final appealable order. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">II. Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 6} The issue that we must determine is when the time for appeal begins to run from an order when the party is given a time frame to exercise a posttrial option. Shiloh argues that the appeal time should begin to run when the party exercises its choice and that its notice of appeal was therefore filed within the 30-day time limit because the December 15, 2006 order was not final and appealable until VIL agreed to the remittitur on December 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 7} Section 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution states that appellate courts have jurisdiction only over judgments or final orders. R.C. 2505.02, which defines \u201cfinal order,\u201d listed six orders that are final and appealable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shiloh contends that the December 15, 2006 order was not final under R.C. 2505.02(B)(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>or (B)(3), the only subsections at issue, while VIL claims that the order is final under R.C. 2505.02(B)(3). We will examine both sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\n<em>A. R.C. 2505.02(B)(1)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 8} Final orders include those orders that affect a substantial right and in effect determine an action and prevent a judgment. R.C. 2505.02(B)(1). For an order to determine the action, it must dispose of the merits of the cause or some separate and distinct branch thereof and leave nothing for the determination of the court. <em>Miller v. First Internatl. Fid. &amp; Trust Bldg., Ltd., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 474, 2007-Ohio-2457, 866 N.E.2d 1059, \u00b6 6. A judgment that leaves issues unresolved and contemplates further action is not a final, appealable order under (B)(1) unless the remaining issue is mechanical and involved only a ministerial task. <em>State v. Threatt, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 277, 2006-Ohio-905, 843 N.E.2d 164, \u00b620.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 9} Analyzing the order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(1), we hold that it was not final and appealable, because it did not determine the action. The court\u2019s December 15, 2006 order left a fundamental issue unresolved: the nature of the relief to be granted. Because the order gave VIL the option of a new trial on damages or, in the alternative, remittitur, this fundamental issue was resolved only when VIL eventually consented to the remittitur. At that point, the judgment became final and appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">\n<em>B. R.C. 2505.02(B)(3)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">{\u00b6 10} VIL argues that the trial court\u2019s December 15 order was final and appealable under R.C. 2505.02(B)(3), which defines as final an order that \u201cvacates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial.\u201d VIL argues that the December 15 order alternatively granted two of the remedies contemplated by R.C. 2505.02(B)(3) because it set aside the judgment and granted a new trial on damages. The trial court also specifically stated that the order was \u201can appeal-able order under 2505.02(B)(3).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">{\u00b6 11} If the trial court had simply granted a new trial, the order undoubtedly would have been a final appealable order. However, this court has held that a trial court cannot order remittitur without the plaintiffs consent. <em>Wightman v. Consol. Rail Corp. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 431, 444, 715 N.E.2d 546; <em>Chester Park Co. v. Schulte </em>(1929), 120 Ohio St. 273, 290, 166 N.E. 186. When the trial court in this case issued its order, it explicitly stated that \u201c[jjudgment shall be entered against Defendant Shiloh Industries, Inc. for Total Contract Damages in the amount of $1,580,568.52 <em>upon the consent of the Plaintiff.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Therefore, by the explicit terms of the trial court\u2019s order, judgment could not have been entered until VIL made a decision about the remittitur. The order was not final until the plaintiff elected either the new trial on damages or the remittitur, notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s language calling it final and appeal-able. R.C. 2505.02(B)(3) does not apply, because the trial court\u2019s order did not simply grant a new trial. The court granted a new trial contingent on VIL\u2019s election of a remedy at some future point.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 12} Although there are no Ohio court decisions addressing when an order offering a new trial or remittitur becomes final for purposes of appeal, federal courts have addressed such orders. A federal court order such as the one issued in this case is not final until (1) the plaintiff elects a remedy (or the time to choose expires) or (2) the court issues a judgment reflecting the remedy chosen. See <em>Paducah v. E. Tennessee Tel. Co. </em>(1913), 229 U.S. 476, 480, 33 S.Ct. 816, 57 L.Ed. 1286; <em>Jones v. Craig </em>(1888), 127 U.S. 213, 215-216, 8 S.Ct. 1175, 32 L.Ed. 147. See <em>Ortiz-Del Valle v. Natl. Basketball Assn. </em>(C.A.2, 1999), 190 F.3d 598, 600 (\u201cWhere the plaintiff elects the remittitur, the defendant\u2019s time for filing the notice of appeal runs from the date of entry of the amended judgment reduced as a result of the remittitur\u201d); <em>Evans v. Calmar Steamship Co. </em>(C.A.2, 1976), 534 F.2d 519, 522; <em>Mauriello v. Univ. of Med. &amp; Dentistry of New Jersey </em>(C.A.3, 1986), 781 F.2d 46, 49 (\u201cThe amount of the judgment was not fixed until plaintiff filed her consent, and at that point the time for appeal began to run. The notice of appeal was filed within 30 days of the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance, and therefore was timely\u201d); <em>Howell v. Marmpegaso Compania Naviera, S.A. </em>(C.A.5,1978), 566 F.2d 992, 993 (\u201cacceptance of the remittitur rendered the judgment final and appeal-able, and actuated the 30-day time limit within which notice of appeal must be filed\u201d); <em>Anderson v. Roberson </em>(C.A.6, 2001), 249 F.3d 539, 542 (\u201ca district court order giving the plaintiff a choice between remittitur or a new trial is not a final, appealable order\u201d). We think that the federal approach is logical and meets the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>goals of finality of judgments and judicial economy. A posttrial order that sets forth a time frame for the exercise of an option by a party is not a final, appealable order until the party\u2019s choice is made or until the time for choosing has expired.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b466-14\">Faulkner, Garmhausen, Keister &amp; Shenk, James L.

Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 13} In light of the foregoing, we hold that an order allowing a plaintiff a period of time in which to choose between remittitur and a new trial on damages is not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">{\u00b6 14} We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Shelby County and remand the cause to that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AHv\">Pfeifer and Cupp, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-17\">. The order states: \u201cJudgment shall be entered against Defendant Shiloh Industries, Inc. for Total Contract Damages in the amount of $1,580,568.52 upon consent of the Plaintiff.

The trial court order in question falls squarely within R.C. 2505.02(B)(3). That provision specifically defines a final, appealable order as one that \u201cvacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial.\u201d The trial court\u2019s order in this case did just that \u2014 it set aside the judgment and granted a new trial on damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">{\u00b6 16} The order also gave the plaintiff the option of choosing remittitur in lieu of the new trial. However, there is nothing in the statute to indicate that this optional language somehow removed the order from the meaning of R.C. 2505.02. The order was still final and appealable even with the optional language because it disposed of the merits of the case and left nothing for the determination of the court. <em>Miller v. First Internatl. Fid. &amp; Trust Bldg., Ltd., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 474, 2007-Ohio-2457, 866 N.E.2d 1059, \u00b6 6. The only remaining issue \u2014 plaintiff\u2019s consent to remittitur \u2014 was merely \u201cmechanical\u201d and involved only a \u201cministerial task.\u201d <em>State v. Threatt, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 277, 2006-Ohio-905, 843 N.E.2d 164, \u00b6 20. Accordingly, I believe that the court of appeals was correct to dismiss the appeal and cross-appeal as untimely.
