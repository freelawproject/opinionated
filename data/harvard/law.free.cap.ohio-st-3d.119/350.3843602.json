Because the petition does not state a viable mandamus claim, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant, Tyrone Rudolph, a prison inmate, filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County for a writ of mandamus to compel appellee, Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Timothy Horton, to grant him jail-time credit on his previously entered sentence. Judge Horton filed a motion to dismiss. The court of appeals granted the motion and dismissed Rudolph\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 3} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. Rudolph had an adequate remedy at law by appeal to raise any error by the trial court in calculating his jail-time credit. <em>State ex rel. Brown v. Summit Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 409, 2003-Ohio-4126, 792 N.E.2d 1123, \u00b6 4. And insofar as Rudolph now claims that he is entitled to be released from prison because of his jail-time credit, habeas corpus, instead of mandamus, is the appropriate remedy. <em>State ex rel.
