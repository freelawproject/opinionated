He then stole Green\u2019s Visa card and SUV. Hale was convicted of aggravated murder with an aggravated-robbery specification and was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">{\u00b6 2} In 2003, Hale was released from prison after serving 12 years of a sentence for aggravated robbery and carrying a concealed weapon. At first, he lived with his father, but left in February 2004. That same month, he obtained a telemarketing job with a base pay of $7.64 per hour. On March 9, 2004, Hale told his sister Lashayla that he had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">{\u00b6 3} By June 2004, Hale was in financial difficulty. His bank account had a negative balance during all of June 2004. On June 8, he moved into Room 260 of the Lake Erie Lodge, a motel in Euclid. He initially rented the room for a week. He renewed his stay for another week on June 15, renewed for a single night on June 22, and checked out on June 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">{\u00b6 4} On June 23, 2004, an employee of the lodge found a human corpse wrapped in plastic garbage bags in Room 231, a vacant room being used for storage. He notified the management, who summoned the police. The body was identified as that of Douglas Green, a local voice teacher, professional singer, and music producer.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">{\u00b6 5} An autopsy disclosed that Green had been shot four times in the right side of the head. Two shots went into Green\u2019s right ear, one entered his skull directly behind the ear, and one entered about two and one-half inches behind the ear. Three of the four shots entered Green\u2019s brain. Any one of these three wounds would have immediately stopped any voluntary movement on Green\u2019s part. Three of the wounds were contact wounds, meaning that the shots were fired from no more than an inch away. Gunshot residue was found on Green\u2019s right hand, but not his left, an indication that Green\u2019s right hand was in close proximity to the gun when it was fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Green\u2019s bank statement shows that at 12:07 p.m. on June 22, 2004, a person using Green\u2019s Visa card made a $55.15 purchase at a Giant Eagle store in Willoughby Hills. Giant Eagle records show that the purchaser bought garbage bags, cleaning supplies, beer, and cigarettes in that transaction. Green did not smoke or drink beer. The purchaser also used a Giant Eagle discount card registered to Hale\u2019s sister and deceased mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">{\u00b6 7} Hale\u2019s friend James Hull saw Hale driving a Explorer SUV on two occasions after Green\u2019s murder, including on June 23, 2004, when Hull helped Hale move out of the lodge. Hull later identified photographs of Green\u2019s SUV as the one Hale had been driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">{\u00b6 8} On June 28, 2004, at 2:30 p.m., Detective Sergeant Robert Pestak of the Euclid police found Hale inside Green\u2019s Ford Explorer SUV, parked near Hale\u2019s workplace in Cleveland. Pestak, supported by Cleveland police units, arrested Hale.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">{\u00b6 9} When told that he was being arrested for Green\u2019s murder, Hale said, \u201cI didn\u2019t kill anybody.\u201d Sergeant Pestak administered <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Hale. While being led to a cruiser, Hale again said, \u201cI didn\u2019t kill anybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">{\u00b6 10} Hale was taken to the Euclid police station and placed in a cell. After approximately five hours, Hale was removed from the cell and brought to the detective bureau. There, Detective Sergeant James Baird completed a personal-information form on Hale and presented it to Hale for his signature. Hale signed the form using his left hand, but Baird noted that Hale had difficulty writing with that hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">{\u00b6 11} Baird then administered <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Hale. Hale signed a <em>Miranda </em>waiver form, and this time, Hale used his right hand. Baird proceeded to interrogate Hale. During the interrogation, Baird told Hale that Green \u201cwas possibly bisexual\u201d and that \u201cif this was a case of self-defense, then that would be understandable if he felt that Mr. Green had attacked him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">{\u00b6 12} Hale wrote out and signed a four-page statement. In his statement, Hale claimed that he had met Green in May 2004 when Green, identifying himself as a record producer, asked Hale whether he had considered singing professionally and gave Hale his cell-phone number. According to Hale, he later called Green, and Green agreed to go to Hale\u2019s motel room to hear him sing.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">{\u00b6 13} According to Hale, they had arranged to meet at the Underground Railroad, a bar near the lodge. Hale claimed that he and Green had met at the Underground Railroad on Monday, June 21, 2004. (However, according to the owner of the Underground Railroad, that establishment was closed on Mondays.) They then went to Hale\u2019s room. According to Hale, Green had a small gun in his shoulder bag and displayed it to Hale as they entered the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Hale claimed that he sang for Green, then went to the bathroom. Hale claimed that when he returned, he found Green lying on the bed, nude. Hale told Green to leave. According to Hale, Green grabbed Hale\u2019s wrists and \u201claid his head on [Hale\u2019s] crotch\u201d while making \u201cslurping\u201d noises.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">{\u00b6 15} Hale claimed that he then freed his <em>right </em>hand, reached into Green\u2019s bag, pulled out the gun, held it to Green\u2019s head, and cocked it. According to Hale, Green said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t loaded, so why don\u2019t you give me some of that dick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">{\u00b6 16} Hale fired. Green \u201creeled back,\u201d but still gripped Hale\u2019s left wrist, according to Hale. Hale cocked the gun and fired again. He then backed away from Green, took some bullets from Green\u2019s bag, and reloaded. According to Hale, Green then tried to stand up. Hale fired \u201conce or twice\u201d more.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">{\u00b6 17} According to Hale, he considered calling an ambulance or the police, but decided not to after he \u201cthought about * * * [his] record\u201d and \u201cthe life [he] was attempting to build.\u201d Instead, he disposed of the gun and Green\u2019s belongings. Then he went out to buy cleaning supplies to clean up Green\u2019s blood, using Green\u2019s credit card because Hale\u2019s \u201cfunds were low.\u201d The next day, he wrapped Green\u2019s body in garbage bags, also purchased with Green\u2019s credit card, and dragged the body to a storage room.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">{\u00b6 18} Hale was indicted on two counts of aggravated murder: one under R.C. 2903.01(A) and one under R.C. 2903.01(B). Each count carried a felony-murder death specification alleging murder during a robbery. Other counts charged aggravated robbery, tampering with evidence, and having a weapon while under disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hale argued self-defense, contending that Green had sexually assaulted him and that Hale had shot him to keep from being raped.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">{\u00b6 19} On June 7, 2005, Hale was convicted of all counts and specifications, and he was sentenced to death for the aggravated murder of Green. He appeals his convictions and death sentence, raising 22 propositions of law for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">I. <em>Miranda </em>Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">{\u00b6 20} In his third proposition of law, Hale contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the oral and written statements he gave Sergeant Baird on June 28, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">{\u00b6 21} Sergeant Baird initially questioned Hale in order to obtain his personal information before administering Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> warnings. Only after giving the <em>Miranda </em>warnings did Baird interrogate Hale about the murder. In response to Baird\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>interrogation, Hale gave Baird both oral and written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>statements admitting that he had killed Green and setting forth his version of the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">{\u00b6 22} Hale argues that because Baird had asked him questions before giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings \u2014 even though the <em>pre-Miranda </em>questions did not deal with the murder in any way \u2014 his oral and written statements about the murder should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">{\u00b6 23} The record of the suppression hearing establishes the following sequence of events:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">{\u00b6 24} Sergeant Pestak arrested Hale at approximately 2:30 p.m., June 28, and informed Hale of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which Sergeant Pestak recited from memory. Hale was then driven to the Euclid police station, arriving at 3:35 p.m. Before his shift ended at 5:00 p.m., Sergeant Pestak asked Sergeant Baird to \u201cget a personal history\u201d from Hale.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">{\u00b6 25} Pestak\u2019s request referred to the standard personal-history form used by the Euclid detective bureau. The form contains such information as the arrestee\u2019s name, address, age, phone number, Social Security number, physical description, employer, education, and the names of his immediate family members. The detective bureau routinely obtains this information from every felony suspect and uses it to complete the form. The bureau gathers this information for police records and to verify the arrestee\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">{\u00b6 26} At 7:50 p.m., Baird had Hale escorted from his cell to the detective bureau. For 20 to 25 minutes, Baird questioned Hale to obtain information for the personal-history form.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">{\u00b6 27} When questioning finished, Baird told Hale that Baird \u201cwas going to talk to him briefly about the crime that he was being charged with, and that before [Baird] asked him any questions or talked to him at all about it, that [Baird] had to advise him of his rights.\u201d Baird asked Hale to read a form containing the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Baird then read the <em>Miranda </em>form aloud to him. Baird asked if Hale understood his rights. Hale said yes and signed the form, acknowledging that he understood them. Baird then showed Hale the waiver portion of the <em>Miranda </em>form and told Hale that if he wanted to talk to Baird, he needed to sign the waiver. Hale signed the <em>Miranda </em>waiver at 8:22 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">{\u00b6 28} Baird explained to Hale that he was under arrest for murder, then began what Baird described as a \u201csoft interrogation.\u201d Baird discussed the case with Hale for about 20 minutes. Hale then orally stated his version of the events of June 21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When Hale finished, Baird said, \u201cI\u2019d really like to get this on paper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>so we can have your side of the story.\u201d At 8:53 p.m., Baird gave Hale a statement sheet and asked him to write his statement in his own words. Over the next two hours, Hale wrote out a four-page statement, which was ultimately introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">{\u00b6 29} Hale was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings twice on June 28: first by Pestak at 3:00 p.m., during his arrest, and then by Baird at approximately 8:15 p.m., just before he began to interrogate Hale about the murder. Hale contends that <em>neither </em>set of warnings was effective and that his statement should therefore have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">{\u00b6 30} We need not determine whether Pestak\u2019s warnings were still effective by the time Baird interrogated Hale. See generally <em>State v. Roberts </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 225, 232, 513 N.E.2d 720. It is undisputed that Baird administered full <em>Miranda </em>warnings and obtained an express, written waiver immediately before he interrogated Hale about Green\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">{\u00b6 31} Hale argues that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings given by Baird were ineffective and should be ignored because Baird questioned him about his personal history before giving those warnings. Because Baird\u2019s warnings did not precede <em>all </em>questioning, including the personal-history questions, Hale contends that they were ineffective for <em>any </em>portion of the questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">(\u00b6 32} We disagree. Baird was not required to preface the personal-history questions with <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The personal-history questions were routine booking questions, and the requirement that police administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings before questioning a suspect in custody does not apply to routine booking questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">{\u00b6 33} Routine booking questions are questions asked in order \u201cto secure the \u2018biographical data necessary to complete booking or pretrial services.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Muniz </em>(1990), 496 U.S. 582, 601, 110 S.Ct. 2638, 110 L.Ed.2d 528, quoting <em>United States v. Horton </em>(C.A.8, 1989), 873 F.2d 180, 181, fn. 2. The personal-history questions in this case clearly fit within that definition. The information elicited for the personal-history form was routinely requested for record-keeping and identification purposes. Moreover, the personal-history form was not \u201cdesigned to elicit incriminatory admissions.\u201d Id. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2638, 110 L.Ed.2d 528, fn. 14. Hence, the personal-history questions were \u201creasonably related to the police\u2019s administrative concerns.\u201d Id. at 601-602, 110 S.Ct. 2638, 110 L.Ed.2d 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">{\u00b6 34} Thus, no reason exists to suppress Hale\u2019s statement. Baird was not required to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings any sooner than he did. By giving complete <em>Miranda </em>warnings and obtaining an express waiver before asking Hale any questions about the crime, Baird complied fully with the relevant constitutional requirements. That fact distinguishes this case from cases such as <em>Oregon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>v. Elstad </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222, and <em>Missouri v. Seibert </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643, in which police first interrogated suspects about their crimes, then administered <em>Miranda </em>warnings, then engaged in further interrogation. Cf. <em>Seibert, </em>542 U.S. at 616, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (plurality opinion) (postwarning interrogation was \u201ca mere continuation\u201d of prewarning interrogation) and 542 U.S. at 622, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (postwarning interrogation was \u201crelated to the substance of [the suspect\u2019s] prewarning statements\u201d). We therefore overrule Hale\u2019s third proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">II. Character Evidence (Specific Instance of Victim\u2019s Conduct)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">{\u00b6 35} In section (F) of his eighth proposition of law, Hale argues that the trial court erred by partly excluding defense testimony about a sexual assault Green allegedly committed in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">{\u00b6 36} At trial, the defense claimed that Hale\u2019s killing of Green constituted lawful self-defense because Green had attempted to rape Hale. The state responded to this claim by calling witnesses to testify about Green\u2019s peaceful character. See Evid.R. 404(A)(2) (victim\u2019s peaceful character admissible to rebut evidence that victim was first aggressor). In response, the defense adduced the testimony of Johnny A. Smith that in 1998, Green had performed oral sex on him, forcibly and against his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">{\u00b6 37} The state objected to Smith\u2019s testimony. Citing <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 759 N.E.2d 1240, the state argued that the 1998 sexual assault could not be used to prove Hale\u2019s claim of self-defense. The defense argued that <em>Barnes </em>was inapplicable because the 1998 assault was being introduced only to rebut the state\u2019s evidence of Green\u2019s peaceful character, not to prove Hale\u2019s self-defense claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">{\u00b6 38} The trial court agreed with the state that <em>Barnes </em>barred evidence about the 1998 sexual assault. Nevertheless, the trial court permitted Smith to testify that the assault had taken place, because Sergeant Baird had already mentioned the 1998 sexual-assault accusation in his testimony about Hale\u2019s interrogation. However, the trial court limited Smith\u2019s testimony to information the jury had already heard: that Green had sexually assaulted Smith in 1998 and that the assault had involved oral sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">{\u00b6 39} On direct examination, the defense asked Smith whether Green had been \u201crestraining\u201d him during the assault. The state\u2019s objection to this question was sustained. Hale claims that the jury should have been allowed to hear Smith\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">{\u00b6 40} The parties\u2019 arguments address the applicability of our holding in <em>State v. Barnes: \u201cA </em>defendant asserting self-defense cannot introduce evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>specific instances of a victim\u2019s conduct to prove that the victim was the initial aggressor.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 21, 759 N.E.2d 1240, syllabus (applying Evid.R. 405(B)). As he did at trial, Hale argues that <em>Barnes </em>is inapplicable, because Smith\u2019s testimony was not offered to prove that Green was the initial aggressor, but rather \u201cto rebut the good character evidence the State had presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">{\u00b6 41} In our view, it does not matter whether the proffered testimony was offered to rebut the state\u2019s character evidence, as Hale suggests, or to prove that Green was the aggressor, as the state argues. Under Evid.R. 405, the testimony was inadmissible for <em>either </em>purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">{\u00b6 42} Evid.R. 405 governs methods of proving character, including the use of specific instances of conduct. Evid.R. 405 authorizes use of specific instances in only two situations: on cross-examination of the other party\u2019s character witnesses, Evid.R. 405(A), and in cases where \u201ccharacter or a trait of character of a person is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense.\u201d Evid.R. 405(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">{\u00b6 43} Under our holding in <em>Barnes, </em>Smith\u2019s testimony could not be used in direct support of Hale\u2019s self-defense claim, i.e., to prove that Green was the aggressor on June 21, 2004, because Evid.R. 405(B) authorizes specific instances of a person\u2019s conduct only when the person\u2019s character \u201cis an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense\u201d and the victim\u2019s character is not an essential element of a self-defense claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">{\u00b6 44} If we accept Hale\u2019s claim that he offered Smith\u2019s testimony not to prove that Green was the aggressor but merely to rebut the state\u2019s evidence of Green\u2019s character, then Evid.R. 405(A) would apply, and <em>Barnes </em>would be inapplicable. But Evid.R. 405(A) does not authorize Smith\u2019s testimony either. Nothing in Evid.R. 405(A) allows a party to use <em>extrinsic evidence </em>of specific instances of a person\u2019s conduct to rebut the other party\u2019s evidence regarding that person\u2019s character. Accord <em>United States v. Benedetto </em>(C.A.2, 1978), 571 F.2d 1246, 1249-1251; <em>United States v. Pantone </em>(C.A.3, 1979), 609 F.2d 675, 680; <em>State v. Bourgeois </em>(Me.1994), 639 A.2d 634, 636-637; <em>People v. Champion </em>(1981), 411 Mich. 468, 471, 307 N.W.2d 681; <em>Spadafina v. State </em>(Tenn.Crim.App.2000), 77 S.W.3d 198, 212; <em>Daggett v. State </em>(Tex.Crim.App.2005), 187 S.W.3d 444, 454, fn. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">{\u00b6 45} Hale also argues that, pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B), the proffered testimony was admissible as \u201cother acts\u201d evidence for <em>noncharacter </em>purposes. He argues that the testimony would have provided evidence of Green\u2019s intent to sexually assault Hale and of Green\u2019s modus operandi in committing such assaults. But Hale did not offer Smith\u2019s testimony for those purposes at trial. He offered it only on the issue of Green\u2019s character. Hence, he waived any argument for admissibility based on Evid.R. 404(B). See <em>Pantone, </em>609 F.2d at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>{\u00b6 46} Finally, Hale claims that the exclusion of Smith\u2019s testimony denied him due process. We disagree. Due process requires only \u201cthat criminal defendants be afforded a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u201d <em>California v. Trombetta </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 479, 485, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413. Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he accused does not have an unfettered right to offer testimony that is incompetent, privileged, or otherwise inadmissible under standard rules of evidence.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Illinois </em>(1988), 484 U.S. 400, 410, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">{\u00b6 47} In <em>United States v. Bautista </em>(C.A.10, 1998), 145 F.3d 1140, the court rejected a due process claim on nearly identical facts. Bautista, charged with murder, claimed to have killed the victim \u201cin the heat of passion upon adequate provocation.\u201d The claimed provocation was that the victim had made a homosexual advance at Bautista. The defense proffered the testimony of a witness who claimed that the victim had once made such an advance at him. The trial court excluded this testimony, and the defendant was convicted. Id. at 1145, 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">{\u00b6 48} The court of appeals affirmed, noting that \u201cthe right to present defense witnesses is not absolute. A defendant must abide [by] the rules of evidence and procedure.\u201d Id. at 1151-1152. Thus, although evidence of the victim\u2019s aggressive character was admissible to show that he was the aggressor, the defense was not entitled to use specific instances of the victim\u2019s conduct to prove his aggressive character. Id. at 1152. Moreover, the trial court had allowed the defendant \u201cto testify that he feared [the victim\u2019s] aggressive homosexual advances and that he had killed [the victim] in the heat of passion upon adequate provocation. In fact, in his confession, which he relied upon, that is the theory the jury heard.\u201d Id. Thus, the trial court \u201cdid not prevent [the defendant] from presenting a defense.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">{\u00b6 49} Like Bautista, Hale was able to present his self-defense claim to the jury by relying on his confession. Indeed, the trial court gave Hale greater leeway than Bautista received. Smith was permitted to testify about the alleged sexual assault by Green, notwithstanding Evid.R. 405. He was prevented only from stating that Green had restrained him. The trial court\u2019s (partial) enforcement of Evid.R. 405 did not deny Hale a \u201cmeaningful opportunity to present a complete defense\u201d and hence did not violate Hale\u2019s right to due process. <em>Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. at 485, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413. We overrule section (F) of Hale\u2019s eighth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">III. Other Evidentiary Issues</p>\n<p id=\"A-r\">A. Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">{\u00b6 50} In his tenth proposition of law, and in section (E) of his eighth proposition of law, Hale contends that the trial court erred by allowing prosecution witnesses Curtiss Jones and Michael Grida to give expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>{\u00b6 51} Curtiss Jones was the supervisor of the trace-evidence department of the Cuyahoga County coroner\u2019s office. He testified regarding blood spatter found in Hale\u2019s motel room. Hale argues that Jones had insufficient practical experience to qualify as an expert on blood-spatter evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">{\u00b6 52} Hale did not object at trial to the court\u2019s recognizing Jones as an expert. Hence, he has waived this issue unless he can demonstrate plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">{\u00b6 53} An alleged error is plain error only if the error is \u201cobvious,\u201d <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 257, 750 N.E.2d 90, and \u201cbut for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.\u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">{\u00b6 54} No plain error occurred here. Evid.R. 702(B) provides that a witness may qualify as an expert by reason of his or her specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education. Neither special education nor certification is necessary to confer expert status on a witness. The witness offered as an expert need not have a complete knowledge of the field in question, as long as the knowledge he or she has will aid the trier of fact. <em>State v. Baston </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 418, 423, 709 N.E.2d 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">{\u00b6 55} Jones testified that he has a master\u2019s degree in forensic science. Additionally, he underwent 48 hours of instruction in the field of blood-spatter analysis, had passed two proficiency tests in that field, and had testified three or four times previously on blood-spatter evidence. Jones testified that he deals with blood-spatter evidence \u201cevery day in terms of looking at evidence.\u201d Examining items \u201cfor the presence of biological fluid such as blood\u201d is \u201cone of the main things\u201d he does, and when he does so, he applies his knowledge of blood-spatter analysis. In light of Jones\u2019s training and experience, the trial court did not commit any obvious error in permitting him to testify as an expert on blood spatter. Cf. <em>State v. Wogenstahl </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 362, 662 N.E.2d 311. Hence, no plain error exists, and this issue is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">{\u00b6 56} Hale also questions the reliability of blood-spatter analysis in general. However, we have recognized that blood-spatter analysis is a proper subject for expert testimony. <em>State v. Biros </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 426, 452, 678 N.E.2d 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">{\u00b6 57} Michael Grida was a Euclid police detective. Using Hale\u2019s bank statements and ATM receipts, Grida testified that Hale had carried a negative bank balance in June 2004, the month of the murder. He also reconciled Hale\u2019s bank statement with an ATM receipt showing a negative balance of $1,099.84 in Hale\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">{\u00b6 58} Hale objected to some of Grida\u2019s testimony, but not on the ground that Grida lacked expert qualifications. Hence, this issue is waived absent plain error. No plain error occurred here. Hale\u2019s financial situation gave him a motive for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>robbery, but the aggravated robbery itself was firmly established by other evidence. In his statement to the Euclid police, Hale admitted stealing Green\u2019s SUV and credit card. Hale\u2019s friend James Hull saw Hale in possession of Green\u2019s SUV after the murder, and police found Hale inside Green\u2019s SUV when they arrested him. Green\u2019s bank records confirmed that Green\u2019s Visa card was used on June 22. Giant Eagle records provided additional evidence that Hale had used the Visa card at the Giant Eagle store.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">{\u00b6 59} Hale\u2019s tenth proposition of law and section (E) of his eighth proposition of law are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">B. Prejudicial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">{\u00b6 60} In section (B) of his eighth proposition of law, Hale contends that Robert Stewart gave inflammatory, irrelevant testimony. Stewart, a maintenance worker at the lodge, had seen Green\u2019s body in Room 281. The prosecutor asked him how that affected his emotions. Over a defense objection, the trial court permitted Stewart to answer. Stewart testified that seeing the body \u201cshook [him] up pretty good\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t work much the rest of the day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">{\u00b6 61} Because Stewart\u2019s emotional reaction to seeing the victim\u2019s body was irrelevant, the trial court erred by overruling Hale\u2019s objection. However, Stewart was a minor witness, and his testimony that seeing the body upset him was not inflammatory. The trial court\u2019s error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">{\u00b6 62} In section (C) of his eighth proposition of law, Hale contends that the testimony of Ricardo Cuffari and Vivian Wilson Jr. amounted to improper \u201cvictim-impact evidence.\u201d In response to Hale\u2019s self-defense claim, the state called Cuffari and Wilson, two friends of Green\u2019s, to testify that Green had a peaceful character. Hale claims that their testimony went beyond Green\u2019s character for peacefulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">{\u00b6 63} First, Hale complains that Cuffari testified about Green\u2019s \u201cbusiness practices.\u201d Cuffari testified that it was not Green\u2019s \u201cnormal practice\u201d to \u201caudition\u201d a potential student before agreeing to teach him. This testimony was relevant because it contradicted Hale\u2019s account of why Green was in Hale\u2019s hotel room.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">{\u00b6 64} Hale also complains that Cuffari testified about Green\u2019s work in the music industry. Cuffari, who owned a recording and voice-coaching studio, testified that he had met Green after hearing him sing professionally; Green later became a coproducer at Cuffari\u2019s studio. Their relationship was originally a professional one, but they quickly became friends. This testimony was relevant to establish Cuffari\u2019s relationship with Green, and thus his knowledge of Green\u2019s character. \u201c[T]o introduce opinion evidence the offering party must qualify the character witness by laying a foundation showing that the witness is sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>acquainted with the accused or victim to have formed an opinion about that person\u2019s character.\u201d 1 Gianelli <em>&amp; </em>Snyder, Evidence (2d Ed.2001) 253, Section 405.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">{\u00b6 65} Finally, Hale argues that Cuffari\u2019s testimony that he and Green had prayed together should have been excluded. The prosecutor asked Cuffari, \u201c[LJeading up to the point in time when Doug died, how would you describe the level of friendship between the two of you?\u201d Cuffari replied: \u201cDoug was probably one of my best friends at that time. * * * We called each other a lot on the phone. If there was problems on his side or my side, I would call for prayers and vice versa. When my mom was passing away he came to the hospital and prayed over my mom. He also sang in her funeral so you could see how direct it was. And he was a very, very close and dear friend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">{\u00b6 66} Cuffari briefly mentioned prayers as part of his response to the prosecutor\u2019s question about the \u201clevel of friendship\u201d between Cuffari and Green. In this context, Cuffari was simply elaborating on Green\u2019s status as \u201cone of [his] best friends,\u201d thus laying a foundation to establish his knowledge of Green\u2019s character.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">{\u00b6 67} Hale complains that Vivian Wilson testified that Green did not smoke or drink beer. Wilson\u2019s testimony was relevant to the aggravated-robbery charge, because Green\u2019s Visa card was used at the Giant Eagle store to buy beer and cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">{\u00b6 68} Wilson also testified that the last time he saw Green, Green had greeted him by saying, \u201c[G]ive me some love * * On that occasion, Wilson had asked Green to sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d for Wilson\u2019s son the next day. This testimony illustrated the close relationship between Green and Wilson and was thus relevant to Wilson\u2019s knowledge of Green\u2019s character. We reject section.(C) of Hale\u2019s eighth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">{\u00b6 69} In section (D) of his eighth proposition of law, Hale contends that State\u2019s Exhibit 151, a photograph of Green, was irrelevant and misleading. The photograph was taken from the cover of a compact disc containing songs by Green. In the photo, Green wears rings on both hands. The state introduced the photo to show that Green owned and wore jewelry, thus suggesting robbery as Hale\u2019s motive to kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">{\u00b6 70} Hale argues that the photo is misleading because it does not specifically show Green\u2019s appearance \u201cat the time he met Hale at his motel room.\u201d We find this contention specious. Evid.R. 401 defines \u201crelevant evidence\u201d as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d This test is a broad one, and the photo clearly satisfies it. See 1 McCormick, Evidence (2006) 733-735, Section 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>{\u00b6 71} Moreover, the photo created no danger of unfair prejudice; hence, no cogent argument exists to exclude the photo under Evid.R. 403(A). Hale offers no explanation to support his assertion that the photo \u201camounted to victim impact\u201d evidence. Cf. <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 57 (predeath photo of victim admissible). We reject section (D) of Hale\u2019s eighth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">C. Gruesome Photographs</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">{\u00b6 72} In his ninth proposition of law, Hale contends that he was prejudiced by the admission of gruesome and cumulative autopsy and crime-scene photographs. See generally <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 258, 513 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">{\u00b6 73} State\u2019s Exhibits 27 and 28, although they are autopsy photographs, are not gruesome. Neither are the photographs of Green\u2019s body wrapped in opaque plastic bags, or those showing the bags after their removal from the body. Likewise, the crime-scene photographs are not gruesome, even though a few show small bloodstains on carpets, furniture, or walls. Thus, although some of these photos are cumulative, <em>Morales </em>does not apply to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">{\u00b6 74} Six autopsy photos showing Green\u2019s head wounds can be characterized as gruesome. However, State\u2019s Exhibits 32, 33, and 34 are not repetitious or cumulative. Each one shows something the other does not. Exhibit 33 shows \u201cfouling\u201d around one of the bullet wounds that indicates it was a contact wound. Exhibit 32 does not show fouling, but does depict the probes that the coroner inserted into the bullet holes to show the angles of entry. Exhibit 34 also shows the probes, but from an angle different from that in Exhibit 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">{\u00b6 75} On the other hand, State\u2019s Exhibit 31 appears to show nothing not shown by Exhibit 33, and Exhibit 30 appears to be merely a closer view of Exhibit 29. Nevertheless, we find no prejudice and no reversible error in the admission of two cumulative photographs. Cf. <em>State v. Jalowiec </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 220, 230, 744 N.E.2d 163 (cumulative effect of several repetitive autopsy photographs was harmless). We therefore overrule Hale\u2019s ninth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\"><em>TV. </em>Jury Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AMO\">A. Life Qualification</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">{\u00b6 76} In his fifth proposition of law, Hale claims that the trial judge conducted voir dire in a one-sided, and therefore unfair, manner. According to Hale, the judge death-qualified each prospective juror without any request by the prosecution, but he did not similarly \u201clife-qualify\u201d each prospective juror \u2014 i.e., he did not ask those jurors questions to determine whether they would automatically vote for the death penalty. See generally <em>Morgan v. Illinois </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 719, 729, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492. Hale alleges that \u201cthe trial court failed to ask life-qualifying questions of at least 28 prospective jurors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">{\u00b6 77} Crucially, Hale does not contend that the trial judge <em>prevented </em>defense counsel from life-qualifying the jurors. Instead, he argues that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s conduct of voir dire was biased\u201d because the judge asked death-qualifying questions himself, but left it to defense counsel to ask life-qualifying questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">{\u00b6 78} Hale has failed to preserve his claim that the trial judge was not impartial. Such claims must be raised by filing an affidavit of disqualification with the chief justice of this court. Hale did file such an affidavit in this case, but that affidavit made no allegation concerning the conduct of the trial judge during voir dire. See <em>In re Disqualification of Ambrose, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1220, 2005-Ohio-7154, 850 N.E.2d 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">{\u00b6 79} Moreover, the claimed error does not reach the level of plain error. In the first place, the record shows that the trial judge asked numerous prospective jurors whether they could consider mitigating factors or whether they would automatically vote for a death sentence. In many cases, the judge asked <em>both </em>questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">{\u00b6 80} Second, the trial court had no obligation to personally life-qualify the jurors. <em>State v. Stojetz </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 452, 705 N.E.2d 329, syllabus; <em>State v. Mundt, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 22, 2007-Ohio-4836, 873 N.E.2d 828, \u00b6 164-167. The fact that the judge did ask death-qualifying questions did not create any such obligation. The fact remains that the trial judge did not prevent defense counsel from asking such questions, and counsel in fact did ask such questions without hindrance. Hale provides no support for his assertions that the trial judge\u2019s method of proceeding caused the seating of a \u201cdeath-prone jury.\u201d We overrule Hale\u2019s fifth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">B. Juror Misconduct/Misunderstanding</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">{\u00b6 81} In his sixth proposition of law, Hale contends that the jurors did not understand the concept of aggravating circumstances and that they committed \u201cjuror misconduct\u201d by considering nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">{\u00b6 82} Both claims are based solely on statements that two jurors made on voir dire. In explaining that he was not opposed to capital punishment, one juror stated: \u201cI\u2019m assuming that the aggravated circumstances would mean like something like extreme brutality * * Another juror said she \u201cwould have to decide by what was presented as far as the reason or the cause of death, how it was done, why it was done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">{\u00b6 83} These statements, made on voir dire \u2014 before the jury had even been selected, much less formally instructed as to the meaning of aggravating circumstances \u2014 cannot support an inference that the jurors either misunderstood or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>disobeyed the instructions they later received in the penalty phase. We overrule Hale\u2019s sixth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">C. Failure to Excuse Jurors for Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">{\u00b6 84} In his seventh proposition of law, Hale contends that three prospective jurors should have been excused for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 85} Prospective juror No. 33 stated early in her voir dire that a defendant who took a life should get death and that she did not think she could consider a life sentence. But in later questioning, she retreated from that position. She ultimately abandoned it altogether, affirming that she could set her personal views aside and consider mitigating factors in accordance with the trial court\u2019s instructions. Hale challenged juror No. 33 for cause as an automatic-death-penalty juror, but the trial court overruled his challenge. The defense later eliminated this juror with a peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">{\u00b6 86} No Sixth Amendment violation took place, because juror No. 33 ultimately did not sit on the jury. \u201cSo long as the jury that sits is impartial, the fact that the defendant had to use a peremptory challenge to achieve that result does not mean the Sixth Amendment was violated.\u201d <em>Ross v. Oklahoma </em>(1988), 487 U.S. 81, 88, 108 S.Ct. 2273, 101 L.Ed.2d 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">{\u00b6 87} As a matter of state law, we have \u201crecognized that where the defense exhausts its peremptory challenges before the full jury is seated, the erroneous denial of a challenge for cause in a criminal ease may be prejudicial.\u201d <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 564, 715 N.E.2d 1144. However, \u201c[a] defendant in a criminal case cannot complain of prejudicial error in the overruling of a challenge for cause if such ruling does <em>not </em>force him to exhaust his peremptory challenges.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Eaton </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St.2d 145, 48 O.O.2d 188, 249 N.E.2d 897, paragraph one of the syllabus, vacated in part by <em>Eaton v. Ohio </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 935, 92 S.Ct. 2857, 33 L.Ed.2d 750. Thus, \u201c[i]f the trial court erroneously overrules a challenge for cause, the error is prejudicial only if the accused eliminates the challenged venireman with a peremptory challenge <em>and </em>exhausts his peremptory challenges before the full jury is seated.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 30-31, 553 N.E.2d 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">{\u00b6 88} In this case, Hale did expend a peremptory challenge on juror No. 33, but he used only five of his allotted six peremptories. Thus, the trial court did not force Hale to exhaust his peremptories when it overruled his challenge to juror No. 33. That ruling was therefore nonprejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">{\u00b6 89} Jurors No. 4 and 5 served on the jury. But Hale waived any objection to their service. First, he declined to challenge either one for cause. Second, he did not exhaust his peremptories, and he thereby \u201cacquiesced in the jury that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>finally selected.\u201d <em>State v. Carter </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St.2d 212, 214, 50 O.O.2d 446, 256 N.E.2d 714; see also <em>State v. Stallings </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 280, 288, 731 N.E.2d 159. Finally, defense counsel expressly stated that they were satisfied with the jury. See <em>Eaton, </em>19 Ohio St.2d at 149, 48 O.O.2d 188, 249 N.E.2d 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">{\u00b6 90} The trial court did not commit plain error in failing to excuse jurors No. 4 and 5 sua sponte. The record does not show that they were automatic-death-penalty jurors. Juror No. 4 thought he could consider all sentencing options. He agreed that the death penalty is \u201cfor a very few select people\u201d and should not be imposed on all murderers without regard to mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">{\u00b6 91} Juror No. 5 thought that sex murderers and child murderers should be executed and that in cases such as Charles Manson\u2019s, \u201cyou really want to see that person hang.\u201d Otherwise, she stated, it depended on the individual case. These statements in no way suggest that juror No. 5 would vote automatically for a death sentence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">{\u00b6 92} Indeed, juror No. 5 appeared uncertain that she could sign a death verdict and was reluctant to answer that question without knowing the circumstances of the case. She understood that the death penalty \u201cis reserved for only a few.\u201d She said that she could consider mitigating factors and would consider all sentencing options. She said, \u201cI may not vote for the death penalty in this instance. I might think something lesser would be appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">{\u00b6 93} Hale has waived his claims with respect to jurors No. 4 and 5, and the trial court did not commit plain error in allowing them to sit. We therefore overrule Hale\u2019s seventh proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">V. Trial-Administration Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">A. In Camera Inspection of Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">{\u00b6 94} Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g) provides for the in camera inspection of a witness\u2019s written or recorded out-of-court statement to determine whether the statement is inconsistent with the witness\u2019s testimony (in which case it may be used in cross-examining the witness). Under the rule, counsel for both parties \u201cmust be given the opportunity to: (1) inspect the statement personally; and (2) call to the court\u2019s attention any perceived inconsistencies between the testimony of the witness and the prior statement.\u201d <em>State v. Daniels </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 69, 1 OBR 109, 437 N.E.2d 1186, syllabus. In his first proposition of law, Hale contends that his trial counsel were not allowed to participate in the trial court\u2019s in camera review of several witnesses\u2019 prior statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">{\u00b6 95} Hale\u2019s strongest claim involves a police report written by Sergeant Baird. At a pretrial suppression hearing, the trial court reviewed Baird\u2019s report, but Hale\u2019s counsel were not allowed to participate in that review.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>{\u00b6 96} However, the defense failed to preserve this issue. \u201c[0]nce the trial court concluded that there were no inconsistencies between the statements and trial testimony * * *, defense counsel did not ask to review the statements or object to the procedure employed by the court * * *. Defense counsel merely accepted the trial court\u2019s decision that there were no inconsistencies * * *.\u201d <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 197, 2004-Ohio-7007, 824 N.E.2d 504, \u00b6 48. Thus, Hale \u201chas waived all but plain error in regard to this issue.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">{\u00b6 97} There was no plain error here, because Hale \u201chas failed to identify any inconsistencies that would warrant reversal.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 49. The \u201cinconsistencies\u201d mentioned by Hale are actually details of the interrogation to which Baird testified but did not mention in his report. However, \u201c[t]he fact that details may be lacking in a pretrial statement does not mean that inconsistencies exist for purposes of Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g).\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">{\u00b6 98} Hale also claims that his counsel were not allowed to participate in the inspection of statements by James Hull, Hale\u2019s sister Lashayla, and Jude Nilsson, a carpenter at the Lake Ohio Lodge in 2004, but these claims are far less substantial. First, the record does not show that defense counsel were prevented from participating in the in camera inspection of statements by these three witnesses, and we decline to speculate on the matter. Thus, with regard to those statements, the factual premise for Hale\u2019s claims simply does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">{\u00b6 99} Second, any issue was waived at trial, for the defense neither objected to the inspection procedure nor asked to review the statements. Id. at \u00b6 48. And there was no plain error. As to Hull\u2019s statements, the claimed \u201cinconsistencies\u201d are again merely details that Hull mentioned in his testimony but that do not appear in his pretrial statements. Id. at \u00b6 49. As for Lashayla Hale and Jude Nilsson, Hale fails to identify <em>any </em>purported inconsistencies between these witnesses\u2019 statements and their testimony. Hale\u2019s first proposition of law is ' overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">B. Proceedings in Defendant\u2019s Absence</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">{\u00b6 100} In his fourth proposition of law, Hale contends that trial proceedings were conducted in his absence. An accused has a fundamental right to be present at all critical stages of his criminal trial. However, \u201cthe presence of a defendant is a condition of due process to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence, <em>and to that extent only.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts </em>(1934), 291 U.S. 97, 107-108, 54 S.Ct. 330, 78 L.Ed. 674, overruled on other grounds by <em>Malloy v. Hogan </em>(1964), 378 U.S. 1, 17, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653. The question is whether his presence has a \u201creasonably substantial\u201d relationship to \u201cthe fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.\u201d Id. at 105-106, 54 S.Ct. 330, 78 L.Ed. 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>{\u00b6 101} On May 12, 2005, Hale was absent during all or part of a brief, inconclusive discussion between the trial judge and counsel for the parties. The defense complained that the state was still disclosing evidence that should have been disclosed earlier. The state asserted that it had already informally disclosed the evidence in question and was now merely doing so \u201cin a formal written fashion\u201d for the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">{\u00b6 102} Hale\u2019s \u201cabsence was not prejudicial because the jury received neither testimony nor evidence, and no critical stage of the trial was involved.\u201d <em>State v. Frazier, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 139, 2007-Ohio-5048, 873 N.E.2d 1263, \u00b6 145. Hale contends that his presence during this discussion \u201cwould have been important\u201d because it \u201cwould have alerted him to the ineffective assistance of counsel he was receiving * * * which would have prompted him to raise the issue before the trial court.\u201d We reject this speculative claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">{\u00b6 103} Hale was also absent from a proceeding in chambers on May 25, 2005. This proceeding involved a discussion of \u201ctechnical and procedural and evidentiary matters,\u201d and defense counsel waived Hale\u2019s presence. Hale contends that counsel may not waive a client\u2019s right to be present, but he is incorrect. See, e.g., <em>Frazier, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 139, 2007-Ohio-5048, 873 N.E.2d 1263, \u00b6 144; <em>State v. Green </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 352, 372, 738 N.E.2d 1208. Moreover, Hale\u2019s absence was not prejudicial, as the jury received no testimony or evidence in his absence. See <em>Frazier </em>at \u00b6 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">{\u00b6 104} Hale also contends that he was not present during ten \u201cpretrial hearings\u201d held between August 23, 2004, and March 10, 2005. The record does not show that any hearings actually took place on the dates indicated. The trial court\u2019s docket and journal entries state only that \u201cpretrial[s]\u201d were held on those dates. These may have been pretrial <em>conferences. </em>See generally Crim.R. 17.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">{\u00b6 105} Whatever the \u201cpretrials\u201d were, none of them was recorded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he record must affirmatively indicate the absence of a defendant or his counsel during a particular stage of the trial.\u201d <em>State v. Clark </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 252, 258, 527 N.E.2d 844. As no record was made, we cannot determine whether Hale was absent from the pretrials in question. Hale\u2019s fourth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">C. Discovery Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">{\u00b6 106} In section (A) of his eighth proposition of law, Hale contends that the trial court should have punished the state\u2019s noncompliance with its discovery orders by excluding Hale\u2019s oral statements to Sergeants Baird and Pestak.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>{\u00b6 107} Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(a)(ii) provides: \u201cUpon motion of the defendant, the court shall order the prosecuting attorney to permit the defendant to inspect and copy * * * [wjritten summaries of any oral statement * * * made by the defendant or co-defendant to * * * any law enforcement officer.\u201d This rule requires that the prosecution \u201creduce the [defendant\u2019s] statement to writing, in the form of a summary, to be provided to the defense during discovery.\u201d <em>State v. Bidinost </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 449, 456, 644 N.E.2d 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">{\u00b6 108} At issue are Hale\u2019s statement to Pestak that he \u201cdidn\u2019t kill anybody\u201d and Hale\u2019s statement to Baird that he had discarded the gun, Green\u2019s clothing and shoulder bag, and some towels in a dumpster outside the lodge. The state had informed defense counsel of the statements to Baird during a pretrial, but had failed to provide written summaries of either statement, as required by <em>Bidinost, </em>within the deadline set by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">{\u00b6 109} The trial court initially ordered that Hale\u2019s oral statement to Baird be excluded as a discovery sanction. However, the court did not exclude the statement to Pestak. Later, the trial court found that the defense had opened the door to part of Hale\u2019s oral statement to Baird \u2014 all except the part about the shoulder bag \u2014 and allowed Baird to testify to that portion of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">{\u00b6 110} The prosecutor asked Sergeant Baird about Hale\u2019s admission that he had disposed of the gun and Green\u2019s clothing and shoulder bag. On objection, the prosecutor withdrew this question. The defense did not ask the trial court to strike the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the shoulder bag or to issue a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">{\u00b6 111} The prosecutor then asked, \u201c[W]hat did the defendant tell you he disposed of?\u201d Baird replied, \u201cHe told me that he had disposed of the clothing, the gun <em>and the bag, </em>along with some towels.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">{\u00b6 112} Defense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial. At sidebar, the prosecutor suggested that Baird had been referring to a <em>garbage </em>bag that Hale had placed the gun and clothing in before disposing of them. The trial court determined that its order did not bar references to the garbage bag. Further questioning clarified that the \u201cbag\u201d mentioned by Baird was indeed a garbage bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">{\u00b6 113} Crim.R. 16(E)(3) provides: \u201cIf at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>{\u00b6 114} We have held that Crim.R. 16(E)(3) vests the trial court \u201cwith a certain amount of discretion in determining the sanction to be imposed for a party\u2019s nondisclosure of discoverable material. The court is not bound to exclude such material at trial although it may do so at its option.\u201d <em>State v. Parson </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 442, 445, 6 OBR 485, 453 N.E.2d 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 115} <em>Parson </em>established guidelines for evaluating the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in this area: \u201cWhere, in a criminal trial, the prosecution fails to comply with Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(a)(ii) by informing the accused of an oral statement made by a co-defendant to a law enforcement officer, and the record does not demonstrate (1) that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose was a willful violation of Crim.R. 16, (2) that foreknowledge of the statement would have benefited the accused in the preparation of his defense, or (3) that the accused was prejudiced by admission of the statement, the trial court does not abuse its discretion under Crim.R. 16(E)(3) by permitting such evidence to be admitted.\u201d <em>Parson, </em>6 Ohio St.3d 442, 6 OBR 485, 453 N.E.2d 689, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 116} None of the three <em>Parson </em>factors exists in this case. First, nothing in the record indicates that the state\u2019s failure to provide written summaries of Hale\u2019s oral statements in question was a <em>willful </em>discovery violation. To the contrary, the trial court expressly found that the prosecution had engaged in \u201cno intentional withholding of the information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">{\u00b6 117} Second, there is no evidence that foreknowledge of the statements at issue would have benefited the defense. In fact, the defense <em>had </em>foreknowledge of these statements. As we have noted, the prosecution had orally informed the defense of Hale\u2019s statements to Baird before trial. While this conduct did not satisfy the requirement of a written summary, it clearly did provide the defense with foreknowledge of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">{\u00b6 118} As for Hale\u2019s statements to Pestak that he \u201cdidn\u2019t kill anybody,\u201d the defense learned of them no later than May 9, 2005, when Pestak testified about that statement at the suppression hearing. That hearing occurred 22 days before Pestak testified at trial concerning those statements. Thus, \u201c[w]hile the defense was entitled to a written summary of the statements], the record does not reflect that a written summary would have benefited appellant in the preparation of his defense.\u201d <em>Bidinost, </em>71 Ohio St.3d at 457, 644 N.E.2d 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">{\u00b6 119} Third, the record does not show prejudice. The defense was not surprised by these statements, because defense counsel had actual foreknowledge of their content. Nor did the defense request a continuance to prepare to cross-examine Pestak and Baird. Hence, \u201cthe trial court may have properly determined that appellant was prepared to proceed despite any claim of unfair \u2018surprise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bidinost, </em>71 Ohio St.3d at 457, 644 N.E.2d 318. See also <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>Wiles </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 80, 571 N.E.2d 97, citing <em>State v. Edwards </em>(1976), 49 Ohio St.2d 31, 42-43, 3 O.O.3d 18, 358 N.E.2d 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">{\u00b6 120} Finally, no due process issue exists here. \u201cThere is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case * * <em>Weatherford v. Bursey </em>(1977), 429 U.S. 545, 559, 97 S.Ct. 837, 51 L.Ed.2d 30. See also <em>Gray v. Netherland </em>(1996), 518 U.S. 152, 168, 116 S.Ct. 2074, 135 L.Ed.2d 457. In particular, a criminal defendant has no due process right to inspect his own confession. See <em>Leland v. Oregon </em>(1952), 343 U.S. 790, 801-802, 72 S.Ct. 1002, 96 L.Ed. 1302; <em>Cicenia v. La Gay </em>(1958), 357 U.S. 504, 510-511, 78 S.Ct. 1297, 2 L.Ed.2d 1523, overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Escobedo v. Illinois </em>(1964), 378 U.S. 478, 492, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977, fn. 15. We overrule section (A) of Hale\u2019s eighth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">VI. Exclusion of Proffered Mitigation</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">{\u00b6 121} In Hale\u2019s 11th proposition of law, he contends that the trial court improperly excluded relevant mitigating evidence from the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">{\u00b6 122} Hale\u2019s three sisters, Latisha, Lashayla, and Laquatia, testified on his behalf in the penalty phase. During Lashayla\u2019s testimony, defense counsel asked: \u2018What would it do to you if your brother was sentenced to death?\u201d The state\u2019s objection was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">{\u00b6 123} Hale claims this ruling was erroneous because the impact of the death penalty on the' defendant\u2019s family is a relevant mitigating factor. The constitutional right of a capital defendant to present mitigating evidence includes any aspect of his character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense. <em>Lockett v. Ohio </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">{\u00b6 124} However, a trial court may exclude proffered mitigation that is not relevant to the defendant\u2019s character, his record, or the circumstances of the offense. Id. at fn. 12. Several jurisdictions have held that testimony by the defendant\u2019s relatives concerning the impact that the defendant\u2019s execution will have on them is not relevant to the defendant\u2019s character, his record, or the circumstances of his offense and therefore may be excluded. See, e.g., <em>People v. Vieira </em>(2005), 35 Cal.4th 264, 295, 25 Cal.Rptr.3d 337, 106 P.3d 990; <em>People v. Armstrong </em>(1998), 183 Ill.2d 130, 154-155, 233 Ill.Dec. 252, 700 N.E.2d 960; <em>Ross v. State </em>(Miss.2007), 954 So.2d 968, \u00b6 15; <em>Fuller v. State </em>(Tex.Crim.App.1992), 827 S.W.2d 919, 936; <em>State v. Stenson </em>(1997), 132 Wash.2d 668, 750-754, 940 P.2d 1239. Contra <em>State v. Stevens </em>(1994), 319 Or. 573, 584, 879 P.2d 162 (effect of execution on defendant\u2019s family is relevant to his character because it shows his capacity to be of emotional value to others).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">{\u00b6 125} Even were we to conclude that the evidence should have been admitted, we would find in this case that any error was harmless. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>court\u2019s ruling was narrow. Although Lashayla was precluded from testifying as to how Hale\u2019s execution would affect her, she was permitted to testify that she loved him. Similarly, Latisha and Laquatia testified that they loved Hale and wanted to maintain a relationship with him. In addition, all three sisters were permitted to expound on Hale\u2019s good qualities. Thus, while staying within the bounds of the trial court\u2019s ruling, Hale\u2019s sisters were fully able to convey that they loved and valued their brother and to present aspects of his character that militated in favor of sparing his life. See <em>Vieira, </em>35 Cal.4th at 295, 25 Cal.Rptr.3d 337, 106 P.3d 990; <em>State v. Loftin </em>(1996), 146 N.J. 295, 369, 680 A.2d 677 (any error would have been harmless; defendant presented character evidence that directly focused on his relationship with wife and child). We overrule Hale\u2019s 11th proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">VII. Penalty-Phase Evidentiary Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">{\u00b6 126} In his 12th proposition of law, Hale argues that the trial court allowed inadmissible evidence in the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">{\u00b6 127} Hale\u2019s sister Laquatia testified in the penalty phase. During her cross-examination, the state elicited testimony regarding a threat by Hale to kill his father. Laquatia testified that she had heard about the threat, but \u201cwasn\u2019t present\u201d when it was made. The defense objected, but did not state any grounds for the objection, and the trial court overruled it.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">{\u00b6 128} Hale now advances three grounds for holding the testimony inadmissible. First, he argues that Laquatia\u2019s testimony was inadmissible hearsay. See <em>State v. Jalowiec </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 220, 233, 744 N.E.2d 163 (hearsay rule applies to the penalty phase). Second, Hale argues that the prosecutor was \u201ctestifying,\u201d although he makes no attempt to explain this assertion. Third, he argues that Laquatia\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because it went to the issue of future dangerousness and showed that Hale was a person of bad character.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">{\u00b6 129} However, Hale did not advance any of these grounds at trial. By failing to \u201cstat[e] the specific ground of objection,\u201d Hale waived his claims. Evid.R. 103(A)(1). Hence, he can prevail now only if he shows that the admission of Laquatia\u2019s testimony was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">{\u00b6 130} We find that it was not. Hale\u2019s sister Latisha testified that she was present at times when Hale argued with his father. On one such occasion, Hale threatened to kill his father, \u201cbut then he told him that he kn[e]w that he wouldn\u2019t die so he\u2019s not going to kill him. If anything he\u2019ll torture him.\u201d Laquatia\u2019s testimony regarding the death threat was thus merely cumulative of Latisha\u2019s testimony, whose admissibility Hale does not challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">{\u00b6 131} Hale also claims that the state improperly elicited evidence about Hale\u2019s having been paroled. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>John Fabian, the defense psychologist, about the length of the sentence from which Hale had been released in 2003. Fabian knew that Hale had served 12 years, but did not know the length of the original sentence. The prosecutor asked: \u201cIn fact, doctor, it was an indeterminate sentence of 12 to 25 years, was it not?\u201d Fabian repeated, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The prosecutor then asked: \u201c[A]ssuming that that is accurate, * * * would you agree from your knowledge of the prison system that in order to be red lighted after the minimum term of an indeterminate sentence, the parole board reviewed the inmate\u2019s performance while in prison [and] was satisfied that parole was justified at that point?\u201d Fabian said: \u201cThat seems logical to me.\u201d Fabian had not discussed parole on direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">{\u00b6 132} Again, the defense made nonspecific objections to the prosecutor\u2019s questions. Thus, Hale has failed to preserve his claim and must demonstrate that it was plain error to permit Fabian to answer these questions. Raising the issue of parole on cross-examination may have been improper, see <em>State v. Cassano, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 94, 2002-Ohio-3751, 772 N.E.2d 81, \u00b6 98, but it was not clearly outcome-determinative. We therefore find that no plain error occurred. Moreover, our independent review of the death sentence will cure the error, as the possibility of parole will play no part in our analysis. Hale\u2019s 12th proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">VIII. Penalty-Phase Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">{\u00b6 133} In his 13th proposition of law, Hale argues that erroneous instructions rendered the penalty phase unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 134} During closing argument, the prosecutor asked the jury to consider whether there was \u201cany mitigation in\u201d the circumstances of the crime, specifically the robbery and the defendant\u2019s attempts to conceal the murder. The defense objected on the ground that the prosecutor could not argue mitigating factors not raised by the defense. See <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 289, 528 N.E.2d 542. The trial court sustained the objection and gave, without objection, the following curative instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">{\u00b6 135} \u201cMitigation evidence is the evidence that was presented by the defense during this portion of the trial or that would have been presented during the trial phase. <em>It does not exist within the context of the crime itself\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">{\u00b6 136} It is unclear what the judge meant by the last sentence of this instruction, but Hale contends that it can reasonably be understood to mean that the circumstances of the crime cannot be considered in mitigation. Such an instruction would, of course, be incorrect. See R.C. 2929.04(B) (sentencer \u201cshall consider\u201d the nature and circumstances of the offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>{\u00b6 137} However, on the facts of this case, we cannot find that this instruction constituted plain error. The only \u201ccircumstances of the offense\u201d in which Hale claims to find mitigation is that Green allegedly provoked the murder by making an unwanted sexual advance. However, the physical evidence is inconsistent with that claim. Furthermore, the trial judge did instruct the jury, correctly, that \u201cduress, coercion or strong provocation\u201d was a mitigating factor. Under these circumstances, it is unlikely that the jury would have imposed a life sentence even if the trial court had not given the instruction at issue. Hence, we cannot find that the instruction constituted plain error, and this claim is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">{\u00b6 138} The trial court also instructed the jury to consider \u201conly that evidence admitted in the trial phase that is relevant to the aggravating circumstances and to any of the mitigating factors.\u201d This instruction was erroneous, as we have held it to be the trial court\u2019s responsibility to determine what guilt-phase evidence is relevant in the penalty phase. See <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 201, 702 N.E.2d 866.</p>\n<p id=\"A__\">{\u00b6 139} Hale contends that this instruction was prejudicial because it allowed the jury to consider guilt-phase evidence about the gunshot wounds. However, the gunshot wounds were \u201cneither irrelevant nor prejudicial to the penalty phase.\u201d <em>State v. Lindsey </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 479, 485, 721 N.E.2d 995. The execution-style nature of the murder \u2014 four shots, at least three at close range, to the head \u2014 tends to show prior calculation and design, which are elements of the felony-murder aggravating circumstance. See <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 330, 738 N.E.2d 1178. The wounds also disprove Hale\u2019s story of a sexual assault by Green, thus refuting the claimed mitigating factor of provocation. In any event, the nature and circumstances of the offense are relevant and must be considered in the penalty phase. See <em>State v. Stumpf </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 512 N.E.2d 598, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 201, 661 N.E.2d 1068; <em>State v. Fears </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 345, 715 N.E.2d 136, quoting <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 282-283, 528 N.E.2d 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 140} In fact, practically all the guilt-phase evidence was relevant to the aggravating circumstance, the nature and circumstances of the offense, or the claim of provocation. Thus, the trial court\u2019s instruction was not prejudicial. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 350, 744 N.E.2d 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">{\u00b6 141} In his 14th proposition of law, Hale contends that the trial judge was biased in favor of a death sentence. He bases this claim on what the trial judge said on June 16, 2005, when the jury returned its penalty-phase recommendation of death:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>{\u00b6 142} \u201cThe Court having polled the jury does find that this is the verdict of the jury in this case, and the sentence of death shall be imposed upon the Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">{\u00b6 143} \u201cA sentencing hearing will be set in this case * * * to place that verdict into effect. The Court will enter that verdict at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">{\u00b6 144} The defense filed an affidavit of disqualification against the trial judge, arguing that the trial judge\u2019s words evidenced a predisposition in favor of a death sentence. See R.C. 2701.03. However, the chief justice of this court found that the trial judge was not biased or prejudiced. \u201cIsolated remarks made by a judge near the end of a three- or four-week trial are not sufficient to prove that the judge is biased or prejudiced.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Ambrose, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1220, 2005-Ohio-7154, 850 N.E.2d 722, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">{\u00b6 145} Under Section 5(C), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, the chief justice or his designee has sole authority to determine whether a trial judge is disqualified. See <em>State v. Moore </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 649, 650, 758 N.E.2d 1130; <em>Beer v. Griffith </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 440, 441, 8 O.O.3d 438, 377 N.E.2d 775. In this case, the chief justice determined that the trial judge\u2019s June 16 remark did not establish bias or create any basis for disqualification. <em>Ambrose </em>at \u00b6 5. That ruling is res judicata. <em>State v. Rogers </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 174, 186, 17 OBR 414, 478 N.E.2d 984. We reject the attempt to relitigate a settled issue and overrule Hale\u2019s 14th proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">{\u00b6 146} In his 15th proposition of law, Hale contends that the trial judge improperly considered victim-impact evidence in sentencing him to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">{\u00b6 147} After the jury returned its sentencing recommendation on June 16, 2005, the trial judge scheduled a final hearing for the purpose of imposing sentence. This hearing was held on July 18, 2005. At that time, after hearing from counsel for both parties and giving Hale an opportunity for allocution, the trial judge explained why the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors and announced his decision to sentence Hale to death. <em>After </em>that, the judge heard the statements of Douglas Green\u2019s sister and daughter. He then imposed sentence on all counts, both capital and noncapital.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">{\u00b6 148} \u201cAbsent an indication that the trial court considered the victim-impact evidence in arriving at its sentencing decision, the admission of such evidence is not reversible error. * * * [T]his court will presume that a trial court considered only the relevant, material, and competent evidence in arriving at its judgment, unless the contrary affirmatively appears from the record.\u201d <em>State v. Myers, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 335, 2002-Ohio-6658, 780 N.E.2d 186, \u00b6 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">{\u00b6 149} The record contains no affirmative indication that the trial judge considered the statements of Green\u2019s relatives in sentencing Hale to death. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the contrary, the judge announced his findings and sentence on the aggravated murder <em>before </em>hearing from Green\u2019s relatives. We therefore overrule Hale\u2019s 15th proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">{\u00b6 150} In his 16th proposition of law, Hale contends that flaws in the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion invalidate his death sentence. Hale\u2019s principal claim is that the trial court failed to weigh the mitigating factors <em>collectively </em>against the aggravating circumstances. See <em>State v. Bays </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 15, 30, 716 N.E.2d 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">{\u00b6 151} In analyzing Hale\u2019s history, character, and background evidence, the trial court stated that the evidence deserved \u201csome weight\u201d but that its weight was \u201cnot <em>sufficient on its own </em>to overcome the Aggravating Circumstance.\u201d (Emphasis added.) However, the court later stated that the love and support of Hale\u2019s family would not be considered under the R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) catchall provision because \u201cthe Court previously considered this factor in mitigation and gave it some weight when the Court considered the Defendant\u2019s Character, Background and History.\u201d It appears from this passage that the trial court was trying to avoid giving double weight to the love and support of Hale\u2019s family and that the court was weighing history, character, and background together with the other factors. Thus, it is not clear that the trial court failed to weigh the mitigating circumstances collectively. Even if the trial court did make this mistake, our independent review will cure it. See <em>Bays, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 30-31, 716 N.E.2d 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 152} Hale also faults the trial judge for relying on Curtiss Jones\u2019s expert opinion on blood-spatter evidence to support its finding that Green did not sexually assault Hale. This claim essentially duplicates Hale\u2019s tenth proposition of law, which we have already rejected, and which we now reject again.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 153} Next, Hale contends that the trial court \u201cimproperly diminished\u201d the mitigating weight of his adjustment to prison. However, a trial court need not accept mitigating factors at the defendant\u2019s proposed valuation; their weight is for the trial court to determine. <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 171, 555 N.E.2d 293. See also <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 193, 631 N.E.2d 124; <em>State v. Wiles </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 91, 571 N.E.2d 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">{\u00b6 154} Finally, Hale contends that the trial court failed to explain why the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors. We find that the opinion as a whole adequately explains this issue. The trial court explained that Hale\u2019s history, character, and background had some weight, but \u201cthere was also testimony concerning aspects of [Hale\u2019s] family life that were normal.\u201d The court further stated that Hale\u2019s adjustment to prison deserved \u201cminimal\u201d weight because of his pattern of escalating criminal behavior, culminating in murder. The court also explained why no other mitigating factors deserved any weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>{\u00b6 155} In any case, \u201cinadequate explanations of the weighing process do not constitute reversible error because any such error may be readily cured by this court\u2019s independent review.\u201d <em>State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 533, 684 N.E.2d 47. Hale\u2019s 16th proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">IX. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">{\u00b6 156} In his 19th proposition of law, Hale accuses the prosecutors of misconduct. We will also consider section (G) of Hale\u2019s eighth proposition of law, which duplicates portions of Hale\u2019s 19th proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">A. Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">{\u00b6 157} Hale contends that the state failed to afford timely discovery of the felony records of certain prosecution witnesses. See Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(a). However, Hale fails to explain how he was prejudiced. In each instance, the information was disclosed before the defense cross-examined the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">{\u00b6 158} Hale also contends that the state failed to timely disclose evidence regarding Hale\u2019s financial transactions. However, as Hale concedes, the trial court imposed a sanction on the state for this lapse. The trial court limited the state\u2019s financial evidence to that involving Hale\u2019s financial condition at the time of the murder, while excluding evidence involving bounced checks and identity theft by Hale \u2014 evidence holding greater potential for prejudice. Discovery sanctions are within the trial court\u2019s discretion, <em>Parson, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 445, 6 OBR 485, 453 N.E.2d 689, and Hale does not show that the judge abused his discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">{\u00b6 159} Hale\u2019s other discovery-related claims duplicate claims made in Hale\u2019s first and eighth propositions of law, which we have overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">B. Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">{\u00b6 160} Hale accuses the prosecutors of \u201cplant[ing] prejudicial information in the jurors\u2019 minds\u201d during voir dire. During general voir dire, the prosecutor asked the panel about familiarity with firearms, and when one juror mentioned owning a derringer, the prosecutor asked how many bullets a derringer holds. He further asked the panel members whether any of them had ever moved or carried a person larger than themselves. Additionally, he asked the panel members to remember the most traumatic event in their lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">{\u00b6 161} Each of these questions related to issues raised at trial. The trial judge has discretion as to the scope of voir dire, and Hale does not demonstrate that the judge abused his discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">C. Hearsay</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">{\u00b6 162} Hale points to four instances in which the prosecutor presented hearsay. However, in three instances, the defense did not object, thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>waiving any issue. In a fourth (the dollar value of Green\u2019s jewelry), an objection was sustained, and the jury never heard the testimony. An appellant cannot predicate error on objections the trial court sustained. <em>Viox v. Weinberg, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 79, 2006-Ohio-5075, 861 N.E.2d 909, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">D. Leading Questions</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">{\u00b6 163} Hale lists 26 leading questions the prosecutor asked on direct examination. In 23 instances, the defense did not make a timely objection, so any issue pertaining to those questions is waived. In three instances, the defense did interpose timely objections. However, it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to allow leading questions on direct examination. <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 185, 190, 616 N.E.2d 909. Hale makes no attempt to explain how the trial court abused its discretion in overruling his objections. Nor does he explain why it was prosecutorial misconduct for the prosecutor to engage in conduct that the trial court had discretion to allow and did allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">E. Victim Impact</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">{\u00b6 164} Hale claims that the prosecutor introduced victim-impact evidence and argument in the guilt phase. In one instance, the defense failed to object, waiving the issue. In two instances, objections were sustained. As already noted, an appellant cannot predicate error on objections that the trial court sustained. <em>Viox, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 79, 2006-Ohio-5075, 861 N.E.2d 909, \u00b6 36. The rest of this claim duplicates section (C) of Hale\u2019s eighth proposition of law, which we have rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">F. \u201cIrrelevant\u201d and \u201cInflammatory\u201d Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">{\u00b6 165} Hale claims that the prosecutor introduced irrelevant and inflammatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">{\u00b6 166} First, Lashayla Hale testified that Hale had once told her that he had a gun and felt like shooting his mother\u2019s ex-boyfriend. (The prosecutor did not deliberately elicit the part about shooting the ex-boyfriend.) The trial court initially overruled a defense objection. The next day, the defense moved for a mistrial. The trial court offered to consider giving a curative instruction instead. However, for tactical reasons, the defense declined to request an instruction. Thus, Hale \u201ccannot now complain that none was given.\u201d <em>State v. Davie </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 311, 322, 686 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">{\u00b6 167} Second, the prosecutor asked Lashayla, over objection, whether Hale had a drinking problem. This question was irrelevant to the guilt phase, but the error was harmless in view of the overwhelming evidence of Hale\u2019s guilt. In two other instances in which Hale objected at trial to questions asked of Lashayla, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>objections were sustained. See <em>Viox, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 79, 2006-Ohio-5075, 861 N.E.2d 909, at \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">{\u00b6 168} Third, the prosecutor asked Sergeant Baird about Hale\u2019s admission that he disposed of the gun, Green\u2019s clothing, and Green\u2019s shoulder bag. On objection, the prosecutor withdrew the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">{\u00b6 169} The prosecutor\u2019s question violated the trial court\u2019s order imposing discovery sanctions. (See discussion of section (A) of Hale\u2019s eighth proposition of law.) However, the disposal of the shoulder bag was neither irrelevant nor inflammatory. In any event, at trial, Hale did not cite the irrelevant and inflammatory nature of the question as grounds for his objection, so this claim is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">{\u00b6 170} Finally, Hale claims the prosecutor made inflammatory comments about the evidence. The prosecutor referred to the items Hale had purchased to clean up the murder scene as the \u201cmurder scene clean-up kit.\u201d He also asked Sergeant Pestak whether a hat found in Hale\u2019s baggage had \u201cthree rough cut holes in it that would approximate if someone tried to wear it as a mask, two eye holes and a mouth hole.\u201d However, the defense did not object to these questions, so this issue is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">{\u00b6 171} The prosecutor also referred to Hale\u2019s confession as his \u201cmea culpa\u201d and \u201chis two-hour long considered statement.\u201d Objections to these comments were sustained; hence, there was no error. <em>Viox, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 79, 2006-Ohio-5075, 861 N.E.2d 909, at \u00b6 36. The defense did not request curative instructions in either case, thus waiving any claim to such instructions. <em>Davie, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 322, 686 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">G. Speculative Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">{\u00b6 172} Hale claims that Detective Grida gave testimony that was speculative, unreliable, and outside his personal knowledge. See Evid.R. 602 (witness may not testify to matters outside his personal knowledge).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">{\u00b6 173} Grida testified that police believed that Hale had help moving Green\u2019s body because, given the route taken and the body\u2019s size, there would have been more abrasions on the outer garbage bag if only one person had dragged it. Hale\u2019s objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">{\u00b6 174} This testimony may have been admissible as lay opinion under Evid.R. 701, as it was rationally based on Grida\u2019s perceptions and helpful to a clear understanding of a fact in issue. However, the state does not argue the point. In any event, given the overwhelming evidence of Hale\u2019s guilt, any error in admitting this testimony was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">{\u00b6 175} Grida also testified about how blood may have gotten onto the wall of Room 231 and expressed an opinion that the lodge employees who found the body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>could not have moved it. The defense did not object to this testimony, so any issue is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">{\u00b6 176} Hale also claims that Sergeant Pestak testified about matters outside his personal knowledge. Pestak testified that he \u201cassume[d]\u201d that Green\u2019s family last saw him on June 20 or 21, 2004. Pestak also identified a page in Green\u2019s receipt book and testified, \u201c[I]t\u2019s signed by, Pm guessing it\u2019s signed Douglas Green.\u201d These matters had little or no importance to the case, and any error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">H. Improper Rebuttal</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">{\u00b6 177} Johnny Smith, testifying about his 1998 rape accusation against Green, stated on direct examination that he had not been consulted about the plea bargain that reduced the charge to misdemeanor assault. On cross-examination, Smith admitted that the prosecutor\u2019s office had contacted him and that he had approved the plea bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">{\u00b6 178} On rebuttal, the state called Michael Nolan, the assistant prosecutor who had handled the 1998 case. Nolan confirmed that he had discussed the proposed plea bargain with Smith and that Smith had consented to it. Hale contends that Nolan\u2019s testimony violated Evid.R. 616(C), which states: \u201cIf offered for the sole purpose of impeaching a witness\u2019s testimony, extrinsic evidence of contradiction is inadmissible\u201d unless permitted by Evid.R. 608(A), 609, 613, 616(A), or 616(B), or by the hearsay exception regarding learned treatises.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">{\u00b6 179} But Hale did not object to Nolan\u2019s testimony at trial. Hence, this issue is waived, absent plain error. Nolan\u2019s testimony was not prejudicial in the least; Johnny Smith had already admitted on cross-examination that he had agreed to the plea bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">I. Victim\u2019s Family</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">{\u00b6 180} At one point during trial, one of the prosecutors talked with Green\u2019s relatives in the courtroom. Hale claims that this conduct somehow constituted an emotional appeal to the jury. But there is nothing improper in a prosecutor\u2019s speaking to the victim\u2019s family, and Hale\u2019s claim regarding the effect on the jury is speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">J. Guilt-Phase Closing Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">{\u00b6 181} Hale claims that several comments in the prosecutor\u2019s argument misrepresented evidence, shifted the burden of proof, or were inflammatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">{\u00b6 182} The prosecutor said that Hale had \u201cset up the meeting place\u201d with Green on the day of the murder. This statement was not supported by evidence. However, a defense objection was sustained, so the trial court did not err. <em>Viox, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 79, 2006-Ohio-5075, 861 N.E.2d 909, at \u00b6 36. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>defense did not request a curative instruction, so any error in the trial court\u2019s failure to give one is waived. <em>Davie, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 322, 686 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">{\u00b6 183} Hale claims that the prosecutor misrepresented evidence by stating that Hale \u201chad a gun in that room, Room 260 on June 21st, 2004.\u201d A defense objection was overruled. Hale argues that the evidence \u2014 i.e., Hale\u2019s statement\u2014 showed that Green owned the gun. But the prosecutor\u2019s comment referred to Hale\u2019s <em>possession </em>of the gun, which was undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b6 184} The prosecutor also said that at the time Hale set up his meeting with Green, he \u201cknew he had to be out [of the lodge] by the 22nd.\u201d That inference is a reasonable one based on the evidence. Lodge records, authenticated and explained by the lodge\u2019s owner, showed that Hale checked into the lodge for seven days\u2019 tenancy on June 8, 2004, and renewed his tenancy for another seven days on June 15, to expire on June 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">{\u00b6 185} The prosecutor referred to certain facts as \u201cundisputed\u201d: that Green was a 47-year-old husband and father, that phone records showed that Hale had called Green, that the Underground Railroad was closed on Mondays, and that Hale stole and used Green\u2019s credit card. Objections to these statements were overruled. These references were not improper. They were directed not toward the defendant\u2019s silence, but toward the strength of the state\u2019s case. <em>State v. Ferguson </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 160, 5 OBR 380, 450 N.E.2d 265, paragraph one of the syllabus. See also <em>State v. Webb </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 325, 328-329, 638 N.E.2d 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">{\u00b6 186} The prosecutor said that Hale\u2019s \u201cpicking up the pen with his left hand [when signing the <em>Miranda </em>waiver] was a lie.\u201d A defense objection was sustained, however, so no error occurred. <em>Viox, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 79, 2006-Ohio-5075, 861 N.E.2d 909, at \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">{\u00b6 187} The prosecutor asked \u201cwhat became of\u2019 the gun that Hale told his sister Lashayla he had. A defense objection was sustained. The prosecutor then asked, \u201cWhere is it?\u201d The trial court overruled a defense objection. Hale argues that the prosecutor\u2019s question improperly shifted the burden of proof onto him. We disagree. \u201cThe prosecution is not prevented from commenting upon the failure of the defense to offer evidence in support of its case.\u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 16, 20, 23 OBR 13, 490 N.E.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">{\u00b6 188} Hale claims that the prosecutor misrepresented \u201c[r]oom logs showing when Hale came and went,\u201d but Hale does not explain how the prosecutor misrepresented the room logs.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">{\u00b6 189} Finally, the prosecutor asked whether Hale\u2019s acts showed him to be a \u201cperson worthy of compassion\u201d or \u201ca person * * * [who] wasn\u2019t capable of showing concern for the person who was decomposing back in Room 231.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Defense objections were sustained. No error occurred. <em>Viox, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 79, 2006-Ohio-5075, 861 N.E.2d 909, at \u00b6 36. Hale complains that the trial court gave no curative instruction, but Hale did not request one. Thus, his complaint about the lack of an instruction is waived. <em>Davie, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 322, 686 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">K. Disparaging Defense Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">{\u00b6 190} Outside the jury\u2019s presence, the prosecutor accused defense counsel of acting in bad faith, trying to \u201ccreate error\u201d and to \u201cset up\u201d an ineffective-assistance claim. Hale contends that these statements \u201cimproperly chilled the defense\u201d and \u201cstifle[d] defense counsel\u2019s arguments.\u201d Nothing in the record supports Hale\u2019s speculation. If anything, the record suggests that the vigor of defense counsel\u2019s advocacy was unabated throughout the trial. Nor does Hale cite any authority for the proposition that such remarks, made outside the jury\u2019s presence, amount to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">{\u00b6 191} While approaching the bench to argue a defense objection, the prosecutor expressed the opinion that the objecting counsel was \u201cout of [his] mind.\u201d Such a remark, made in front of the jury, would have been improper; an attorney may not disparage opposing counsel for making an objection. See <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 406, 613 N.E.2d 203. However, nothing in the record shows that the jury could or did hear the prosecutor\u2019s remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">{\u00b6 192} During the penalty phase, the prosecutor asked Dr. Fabian, the defense psychologist, whether he had ever worked for the county public defender\u2019s office. A motion for mistrial was denied. Hale fails to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a mistrial. See generally <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 182, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343 (grant or denial of mistrial is within trial court\u2019s discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">L. Penalty-Phase Cross-Examination</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">{\u00b6 193} The prosecutor asked Dr. Fabian whether it was true that mitigating factors \u201ccan occur in individuals within the same family and they don\u2019t act out * * * in a criminal sense.\u201d This method was a proper way to highlight the fact that a bad upbringing does not necessarily cause criminal behavior. See <em>State v. Hanna, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, 767 N.E.2d 678, \u00b698; <em>State v. Newton, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 13, 2006-Ohio-81, 840 N.E.2d 593, \u00b6 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">{\u00b6 194} In cross-examining Dr. Fabian, the prosecutor raised the possibility that Hale might escape from prison. A defense objection was sustained. The defense specifically asked that no curative instruction be given at that time. The trial court offered to give one later if asked to do so. However, the defense never made any such request. Hence, no reversible error exists. <em>Viox, </em>169 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>App.3d 79, 2006-Ohio-5075, 861 N.E.2d 909, at \u00b6 36; <em>Davie, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 322, 686 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">{\u00b6 195} In two other instances, defense objections were also sustained at trial. The prosecutor asked Dr. Fabian whether he was \u201cfamiliar with the Ohio prison riots that resulted in guard fatalities\u201d and asked: \u201cSo the mere presence or fact of a mitigation evaluation or report does not in and of itself prove the existence of mitigation in that person\u2019s background?\u201d The trial court did not allow Fabian to answer either question. Thus, no error was committed. <em>Viox, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 79, 2006-Ohio-5075, 861 N.E.2d 909, at \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">M. Penalty-Phase Closing Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">{\u00b6 196} First, Hale complains that the prosecutor stated in closing argument that \u201cthe attention and the sympathy that rightly should flow to that victim sometimes becomes perversely focused on the defendant.\u201d This statement was improper, because sympathy may play no role in the jury\u2019s decision. However, the trial court sustained a defense objection, and it had previously instructed the jury: \u2018You must not be influenced by any consideration of sympathy or prejudice.\u201d Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s comment was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">{\u00b6 197} Second, Hale complains that the prosecutor displayed Green\u2019s photo to the jury during argument. As the photo was in evidence, however, it was not improper to display it to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">{\u00b6 198} Third, the prosecutor argued that Hale had \u201cno remorse and has no concern.\u201d Hale claims this was improper because he did not present remorse as a mitigating factor. See <em>DePew, </em>38 Ohio St.3d at 289-290, 528 N.E.2d 542. But Hale did raise remorse as an issue by expressing remorse in his unsworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">{\u00b6 199} Fourth, the prosecutor argued that during the robbery, Hale \u201cmade a choice to cock the gun, shoot him twice. * * * Reload that gun, and shoot him twice more * * Hale claims this narrative was improper because the circumstances of the murder cannot be used as aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">{\u00b6 200} However, the prosecutor did not state that the circumstances of the murder were \u201caggravating circumstances.\u201d See <em>Wogenstahl, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 355-356, 662 N.E.2d 311. The prosecutor\u2019s argument dealt with prior calculation and design, which were elements <em>of </em>the felony-murder specification and which were therefore relevant to the sentencing. The existence of prior calculation and design had further relevance to this case because it rebutted the defense claim that Green had provoked his own murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">{\u00b6 201} Fifth, the prosecutor stated that the issue was whether the mitigating evidence lessened Hale\u2019s \u201cmoral culpability.\u201d This statement was erroneous. See <em>State v. Jackson, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, \u00b6 115-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>116. But cf. <em>Penry v. Lynaugh </em>(1989), 492 U.S. 302, 319, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (punishment \u201cshould be directly related to the personal culpability of the criminal defendant\u201d), overruled on other grounds, <em>Atkins v. Virginia </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335. However, Hale did not object, and the comment was not plain error. See <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">{\u00b6 202} Hale\u2019s remaining claims of improper argument involve statements to which he did not object at trial. Hale\u2019s failure to object waived each of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 203} Hale\u2019s 19th proposition of law and section (G) of his eighth proposition of law are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">X. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">{\u00b6 204} In his 20th proposition of law, Hale claims that he received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel. To establish ineffective assistance, Hale must show (1) deficient performance by counsel, i.e., performance falling below an objective standard of reasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the proceeding\u2019s result would have been different. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">{\u00b6 205} Hale divides his numerous ineffective-assistance claims into four categories: voir dire, guilt phase, penalty phase, and failures to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">{\u00b6 206} <em>Voir Dire: </em>Hale contends that his counsel were ineffective because they did not challenge jurors No. 4 and 5 for cause. Hale claims these jurors were automatic-death-penalty jurors. However, the case for so regarding them was weak, as we explain above in discussing Hale\u2019s seventh proposition of law. It was therefore not ineffective assistance to fail to challenge them.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">{\u00b6 207} Hale contends that his counsel should have challenged juror No. 7 for cause because the juror knew the victim. Juror No. 7 remembered Green as an entertainer who had been known locally when the juror was in her teens. However, juror No. 7 \u201cdidn\u2019t know him personally.\u201d Green was a \u201cfriend of a friend of a friend.\u201d The juror\u2019s interaction with Green was limited to saying \u201cHello\u201d or \u201c[H]ow you doing?\u201d About three years before the trial, Green had sung at the wedding of the juror\u2019s brother, but the juror had been ill and did not remember him well. Juror No. 7 stated that her acquaintance with Green would not affect her ability to be fair and impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">{\u00b6 208} \u201cThere is no constitutional prohibition against jurors simply knowing the parties involved or having knowledge of the case.\u201d <em>McQueen v. Scroggy </em>(C.A.6, 1996), 99 F.3d 1302, 1320. Juror No. 7 testified that her slight acquain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>tance with Green would not affect her impartiality, and her voir dire gives no reason to doubt this. The relationship was distant and casual, not \u201cclose and ongoing\u201d as in <em>Wolfe v. Brigano </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 232 F.3d 499, 502. See <em>Miller v. Francis </em>(C.A.6, 2001), 269 F.3d 609, 618 (distinguishing <em>Wolfe).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">{\u00b6 209} Moreover, the defense had strong tactical reasons for wanting juror No. 7 to sit on the jury. Her religious beliefs emphasized that \u201cthou shall not judge,\u201d and she believed her religion would deem it a sin to vote for a death sentence. In fact, for this very reason, the <em>prosecution </em>repeatedly (but unsuccessfully) challenged juror No. 7 for cause. Accordingly, defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge juror No. 7 was neither deficient nor prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b6 210} Hale contends that his counsel should have challenged juror No. 1 for cause because she could not fairly consider all three possible life sentences. Juror No. 1 stated that she would be open to a sentence of life without parole, but \u201cprobably would be against\u201d anything less.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">{\u00b6 211} But juror No. 1 also had strong leanings against capital punishment and thus was a desirable juror for the defense. She said in her questionnaire that the death penalty should be used only if there was \u201cabsolutely no doubt\u201d of guilt. A death sentence \u201cwould be very hard for [her] to agree to.\u201d Her statements also reveal her strong sense of the seriousness and finality of the decision: \u201c[I]t\u2019s so final that that\u2019s really a big decision to make.\u201d \u201c[I]t\u2019s an incredibly serious undertaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">{\u00b6 212} In the penalty phase of a capital case, counsel\u2019s primary objective is to avoid a death sentence. Obtaining a life sentence with the possibility of parole, as opposed to without it, is a secondary consideration. Thus, competent counsel could make a reasonable tactical decision to accept a juror whose answers indicated a strong reluctance to impose death, even though that reluctance may have come packaged with a predisposition against parole. Juror No. 1 was such a juror, and Hale\u2019s counsel did not perform deficiently by accepting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">{\u00b6 213} Hale contends that defense counsel should have tried to rehabilitate prospective jurors No. 8, 28, and 41, each of whom was excused as unwilling to consider a death sentence. Hale\u2019s claim of prejudice is necessarily speculative, because we cannot know whether these jurors <em>could </em>have been rehabilitated. Hale\u2019s trial counsel saw and heard the jurors respond to the voir dire questions; we did not. We are therefore in no position to second-guess counsel on this point. See <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 143, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">{\u00b6 214} Hale claims his trial counsel misstated the law to the trial judge during voir dire. Trial counsel stated that in the penalty phase, the jury must initially consider whether the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors. But Hale\u2019s trial counsel correctly stated the law. See <em>State v. Lindsey </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 479, 487, 721 N.E.2d 995; <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>162, 661 N.E.2d 1030 (when jury cannot unanimously agree on a death sentence, it must move on to consider which life sentence is appropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">{\u00b6 215} There would have been no prejudice to Hale even if counsel\u2019s statement had been incorrect. No jurors were present when counsel made the statement at issue, and Hale makes no claim that the trial court gave incorrect jury instructions as a result of counsel\u2019s alleged error.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 216} Defense counsel did make an incorrect statement during the voir dire of juror No. 30. Both the trial court and defense counsel incorrectly referred to the mitigating factors outweighing the aggravating circumstances. However, in the penalty phase, the trial court correctly instructed the jury that the state had the burden of proving that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, Hale was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">{\u00b6 217} Citing <em>Turner v. Murray </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 28, 36-37, 106 S.Ct. 1683, 90 L.Ed.2d 27, Hale contends that his counsel performed deficiently by failing to question the jurors about racial bias. However, <em>Turner </em>has no application to this case. <em>Turner </em>holds that a capital defendant accused of an <em>interracial </em>murder is entitled, <em>upon request, </em>to have prospective jurors informed of the race of the victim and questioned concerning racial bias. But this case does not involve an interracial murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">{\u00b6 218} And <em>Turner </em>held only that the defense was <em>entitled </em>to engage in racial-bias inquiry, not that defense counsel <em>must </em>do so in order to effectively assist their client. We have recognized that \u201cthe actual decision to voir dire on racial prejudice is a choice best left to a capital defendant\u2019s counsel,\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 323, 327, 731 N.E.2d 645, and we normally defer to counsel\u2019s judgment on this question. Id. at 328, 731 N.E.2d 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">{\u00b6 219} We decline to deviate from that practice here. There was no discernible reason to ask about racial bias. This case did not involve an interracial murder, nor did the evidence raise any racial issues. In <em>State v. Watson </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 1, 13, 572 N.E.2d 97, we held that defense counsel\u2019s failure to examine racial attitudes on voir dire was not ineffective assistance, even though <em>Watson </em>did involve an interracial murder. Because the case did not involve any issue of \u201cracial confrontation,\u201d defense counsel \u201ccould have properly determined that the examination of jurors\u2019 racial views * * * would be unwise.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 328, 731 N.E.2d 645 (noting risks of examining racial prejudice on voir dire). Hence, it was neither deficient performance nor prejudicial for counsel not to ask racial-bias questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">{\u00b6 220} Hale contends that his counsel, during voir dire, failed to ensure that prospective jurors understood the meaning of aggravating circumstances. In essence, this issue recasts Hale\u2019s sixth proposition of law as an ineffective-counsel claim. However, because Hale does not contend that the penalty-phase instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>tions were incorrect, no reason exists to believe that the jurors actually seated at trial misunderstood the meaning of aggravating circumstances. Hale accordingly has faded to show the prejudice requisite to an ineffective-assistance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">{\u00b6 221} <em>Guilt </em>Phase: Hale claims his counsel were ineffective because they did not request funds for a crime-scene expert. According to Hale, such an expert could have rebutted the \u201cerroneous\u201d testimony of Curtiss Jones. This claim is conjectural. See <em>State v. Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 98. Hale also claims his counsel failed to perform a sufficient investigation. This claim is also speculative: nothing in the record shows the extent of counsel\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">{\u00b6 222} Hale claims his counsel erred by fading to call him to testify in his own behalf. Hale contends that, in a self-defense case, it can <em>never </em>be sound trial strategy to decline to present the defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">{\u00b6 223} No such blanket statement can be made. \u201cRepresentation is an art, and an act or omission that is unprofessional in one case may be sound or even brdliant in another.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. In this case, by relying on Hale\u2019s confession instead of his live testimony, Hale\u2019s counsel were able to present his story to the jury without subjecting him to cross-examination. In view of the many weaknesses in Hale\u2019s story, this defense strategy was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">{\u00b6 224} Hale also contends that introducing his written statement, instead of his live testimony, prejudiced him because the written statement mentioned that Hale had served 12 years in prison. Hale admits that had he testified, his felony conviction might have been introduced to impeach him. But he says that had he testified, he could have explained that he had been sexually abused in prison, thus explaining why he feared rape when he allegedly encountered Green nude on his bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">{\u00b6 225} But Hale ignores the fact that his written statement contains precisely the information that he claims only his live testimony could have provided. Hale\u2019s statement says: \u201cI not too long ago served 12 long years in prison <em>and had fought off unwanted advances before. </em>I was prepared in prison though. You expected this type of thing. No way in hell did I expect this out here.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, Hale\u2019s argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">{\u00b6226} Hale claims that his counsel, by arguing that Hale did not commit aggravated robbery by taking Green\u2019s property after killing him, undermined their credibility with the jury. This claim is inherently speculative and finds no support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">{\u00b6 227} Hale contends that counsel, in cross-examining Sergeant Baird, \u201cimproperly emphasized\u201d Baird\u2019s claim that he had told Hale that Green might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>bisexual, thus planting the idea of a sexual assault in Hale\u2019s head. But the cross-examination was a matter of debatable trial tactics, which do not constitute ineffective assistance. See <em>State v. Clayton </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 49, 16 O.O.3d 35, 402 N.E.2d 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">{\u00b6 228} Hale contends that counsel were ineffective because they reviewed records related to state witnesses while the witnesses were testifying. However, Hale fails to identify any resulting prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 229} Hale contends that defense counsel, after persuading the trial court to exclude evidence of his bounced checks, opened the door to such evidence by raising the subject on cross-examination of Sergeant Pestak. Defense cross-examination of Pestak similarly opened the door to testimony about Hale\u2019s excluded oral statements to police. However, these alleged errors were not prejudicial in light of overwhelming evidence of Hale\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 230} <em>Penalty Phase: </em>After the guilt-phase verdicts, the trial court released the jurors from sequestration and stated that they were \u201cdischarged.\u201d However, the court asked them to remain for further instructions. Those instructions informed the jurors that they were \u201cstill jurors on this case\u201d and that they must continue to obey the court\u2019s instructions not to discuss the case with anyone and not to watch newscasts or read newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 231} Hale contends that because the jurors had been \u201cdischarged\u201d after the guilt phase, his trial counsel should have requested a voir dire of the jury before the penalty phase to ensure that they had not discussed the case in the interim. See generally <em>Remmer v. United States </em>(1954), 347 U.S. 227, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654. However, a <em>Remmer </em>hearing is required only \u201cwhen the trial court learns of \u2018private communication, contact, or tampering * * * with a juror during a trial about the matter pending before the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 210, 2006-Ohio-6404, 858 N.E.2d 1144, \u00b6 263, quoting <em>Remmer, </em>347 U.S. at 229, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654. In this case, there was no allegation that any such contact occurred. Nor does the trial court\u2019s use of the word \u201cdischarged\u201d justify the supposition that the jurors discussed the case between the guilt and penalty phases. There was thus no reason for counsel to ask for a voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 232} Hale contends that his counsel did not adequately investigate mitigating factors or prepare their penalty-phase case. He claims that more witnesses could have been called, but this argument is speculative, and even if Hale is correct, it would not necessarily indicate that counsel\u2019s investigation was inadequate. Similarly, Hale criticizes the testimony of Dr. Fabian, the defense psychologist, claiming that counsel failed to \u201cadequately supervise and direct\u201d Fabian. This argument is also speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 233} <em>Failures to Object: </em>Finally, Hale complains that his trial counsel failed to object to numerous alleged errors. Each of Hale\u2019s claims recasts one of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>substantive propositions of law into an ineffective-assistance claim. However, \u201c[t]he failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831. In our view, none of Hale\u2019s claims of error is so compelling that competent counsel would have been obligated to object to them at trial, nor were they prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">{\u00b6 234} Hale\u2019s 20th proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">XI. Cumulative Error</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">{\u00b6 235} In his 21st proposition of law, Hale contends that his trial was \u201creplete with\u201d errors whose cumulative effect was prejudicial. However, he specifically cites only three claimed errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">{\u00b6 236} First, he claims that defense counsel were not permitted to participate in the in camera inspection of witness statements under Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g), conduct that prevented him from exposing an inconsistency between Sergeant Baird\u2019s report and his trial testimony. However, there was no such inconsistency, as we concluded in discussing Hale\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">{\u00b6 237} Second, he claims that his ability to present a defense was hindered by the trial court\u2019s limitation on Johnny Smith\u2019s testimony. But the trial court did not err by limiting Smith\u2019s testimony, as we explained in discussing section (F) of Hale\u2019s eighth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">{\u00b6 238} Third, he claims that his ability to present a defense was also hindered by Michael Nolan\u2019s improper rebuttal testimony. But Hale waived this claimed error at trial, as we stated in our discussion of Hale\u2019s 19th proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">{\u00b6 239} Thus, of the alleged errors Hale cites, two were not errors at all, and the third was waived. Hale\u2019s 21st proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">XII. Settled Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">{\u00b6 240} In his 22nd proposition of law, Hale attacks the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes. His claims are summarily overruled on authority of <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v.

Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus (authorizing summary disposition of settled issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>XIII. Noncapital Sentencing Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">A. <em>Blakely-Foster </em>Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">{\u00b6 241} In his second proposition of law, Hale contends that his sentences on the noncapital offenses should be vacated, and his case remanded for resentencing on those offenses, pursuant to our decision in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, following <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403. See also <em>State v. Elmore, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-6207, 857 N.E.2d 547. The state agrees that Hale\u2019s case should be remanded for resentencing on the noncapital crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">{\u00b6 242} However, Hale was sentenced on July 18, 2005. Although <em>Blakely </em>had been decided the previous year, Hale did not raise a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the trial court. Thus, he has forfeited this claim. See <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 31; <em>State v. Frazier, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 139, 2007-Ohio-5048, 873 N.E.2d 1263, \u00b6205.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">{\u00b6 243} The noncapital sentences imposed in this case were not plain error. \u201cNothing in the record suggests that the noncapital sentencing would have been different if [the defendant] had been sentenced in accordance with <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Foster.\u201d Frazier </em>at \u00b6 208. Accordingly, we overrule Hale\u2019s second proposition of law and, for the same reason, deny Hale\u2019s motion to remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">B. Court Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">{\u00b6 244} The trial court imposed court costs on Hale in the amount of $2,826.52. Hale did not then object. Now, in his 17th proposition of law, he claims that he is indigent and that assessing costs violates the \u201cspirit\u201d of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">{\u00b6 245} Hale has waived this issue by failing to object. See <em>State v. Threatt, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 277, 2006-Ohio-905, 843 N.E.2d 164, \u00b623 (indigent defendant\u2019s motion for waiver of costs must be made at time of sentencing). There was no plain error. <em>State v. White, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 580, 2004-Ohio-5989, 817 N.E.2d 393, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus, holds that costs must be assessed against, and may be collected from, indigent defendants, and Hale cites no authority to support his \u201cspirit-of-the-Eighth-Amendment\u201d claim. Hale\u2019s 17th proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">XIV. Independent Sentence Review</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">{\u00b6 246} In his 18th proposition of law, Hale contends that the aggravating circumstances in his case do not outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. This claim invokes our duty under R.C. 2929.05 to independently review his sentence of death. We now proceed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Aggravating Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">{\u00b6 247} Under R.C. 2929.05(A), we must determine whether the evidence supports the finding of the aggravating circumstances. The sole aggravating circumstance in this case is the robbery-murder specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">{\u00b6248} The evidence easily supports Hale\u2019s conviction of this specification. Hale admitted that he himself shot Green; thus, Hale was the principal offender in the aggravated murder. The evidence of aggravated robbery is clear: Hale was arrested in possession of Green\u2019s SUV, and he used Green\u2019s Visa card after the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">{\u00b6249} Hale claims that the evidence establishes the following mitigating factors: defendant\u2019s history, character, and background; that the victim induced or facilitated the offense, R.C. 2929.04(B)(1); duress, coercion, or strong provocation, R.C. 2929.04(B)(2); remorse; the love and support of his family; and the likelihood that Hale will successfully adapt to prison. R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) (other factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">History, Character, and Background</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">{\u00b6 250} In the penalty phase, Hale introduced testimony from his three sisters and from Dr. John Fabian, a forensic and clinical psychologist. Hale also made an unsworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">{\u00b6 251} The defense witnesses testified extensively regarding Hale\u2019s family and childhood. Hale was born in 1968, the eldest of four children. His father, who worked for LTV Steel for 30 years, was described by Hale\u2019s sister Latisha as pretty stable. Hale\u2019s mother worked for 19 years for the Cleveland Catholic Diocese. However, she had a drinking problem and was unfaithful to her husband. These issues caused conflict in their marriage, sometimes leading to physical violence between the spouses. According to Dr. Fabian, Hale\u2019s father also had a drinking problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">{\u00b6 252} Hale had an unusually close relationship with his mother, who treated him less as a child than as a \u201cbest friend\u201d and confidant. According to Dr. Fabian, some of her confidences involved things \u201cthat perhaps he was too young to understand or to hear about.\u201d Hale usually sided with his mother against his father, conflict, that sometimes led to physical confrontations between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">{\u00b6 253} When Hale was about seven, his mother left his father. She took Hale and his sister Laquatia to California. Initially, they stayed with Mrs. Hale\u2019s sister and her husband in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. According to Laquatia, an older female cousin sexually molested Hale during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>{\u00b6 254} Hale was exposed to a violent environment during this period. There were conflicts among the adults, with Mrs. Hale\u2019s sister accusing her of sleeping with her husband. Eventually, the Hales moved out and went to live in \u201cthe projects.\u201d According to Laquatia, Mrs. Hale \u201chad * * * different men in and out\u201d during this time. According to Hale, his mother attempted suicide twice while in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">{\u00b6 255} After about a year, Hale\u2019s mother returned to Cleveland and to her husband. Hale\u2019s father forgave her and took her back into his household. Hale\u2019s mother stopped drinking, spent more time with her children and became \u201cnurturing.\u201d During this period, Hale \u201ccalmed down,\u201d became more outgoing, and did well in school. Life was \u201cbasically decent\u201d and \u201ckind of peaceful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">{\u00b6 256} Hale\u2019s life changed for the worse when he was about 13. His mother resumed drinking, fighting with her husband, and seeing other men. Hale began associating with delinquent peers, cutting school, stealing, and rebelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">{\u00b6 257} Hale\u2019s sisters all testified that they love him. They credited him with numerous good qualities: intelligence, creativity and artistic ability, the ability to plan and to solve problems, a positive attitude, enthusiasm, willingness to work, compassion, and \u201cbig dreams\u201d about helping the homeless. They described him as loving, gentle, pleasant, helpful, religious, a comforter, and a \u201cdefender\u201d who protected his sisters. They felt that after his release from prison, he had been trying to \u201ckeep straight,\u201d to \u201cget * * * on the right track.\u201d Laquatia testified that Hale assisted her with a mentoring program at her church.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">{\u00b6 258} Dr. Fabian, the defense psychologist, interviewed Hale four times and also interviewed Hale\u2019s sisters. Dr. Fabian\u2019s opinion was that Hale\u2019s personality and background exhibit a number of risk factors associated with violent behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">{\u00b6 259} He divided these factors into four categories. \u201cIndividual factors\u201d were Hale\u2019s aggressive personality and antisocial attitudes. \u201cFamily factors\u201d included the instability of Hale\u2019s family, his early separation from a parent, \u201ccaregiver disruption,\u201d his parents\u2019 substance abuse, family conflict, and exposure to violence. \u201cSchool factors\u201d were Hale\u2019s academic failure and lack of commitment to school. \u201cPeer-related factors\u201d included Hale\u2019s growing up in a poor neighborhood where he was exposed to crime, weapons, and substance abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">{\u00b6 260} Dr. Fabian further opined that Hale has \u201cvery poor\u201d coping skills. He has poor judgment, difficulty tolerating stress, poor impulse control, and a tendency to misperceive events. He uses substance abuse and violence to cope.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">{\u00b6261} However, Fabian also believed that Hale\u2019s prison records showed adequate or good adjustment to prison. Hale obtained a GED in prison, took college courses, obtained counseling, and completed two programs for substance abuse. He became a counselor himself and also tutored illiterate prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>{\u00b6 262} Despite the stress of prison, Fabian testified that Hale had committed no \u201cviolent infractions\u201d during his 12-year incarceration. However, in his unsworn statement, Hale said that he did \u201ca lot of fighting\u201d during his first two years, resulting in \u201ca lot of hole time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">{\u00b6 263} Fabian also believed that Hale is unlikely to commit violent acts in prison. Fabian testified that life-sentenced inmates have rates of prison violence similar to the low rates of death-row inmates and \u201cmuch lower\u201d than those of \u201cgeneral offenders.\u201d He also noted the phenomenon of \u201cage burn-out\u201d: beginning between the ages of 35 and 40, an inmate\u2019s risk of violent behavior drops. (Hale was 37 when he was tried.)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">{\u00b6 264} Hale has no history of mental illness, and Fabian did not diagnose him as mentally ill. Fabian placed Hale\u2019s intelligence in the low-average-to-average range, making him \u201cbrighter than most capital offenders.\u201d Hale was not intoxicated at the time of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">{\u00b6 265} Hale\u2019s history, character, and background have some mitigating weight. Hale spent significant portions of his childhood in an unstable environment. But we have seldom given decisive weight to this factor. See, e.g., <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 48, 51-54, 765 N.E.2d 334; <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 585-586, 605 N.E.2d 884; <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 41, 544 N.E.2d 895. Here, we find that it is entitled to minimal weight. Hale\u2019s father was stable and responsible. During most of Hale\u2019s childhood, his mother was neither stable nor responsible, but during the years when she had stopped drinking, even she managed to provide maternal nurturing.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Victim\u2019s Provocation or Inducement of the Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">{\u00b6 266} Hale\u2019s claims of victim inducement and provocation are both based on his allegation that Green sexually assaulted him. That allegation, we find, is not worthy of belief. Hale\u2019s version of the shooting was both internally inconsistent and inconsistent with the evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">{\u00b6 267} In his statement, Hale claimed that he fired the first two shots while Green\u2019s head was in contact with Hale\u2019s crotch and Green had hold of Hale\u2019s left wrist. But Hale also admitted that he shot Green with the gun in his <em>right </em>hand, and the autopsy showed that all four shots entered the <em>right </em>side of Green\u2019s head. This fact indicates that Green was facing either away from Hale <em>or </em>to Hale\u2019s right when Hale shot him. Similarly, the presence of gunshot residue on Green\u2019s <em>right </em>hand does not make sense if, as Hale claimed, Green was using that hand to hold Hale\u2019s <em>left </em>wrist at the time of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">{\u00b6 268} Hale further claimed that after the first two shots, Green was still trying to get up. This action was impossible. According to expert medical testimony, at least three of the four shots \u2014 and therefore at least one of the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>two shots \u2014 would have rendered Green unable to engage in any voluntary movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">{\u00b6 269} Hale claimed that he backed away from Green after firing the first two shots. But three of the four shots \u2014 and therefore at least one of the second two shots \u2014 were contact wounds. Hale never explained how he inflicted one or more contact wounds <em>while backing away </em>from Green, who (according to Hale) was lying on the floor at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">{\u00b6 270} Hale claimed that Green was at the foot of the bed when Hale first shot him. But police found a small, circular spot of blood on the headboard of the bed. According to forensic expert Curtiss Jones, the spot\u2019s origin was probably no more than three to four feet from the headboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">{\u00b6 271} Hale also claimed that he shot Green with Green\u2019s own gun. But when he threatened Green with that gun, he claimed, Green was unafraid because Green did not believe the gun was loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">{\u00b6 272} Finally, Hale claimed he and Green met at the Underground Railroad on June 21, 2004. But June 21 was a Monday, and the testimony of two witnesses, including the owner of the Underground Railroad, established that the Underground Railroad was closed on Mondays.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">{\u00b6 273} On the record before us, we find that no mitigating factor exists under R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) or (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Remorse</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">{\u00b6 274} Hale\u2019s expression of remorse is entitled to minimal weight at best. See <em>State v. Post </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 380, 394, 513 N.E.2d 754. Moreover, the sincerity of his remorse is questionable, inasmuch as he concocted a false story in order to blame his victim for the murder. See <em>State v. Wiles </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 93, 571 N.E.2d 97 (attempts to avoid responsibility may offset remorse). We find that remorse has no weight in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">Prospect of Adapting to Prison</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">{\u00b6 275} Hale\u2019s prospect of successfully adapting to prison is not a compelling mitigating factor, but it does carry some weight. See, e.g., <em>State v. Hand, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 378, 2006-Ohio-18, 840 N.E.2d 151, \u00b6 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">Other Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b268-15\">{\u00b6 276} No other mitigating factors apply. There is nothing mitigating in the nature and circumstances of the offense. Green was shot four times in the head at close range, a method that suggests a calculated, execution-style murder. See <em>Campbell, </em>95 Ohio St.3d at 51, 765 N.E.2d 334.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b269-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>William D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Jon W. Oebker, Blaise D. Thomas, and Jennifer A. Driscoll, Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ADm\">Timothy Young, Ohio Public Defender, Kelly L. Culshaw, Supervisor, Death Penalty Division, and Ruth L. Tkacz and Kimberly S. Rigby, Assistant Public Defenders, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">{\u00b6 277} Hale\u2019s mitigation adds up to little. We find that the robbery-murder aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">{\u00b6 278} The death sentence is also proportionate to death sentences we have approved in robbery-murder cases. See, e.g., <em>State v. Allen </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 626, 644, 653 N.E.2d 675; <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 42, 553 N.E.2d 576; <em>State v. Scott </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 92, 107, 26 OBR 79, 497 N.E.2d 55 (attempted robbery).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">{\u00b6 279} Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b269-9\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-12\">.
