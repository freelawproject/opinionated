Rance </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 632, 710 N.E.2d 699, and to clarify whether pursuant to-its holding and R.C. 2941.25, a defendant may be convicted and sentenced for two separate crimes arising out of two forms of the same offense based on a single criminal act \u2014 here, aggravated assault for stabbing one victim, one time.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">{\u00b6 2} Because R.C. 2903.12(A)(1) and (A)(2) set forth two means of committing the same offense both of which serve the same purpose \u2014 preventing physical harm to persons \u2014 we conclude that the General Assembly did not intend them to be separately punishable when the offenses result from a single act undertaken with a single animus. Therefore, separate convictions for aggravated assault in violation of R.C. 2903.12(A)(1) and (A)(2) are allied offenses of similar import when committed with a single animus. In this instance, Brown\u2019s two aggravated-assault convictions arise out of a single act \u2014 one stab wound to one victim; they are therefore committed with a single animus and are allied offenses of similar import, and she may be convicted of and sentenced for only one. The proper disposition of these offenses requires the trial court to merge one offense into the other for purposes of conviction and sentencing, as opposed to arbitrarily vacating one of the convictions. Accordingly, we remand the matter to the trial court with instructions to merge Brown\u2019s convictions and resentence her in accordance with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">{\u00b6 3} On April 4, 2005, defendant-appellee and cross-appellant, Jakeena Brown, and Kevin Johnson, her live-in boyfriend, got into an argument. After Johnson damaged Brown\u2019s truck by ripping the temporary tag off and feeding it to the dog, damaging the bumper, and breaking a window, Brown stabbed Johnson once in the abdomen with a serrated steak knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">{\u00b6 4} The Cuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted Brown on two counts of felonious assault and one count of domestic violence, and the matter proceeded to a jury trial. At the close of evidence, the trial court instructed the jury on the two counts of felonious assault, the corresponding lesser included offenses of aggravated assault, and the single count of domestic violence. The jury acquitted Brown of two counts of felonious assault, but found her guilty of both counts of aggravated assault as well as the domestic-violence count.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The trial court sentenced Brown to two years of community control for the aggravated-assault convictions. It also sentenced Brown to a six-month term in the county jail for the domestic-violence conviction. However, the court suspended the execution of the domestic-violence sentence and placed Brown on two years\u2019 probation to run concurrently with her community-control sentence for the aggravated assaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">{\u00b6 6} Brown appealed the convictions to the Eighth District Court of Appeals arguing, inter alia, that her aggravated-assault convictions were allied offenses of similar import that the trial court should have merged into a single conviction and sentence. <em>State v. Brown, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 87651, 2006-Ohio-6267, 2006 WL 3446238. The court found that the allied-offense analysis applies only to eases in which the defendant\u2019s conduct could be construed as constituting two or more offenses. Brown committed only one act of aggravated assault. Thus, her conviction on two counts violated double jeopardy. Id. at \u00b6 50-51. Therefore, the court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment with regard to the aggravated-assault convictions and remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to vacate both the finding of guilt and the sentence for one of the aggravated-assault convictions. Id. at \u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">{\u00b6 7} We accepted jurisdiction over propositions of law I and II of the state\u2019s appeal and proposition VI of Brown\u2019s cross-appeal on the constitutionality of the domestic-violence statute, held Brown\u2019s proposition for <em>State v. Carswell, </em>Warren App. No. CA2005-04-047, 2005-Ohio-6547, 2005 WL 3358882, and stayed the briefing schedule. <em>State v. Brown, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 1409, 2007-Ohio-2632, 867 N.E.2d 843. On July 25, 2007, we announced our decision in <em>Carswell, </em>upholding the constitutionality of R.C. 2919.25. <em>State v. Carswell, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 210, 2007-Ohio-3723, 871 N.E.2d 547. On October 4, 2007, we ordered the parties to brief the state\u2019s propositions of law. <em>State v. Brown, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 1424, 2007-Ohio-5264, 874 N.E.2d 540. In her brief, Brown conceded that if this court followed its recent decision in <em>Carswell, </em>it would reject the sole proposition of law advanced in her cross-appeal. Hence, we do not further address that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Arguments of the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">{\u00b6 8} The state asserts that pursuant to the test set forth in <em>State v. Rance, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 632, 710 N.E.2d 699, Brown\u2019s two convictions for aggravated assault do not constitute allied offenses of similar import because an abstract comparison of the alternate theories of aggravated assault set forth in R.C. 2903.12(A)(1) and (A)(2) reveals that the commission of one does not necessarily result in commission of the other. Therefore, the state argues that R.C. 2941.25, the multiple-count statute, permits Brown to be punished cumulatively. Alternatively, the state contends that if Brown\u2019s offenses do constitute allied offenses of similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>import, the proper remedy is merger of the offenses into a single conviction and sentence rather than the arbitrary dismissal of one of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">{\u00b6 9} In contrast, Brown argues that by placing several means of committing aggravated assault into a single Revised Code section, the legislature demonstrated its intent that those alternate means constitute allied offenses of similar import, even though they may not technically satisfy the elemental <em>Ranee </em>test. Brown further contends that the state\u2019s attempt to distinguish merger from dismissal of one of the counts amounts to a distinction without a difference because, with either method, the end result is a single conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Allied Offenses of Similar Import and Legislative Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">{\u00b6 10} The Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution prohibits (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction, and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>United States v. Halper </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 435, 440, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 104 L.Ed.2d 487, citing <em>North Carolina v. Pearce </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656. These double-jeopardy protections apply to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Benton v. Maryland </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 784, 786, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707; <em>State v. Tolbert </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 89, 90, 573 N.E.2d 617. Additionally, Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution provides, \u201cNo person shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">{\u00b6 11} The facts of this case involve the third double-jeopardy prohibition \u2014 the prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense. However, the Double Jeopardy Clause only prevents a sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended. <em>Rance, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 635, 710 N.E.2d 699, quoting <em>Missouri v. Hunter </em>(1983), 459 U.S. 359, 366, 103 S.Ct. 673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535, and citing <em>State v. Moss </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 515, 518, 23 O.O.3d 447, 433 N.E.2d 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">{\u00b6 12} The United States Supreme Court has held that the test for determining whether two offenses are the same for double-jeopardy purposes is \u201cwhether each offense requires proof of an element that the other does not.\u201d <em>Rance, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 634-635, 710 N.E.2d 699, citing <em>Blockburger v. United States </em>(1932), 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306. In <em>Ranee, </em>we found that the two-step test set forth in R.C. 2941.25, Ohio\u2019s multiple-count statute, answered both the constitutional and state statutory inquiries regarding the General Assembly\u2019s intent to permit cumulative punishments for the same conduct. Id. at 639, 710 N.E.2d 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 2941.25 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>{\u00b6 14} \u201c(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(B) Where the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar Mnd committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">{\u00b6 16} The legislative history of R.C. 2941.25 demonstrates that \u201c[t]he basic thrust of the section is to prevent 'shotgun\u2019 convictions.\u201d Legislative Service Commission Summary of Am.Sub.H.B. 511, The New Ohio Criminal Code (June 1973) 69. The summary states: \u201cFor example, a thief theoretically is guilty not only of theft but of receiving stolen goods, insofar as he receives, retains or disposes of the property he steals. Under this section, he may be charged with both offenses but he may be convicted of only one, and the prosecution sooner or later must elect as to which offense it wishes to pursue. On the other hand, a thief who commits theft on three separate occasions or steals different property from three separate victims in the space, say, of 5 minutes, can be charged with and convicted of all three thefts.\u201d Id. Similarly, the final report of the Technical Committee<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to Study Ohio Criminal Laws and Procedures reflects the committee\u2019s opinion that \u201cwhere the same conduct by the defendant technically amounts to two or more related offenses, he should be guilty of only one offense. On the other hand, where his conduct amounts to two or more different offenses, or to two or more offenses of the same Mnd committed at different times or with a separate evil purpose as to each, then it should be possible to convict him of all such crimes. The proposed section [R.C. 2941.25] is designed to effect this policy.\u201d Ohio Legislative Service Commission, Proposed Ohio Criminal Code (Mar.1971) 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">{\u00b6 17} This court has recognized that R.C. 2941.25(B) demonstrates a clear indication of the General Assembly\u2019s intent to permit cumulative sentencing for the commission of (1) offenses of dissimilar import and (2) offenses of similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>import committed separately or with separate animus. <em>Rance, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 636, 710 N.E.2d 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">{\u00b6 18} In applying the multiple-count statute, this court has long followed a two-tiered test to determine whether two offenses constitute allied offenses of similar import. <em>State v. Cabrales, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 54, 2008-Ohio-1625, 886 N.E.2d 181, \u00b6 14, citing <em>Newark v. Vazirani </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 81, 549 N.E.2d 520, syllabus. See also <em>State v. Blankenship </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 116, 117, 526 N.E.2d 816; <em>State v. Mughni </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 65, 67, 514 N.E.2d 870; <em>State v. Talley </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 152, 153-154, 18 OBR 210, 480 N.E.2d 439; <em>State v. Mitchell </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 416, 418, 6 OBR 463, 453 N.E.2d 593; <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 128, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c \u2018In the first step, the elements of the two crimes are compared. If the elements of the offenses correspond to such a degree that the commission of one crime will result in the commission of the other, the crimes are allied offenses of similar import and the court must then proceed to the second step. In the second step, the defendant\u2019s <em>conduct </em>is reviewed to determine whether the defendant can be convicted of both offenses. If the court finds either that the crimes were committed separately or that there was a separate animus for each crime, the defendant may be convicted of both offenses.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Cabrales </em>at \u00b6 14, quoting <em>Blankenship, </em>38 Ohio St.3d at 117, 526 N.E.2d 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Ranee, </em>we clarified the two-tiered test for allied offenses of similar import, specifying that courts should assess the elements of the offenses in the statutory abstract in accordance with Justice Rehnquist\u2019s dissent in <em>Whalen v. United States </em>(1980), 445 U.S. 684, 709-711, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715. <em>Rance, 85 </em>Ohio St.3d at 637, 710 N.E.2d 699. In <em>Whalen, </em>Justice Rehnquist favored a comparison of the statutes in the abstract over a comparison of the crimes as charged: \u201c[BJecause the <em>Blockburger </em>test is simply an attempt to determine legislative intent, it seems more natural to apply it to the language as drafted by the legislature than to the wording of a particular indictment.\u201d <em>Whalen </em>at 711, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Cabrales, </em>we acknowledged that <em>Ranee </em>has \u201cproduced inconsistent, unreasonable, and, at times, absurd results.\u201d <em>Cabrales, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 54, 2008-Ohio-1625, 886 N.E.2d 181, at \u00b6 20. As examples of such results, we cited <em>State v. Hendrickson, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19045, 2003-Ohio-611, 2003 WL 264339, and <em>State v. Waldron </em>(Sept. 1, 2000), Ashtabula App. No. 99-A-0031, 2000 WL 1257520, both holding that involuntary manslaughter and aggravated vehicular homicide are not allied offenses of similar import when there is only one victim. Thus, in <em>C\u00f3brales, </em>we once again clarified the two-tiered test, holding: \u201cIn determining whether offenses are allied offenses of similar import under R.C. 2941.25(A), courts are required to compare the elements of offenses in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>abstract without considering the evidence in the case, but are not required to find an exact alignment of the elements. Instead, if, in comparing the elements of the offenses in the abstract, the offenses are so similar that the commission of one offense will necessarily result in commission of the other, then the offenses are allied offenses of similar import.\u201d <em>C\u00f3brales </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 22} Here, the jury convicted Brown of one count of aggravated assault in violation of R.C. 2903.12(A)(1) and one count of aggravated assault in violation of R.C. 2903.12(A)(2), with each conviction arising from a single stab wound to Johnson\u2019s abdomen.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 23} R.C. 2903.12(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cNo person, while under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage, either of which is brought on by serious provocation occasioned by the victim that is reasonably sufficient to incite the person into using deadly force, shall knowingly:</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(1) Cause serious physical harm to another * * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(2) Cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another * * * by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">{\u00b627} R.C. 2901.01(A)(5) defines \u201c[sjerious physical harm to persons\u201d to include any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(a) Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment;</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(b) Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death;</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(c) Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity;</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(d) Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement;</p>\n<p id=\"b561-15\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(e) Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-16\">{\u00b6 33} In contrast, \u201cphysical harm to persons\u201d includes \u201cany injury, illness, or other physiological impairment, regardless of its gravity or duration.\u201d R.C. 2901.01(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-17\">{\u00b6 34} The only elements shared by these two alternate theories of aggravated assault are those of mens rea and physical harm. But while the offenses share the element of physical harm, they vary in the degree of harm required. R.C. 2903.12(A)(1) proscribes causing \u201cserious physical harm\u201d regardless of the means used to cause that harm, while subsection (A)(2) proscribes causing the lesser \u201cphysical harm\u201d by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>these two forms of aggravated assault do not satisfy the two-tiered test for allied offenses of similar import set forth in <em>Ranee </em>and clarified in <em>C\u00f3brales </em>because, comparing the elements of the offenses in the abstract, the commission of one will not necessarily result in commission of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 35} The state would have us end our analysis here, declare that aggravated assault in violation of R.C. 2903.12(A)(1) and (A)(2) are not allied offenses of similar import, and affirm both of Brown\u2019s convictions. However, the <em>Blockburger </em>test and our two-tiered test for allied offenses of similar import are rules of statutory construction designed to determine legislative intent. See, e.g., <em>Rance, 85 </em>Ohio St.3d at 635, 710 N.E.2d 699. But as Justice Rehnquist noted in his <em>Whalen </em>dissent, the lower court considered \u201c \u2018the societal interests protected by the [rape and felony murder] statutes under consideration\u2019 \u201d in determining Congressional intent, and found that one was \u201cdesigned \u2018to protect women from sexual assault\u2019 \u201d while the other \u201cwas intended \u2018to protect human life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whalen, </em>445 U.S. at 713, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), quoting <em>Whalen v. United States </em>(D.C.App.1977), 379 A.2d 1152, 1159. As Justice Rehnquist concluded, \u201c[B]y asking whether two separate statutes each include an element the other does not, a court is really asking whether the legislature manifested an intention to serve two different interests in enacting the two statutes.\u201d <em>Whalen </em>at 714, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 36} In determining whether two offenses constitute allied offenses of similar import, we have previously considered the societal interests protected by the relevant statutes. In <em>State v. Mitchell </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 416, 6 OBR 463, 453 N.E.2d 593, we considered the offenses of theft and aggravated burglary. We acknowledged that the offenses had some common elements, in that aggravated burglary may involve the purpose to commit a theft offense. Id. at 419, 6 OBR 463, 453 N.E.2d 593. We noted, however, that completion of the theft offense was not necessary to commit aggravated burglary and that the purpose to commit any felony would satisfy the requisite intent. Id. We then proceeded to consider the societal interests protected by the relevant statutes. Id. We acknowledged that the theft statute seeks to prohibit the nonconsensual taking of property by any means, while the focus of the aggravated-burglary statute seeks to minimize the risk of harm to persons. Id. We therefore concluded that the General Assembly intended to distinguish the offenses of aggravated burglary and theft and permit separate punishments for their commission. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">{\u00b6 37} While our two-tiered test for determining whether offenses constitute allied offenses of similar import is helpful in construing legislative intent, it is not necessary to resort to that test when the legislature\u2019s intent is clear from the language of the statute. A cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is that \u201c[a] court must look to the language and purpose of the statute in order to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>legislative intent.\u201d <em>State v. Cook </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 404, 416, 700 N.E.2d 570. \u201c[W]hen the General Assembly has plainly and unambiguously conveyed its legislative intent, there is nothing for a court to interpret or construe, and therefore, the court applies the law as written.\u201d <em>State v. Kreischer, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 391, 2006-Ohio-2706, 848 N.E.2d 496, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 38} R.C. Chapter 2903 defines four assault offenses: (1) felonious assault, (2) aggravated assault, (3) assault, and (4) negligent assault. R.C. 2903.11 through 2903.14. See also Legislative Service Commission Summary of Am.Sub. H.B. 511, supra, at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 39} R.C. 2903.12 defines the offense of aggravated assault. Division (A) of that section sets forth the distinguishing factor of provocation and the requisite mens rea for the offense: knowingly. Then subdivisions (1) and (2) set forth two means of committing the offense \u2014 causing serious physical harm to another, or causing or attempting to cause physical harm by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance. These subdivisions set forth two different forms of the same offense, in each of which the legislature manifested its intent to serve the same interest \u2014 preventing physical harm to persons. See <em>Whalen, </em>445 U.S. at 714, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 40} In light of this statutory language, we conclude that the General Assembly did not intend violations of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) and (A)(2) to be separately punishable when the offenses result from a single act undertaken with a single animus. Thus, aggravated assault in violation of R.C. 2903.12(A)(1) and (A)(2) are allied offenses of similar import. Accordingly, we affirm that portion of the decision of the court of appeals holding that Brown can be convicted of and sentenced only for one offense of aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">{\u00b6 41} Because Brown\u2019s convictions arise from a single act and animus, pursuant to R.C. 2941.25, she may be convicted of only one form of the offense of aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">{\u00b6 42} In <em>State v. Botta </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 196, 201, 56 O.O.2d 119, 271 N.E.2d 776, we acknowledged that R.C. 2941.25 is a legislative attempt to codify the judicial doctrine of merger, i.e., the principle that \u201ca major crime often includes as inherent therein the component elements of other crimes and that these component elements, in legal effect, are merged in the major crime.\u201d See also <em>State v. Roberts </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 170, 172-173, 16 O.O.3d 201, 405 N.E.2d 247; <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 254, 15 O.O.3d 262, 400 N.E.2d 897; <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345. Therefore, the proper disposition of matters involving allied offenses of similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>import committed with a single animus is to merge the crimes into a single conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 43} Regarding the doctrine of merger, we have previously stated: \u201cAn accused may be tried for both [allied offenses of similar import] but may be convicted and sentenced for only one. The choice is given to the prosecution to pursue one offense or the other, and it is plainly the intent of the General Assembly that the election may be of either offense.\u201d <em>Maumee v. Geiger </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 238, 244, 74 O.O.2d 380, 344 N.E.2d 133. See also Legislative Service Commission Summary of Am.Sub.H.B. 511, supra, at 69 (stating that pursuant to R.C. 2941.25 a defendant may be charged with multiple offenses of similar import committed with a single animus, but that he may be convicted of only one, and further stating that \u201cthe prosecution sooner or later must elect as to which offense it wishes to pursue\u201d). Thus, upon remand for merger and resentencing the state must elect which of Brown\u2019s two assault charges will merge into the other for purposes of her conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 44} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, albeit for different reasons, and remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b564-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b564-9\">Pfeifer and Lanzinger, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-9\">. In response to House Resolution No. 81 of the 106th General Assembly, the Ohio Legislative Service Commission appointed the Technical Committee, consisting of members of the bench and bar from throughout the state, to draft a comprehensive substantive revision of the criminal laws of this state. Ohio Legislative Service Commission, Proposed Ohio Criminal Code (Mar.1971) at iii and vii. The committee\u2019s work led to the Legislative Service Commission\u2019s preparation of what eventually became H.B. 511, 109th General Assembly, which, as amended, constituted the first comprehensive revision of Ohio\u2019s substantive criminal law since 1815.

This statement is unnecessary and confusing in light of our most recent decision on allied offenses, <em>State v. Cabrales, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 54, 2008-Ohio-1625, 886 N.E.2d 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">{\u00b6 46} This court clarified in <em>C\u00f3brales </em>that \u201c[i]n determining whether offenses are allied offenses of similar import under R.C. 2941.25(A), courts are required to compare the elements of offenses in the abstract without considering the evidence in the case, but are not required to find an exact alignment of the elements. Instead, if, in comparing the elements of the offenses in the abstract, the offenses are so similar that the commission of one offense will necessarily result in commission of the other, then the offenses are allied offenses of similar import.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. The majority now asks whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>General Assembly intended to serve the same \u201csocietal\u201d interest in enacting the compared statutes and whether their violations were designed to be \u201cseparately punishable.\u201d These questions are irrelevant, for R.C. 2941.25 shows that it does not apply to the circumstances before us. R.C. 2941.25 provides:</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b565-12\">William D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Pamela Bolton, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant and cross-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c(A) <em>Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more </em>allied <em>offenses </em>of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c(B) <em>Where the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes two or more offenses </em>of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 49} The court of appeals in Brown\u2019s case refused to engage in an analysis of allied offenses under R.C. 2945.25 because it concluded that such an analysis \u201cis implicated only in a situation where the conduct by a defendant could be construed to constitute two or more offenses.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 87651, 2006-Ohio-6267, 2006 WL 3446238, \u00b6 50. The court held that Brown\u2019s two convictions for aggravated assault should have been merged into a single count for a very simple reason \u2014 Brown had committed only one act of assault. Id. at \u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 50} I agree with the court of appeals that the problem of allied offenses is obviated when the defendant\u2019s conduct involves a single act with a single animus, and the offenses charged are different forms of the same crime. In this situation, Brown\u2019s conduct \u2014 stabbing Johnson once \u2014 could not be construed to constitute two or more offenses. The state indicted her on two separate counts that specified alternative means of committing the alleged act of aggravated assault (knowingly causing serious physical harm to Johnson, R.C. 2903.12(A)(1), and knowingly causing or attempting to cause physical harm to Johnson by means of a deadly weapon or ordnance, R.C. 2903.12(A)(2)). Both counts in the indictment related to a single act, committed with a single state of mind, and the single offense of aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">{\u00b6 51} Brown could be convicted and sentenced on a single offense. I would adopt the reasoning of the court of appeals and therefore concur in judgment only.</p>\n<judges id=\"b565-11\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Robert L.
