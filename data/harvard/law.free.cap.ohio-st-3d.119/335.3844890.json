Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 331, 2006-Ohio-5791, 856 N.E.2d 243; <em>Lovell v. Levin, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 200, 2007-Ohio-6054, 877 N.E.2d 667. The Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) concluded that our decision in <em>Knust </em>was dispositive, and it summarily affirmed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s assessment with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>out allowing the Browns to complete discovery and present evidence at a hearing. The Browns argue that the BTA had a statutory duty to permit discovery and to hold a hearing. Under the particular circumstances presented, we disagree, and we affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Keith A. Brown and Noel P. Brown (the latter now deceased) were husband and wife and filed a joint Ohio tax return for tax year 2000. In that return, they reported their adjusted gross income for that year, but that figure did not include the Browns\u2019 distributive share of income from several corporations whose shares were held by the Keith A. Brown Revocable Living Trust. To the extent that it owned those shares, the trust constituted an \u201celecting small business trust\u201d (\u201cESBT\u201d) under the Internal Revenue Code. Pursuant to an election under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, the income of those corporations \u201cflowed through\u201d to the shareholders. See <em>Dupee v. Tracy </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 350, 351, 708 N.E.2d 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">{\u00b6 3} The Browns omitted the distributive-share income from their joint personal income tax return on the theory that the income constituted income of the trust, reportable under federal law through a return filed by the trust. Because the Browns did not include the distributive-share income in their federal adjusted gross income, the Browns reasoned that that income did not form part of their Ohio adjusted gross income either.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, they omitted to include that income on the particular line of the Ohio tax form where that amount should have been disclosed. The propriety of excluding the distributive-share income from federal and Ohio adjusted gross income is the main substantive issue that the Browns attempted to raise at the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">{\u00b6 4} The Tax Commissioner issued an assessment that added back the distributive-share income into Ohio adjusted gross income. The assessment rested on the Tax Commissioner\u2019s view that because the trust was a \u201cgrantor trust\u201d under the Internal Revenue Code, its income flowed through to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>grantor/beneficiary, Keith Brown. Upon review, the commissioner upheld his assessment on the following basis: \u201cPursuant to <em>Knust v. Wilkins </em>(Oct. 14, 2005), BTA No. 2004-M-533, unreported, appeal pending Sup.Ct. No. 2005-2084 [111 Ohio St.3d 331, 2006-Ohio-5791, 856 N.E.2d 243], an ESBT election does not supersede the applicability of the grantor trust rules and the income and gains from the trust are includable on the petitioners\u2019 2000 Individual Income Tax Return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">{\u00b6 5} The Browns appealed to the BTA, setting forth the following as their sole specification of error: \u201cThis appeal is being taken because the assessment is not supported by a proper application of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 5747.02 and other applicable laws.\u201d At the BTA, the Browns served written discovery requests on the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner filed a motion asking the BTA to hold the case in abeyance pending this court\u2019s decision in the appeal of the <em>Knust </em>case. The Browns opposed the motion, and in an order dated November 3, 2006, the BTA denied the motion. The BTA\u2019s order also stated that the commissioner \u201cis expected to respond to appellants\u2019 discovery requests within the dictates of the discovery rules.\u201d Apparently, the commissioner never responded to the discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">{\u00b6 6} On November 22, 2006, we decided <em>Knust v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 331, 2006-Ohio-5791, 856 N.E.2d 243, affirming the BTA\u2019s disposition. We recited the general federal-law principle that \u201cthe income earned by a grantor trust passes through to the grantor and is taxed to him or her,\u201d and we held that \u201c[n]othing in [the ESBT provision] suggests that that principle changes when the grantor trust is designated as an ESBT.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 24, 25. We also held that the \u201cfailure of the Internal Revenue Service to insist that the returns be changed to reflect the trust income as personal income * * * does not prevent the Tax Commissioner or this court from applying the federal statutes as they are written.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">{\u00b6 7} On December 8, 2006, the BTA issued an order in this case requiring the Browns to show cause why the Tax Commissioner\u2019s assessment should not be affirmed on the authority of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Knust. </em>The Tax Commissioner urged affirmance; the Browns opposed affirmance based upon two contentions. First, the Browns argued that the facts of their case materially differed from those of <em>Knust, </em>claiming that Keith A. Brown had terminated the trust on December 28, 2000, the day before a federal regulation became effective that supported the Tax Commissioner\u2019s position.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, the Browns argued that <em>Knust </em>was wrongly decided and that they should have the opportunity to prove that to be true. Additionally, the Browns recited that they had \u201cnot received any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>discovery,\u201d and they asked that the BTA hold the show-cause order in abeyance until completion of \u201cmeaningful discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">{\u00b6 8} On August 17, 2007, the BTA issued its decision. The BTA stated that it had already decided in another case that the factual distinction asserted by the Browns was not material. The BTA did not separately address the Browns\u2019 allegation that <em>Knust </em>was wrongly decided. Instead, the BTA proceeded to affirm the Tax Commissioner\u2019s assessment \u201cbased on the preponderance of evidence in the record before us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">{\u00b6 9} The Browns appealed, and they contend that they were entitled to complete discovery and to present their evidence at a hearing. In the alternative, they seek a ruling that we erred when we decided <em>Knust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">{\u00b6 10} As the foregoing recitation indicates, our holding in <em>Knust </em>appears to resolve the substantive legal issue that the Browns assert. But the Browns point to the unmistakable mandate of R.C. 5717.02: when a taxpayer appeals a determination of the Tax Commissioner to the BTA, that body \u201cupon the application of any interested party * * * <em>shall </em>order the hearing of additional evidence.\u201d Moreover, the BTA\u2019s rules state that certain forms of discovery \u201cmay be permitted\u201d by the BTA, subject to the Rules of Civil Procedure where those rules are not inconsistent with other BTA rules. Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">{\u00b6 11} The duty to hold a hearing upon application, along with the general existence of a right to pursue discovery, furnishes the Browns with a strong initial argument in support of their position. We agree as a general matter that the BTA has no power analogous to that of a court in a civil action to grant summary judgment under Civ.R. 56 or dismissal for failure to state a claim under Civ.R. 12(B)(6). Indeed, the BTA has acknowledged this legal precept in its decisions. See, e.g., <em>Weastec, Inc. v. Highland Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Interim Order, Jan. 18, 2008), BTA No. 07-H-884, 2008 WL 291887 at 2 (the BTA has \u201con multiple occasions\u201d held that it \u201chas no authority to grant a motion for summary judgment\u201d). Ordinarily, then, a party to a BTA appeal from a final determination of the Tax Commissioner may obtain a hearing upon request in spite of considerations that might lead to summary disposition in a civil case.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">{\u00b6 12} Given this background, the question arises in this case whether the BTA violated R.C. 5717.02 and arrogated powers it does not possess when it summarily affirmed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">{\u00b6 13} The propriety of summary affirmance cannot be decided without reference to another mandate set forth in R.C. 5717.02. The second paragraph of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>section requires the appellant to attach the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination to the notice of appeal, and then states that the appellant must \u201cspecify the errors therein complained of.\u201d In this case, the notice of appeal comes closest to specifying error with the following sentence: \u201cThis appeal is being taken because the assessment is not supported by a proper application of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 5747.02 and other applicable laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">{\u00b6 14} Because the Tax Commissioner relied on the BTA\u2019s decision in <em>Knust </em>when he upheld the assessment against the Browns, and because the <em>Knust </em>appeal from the BTA\u2019s decision was pending before this court at the time the Tax Commissioner issued his final determination, the BTA could have construed the Browns\u2019 notice of appeal as a request that if this court reversed the BTA\u2019s decision in <em>Knust, </em>the Browns should enjoy the benefit of that legal ruling. Indeed, to construe the notice of appeal in that way would comport with the fact that this case is one of a large number of cases that were pending before the BTA in anticipation of our decision in the <em>Knust </em>appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">{\u00b6 15} To the extent that the Browns\u2019 appeal in essence sought the benefit of a possible reversal in <em>Knust, </em>summary affirmance would have been appropriate once this court had affirmed the BTA in <em>Knust </em>rather than reversing. Quite simply, there would have been nothing to accomplish by holding a hearing and taking additional evidence if the only request before the BTA sought implementation of this court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 16} We do not understand the Browns to contend otherwise. Instead, the Browns argue that their appeal consisted of much more than a request that this court\u2019s decision be applied to their case. In the Browns\u2019 view, they were entitled to discovery and a hearing for two reasons: first, they desired to show that their case differed factually from <em>Knust </em>in some material respect; and second, they desired to present certain evidence of how the Tax Commissioner adopted his view of the Internal Revenue Code, which, once presented, would show that <em>Knust </em>was wrongly decided. We therefore turn to the propriety of not granting them a hearing on those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">{\u00b6 17} Our cases establish three pertinent points regarding the requirement to specify errors in the notice of appeal. First, the failure to set forth <em>any </em>error in the notice of appeal with the requisite specificity justifies the dismissal of the appeal by the BTA for want of jurisdiction. <em>Queen City Valves, Inc. v. Peck </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 579, 53 O.O. 430, 120 N.E.2d 310. Second, although the BTA may possess jurisdiction over one or more issues that have been sufficiently specified, the BTA lacks jurisdiction to grant relief from a final determination based on other alleged errors that were not sufficiently specified in the notice of appeal. <em>Ladas v. Peck </em>(1954), 162 Ohio St. 159, 54 O.O. 397, 122 N.E.2d 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>syllabus; <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Lindley </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 71, 75, 23 O.O.3d 118, 430 N.E.2d 939 (\u201ca notice of appeal does not confer jurisdiction upon the Board of Tax Appeals to resolve an issue, unless that issue is clearly specified in the notice of appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 18} Third, the specification requirement is stringent. As we stated more than 50 years ago in <em>Queen City Valves, </em>\u201cspecify\u201d means \u201c \u2018to state in full and explicit terms\u2019 \u201d any contention upon which an appellant at the BTA seeks relief. <em>Queen City Valves, </em>161 Ohio St. at 583, 53 O.O. 430, 120 N.E.2d 310, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th Ed.). An assignment of error in a notice of appeal does not confer jurisdiction if \u201c[t]he errors set out are such as might be advanced in nearly any case and are not of a nature to call the attention of the board to those precise determinations of the Tax Commissioner with which appellant took issue.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 19} A number of recent cases demonstrate the stringency of the specification requirement. A notice of appeal failed to invoke jurisdiction to consider whether the Tax Commissioner erred by finding that the taxpayer was a \u201cconsumer\u201d for use-tax purposes when the taxpayer\u2019s notice of appeal neither cited the relevant statute nor mentioned the term \u201cconsumer.\u201d <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-Ohio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 24. Similarly, a claim of exemption from sales and use tax under R.C. 5739.02(B)(13) was not properly raised and could not be ruled on by the BTA when the taxpayer had neither cited the statute nor used \u201cany language that might suggest to the reasonable reader that [the appellant] intended to claim an exemption under that section.\u201d <em>Cousino Constr. Co. v. Wilkins, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 90, 2006-Ohio-162, 840 N.E.2d 1065, \u00b6 37. Finally, where the Tax Commissioner\u2019s determination relied upon a specific finding, the BTA had no jurisdiction to reverse that finding unless the notice of appeal explicitly contested the finding. <em>Ellwood Engineered Castings Co. v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 424, 2003-Ohio-1812, 786 N.E.2d 458, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">{\u00b6 20} We now examine how the Browns\u2019 notice of appeal fares in light of this precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">{\u00b6 21} In this case, the Browns stated, \u201cThis appeal is being taken because the assessment is not supported by a proper application of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 5747.02 and other applicable laws.\u201d R.C. 5747.02 is nothing more than the general statute that imposes the Ohio personal income tax; the Browns did not cite any of the federal statutes that have been placed at issue in the briefs. Nor does the notice of appeal make any explicit reference to \u201cESBT\u201d or \u201cgrantor trust\u201d or other terms that would define the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>{\u00b6 22} R.C. 5717.02 does not deem sufficient an assertion that \u201cmight be advanced in nearly any case.\u201d <em>Queen City Valves, </em>161 Ohio St. at 583, 53 O.O. 430, 120 N.E.2d 310. The Browns\u2019 claim of error might indeed have been raised in any <em>income tax </em>case in Ohio. Moreover, the claim fails to \u201ccall the attention of the board to those precise determinations of the Tax Commissioner with which appellant took issue.\u201d Id. Under the standard articulated in <em>Queen City Valves </em>and our other cases, this statement arguably specifies no error at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">{\u00b6 23} The foregoing considerations barred the Browns\u2019 request for a hearing in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In particular, the notice of appeal does not state that the present case presents material factual differences from <em>Knust; </em>nor does it state that <em>Knust </em>would have been decided differently if certain evidence had been presented in that case. The BTA\u2019s <em>Knust </em>decision formed the basis for the commissioner\u2019s determination in this case; accordingly, the Browns were on notice and should have identified any difference or deficiency in <em>Knust </em>in their notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">{\u00b624} Because the Browns did not specify such errors, the BTA did not acquire jurisdiction to grant relief based on those contentions. Accordingly, the BTA did not have to allow discovery and hold a hearing as to those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">{\u00b6 25} Finally, the Browns suggest that in some way, the Attorney General\u2019s representation of the Tax Commissioner before this court led us to the wrong conclusion in <em>Knust. </em>We disagree. In <em>Knust, </em>we fully considered and addressed the legal dispute between the Tax Commissioner and certain taxpayers who, like the Browns, contended that an ESBT should report the pass-through corporate income as income of the trust. The Tax Commissioner asserted that when an ESBT is a grantor trust, the usual federal provisions apply that regard the income of the trust as income of the grantor himself. The taxpayers contended, as do the Browns, that the ESBT provision somehow supersedes the grantor-trust rule. We concluded that the Tax Commissioner had properly read and applied the Internal Revenue Code. Our decision of this issue does not differ from our resolution of legal issues generally. The mere fact that many disputed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s position, and acted under their different interpretation of the law, impugns neither the validity of the Tax Commissioner\u2019s reading of the law nor our conclusion that the Tax Commissioner\u2019s interpretation was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Having so recently decided this issue of law, we adhere to it under the principle of stare decisis. Moreover, the BTA acted reasonably and lawfully when it applied our decision in this case rather than question it. Because the Browns did not specify any error that justified holding a hearing, the BTA properly granted summary affirmance on the basis of our decision in <em>Knust. </em>We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b450-6\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b450-7\">Pfeifer and Cupp, JJ., concur in affirming the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals on the basis of the analysis in part III only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b450-8\">O\u2019Donnell, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-8\">. Because Ohio\u2019s income tax did not subject trusts to income taxation in 2000, the distributive-share income would have completely escaped Ohio income taxation had the Browns\u2019 theory been correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\">. The issue is one of substantive federal tax law: whether the Internal Revenue Code required inclusion of the distributive-share income in the federal (and hence also the Ohio) adjusted gross income of the grantor of the trust. It is not in dispute that the Tax Commissioner had state-law authority to require the Browns to disclose the information on the tax form. R.C. 5747.08 (requiring the filing of income tax returns), R.C. 5747.18(A) (authorizing the Tax Commissioner to prescribe income tax forms), and R.C. 5747.19 (prohibiting taxpayers from knowingly filing or causing to be filed an \u201cincomplete\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d return). These statutes plainly conferred authority on the commissioner to require the information to be disclosed, even if that official\u2019s interpretation of federal law had subsequently been held to be incorrect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\">. In <em>Lovell v. Levin, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 200, 2007-Ohio-6054, 877 N.E.2d 667, at \u00b6 28, we applied the holding of <em>Knust </em>to a case presenting that sequence. Accordingly, <em>Lovell </em>foreclosed this aspect of the Browns\u2019 argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b449-10\">. The Tax Commissioner did not file a cross-appeal asserting that the BTA had no jurisdiction over the issues that the Browns sought to litigate. As to nonjurisdictional issues, the failure to file a protective cross-appeal bars our consideration of an error alleged by an appellee. <em>Polaris Amphitheater Concerts, Inc. v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 330, 2008-Ohio-2454, 889 N.E.2d 103, \u00b6 13. But the absence of a cross-appeal does not prevent us from considering an issue of the BTA\u2019s jurisdiction that bears, derivatively, on our own. <em>Elyria v. Lorain Cty. Budget Comm., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 403, 2008-Ohio-940, 884 N.E.2d 553, \u00b6 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b450-9\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALU\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">{\u00b6 27} I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">{\u00b6 28} R.C. 5717.02 expressly provides that \u201c[t]he board may order the appeal to be heard upon the record and the evidence certified to it by the commissioner or director, but upon the application of any interested party the board <em>shall </em>order the hearing of additional evidence, and it may make such investigation concerning the appeal as it considers proper.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This court has long recognized that use of the word \u201cshall\u201d \u201c \u2018denotes that compliance with the commands of that statute is <em>mandatory.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis sic.)\u201d <em>State ex rel. Adams v. Aluchem, Inc., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 640, 2004-Ohio-6891, 821 N.E.2d 547, \u00b6 12, quoting <em>Dept. of Liquor Control v. Sons of Italy Lodge 0917 </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 532, 534, 605 N.E.2d 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">{\u00b6 29} Moreover, Ohio Adm.Code 5717-1-11(A) provides that discovery \u201cmay be permitted by deposition upon oral examination or written questions; written interrogatories; production of documents or tangible things or permission to enter upon land or other property; and requests for admissions\u201d in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure, to the extent that they are not inconsistent with other BTA rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">{\u00b6 30} The majority opinion expressly acknowledges \u201cas a general matter that the BTA has no power analogous to that of a court in a civil action to grant summary judgment under Civ.R. 56 or dismissal for failure to state a claim under Civ.R. 12(B)(6).\u201d \u00b6 11. Yet the majority concludes that the BTA could appropriately grant summary judgment in this case to the extent that the Browns sought the application of a favorable ruling in <em>Knust v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 331, 2006-Ohio-5791, 856 N.E.2d 243, because the conduct of a hearing would be, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the majority\u2019s view, an exercise in futility. R.C. 5717.02, however, provides no exception to its mandatory language requiring the BTA to conduct a hearing \u201cupon the application of any interested party.\u201d Moreover, the BTA\u2019s own holdings recognize that it has no authority to grant summary judgment because \u201cthe Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, which prescribe practice before Ohio courts, have been adopted by this board only for purposes of discovery.\u201d <em>Weastec, Inc. v.
