Maley of Lancaster, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0055448, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1991. Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with violations of the Disciplinary Rules in a two-count complaint. Respondent participated in a hearing on the complaint before a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline. The board now recommends that we suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice for 18 months with six months stayed on condition that he take classes in office management and ethics. Respondent has not objected to the board\u2019s report and recommendation. On review, we find that respondent violated the Code of Professional Responsibility and impose the recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">\n<em>Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">{\u00b6 2} Respondent gave his employee Diane Bilinovich (\u201cthe secretary\u201d) authority to use the office and credit cards, collect client fee payments, manage the office checking account, and meet with clients. Between July 2004 and August 2005, the secretary, in respondent\u2019s name, collected filing fees and agreed to file, or filed, at least 39 bankruptcy petitions. In five of these matters, clients made payment, but cases were never filed. In 34 of these matters, petitions were filed without respondent\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>{\u00b6 3} The secretary developed a practice of preparing bankruptcy petitions without informing respondent. She would file the bankruptcy case online, taking advantage of the use of the electronic signature and would pay the fees online with respondent\u2019s credit card. She would interact with the clients and hire other attorneys, whom respondent used from time to time, to appear at the various bankruptcy hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">{\u00b6 4} The secretary performed various legal functions using the respondent\u2019s name and office. She prepared and filed various pleadings such as an amended Chapter 13 plan, motions for redemption of property, and reaffirmation agreements. She also responded to notices and letters from bankruptcy trustees. Respondent claimed that the secretary was processing cases and using his credit cards without his knowledge or consent. Respondent claims that she pocketed fees amounting to $25,000 to $30,000. Over $11,000 in expenses associated with these bankruptcy filings was paid with respondent\u2019s credit cards or from respondent\u2019s checking account. Bank statements and credit card bills detailing these expenditures were sent to respondent monthly.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">{\u00b6 5} In January 2005, respondent discovered that the secretary had used his charge card to make over $8,300 in personal charges in 2004, for auto repairs, cell phone bills, and the purchase of a computer. When respondent confronted her, she agreed to make monthly payments to repay the debt but made only three $100 payments. In February 2005, she charged an additional $350 of her own expenses on respondent\u2019s credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent terminated the secretary at the end of March 2005, claiming that he was closing his bankruptcy practice. Of the 36 petitions filed under respondent\u2019s name, she filed 19 after being fired. She continued to enter respondent\u2019s office after business hours. She also continued to use respondent\u2019s credit cards, charging over $5,000 to pay bankruptcy court filings under his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">{\u00b6 7} In April through June 2005, respondent became aware of the new filings and credit card charges. The secretary told respondent that they were for an unaffiliated lawyer in respondent\u2019s suite. That lawyer told respondent in June that the secretary was not handling his bankruptcy cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">{\u00b6 8} Respondent\u2019s wife, who had begun working in the office in late June, notified him, in a memo dated July 6, 2005, of problems with the bankruptcy cases. She warned respondent that he might get in \u201cdeep trouble\u201d if he did not get a handle on the cases. The bankruptcy charges and filings continued into August 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">{\u00b6 9} It was not until September 2005 that respondent reported the secretary\u2019s activities to the Lancaster police department. He also contacted the bankruptcy court to terminate his account and to alert the trustees to what had occurred. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>October, respondent contacted the Fairfield County Bar Association regarding the secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">{\u00b6 10} As to Count I, the board found violations of DR 1-102(A)(5) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting conduct adversely reflecting on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), 3-101(A) (prohibiting the aiding of a nonlawyer in the unauthorized practice of law), 3-102(A) (prohibiting the sharing of fees with a nonlawyer), 6-101(A)(3) (prohibiting neglect of an entrusted legal matter), and 7-101 (A)(3) (prohibiting intentionally prejudicing or damaging a client during the professional relationship).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">{\u00b6 11} Respondent did not have a trust account during 2005 and part of 2004. He regularly deposited unearned retainers and lawsuit settlement checks into his business checking account, commingling them with funds of the law firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">{\u00b6 12} As to Count II, the board found violations of DR 1-102(A)(5), 1-102(A)(6), 9-102(A) (prohibiting commingling of client funds with law firm funds), and 9-102(B)(3) (requiring lawyers to maintain complete records of client funds and render appropriate accounts to clients).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent did nothing to stop the secretary after he became aware that she was using his credit card to pay filing fees without his permission and that she had accepted retainers in respondent\u2019s name. Respondent became aware of unauthorized credit card charges in April 2005 after he had fired the secretary. He accepted her explanation that these were another attorney\u2019s charges on his account. He never changed the locks on his office, demanded the keys, or canceled his credit cards. He claims that he did not know about her acceptance of fees until July 2005. Respondent did not notify the authorities or the bankruptcy court until September.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">{\u00b6 14} Respondent granted broad authority to the secretary to deal with and work directly for clients. He either knew or should have known that she was taking money from clients and performing legal work for them. Further, once he had actual knowledge of her actions, he failed to promptly act to protect the clients\u2019 interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">{\u00b6 15} The secretary\u2019s use of respondent\u2019s credit cards for unauthorized personal expenses, even after respondent confronted her about it, did not cause him to investigate further. Respondent knew she had financial difficulties and even loaned her money after she had stolen from him by making unauthorized personal charges on his account.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Respondent neglected his duty to maintain a trust account. He explained his lack of a trust account by blaming his \u201csheer stupidity and laziness.\u201d Significantly, if respondent had properly separated his funds from those of his clients through a trust account and had reconciled the account and his client\u2019s records properly, he could have discovered the secretary\u2019s activities and stopped them.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">{\u00b6 17} We find that there is clear and convincing evidence that respondent committed the violations found by the board in both Counts I and II.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">{\u00b6 18} The board recommends that we suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice for 18 months with six months stayed on the condition that he take office-management and ethics training.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">{\u00b6 19} In recommending a sanction, the board considered the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). As aggravating factors, the board found a selfish motive, a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, and vulnerability of and resulting harm to victims of the misconduct. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1). As mitigating factors, the board noted the absence of a prior disciplinary record, a cooperative attitude toward the proceedings, and respondent\u2019s character and reputation. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2). We adopt the board\u2019s findings as to the aggravating and mitigating factors. In addition, respondent submitted numerous letters attesting to his honesty, integrity, and good character from a judge, elected officials, attorneys, and others. The first assistant prosecuting attorney in Fairfield County testified that he believes that respondent is a person of unquestionable integrity and extremely high moral character. Respondent also testified that he was a founding father of Habitat for Humanity of Fairfield County and had been awarded the 2003 Fairfield County and Ohio \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d from the Sertoma club.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">{\u00b6 20} Respondent\u2019s lax supervision of his employee allowed her to use respondent\u2019s credit card, his bankruptcy court credentials, and his reputation to the detriment of his clients and the court. Appropriate oversight of his practice could have prevented her misconduct. If respondent had read his e-mail notifications from the bankruptcy court, reviewed his bank statements and credit card charges, and reviewed his files on a regular basis, he would have known that something was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">{\u00b6 21} Although we recognize an attorney\u2019s need to delegate, we have insisted on supervision to ensure that delegated legal duties are completed properly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Ball </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 401, 404, 618 N.E.2d 159. More recent decisions from this and other courts have similarly admonished lawyers for failing to supervise nonlawyer assistants with care. See, e.g., <em>Lorain Cty. Bar Assn. v. Noll, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 6, 2004-Ohio-7013, 821 N.E.2d 988 (imposing a two-year suspension, with 18 months stayed, on a lawyer who failed to adequately supervise a legal assistant and committed other violations); <em>Richland Cty. Bar Assn. v. Akers, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 337, 2005-Ohio-5144, 835 N.E.2d 29 (imposing an 18-month sentence with 12 months stayed for failure to supervise an employee); and <em>Mahoning Cty. Bar Assn. v. Lavelle, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 92, 2005-Ohio-5976, 836 N.E.2d 1214, \u00b6 29 (imposing an 18-month suspension with 12 months stayed on a lawyer who \u201cchose to remain oblivious to the improper actions of the persons he hired\u201d).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b329-9\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Robert R. Berger, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AqZ\">Mitchell, Allen, Catalano &amp; Boda and William Mann, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">{\u00b6 22} Whether or not respondent knowingly allowed his employee to engage in the unauthorized practice of law, he was negligent in the supervision of his staff. And his lack of responsibility facilitated her unauthorized practice of law. Respondent\u2019s admitted failure to maintain a trust account also demonstrates irresponsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">{\u00b6 23} We therefore suspend respondent from the practice of law for 18 months, with the last six months stayed, on condition that respondent comply fully with Prof.Cond.R. 1.15, Safekeeping Funds and Property, complete a CLE course on law-office management, and, in addition to the required hours, complete an additional three-hour CLE course in ethics and professionalism. If respondent fails to comply with the conditions, the stay will be lifted, and respondent will serve the entire term of the suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b329-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
