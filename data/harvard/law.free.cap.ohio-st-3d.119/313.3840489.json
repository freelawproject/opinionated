Finding that these acts constituted professional misconduct, the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we suspend the lawyer\u2019s license for one year and stay the last six months on conditions, including one year of probation. We accept the board\u2019s findings of misconduct and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">{\u00b6 2} Respondent, Jeffrey A. Catanzarite of Akron, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0015203, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1979. Relator, Akron Bar Association, charged respondent in a multiple-count complaint with violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility and with failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation as required by Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G). A three-member panel of the board heard the case in November 2007, found three Disciplinary Rule violations and a failure to cooperate, and recommended the one-year suspension and conditioned six-month stay. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">{\u00b6 3} Respondent objects to the board\u2019s report, arguing first that the findings of misconduct are not supported by the requisite degree of proof. The objections, which merely lament that the panel and board did not accept respondent\u2019s version of the underlying events, are overruled. Relator\u2019s witnesses testified to the facts set forth in Part I of this opinion, the panel credited these witnesses over respondent\u2019s testimony, and consistent with our usual practice in disciplinary proceedings, we defer to those credibility determinations. See <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Statzer, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 14, 2003-Ohio-6649, 800 N.E.2d 1117, \u00b68.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent also objects to the board\u2019s recommendation, arguing that the sanction is too severe. We disagree. As explained in Part II of our opinion, we find that a one-year suspension with the last six months stayed on conditions, including one year of probation, is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">I. Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">{\u00b6 5} To establish a lawyer\u2019s professional misconduct, relator must prove a violation of the Disciplinary Rules with clear and convincing evidence.

Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118, paragraph three of the syllabus. The proof of respondent\u2019s improprieties meets this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\n<em>A. Respondent Violated DR 2-106(A) by Charging a Clearly Excessive Fee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent has a master\u2019s degree in business administration in addition to his law degree and has practiced for most of his career in taxation and finance, representing closely held corporations. Sometime in January 2006, David Hirsch called respondent to inquire about retaining his help in resolving difficulties that Hirsch and Robert Joyce, partners in a recruiting firm named Professional Dynamics, were having with a third partner. During their 15- to 20-minute conversation, respondent advised Hirsch that he would not charge for their initial consultation but if hired would require a $1,000 retainer fee and then charge fees as necessary. Respondent, who typically charges $150 per hour, did not specify his hourly rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">{\u00b6 7} Hirsch, who admitted his inexperience in dealing with attorneys, and Joyce then met with respondent on January 13, 2006, for one and one-half to two hours. They explained that their third partner had abandoned the business after incurring various debts. Respondent advised Hirsch and Joyce to reconnect with the partner and \u201cbring [him] back as a team player.\u201d Joyce testified that respondent, at some point during the meeting, had also mentioned the $1,000 retainer, adding that he would cap his fees at $5,000. Both Hirsch and Joyce testified that they made no commitment to hire respondent, telling him that they wanted to think more before engaging him and intending to consult with another attorney the following week.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">{\u00b6 8} Some time after their meeting, respondent called Hirsch and asked whether any progress had been made with the third partner. Respondent also inquired about obtaining a check for $1,000. Hirsch replied, according to his testimony, that he and Joyce would forward a check to respondent if they decided to hire him.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">{\u00b6 9} Before Hirsch and Joyce\u2019s meeting with respondent, Joyce had already tried without success to reconcile the partnership\u2019s differences with the third partner. Joyce tried again after the meeting, but the third partner would not meet with him. Joyce testified that he relayed this information to respondent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>a call on January 15, 2006, during which respondent neither offered another course of action nor revisited the matter of his fee. After this conversation, the partners received the following communiqu\u00e9 to Joyce by facsimile:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u2018You have already begun implementation of our plan regarding your former partner. We have agreed to my legal fee of $5,000, payable $1,000 immediately and $1,000.00 on the 15th day of February, March, April and May of 2006. I will provide all necessary services to resolve the bank loan issue and the corporate procedures needed to reflect [your third partner\u2019s] resignation. This fee shall govern unless litigation becomes necessary * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">{\u00b6 11} A few days after their second telephone conversation, respondent again called Hirsch and asked about his retainer. Hirsch again replied that he and Joyce would pay if they decided to hire respondent. At that point, respondent lost his temper and became profane. He demanded his fee and threatened suit if Hirsch and Joyce did not pay. Hirsch testified to the shock and dismay he experienced after this call, and Joyce testified that Hirsch was visibly shaken when he reported respondent\u2019s use of profanity and threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">{\u00b6 12} Hirsch never spoke to respondent again. Joyce testified that respondent called him a few more times, offering first to charge a fee of only $1,000 and then of only $300. Joyce did not accept either offer and told respondent that he wanted to consult Hirsch about paying respondent $300. The next day, Hirsch and Joyce were notified that respondent had filed a lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">{\u00b6 13} In early February 2006, respondent sued Professional Dynamics in Akron Municipal Court for breach of contract, claiming that Hirsch and Joyce had agreed to pay a $1,000 retainer and a total of $5,000 in fees. His complaint alleged that he had advised Hirsch and Joyce in implementing \u201ca specific strategy\u201d to solve their partnership problem and that \u201cshortly after implementing the first step,\u201d Joyce had called him to report the success of the strategy and his optimism for a successful resolution. Joyce specifically denied these claims at the panel hearing, reiterating that respondent\u2019s \u201cstrategy\u201d had gone nowhere and that he had told respondent so.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">{\u00b6 14} Hirsch and Joyce ultimately hired another lawyer to resolve the partnership\u2019s troubles. They also had to engage a different lawyer to represent them in municipal court; that lawyer settled respondent\u2019s claim for $300. Hirsch and Joyce resigned themselves to the settlement because \u201c[e]nough time and enough money had been spent and it was time to move on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">{\u00b6 15} During the panel hearing, respondent insisted that Hirsch and Joyce had orally agreed to pay him $5,000 for his services and that he had then followed up with a facsimile to commit the agreement to writing. We agree with the panel and board, however, and conclude that the evidence does not support respondent\u2019s claim that Hirsch and Joyce agreed to respondent\u2019s representation or his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>fee. Moreover, respondent admitted at the hearing that he had spent no more than two hours of his time consulting with Hirsch and Joyce. Respondent thus must have realized that his claim for $5,000, representing a charge of $2,500 per hour for the suggestion that the partners negotiate, was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">{\u00b6 16} In fact, respondent conceded during the hearing that he either should not have filed his lawsuit or should have asserted a claim for quantum meruit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The panel and board therefore found that respondent attempted to collect fees clearly in excess of the value of his services from these two prospective clients. We agree and find that he thereby violated DR 2-106(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\n<em>B. Respondent Violated DR 7-102(A)(l) by Taking Legal Action Merely to Harass Another Person</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 17} Respondent sued Hirsch and Joyce on his own behalf and testified why he did so. His demeanor and his explanation show that he filed the action to exact punishment for what he perceived to be an attempt to obtain free legal advice. Indeed, respondent\u2019s irritation with Hirsch and Joyce for supposedly trying to benefit, free of charge, from his experience and education is easily discernible from the pages of the transcribed record. As an example, this exchange took place during respondent\u2019s deposition, taken prior to the panel hearing:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c[Relator\u2019s Counsel:] Well, do you think it is fair to sue somebody for $5,000 for an hour\u2019s worth of time? I am sorry. Two hours\u2019 worth of time?</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c[Respondent:] I am sure defense lawyers do it all the time. I would say yes. A breach of contract is a breach of contract. They got $5000 worth of advice, anyway. They were too ignorant to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c[Relator\u2019s Counsel:] I thought you said earlier that you got a call from Mr. Joyce indicating that he\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c[Respondent:] It went well. They got $5000 worth of advice. They paid nothing for it. I am glad they had problems. They deserve it. That is what shysters get for their dishonesty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">{\u00b6 22} From this evidence, the panel and board found that respondent had taken legal action for the sole purpose of harassing Hirsch and Joyce. We agree and find that he thereby violated DR 7-102(A)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>\n<em>C. Respondent Engaged in Intimidation Tactics that Adversely Reflected on His Fitness to Practice Law in Violation of DR 1-102(A)(6) and that Violated Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b623} As a cautionary measure during prehearing proceedings, relator\u2019s counsel moved for a psychological examination to determine whether respondent suffered from a mental illness that substantially impaired his ability to practice law. See Gov.Bar R. V(7)(C)(1)(b). Though respondent ultimately complied when the panel chairwoman ordered an exam, at first he vigorously resisted the motion. After he unsuccessfully moved to strike, respondent moved to dismiss the complaint, to vacate the order for the exam, for the chairwoman\u2019s recusal, and for sanctions. He argued that a letter accompanying relator\u2019s motion for a psychological examination revealed damaging information about him and constituted an ex parte communication with the chairwoman. The motions were all denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">{\u00b6 24} On April 12, 2007, respondent composed a letter to Disciplinary Counsel complaining about the purportedly improper communication between relator\u2019s counsel and the chairwoman. Ultimately, respondent chose not to send the April 12 letter to Disciplinary Counsel; however, he did send a copy of the letter to relator\u2019s counsel, creating the appearance that he had actually filed a grievance against counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">{\u00b6 25} Through the pretense of a sham grievance, respondent plainly aimed to intimidate relator\u2019s counsel and derail the disciplinary proceeding. Excerpts from respondent\u2019s deposition provide specific proof of this intent. At one point, relator\u2019s counsel asked why respondent had not attended a meeting during the disciplinary investigation, prompting this exchange:</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c[Respondent:] [Y]ou are not going to put words in my mouth. I am a lawyer. You are not smart enough to catch me doing something dishonest. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong here. You did.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c[Relator\u2019s counsel:] Okay. Well, then, let\u2019s mark this as Exhibit A.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c[Respondent:] And, believe me, a complaint is going to be filed against you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">{\u00b6 29} Later, respondent\u2019s deposition testimony left no doubt as to why he sent a copy of the April 12 letter to relator\u2019s counsel and then said nothing about not having actually filed the grievance:</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c[Relator\u2019s counsel:] Tell me when you think you should have these people sign this [notice-of-no-malpractice-insurance] form.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c[Respondent:] I think I already explained that before. After I am engaged. That is what the DR provides. Do you have a problem understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>that? Or is that not the answer you want? You want a convicting answer. Well, you are not going to get one.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c[Relator\u2019s counsel:] Fair enough. I want the truth. That is what I want. Now\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c[Respondent:] You want the truth? You have been hearing the truth. All you want is something to hang me with. It is so obvious. All right. I told you. After I am engaged. That is what the DR provides. Do you understand that? That is the truth. You can\u2019t handle the truth, can you? That is not what you are looking for.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c[Relator\u2019s counsel:] You saw that movie, as well?</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c[Respondent:] Well, it applies here. You want something that you can complain to the Supreme Court about me for. Do it. Do whatever you want. <em>And I am coming after you </em>personally.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 36} From this evidence, the panel and board found that respondent had attempted to bully and intimidate his way out of the disciplinary process. We agree and find that he thereby violated Gov.Bar V(4)(G) and DR 1-102(A)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">II. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">{\u00b6 37} To determine the appropriate length of any attorney\u2019s suspension for professional misconduct, including any attendant conditions for a stay, we consider \u201cthe duties violated, the actual or potential injury caused, the attorney\u2019s mental state, the existence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and sanctions imposed in similar cases.\u201d <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Ake, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 266, 2006-Ohio-5704, 855 N.E.2d 1206, \u00b644. We weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors to decide whether circumstances warrant a more lenient or exacting disposition. See Section 10(B) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). In deciding on a sanction, we are always mindful that the disciplinary process exists not to punish the offender but to protect the public from lawyers who are unworthy of the trust and confidence essential to the attorney-client relationship and to allow us to ascertain the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Agopian, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 103, 2006-Ohio-6510, 858 N.E.2d 368, \u00b6 10, citing <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. O\u2019Neill, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 204, 2004-Ohio-4704, 815 N.E.2d 286, \u00b6 53, and <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Weaver </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 97, 100, 70 O.O.2d 175, 322 N.E.2d 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">A <em>Duties Violated, Injury, Mental State, and Case Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">{\u00b6 38} In attempting to collect a clearly excessive fee from Hirsch and Joyce, respondent violated the legal profession\u2019s duty to charge fees in reasonable amounts. With his sham grievance against relator\u2019s counsel, respondent also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>violated his duty to assist in the process that polices the legal profession. Hirsch and Joyce suffered from respondent\u2019s overbearing reaction to their decision not to hire him and their need to defend against his suit. And until the panel hearing, relator\u2019s counsel had no idea that respondent had not actually filed a grievance against him. Moreover, respondent\u2019s actions were meant to exact a toll from Hirsch, Joyce, and relator\u2019s counsel rather than to advance legitimate claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 39} As for comparable cases, neither respondent nor relator has cited case law for our consideration. It seems that while we have sanctioned lawyers for charging excessive fees, taking legal action merely to harass another, or attempting to intimidate disciplinary authorities, we have not had a case previously that presented all three improprieties. Sanctions imposed in similar cases are thus of little assistance in our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\n<em>B. Aggravating and Mitigating Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 40} Consistent with the board\u2019s report, we find as aggravating factors that respondent\u2019s misconduct manifested a selfish motive, showed an initial lack of cooperation in the disciplinary process, and caused actual harm to the victims. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (e), and (h). Moreover, though respondent has since his deposition conceded that suing Hirsch and Joyce for $5,000 was wrong, he has remained staunchly committed to the notion that Hirsch and Joyce somehow took advantage of him, which does little to acknowledge wrongdoing. Respondent has also remained indignant toward the disciplinary process as a whole for checking his unethical conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">{\u00b6 41} Against these improprieties, only one factor weighs in respondent\u2019s favor \u2014 his lack of a prior disciplinary record. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a). Respondent might have availed himself of BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g), which affords mitigating effect upon proof that (1) a lawyer has been diagnosed with a mental disability or alcohol or drug dependency, (2) the disability or dependence contributed to cause the misconduct, (3) the disability or dependence has been successfully treated, and (4) the lawyer is currently able to practice law competently and within ethical boundaries. Respondent, however, vigorously denies any such disability or dependency.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">{\u00b6 42} In fact, respondent has eschewed any attempt to prove the mitigating effect of a possible mental health or substance-abuse problem, completely defying the findings of the psychiatrist appointed to examine him. Respondent insists that he suffers from no psychological or other health deficiencies because (1) the psychiatrist reported no mental illness and (2) a therapist\u2019s report he submitted during prehearing proceedings supports that he is at low risk for having any dependency disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>{\u00b6 43} It is true that Samuel A. Nigro, M.D., concluded that respondent did not suffer from mental illness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to his August 2007 report, however, Dr. Nigro did find that respondent exhibited a maladaptive paranoid personality, and he suspected that this mental-health concern and possible alcohol abuse likely impede respondent\u2019s ability to practice law within acceptable standards. Though skeptical that respondent would do so, Dr. Nigro recommended that respondent be assessed further for potential problem areas and follow through with any recommended treatment plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">{\u00b6 44} We have no conclusive evidence that a psychological or other mitigating condition contributed to cause respondent\u2019s misconduct. Respondent\u2019s lack of insight and combativeness toward Hirsch, Joyce, and relator\u2019s counsel, however, is not at all consistent with the reaction of a reasonable practitioner under the circumstances. Moreover, we are troubled that respondent has so strenuously resisted the possibility that his furious telephone call to Hirsch, the $5,000 lawsuit that he settled for $300, and his unwarranted threats to file a grievance are perhaps the result of disability or dependency.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 45} The panel and board recommended a one-year suspension with six months stayed under the conditions that respondent (1) consult with the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d), enter into an OLAP contract to obtain whatever disability or dependency assistance he needs, and comply with all terms for the duration of the contract, and (2) complete a one-year probation under the supervision of a monitoring attorney, appointed by relator, to ensure compliance with ethical and professional standards of practice. These conditions appropriately require respondent to address any possible disability or dependency he has and subject his practice to the rigorous monitoring, reporting, and other probationary restrictions imposed by Gov.Bar R. V(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 46} We hereby suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice law in Ohio for one year; however, the last six months of the suspension are stayed on the recommended conditions, with the one-year probation to commence upon reinstatement following the conclusion of the six-month actual suspension. If respondent fails to comply with the terms of the stay, the stay will be lifted, and respondent shall serve the entire one-year suspension. Costs, including those for the psychologi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>cal examination performed in the public interest pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(7)(C)(1)(b), are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b430-6\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b430-7\">Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-12\">. <em>\u201cQuantum, meruit </em>is generally awarded when one party confers some benefit upon another without receiving just compensation for the reasonable value of services rendered.\u201d <em>Aultman Hosp.

The board recommended that we suspend respondent\u2019s license for one year and stay the last six months on conditions. The majority accepts the board\u2019s findings of misconduct and its recommendation for a one-year suspension with the last six months stayed on conditions. I disagree with this decision because Jeffrey A. Catanzarite has practiced law for 28 years without any prior infractions and because this matter arises out of a simple miscommunication regarding attorney fees. In my view, a suspension from the practice of law is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">{\u00b6 48} A panel of the board found several aggravating factors present in this case, including findings that respondent possessed a dishonest and selfish motive, failed to cooperate in the disciplinary process, and refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct. The panel also found as mitigation, however, respondent\u2019s lack of prior disciplinary offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">{\u00b6 49} That a fee dispute sparked the Hirsch-Joyce grievance is clear. When respondent first spoke with Hirsch, he offered Hirsch a free consultation. Respondent claimed that he meant that he would not charge for the initial telephone conversation. Hirsch and Joyce understood his offer differently. They both thought, perhaps due to inexperience with retaining counsel, that their first face-to-face meeting with respondent would be free. From this basic miscommunication came respondent\u2019s furious telephone call to Hirsch, the $5,000 lawsuit that he settled for $300, and his unwarranted threats to file a grievance against relator\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">{\u00b6 50} We have no conclusive evidence that a psychological or other mitigating condition contributed to cause respondent\u2019s misconduct. His lack of insight and combativeness toward Hirsch, Joyce, and relator\u2019s counsel, however, are not consistent with the reaction of a reasonable practitioner under the circumstances. On the other hand, respondent has enjoyed a long and unblemished career in law, and this weighs heavily in his favor. Moreover, respondent personally promised during oral argument that if ordered to do so, he would obtain a more decisive diagnosis as to any possible disability or dependency and follow up with any recommended treatment.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b431-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Alfred E.

Catanzarite, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">{\u00b6 51} The panel and board recommended that respondent (1) consult with the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d), enter into an OLAP contract to obtain whatever disability or dependency assistance he needs, and comply with all terms for the duration of the contract, and (2) complete a one-year probation under the supervision of a monitoring attorney, appointed by relator, to ensure compliance with ethical and professional standards of practice. These conditions appropriately require respondent to address any possible disability or dependency he has and subject his practice to the rigorous monitoring, reporting, and other probationary restrictions imposed by Gov.Bar R. V(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">{\u00b6 52} Based on the foregoing, I would suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice law in Ohio for one year but stay the suspension on the recommended conditions. If respondent would fail to comply with the terms of the stay, the stay would be lifted, and respondent would serve the entire one-year suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 53} I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b431-6\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
