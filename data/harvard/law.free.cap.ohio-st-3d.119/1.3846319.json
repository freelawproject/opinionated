We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">{\u00b6 2} Because this case was decided on a motion for summary judgment, we view the facts in the light most favorable to appellee, Donald Howard, as administrator of the estate of Christopher Howard, against whom the trial court entered summary judgment. <em>State ex rel. Zimmerman v. Tompkins </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 447, 448, 663 N.E.2d 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">{\u00b6 3} On January 24, 2004, appellant Miami Township Fire Department conducted a day-long training exercise at 5460 Bear Creek Road in Miami Township, Montgomery County. The training involved various crews and engines from the fire department responding to real fires deliberately set by fire officials in a former dwelling on the burn site.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-16\">{\u00b6 4} The burn site is an elevated area accessed by a driveway that runs from Bear Creek Road, a gently rolling rural road. Bear Creek road has several curves, and many yellow caution signs are posted along it to indicate the type of curve that lies ahead and the recommended speed at which the curve should be negotiated. One such sign, located near the burn site\u2019s driveway, indicates a sharp right curve ahead and recommends a speed of 30 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-17\">{\u00b6 5} Water used by firefighters during the training ran from the burn site down to Bear Creek Road. At the conclusion of the training, a deputy fire chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>on duty at the burn site ordered the fire department\u2019s crews to periodically visit the burn site that evening to ensure that the fire was out and to apply road salt as needed to Bear Creek Road. He also requested that local police patrol the area that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">{\u00b6 6} Although firefighters who visited the burn site at approximately 6:00 p.m. did not find ice on the road, they spread a five-gallon bucket of salt where water had run down from the bum site onto the roadway. When they left the scene, the portions of the road that were wet were \u201cwell salted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">{\u00b6 7} The firefighters returned to the site at about 7:30 p.m. and remained there for approximately 30 minutes, again checking the road for water and ice. None was found, and no salt was added to Bear Creek Road at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">{\u00b6 8} Police also patrolled the area, and there was evidence that at approximately 9:00 p.m., the northbound side of the road was wet.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">{\u00b6 9} At approximately 10:00 p.m., appellee\u2019s 16-year-old son, Christopher Howard, drove his car northbound on Bear Creek Road with a friend, Robyn Butler, as his passenger. According to Butler, Christopher had successfully managed to negotiate the curve near the burn site while traveling at 50 m.p.h. approximately ten minutes earlier and was attempting to repeat that feat at a higher rate of speed, 60 m.p.h. - twice the speed recommended for the curve.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">{\u00b6 10} After entering the left-hand curve just past the burn site, Howard lost control of the car. His vehicle yawed across the roadway, traveled up a berm, and vaulted into the air before crashing into a tree near a culvert. Howard died instantly; Butler survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">{\u00b6 11} The first police officer to arrive at the accident scene noticed icy conditions on the roadway. He found water running onto the road and noted that it had frozen in some places and had turned slushy in others. Other officers dispatched to the accident scene also observed water, slush, and ice on the roadway, as well as fresh water flowing onto the roadway from the drive to the burn site. For summary judgment purposes, we proceed with the assumption that there was ice on Bear Creek Road and that the ice was the result of water used by the fire department at the burn site.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">{\u00b6 12} After investigating the accident, police concluded, \u201cStricken with water, rock salt, and some ice, [Christopher] failed to negotiate the left-hand curve, over-corrected, and locked up the brakes. Unable to maintain or regain control, he crossed the center-line, striking a sign post and coming to final rest roof first around a tree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">{\u00b6 13} The sensing diagnostic module (\u201cSDM\u201d) in the air-bag sensor in Christopher\u2019s car was recovered after the accident. It confirmed that Christopher had been traveling at a rate of 60 m.p.h. five seconds before the accident. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Although appellee\u2019s expert witness and accident reconstructionist, Fred Lickert, agreed that Christopher had attempted to make the turn in Bear Creek Road at a \u201ccareless\u201d rate of speed, he concluded that the roadway itself presented a hazardous condition to its ordinary users. Lickert\u2019s opinion is that it is possible for a vehicle, under optimal conditions, to negotiate the curve at speeds in excess of 70.9 m.p.h. He concluded that \u201cthe actions and inactions of the Miami Township Fire Department in failing to address the hazardous condition of the roadway were a proximate and contributing cause of this fatal accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">{\u00b6 14} Appellee brought suit against the appellants, Miami Township and the Miami Township Fire Division, alleging that the township was liable for Christopher\u2019s death because Christopher had lost control of his vehicle when it hit \u201cblack ice\u201d that had formed on the roadway due to Miami Township\u2019s negligence. The township moved for summary judgment, asserting that it was immune from liability by operation of R.C. 2744.02, the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act. The trial court agreed, concluding that general blanket immunity applies to the township and that no exception to that immunity applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">{\u00b6 15} Critical to our analysis is the trial court\u2019s finding that the ice on Bear Creek Road did not amount to an \u201cobstruction\u201d as that term is used in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3). The trial court found that the term \u201cobstruction\u201d should be given its ordinary definition \u2014 something that \u201cblocks or closes up by obstacle.\u201d Because passage through Bear Creek Road had not been blocked by any obstacle, the trial court determined that the water and ice on the road did not amount to an \u201cobstruction\u201d and held that the township was not liable for Christopher\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">{\u00b6 16} Howard appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals, which reversed. The court of appeals held that the term \u201cobstruction\u201d should be construed broadly to include any object that has the potential to interfere with the safe passage of motorists on public roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">{\u00b6 17} We accepted the township\u2019s discretionary appeal, which asserted two related propositions: that an \u201cobstruction\u201d as used in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) should be given the plain and ordinary meaning of an \u201cobstacle\u201d or \u201csomething that blocks or closes up by obstacle,\u201d and that a political subdivision\u2019s duty extends only to obstacles that block a roadway for usual and ordinary modes of travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">{\u00b6 18} Our analysis of whether a township is immune from liability pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744 is familiar. First, we begin with the understanding that political subdivisions are not liable generally for injury or death to persons in connection with a township\u2019s performance of a governmental or proprietary function. R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). Second, we consider whether an exception to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>general rule of immunity applies. R.C. 2744.02(B). If an exception does apply, we must determine whether the township can still establish immunity by demonstrating another statutory defense. R.C. 2744.03. The case before us turns on the second prong of the analysis (whether an exception to the general rule applies).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">{\u00b6 19} Pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), an exception for immunity exists for injuries or death caused by a township\u2019s \u201cnegligent failure to keep public roads in repair and other negligent failure to remove obstructions from public roads.\u201d As the trial court recognized, the critical inquiry here is whether the ice on Bear Creek Road was an \u201cobstruction.\u201d The legislature did not define that term in the statute, nor have we done so in our prior decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">{\u00b6 20} In interpreting the statute now, we again apply familiar rules. \u201c[Wjhere the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it is the duty of the court to enforce the statute as written, making neither additions to the statute nor subtractions therefrom.\u201d <em>Hubbard v. Canton City School Bd. of Edn., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 451, 2002-Ohio-6718, 780 N.E.2d 543, \u00b6 14. \u201cIf it is ambiguous, we must then interpret the statute to determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent. If it is not ambiguous, then we need not interpret it; we must simply apply it.\u201d <em>State v. Hairston, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 308, 2004-Ohio-969, 804 N.E.2d 471, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">{\u00b6 21} The plain and ordinary meaning of \u201cobstruction\u201d is \u201c1. an obstructing or being obstructed; 2. anything that obstructs; hindrance.\u201d Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary (1988) 936. \u201cObstruct\u201d is defined as \u201c1. To block or stop up (a passage) with obstacles or impediments; dam; clog; 2. to hinder (progress, an activity, etc.); impede; 3. to cut off from being seen; block (the view).\u201d Id. If the definition of obstruction meant only to \u201cblock or stop\u201d or to dam or clog, there would be no ambiguity and no debate that the ice on Bear Creek Road was not an obstruction, because there is no evidence before us that the road was not passable as a result of the ice. Accord, <em>Parker v. Upper Arlington, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-695, 2006-Ohio-1649, 2006 WL 832523, at \u00b6 14, quoting Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary (1961) 1559 (stop signs, painted crosswalks, and sidewalk ramps are not obstructions because they do not \u201cblock up\u201d or present \u201cobstacles or impediments to passing\u201d through the public roadways); <em>Monroeville v. Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie Ry. Co., </em>152 Ohio App.3d 24, 2003-Ohio-1420, 786 N.E.2d 504, \u00b6 17 (\u201cMerriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed.1996) 803, defines \u2018obstruct\u2019 as follows: \u2018to block or close up by an obstacle; to hinder from passage, action or operation; to cut off from sight\u2019 \u201d and concluding that R.C. 5589.20 and R.C. 5589.21, which prohibit railroads from obstructing a public street or roadway, \u201crequire} ] a complete blockage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">{\u00b6 22} But the dictionary definitions of obstruction also include the concepts of hindering and impeding \u2014 concepts that do not necessarily require a complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>blockage. Seizing that language, and applying opinions of the Ohio Attorney General from 25 years ago \u2014 see, e.g., 1980 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 80-071, at 2-282 \u2014 the court of appeals held that \u201c \u2018obstruction,\u2019 as it is used in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), should be interpreted to mean any object placed or erected in a public roadway that has the potential of interfering with the public\u2019s use of that roadway. An interference occurs when the public\u2019s safe use of the roadway is jeopardized.\u201d <em>Howard v. Miami Twp. Fire Div., </em>171 Ohio App.3d 184, 2007-Ohio-1508, 870 N.E.2d 197, \u00b6 23-24. It then concluded, \u201c[A]n icy mixture on a public roadway has the potential of interfering with the public's safe use of the roadway by creating an opportunity for loss of traction and/or loss of control of a vehicle\u201d and that \u201cthe township was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law under R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), because the political subdivision had a duty of care to remove this obstruction from the road.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 26. We reverse this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">{\u00b6 23} The court of appeals\u2019 conclusion ignores what we believe is a critical aspect of the analysis \u2014 the statutory history of this subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">{\u00b624} The current version of R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) was amended in part by Senate Bill 106 (\u201cS.B. 106\u201d), effective April 2003. Prior to that date, R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) read, \u201c[PJolitical subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by their failure to keep public roads, highways, streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, bridges, aqueducts, viaducts, or public grounds within the political subdivisions open, in repair, <em>and free from nuisance </em>* * (Emphasis added.) See 149 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3500, 3508.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">{\u00b6 25} Contrary to appellee\u2019s counsel\u2019s suggestion at oral argument in this case and to the Sixth District\u2019s decision in <em>Floering v. Roller, </em>Wood App. No. WD-02-076, 2003-Ohio-5679, 2003 WL 22417127, at \u00b6 27 (interpreting the current version of R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) as imposing the same duty of care on political subdivisions as it did when the statute\u2019s language included \u201cfree from nuisance\u201d), we believe that the General Assembly purposely replaced the phrase \u201cfree from nuisance\u201d with \u201cother negligent failure to remove obstructions.\u201d To find otherwise is to conclude that the legislature\u2019s action in amending the statute was a superfluous act.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">{\u00b626} We are persuaded that the legislature\u2019s action in amending R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) was not whimsy but a deliberate effort to limit political subdivisions\u2019 liability for injuries and deaths on their roadways.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">{\u00b6 27} As we noted in <em>Harp v. Cleveland Hts. </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 506, 509, 721 N.E.2d 1020, fn. 1, the General Assembly had attempted previously to make the same amendment to R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) as part of one of its tort-liability-limitation measures, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 350, 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3867, 3987, effective January 27, 1997. See <em>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 451, 458, 715 N.E.2d 1062 (holding that Am.Sub. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>H.B. No. 350 was unconstitutional because it violated the separation-of-powers doctrine and the single-subject rule). Indeed, we presume that at the time it enacted Am.Sub.H.B. No. 350, the legislature was aware of judicial decisions interpreting the term \u201cnuisance\u201d broadly to reach an array of acts or omission that endanger life or health. For example, prior to the legislature\u2019s passing Am.Sub.H.B. No. 350, we had interpreted former R.C. 2744.02(B)(3)\u2019s use of the term \u201cnuisance\u201d to include \u201cconditions that directly jeopardize the safety of traffic on the highway\u201d even if they did not appear on the roadway itself. <em>Manufacturer\u2019s Natl. Bank of Detroit v. Erie Cty. Road Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 318, 322-323, 587 N.E.2d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">{\u00b6 28} We have adhered to that precedent after <em>Sheward, </em>continuing to construe \u201cnuisance\u201d in broad terms. Thus, in <em>Harp, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 512, 721 N.E.2d 1020, we held that a defective tree limb threatening to fall on a public roadway, but not actually on the roadway, could constitute a nuisance under R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) and that a political subdivision\u2019s duty of care extended beyond merely removing obstructions from public roads. Later, in <em>Sherwin-Williams Co. v. Dayton Freight Lines, Inc., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 52, 2006-Ohio-6498, 858 N.E.2d 324, \u00b6 16, we held that a political subdivision could be held liable for injuries sustained outside the political subdivision if the injuries were caused by a nuisance that arose within its territory. In so doing, the majority in <em>SherwinWilliams </em>noted that \u201cthe General Assembly is perfectly capable of limiting the reach of a political subdivision\u2019s liability to injuries or losses that occur on property within the political subdivision,\u201d id. at \u00b6 17, and the dissenting justice invited the legislature to clarify the meaning of R.C. 2744.07(B). Id. at \u00b6 33 (Lundberg Stratton, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">{\u00b6 29} Given the General Assembly\u2019s prior inclusion of the same language in Am.Sub.H.B. No. 350, our precedent that broadly defines the term \u201cnuisance,\u201d and that S.B. 106 also limited the definition of \u201cpublic roads\u201d from a more expansive reading that included \u201cberms, shoulders, rights-of-way, or traffic control devices\u201d to one that focused solely on the roadway itself, see <em>Howard, </em>171 Ohio App.3d 184, 2007-Ohio-1508, 870 N.E.2d 197, \u00b6 17, we discern a legislative intent to limit political-subdivision liability for roadway injuries and deaths. The General Assembly, in furtherance of its goal, used the word \u201cobstructions\u201d in a deliberate effort to impose a condition more demanding than a showing of a \u201cnuisance\u201d in order for a plaintiff to establish an exception to immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">{\u00b6 30} We conclude that for purposes of R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), an \u201cobstruction\u201d must be an obstacle that blocks or clogs the roadway and not merely a thing or condition that hinders or impedes the use of the roadway or that may have the potential to do so. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b115-5\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b115-6\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, J., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b115-7\">Moyer, C J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AN\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">{\u00b6 31} As the majority states, the critical issue in this case is whether ice that has accumulated on a public road can be considered an \u201cobstruction\u201d consistent with the meaning of the term in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3). Because I believe that ice can qualify as such an obstruction, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">{\u00b6 32} R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) provides exceptions to the general concept of political subdivision immunity, stating that \u201cpolitical subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by their negligent failure * * * to remove obstructions from public roads * * The majority defines \u201cobstruction\u201d as \u201canything that obstructs\u201d and notes that the definition of \u201cobstruct\u201d is \u201c1. To block or stop up (a passage) with obstacles or impediments; dam; clog; 2. to hinder (progress, an activity, etc.); impede; 3. to cut off from being seen; block (the view).\u201d Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary (1988) 936. Under the plain meaning of the second definition of \u201cobstruct,\u201d a political subdivision could be liable for its negligent failure to remove an object that hinders or impedes safe travel on the road. Ice that has accumulated on a roadway can certainly have this effect. Because we are duty-bound to follow the plain meaning of statutes as written, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. See <em>State v. Lowe, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 507, 2007-Ohio-606, 861 N.E.2d 512, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">{\u00b6 33} However, the majority believes that this definition creates ambiguity and refers to the statutory history of the subsection for clarification. Looking to the previous version of the statute, the majority finds that that provision formerly stated that \u201cpolitical subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by their failure to keep public roads * * * open, in repair, and <em>free from nuisance </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 149 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3500, 3508. The majority acknowledges that our prior cases broadly read \u201cfree from nuisance\u201d to include conditions both on and off the public roads. However, it concludes that the General Assembly purposely replaced the phrase \u201cfree from nuisance\u201d with \u201cother negligent failure to remove obstructions\u201d so as to limit political subdivision liability to circumstances in which an obstacle blocks or clogs the roadway, as opposed to merely hindering or impeding safe travel on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>{\u00b6 34} I disagree. Our broad reading of the words \u201cfree from nuisance\u201d in prior cases meant that political subdivisions could be liable for the presence of objects outside the actual roadway that altered travel upon the roads. See, e.g., <em>Manufacturer\u2019s Natl. Bank of Detroit v. Erie Cty. Rd. Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 318, 587 N.E.2d 819, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201ca permanent obstruction to visibility\u201d along a road [here, a cornfield located in the right-of-way] could be a nuisance within the meaning of the statute); <em>Harp v. Cleveland Hts. </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 506, 512, 721 N.E.2d 1020 (a tree limb that hung over and threatened to fall onto a public road could be a nuisance). A political subdivision was therefore liable for failing to remedy a condition outside the roadway even if travel on the road itself remained unhindered.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">{\u00b6 35} The more reasonable interpretation of the new \u201cobstruction\u201d language is that the language is an attempt by the General Assembly to limit political subdivision liability to conditions <em>on the roadway itself </em>that <em>either </em>block <em>or </em>impede safe travel. This interpretation recognizes the majority\u2019s argument that the General Assembly purposely changed the language to limit political subdivision liability (by removing liability for conditions existing outside the roadway) and gives full effect to the definition of the terms \u201cobstruction\u201d and \u201cobstruct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">{\u00b6 36} Reading the statute in this manner also comports with common sense. Under the majority\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cobstruction,\u201d Miami Township could be liable if it negligently leaves a large oil drum in one lane of a public road, but not if it negligently leaves a large quantity of oil on the road, because the former would block the road and the latter would not. However, the latter situation would be at least as dangerous as the former. It makes little sense to hold political subdivisions liable for negligence that makes travel impossible while excusing liability for negligence that merely makes travel treacherous. \u201cR.C. 2744.02(B)(3) imposes on political subdivisions a duty of care to keep highways open and safe for public travel,\u201d <em>Manufacturer\u2019s Natl.
