Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">{\u00b6 1} We must determine whether a defendant\u2019s reincarceration after his release from prison violates the Double Jeopardy Clause. Under the facts of this case, we hold that the defendant had no legitimate expectation of finality when his sentence was modified on appeal to two years from eight years and the two-year sentence was stayed pending appeal to this court. Therefore, his resentencing and reincarceration did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">II. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">{\u00b6 2} A jury convicted appellant, Danny Roberts, of five counts of gross sexual imposition. On August 12, 2004, the court sentenced Roberts to four years in prison for each count. Two counts were to be served consecutively to each other, and the other sentences were to be served concurrently to the remaining sentences, for a total sentence of eight years of incarceration. The trial court justified the sentence by finding pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B) that the minimum sentence would not protect the public and would demean the seriousness of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">{\u00b6 3} Roberts appealed, arguing that the trial court erred when it sentenced him to more than the minimum sentence because judicial fact-finding violates the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. <em>State v. Roberts, </em>Hamilton App. Nos. C-040575 and C-050005, 2005-Ohio-4848, 2005 WL 2249106. The court of appeals agreed. Id. at \u00b6 11. Following its prior decision in <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 752, 2005-Ohio-1018, 825 N.E.2d 250, which interpreted several United States Supreme Court cases, including <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403, the court held that judge-made findings that affect sentencing violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights and that therefore the minimum sentence must be imposed. Id. at \u00b6 13. Consequently, the court of appeals modified Roberts\u2019s sentence on each count to the one-year minimum, with two of the sentences to run consecutively but concurrently to the other convictions, for a total sentence of two years. Id. at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">{\u00b6 4} The state filed a timely appeal in this court. On October 20, 2005, the court of appeals stayed its judgment pending disposition of the state\u2019s appeal. On January 25, 2006, we accepted the state\u2019s discretionary appeal and held the cause for a decision in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">{\u00b6 5} On February 27, 2006, we held in <em>Foster </em>that a large portion of the state\u2019s sentencing statutes, including R.C. 2929.14(B), were unconstitutional. Id. at \u00b6 97. We severed the unconstitutional provisions and held that \u201ctrial courts have full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>discretion to impose a prison sentence within the statutory range and are no longer required to make findings or give their reasons for imposing maximum, consecutive, or more than the minimum sentences.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 99-100.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">{\u00b6 6} On March 24, 2006, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (\u201cODRC\u201d) released Roberts from prison and placed him on postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 7} On May 3, 2006, this court issued an entry remanding Roberts\u2019s cause for resentencing pursuant to <em>Foster. In re Ohio Criminal Sentencing Statutes Cases, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 313, 2006-Ohio-2109, 847 N.E.2d 1174, \u00b6 168. On remand, the trial court again imposed an eight-year sentence. In June 2006, Roberts was arrested and reincarcerated to serve the time remaining on the eight-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">{\u00b6 8} Roberts appealed, arguing that his resentencing violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. The court of appeals affirmed Roberts\u2019s sentence by entry. <em>State v. Roberts </em>(June 27, 2007), Hamilton App. No. 060675.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">{\u00b6 9} This cause is now before us pursuant to our acceptance of Roberts\u2019s discretionary appeal. <em>State v. Roberts, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1437, 2007-Ohio-6518, 877 N.E.2d 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">{\u00b6 10} Roberts argues that when a person serves a prison sentence imposed by a court of appeals and the ODRC releases him, rearresting and resentencing that person to additional time violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Ohio and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">{\u00b6 11} We begin our analysis by examining the Double Jeopardy Clauses at issue, which state, \u201c[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offence to be put twice in jeopardy of life or limb,\u201d Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and \u201cNo person shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.\u201d Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution. The Double Jeopardy Clause protects persons from (1) \u201ca second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal,\u201d (2) \u201ca second prosecution for the same offense after conviction,\u201d and (3) \u201cmultiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>North Carolina v. Pearce </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656. The rationale underlying double jeopardy protection \u201cis that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for the alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d <em>Green v. United States </em>(1957), 355 U.S. 184, 187-188, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199. \u201cA primary purpose served by [the Double Jeopardy Clause] is akin to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>served by the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel \u2014 to preserve the finality of judgments.\u201d <em>Crist v. Bretz </em>(1978), 437 U.S. 28, 33, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 57 L.Ed.2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">A. Sentences Subject to Review Have No Expectation of Finality</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">{\u00b6 12} The application of the Double Jeopardy Clause to a change in a sentence depends upon the extent and legitimacy of a defendant\u2019s expectation of finality. <em>United States v. DiFrancesco </em>(1980), 449 U.S. 117, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328, addressed whether the government\u2019s appeal seeking to increase the defendant\u2019s criminal sentence violated the Double Jeopardy Clause by subjecting the defendant to multiple trials or multiple punishments for the same offense. The court stated, \u201cThe double jeopardy focus [is] to determine whether a criminal sentence, once pronounced, is to be accorded constitutional finality and conclusiveness similar to that which attaches to a jury\u2019s verdict of acquittal.\u201d Id. at 132, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 13} The court began its analysis by recognizing that the \u201c \u2018constitutional protection against double jeopardy unequivocally prohibits a second trial following an acquittal,\u2019 \u201d even when it is \u201c \u2018based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation.\u2019 \u201d <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. at 129, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328, quoting <em>Arizona v. Washington </em>(1978), 434 U.S. 497, 503, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717, and <em>Fong Foo v. United States </em>(1962), 369 U.S. 141, 143, 82 S.Ct. 671, 7 L.Ed.2d 629. Otherwise, \u201cthere would be an unacceptably high risk that the Government, with its superior resources, would wear down a defendant, thereby \u2018enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 130, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328, quoting <em>Green v. United States </em>(1957), 355 U.S. 184, 188, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199. Thus, acquittals are afforded \u201cabsolute finality\u201d for purposes of applying double jeopardy protections. Id., quoting <em>Burks v. United States </em>(1978), 437 U.S. 1, 16, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{\u00b6 14} But the court held that \u201ca sentence does not have the qualities of constitutional finality that attend an acquittal.\u201d <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. at 134, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328. In support of this premise, the court cited <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656, in which the Court held that \u201cthere was no absolute constitutional bar to the imposition of a more severe sentence on reconviction after [a] defendant\u2019s successful appeal of the original judgment of conviction.\u201d Id. at 135, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">{\u00b6 15} The court also held that the considerations that support the finality of an acquittal did <em>not </em>support the finality of a sentence. The court reasoned that the review of a sentence \u201cdoes not involve a retrial or approximate the ordeal of a trial on the basic issue of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. at 136, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s primary concern and anxiety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>obviously relate to the determination of innocence or guilt, and that already is behind him.\u201d Id. Thus, reviewing a sentence contains no risk of harassment by the government seeking to retry the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 16} Moreover, the court recognized that when the legislature has provided the government with a statutory right of appeal, \u201c[t]he defendant * * * is charged with knowledge of the statute and its appeal provisions, and has no expectation of finality in his sentence until the appeal is concluded or the time to appeal has expired.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 17} In sum, a defendant\u2019s \u201clegitimate expectations are not defeated if his sentence is increased on appeal any more than are the expectations of the defendant who is placed on parole or probation that is later revoked.\u201d Id. at 137, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328. Thus, the court determined that \u201cthe Double Jeopardy Clause does not require that a sentence be given a degree of finality that prevents its later increase.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">{\u00b6 18} The court also addressed whether the increase in the defendant\u2019s sentence constituted multiple punishments under the Double Jeopardy Clause. The court concluded that because Congress provided the government a right to appeal the defendant\u2019s sentence and the increased sentence was permitted by law, the prohibition against multiple punishments was not implicated. <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. at 138-139, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 19} Thus, the court held that the government\u2019s appeal that resulted in a longer sentence for the defendant did not run afoul of the Double Jeopardy Clause by subjecting the defendant either to multiple trials or to multiple punishments. Id. at 139, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">B. Release from Incarceration Does Not Create an Expectation of Finality</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">{\u00b6 20} An inmate\u2019s release from prison does not necessarily vest him or her with an expectation of finality regarding his or her sentence if the length of the sentence is currently an issue on appeal. In <em>United States v. Blakney </em>(Oct. 23, 1997), C.A.D.C. No. 97-3043, 1997 WL 702372, the trial court had twice imposed a sentence that was below the statutory minimum. During the government\u2019s second appeal, Blakney argued that she had completed her sentence and that to upwardly revise her sentence would violate her due process rights. Id. at *1. The court of appeals disagreed, stating, \u201cWhen the government takes a direct appeal from a district court order a defendant can have no legitimate expectation in the finality of the district court order, whether or not the defendant has been released from prison.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>State v. Straugh, </em>the prison sentence of the defendant, a.k.a. Straughn, was reduced from four years to two years on appeal. See <em>State v. Straugh </em>(Sept. 19, 2007), Hamilton App. No. C-061024. The state appealed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>we reversed Straugh\u2019s sentence pursuant to our decision in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, and remanded the cause for resentencing pursuant to <em>In re Ohio Criminal Sentencing Statutes Cases, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 313, 2006-Ohio-2109, 847 N.E.2d 1174, \u00b6 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">{\u00b6 22} However, Straugh apparently had been released from prison while the state\u2019s appeal was pending. In affirming Straugh\u2019s new sentence, the court of appeals stated that \u201cthough this case presents the unusual circumstance of Straugh having been released after serving the sentence mandated by this court\u2019s judgment, that circumstance was of no constitutional significance. In light of the state\u2019s appeal, Straugh could claim no vested right to be released after serving only two years.\u201d <em>Straugh, </em>Hamilton App. No. 061024, * 3. See generally <em>White v. Pearlman </em>(C.A.10, 1930), 42 F.2d 788, 789 (\u201cThere is no doubt of the power of the government to recommit a prisoner who is released or discharged by mistake, where his sentence would not have expired if he had remained in confinement\u201d), citing <em>Leonard v. Rodda </em>(1895), 5 App.D.C. 256, 1895 WL 11790.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 23} Finally, in <em>Ramos v. Gilkey </em>(Mar. 13, 1998), N.D.Ill. No. 97 C 7981, 1998 WL 122781, the defendant was released from prison 20 months early because of a clerical error in the judgment and commitment order. Upon discovery of the error, Ramos was arrested and reincarcerated to serve the remainder of his sentence. Ramos filed a habeas corpus petition arguing that his incarceration was illegal. In denying the writ, the court held that Ramos did not acquire a legitimate expectation of finality of a shorter sentence due to a typographical mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">C. A Stay Precludes an Expectation of Finality</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 24} In addition, we also conclude that the appellate court\u2019s October 2005 stay should have tempered Roberts\u2019s expectation of finality in his sentence. \u201cThe effect of a stay pending review in a criminal appeal is preventive in nature. It preserves the status quo of the litigation pending appellate review and <em>suspends </em>the power of the lower court to issue execution of the judgment or <em>sentence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Loeb v. State </em>(Fla.App.1980), 387 So.2d 433, 435-436. Thus, during the stay, the two-year sentence was suspended, and the original eight-year sentence was in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">{\u00b6 25} Moreover, a criminal defendant is charged with notice of a stay and has no reasonable expectation of finality regarding the sentence that is subject to the stay. <em>State v. Evers </em>(2004), 368 N.J.Super. 159, 169, 845 A.2d 674; see also <em>State v. Sanders </em>(1987), 107 N.J. 609, 619, 527 A.2d 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">{\u00b6 26} Accordingly, we hold that when a defendant\u2019s sentence is stayed on appeal, but the defendant is released from prison under the assumption that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>sentence has been served, the defendant has no expectation of finality in that sentence for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b408-13\">Joseph T. Deters, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and Scott M. Heenan, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AdB\">Charles W. Isaly, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">IV. Roberts Had No Expectation of Finality in the Two-Year Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 27} Roberts argues that jeopardy attached because his prison term had expired, and the ODRC had released him from prison. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">{\u00b628} The stay acted to temporarily suspend the two-year sentence and reinstate the original eight-year sentence. Thus, Roberts\u2019s sentence had not expired when he was released on March 24, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">{\u00b6 29} The state timely appealed Roberts\u2019s two-year sentence to this court under R.C. 2953.08(B)(2). And the court of appeals issued a stay of Roberts\u2019s two-year sentence pending our resolution of the state\u2019s appeal. We accepted the state\u2019s appeal for review and ultimately reversed Roberts\u2019s sentence. All these events occurred prior to Roberts\u2019s release from prison. Any <em>one </em>of these events placed Roberts on notice that his sentence was subject to being overturned, and in fact, the decision in <em>Foster </em>did overturn Roberts\u2019s sentence. Consequently, Roberts had no expectation of finality in the two-year sentence imposed by the court of appeals. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s resentencing of Roberts on remand to eight years did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of either the United States or Ohio Constitutions, and Roberts\u2019s reincarceration was in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">{\u00b6 30} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b408-11\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b408-12\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
