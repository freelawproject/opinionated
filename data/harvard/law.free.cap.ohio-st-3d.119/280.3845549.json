The Board of Commissioners on Character and Fitness has recommended that we disapprove the 2007 application but permit the applicant to reapply for the July 2008 exam, based on findings that she failed (1) to readily disclose a charge of driving under the influence, (2) to pay fines assessed upon her conviction of that offense, and (3) to accept responsibility for her wrongdoing. These failings warrant disapproval; however, if the applicant reapplies and is able to establish her character, fitness, and other qualifications for bar admission, she may take the February 2009 bar exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">Events Leading to the Board\u2019s Recommendation</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">{\u00b6 2} The applicant, a May 2007 graduate of the University of Cincinnati Law School, had registered as a candidate for admission to the Ohio bar in November 2005. She was stopped for driving erratically at 4:00 a.m. on April 30, 2006, in Newport, Kentucky. She had been drinking and, after registering .17 grams of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>alcohol per 210 liters of breath, was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (\u201cDUI\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">{\u00b63} Pursuant to Gov.Bar R. I(11)(C)(3) and (D)(1), two members of the Cincinnati Bar Association\u2019s admissions committee interviewed the applicant on June 13, 2006, to ascertain whether she possessed the requisite character, fitness, and moral qualifications for admission to the practice of law. The interviewers asked the applicant, \u201cIs there anything in your application that needs to be changed, updated, that would make it no longer correct? Things like changes of address, recent convictions, problems with alcohol, problems with credit and other such things?\u201d The applicant denied any such problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 4} The applicant, who eventually pleaded guilty to the DUI charge in August 2006, did not disclose the charge, then pending, during her interview. She has since explained that she did not think that she had problems with alcohol and that at the time of the interview, she had not been convicted of any offense. Within a day after her interview, however, a friend advised her that she should have disclosed the DUI charge even if she intended to contest it. As a result, the applicant quickly called one of her interviewers, and they arranged for a second interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 5} Due to scheduling and other procedural complications, however, the applicant\u2019s second interview did not take place until June 21, 2007, nearly one year after she was convicted of DUI and ordered to pay attendant fines and costs. By the time of her second interview, the applicant had also applied to take the July 2007 bar exam, properly updating her application with notice of her DUI conviction. The interviewers recommended the applicant\u2019s approval after the second interview, although they expressed some reservations about her willingness to accept responsibility for her conviction and initial nondisclosure. Their concerns stemmed in large part from an undated written statement that the applicant provided to her law school after her conviction and then supplied along with her supplemental character questionnaire. The statement, which the applicant did not recant at the panel hearing, reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cIn August or September I plead guilty to DUI charges. As I was driving my intoxicated friends home at four am on a Saturday night, I was pulled over by a bored Newport police officer, whose girlfriend was riding along, for swerving within my lane and making a wide turn. I passed the field sobriety tests, although the tape mysteriously disapeered [sic], but failed the breathalyzer due to a medical condition (IBS [irritable bowel syndrome]). Being unable to afford a decent lawyer, much less an expert on eradication [sic] and breathalyzers, I decided to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cAfter conducting some research, I was amazed at the unreliability of breathalyzers, and will never blow in one again, even if I have not had a sip of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>alcohol. Every time I get the chance I pass the knowledge I have gained from this experience to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cMoral of this story, if the system wants you, and you have little money, it will get you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 9} The bar association\u2019s admissions committee then recommended final approval of the applicant\u2019s character and fitness. In July 2007, however, the board invoked its sua sponte authority under Gov.Bar R. I(10)(B)(2)(e) to further investigate the applicant\u2019s character, fitness, and moral qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 10} Before and during the ensuing board investigation, the applicant defaulted on an agreement to apply $50 per month toward the fines and court costs assessed against her for the August 2006 DUI conviction. She finally satisfied this obligation in December 2007, shortly after she applied to take the February 2008 bar examination. The applicant reported her delay in a December 20, 2007 facsimile letter to Office of Bar Admissions, explaining that she had not realized her duty to report this arrearage in response to inquiries about newly incurred fines and debt in the supplemental character questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 11} A panel appointed by the board heard the case on January 4, 2008. The majority of the panel members recommended that the applicant be permitted to apply for the bar exam to be administered in February 2008. In recommending the applicant\u2019s disapproval, however, the board adopted the dissenting panel member\u2019s view and recommended that the applicant be permitted to apply for the July 2008 bar exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">The Board\u2019s Concerns</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">{\u00b6 12} At the panel hearing, the applicant tried to explain her initial failure to disclose the pending DUI charge, her unduly defensive letter to her law school, and her failure to pay fines as agreed. She claimed that she had decided not to disclose the DUI arrest on the advice of her lawyer, who had supposedly taken into account the applicant\u2019s lack of any alcohol dependence and lack of any recent criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">{\u00b6 13} As for her letter to the law school after her conviction, the applicant explained that she was \u201cangry and upset\u201d and that she \u201cjust wrote off the cuff and sent it and it\u2019s not something [that she] should have done.\u201d The applicant acknowledged that the letter is \u201cvery inflammatory\u201d and that she \u201chad a bad attitude about it.\u201d The applicant finished by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not used to being in trouble, and I did not handle it well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">{\u00b6 14} Finally, when asked about the delinquent payment of her court fines, the applicant replied that she did not realize the default until she received notice of her failure to qualify to take the July 2007 bar exam. When she called the court to inquire about her record, the court informed her of the arrearages. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>applicant explained that she must have forgotten the fines in the excitement of her impending wedding.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 15} The board was skeptical of the applicant\u2019s explanations, noting in particular that she supposedly forgot to pay her fines at the same time she was reporting the DUI conviction to her law school and in connection with her application for the July 2007 bar exam. Moreover, though the applicant tested .17 on a breath analyzer in a jurisdiction with a legal limit of .08 and pleaded guilty to the charged DUI, she continued to debate the validity of her conviction during the board proceedings by blaming everyone but herself. The board thus also expressed misgivings about the applicant\u2019s refusal to completely acknowledge her wrongdoing and the disrespect she directed toward the criminal justice system simply for holding her accountable for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 16} An applicant to the Ohio bar must prove with clear and convincing evidence that he or she \u201cpossesses the requisite character, fitness, and moral qualifications for admission to the practice of law.\u201d Gov.Bar R. I(11)(D)(1). The applicant\u2019s record must justify \u201cthe trust of clients, adversaries, courts, and others with respect to the professional duties owed to them.\u201d Gov.Bar R. I(11)(D)(3). Necessarily, \u201c[a] record manifesting a significant deficiency in the honesty, trustworthiness, diligence, or reliability of an applicant may constitute a basis for disapproval of the applicant.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">{\u00b6 17} Citing the lack of clear and convincing evidence, the board found:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe Applicant\u2019s conduct with regard to the DUI, her failure timely to pay fines, and to report the offense, as well as her ill-advised letter to the law school written a year after her arrest, bring into question her trustworthiness, diligence and reliability. While the conviction of the DUI itself does not necessarily reflect an untreated alcohol dependency, her conduct can be construed as reflecting dishonesty or at least a failure to provide complete and accurate information about her past. Her failure to pay her fines promptly suggests perhaps a neglect of financial responsibilities. The totality of the evidence presented suggests a failure to accept the responsibilities placed upon her and a lack of mature respect for the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">{\u00b6 19} The applicant has yet to sustain her burden of proof. We therefore accept the board\u2019s recommendation to disapprove. The applicant, provided that she is able to establish her character, fitness, and other qualifications, may apply to take the February 2009 bar exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b391-12\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>William Bruce Davis, for the Cincinnati Bar Association.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Al5\">Margaret Janet Wagner, pro se.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
