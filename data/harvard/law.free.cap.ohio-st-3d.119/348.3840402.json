Because the inmate failed to comply with R.C. 2969.25, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant, Tremaine T. Manns, an inmate at Richland Correctional Institution, filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Richland County for a writ of prohibition to prevent further prosecution in a criminal case. Manns named appellees, Richland County Common Pleas Court Judge James D. Henson, Richland County Prosecuting Attorney James J. Mayer Jr., and Richland County Clerk of Courts Linda H. Frary, as respondents. Manns\u2019s petition did not include an affidavit containing a description of each civil action or appeal of a civil action he had filed in the previous five years in any state or federal court, as required by R.C. 2969.25(A). In addition, although Manns filed an affidavit of indigency in which he claimed that he could not pay the fee to file his prohibition action, he did not file the statement required by R.C. 2969.25(C)(1) setting forth his inmate account \u201cfor each of the preceding six months, as certified by the institutional cashier.\u201d Appellees filed a motion to dismiss, and the court of appeals granted the motion and dismissed the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">{\u00b6 3} This cause is now before the court upon Manns\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">{\u00b6 4} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. It is well settled that \u201c \u2018[t]he requirements of R.C. 2969.25 are mandatory, and failure to comply with them subjects an inmate\u2019s action to dismissal.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Ridenour v. Brunsman, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 260, 2008-Ohio-854, 883 N.E.2d 438, \u00b6 5, quoting <em>State ex rel. White v. Bechtel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 11, 2003-Ohio-2262, 788 N.E.2d 634, \u00b6 5. Manns\u2019s belated attempt to file one of the required affidavits does not excuse his noncompliance. <em>Fortson v.

Nor does R.C. 2969.25(A) or (C) permit substantial compliance. See, e.g., <em>Martin v.
