The Fifth District found its judgment to be in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>conflict with the judgment of the Third District Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Phillips, </em>Logan App. No. 8-04-25, 2006-Ohio-6338, 2006 WL 3477003. We determined that a conflict exists and agreed to resolve the following issue: \u201cMay a police officer who witnesses a motorist cross a right white edge line and without any further evidence of erratic driving or that the crossing was done in an unsafe manner make a constitutional stop of the motorist?\u201d We answer this question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b62} The facts of this case are not complicated. An Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper was driving in Newark, Ohio, when he saw the vehicle in front of him drift across the white fog line by approximately one tire width. A few moments later, he observed the same thing: the vehicle drifted across the right fog line, by approximately a tire width and then drifted back into the lane. The trooper continued following the vehicle for approximately one and a half miles, and he observed no further traffic violations. The trooper then signaled to the driver to pull over the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 3} The trooper approached the vehicle and asked the driver, appellant Christopher Mays, for his driver\u2019s license. Mays handed the trooper his credit card instead, and the trooper noticed that Mays had blood-shot, glassy eyes and smelled of alcohol. The trooper had Mays step out of the car and asked him to participate in field sobriety tests, but Mays refused to participate. The trooper then arrested Mays, and Mays was subsequently charged with operation of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) and crossing marked lanes in violation of R.C. 4511.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b64} The trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress after hearing the evidence and concluding that the trooper did not have a reasonable and articulable suspicion to support the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">{\u00b6 5} The court of appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court of appeals stated that the only issue in this case was \u201cwhether crossing the white line on the right side of the road two times, together with a slight weaving within one\u2019s lane of travel, is sufficient articulable suspicion to justify a traffic stop.\u201d <em>State v. Mays, </em>Licking App. No. 2006-CA-00097, 2007-Ohio-2807, 2007 WL 1651833, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">{\u00b6 6} The court held that, under the totality of circumstances, the trooper had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that appellant may have violated the statute that requires vehicles to stay within the lane markings in most circumstances, and therefore, he was justified in stopping appellant\u2019s vehicle. Id. at \u00b6 20. Further, the court held that \u201c[wjhile a defendant may argue that there were reasons for which he or she should not have been convicted of a violation of [the marked-lanes statute], an officer is not required to have proof beyond a reasonable doubt that someone has violated the marked lane statute in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>make a traffic stop nor must an officer eliminate all possible innocent explanations for someone going over the edge lines. The officer need only have a reasonable suspicion based upon articulable facts that the driver violated the marked lanes statute. (Citation omitted.)\u201d Id. at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">I. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 7} The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution guarantee the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>State v. Orr </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 389, 391, 745 N.E.2d 1036. The United States Supreme Court has stated that a traffic stop is constitutionally valid if an officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that a motorist has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime. <em>Delaware v. Prouse </em>(1979), 440 U.S. 648, 663, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660; <em>Berkemer v. McCarty </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 420, 439, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317, quoting <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 873, 881, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607. Further, \u201c[t]he propriety of an investigative stop by a police officer must be viewed in light of the totality of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Freeman </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 291, 18 O.O.3d 472, 414 N.E.2d 1044, at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 8} Therefore, if an officer\u2019s decision to stop a motorist for a criminal violation, including a traffic violation, is prompted by a reasonable and articulable suspicion considering all the circumstances, then the stop is constitutionally valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">{\u00b6 9} The trooper in this case stopped appellant for violating R.C. 4511.33, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(A) Whenever any roadway has been divided into two or more clearly marked lanes for traffic, or wherever within municipal corporations traffic is lawfully moving in two or more substantially continuous lines in the same direction, the following rules apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(1) A vehicle or trackless trolley shall be driven, as nearly as is practicable, entirely within a single lane or line of traffic and shall not be moved from such lane or line until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">\n<em>A. Reasonable Suspicion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe Fourth Amendment imposes a reasonableness standard upon the exercise of discretion by government officials. <em>Delaware v. Prouse </em>(1979), 440 U.S. 648, 653-654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660. \u2018Thus, the permissibility of a particular law enforcement practice is judged by balancing its intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u2019 Id. at 654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660. To justify a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>particular intrusion, the officer must demonstrate \u2018specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u2019 <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889.\u201d <em>State v. Batchili, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 403, 2007-Ohio-2204, 865 N.E.2d 1282, \u00b6 11. \u201cThe \u2018reasonable and articulable suspicion\u2019 analysis is based on the <em>collection </em>of factors, not on the individual factors themselves.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">{\u00b6 13} As the United States Supreme Court elaborated in <em>Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>a police officer who lacks probable cause but whose observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a particular person\u2019s behavior is criminal may detain the person briefly to investigate the circumstances that provoked the suspicion. 468 U.S. at 439, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c \u2018[T]he stop and inquiry must be \u201creasonably related in scope to the justification for their initiation.\u201d \u2019 <em>[Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. at 881, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607] (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>supra, 392 U.S. [at 29, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889]). Typically, this means that the officer may ask the detainee a moderate number of questions to determine his identity and to try to obtain information confirming or dispelling the officer\u2019s suspicions. But the detainee is not obliged to respond. And, unless the detainee\u2019s answers provide the officer with probable cause to arrest him, he must then be released.\u201d <em>Berkemer, </em>468 U.S. at 439-440, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317. The opposite result is also true: if the detainee\u2019s answers provide the officer with probable cause to arrest him, then it is proper for the detainee to be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">{\u00b6 15} Appellant argues that his actions in this case \u2014 twice driving across the white edge line- \u2014 are not enough to constitute a violation of R.C. 4511.33. He claims that \u201cR.C. 4511.33(A) does not prohibit leaving one\u2019s lane\u201d and that \u201cabsolute observance of the lane markings is not required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">{\u00b6 16} Appellant\u2019s argument is not persuasive. R.C. 4511.33 requires a driver to drive a vehicle entirely within a single lane of traffic. When an officer observes a vehicle drifting back-and-forth across an edge line, the officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the driver has violated R.C. 4511.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">{\u00b6 17} Appellant further argues that the stop was unjustified because there was no reason to suspect that he had failed to first ascertain that leaving the lane could be done safely or that he had not stayed within his lane \u201cas nearly as [was] practicable\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 4511.33(A)(1). R.C. 4511.33 does provide for certain circumstances in which a driver may cross a lane line without violating the statute. However, the question of whether appellant might have a possible defense to a charge of violating R.C. 4511.33 is irrelevant in our analysis of whether an officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion to initiate a traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>stop. An officer is not required to determine whether someone who has been observed committing a crime might have a legal defense to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">{\u00b6 18} R.C. 4511.33(A)(1) provides that a driver must remain within the lane markings \u201cas nearly as is practicable\u201d and that a driver shall not move from a lane \u201cuntil the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.\u201d The phrase \u201cas nearly as is practicable\u201d does not give the driver the option to remain within the lane markings; rather, the phrase requires the driver to remain within the lane markings unless the driver cannot reasonably avoid straying.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 19} We agree with the Seventh District Court of Appeals\u2019 explanation of R.C. 4511.33 in <em>State v. Hodge, </em>147 Ohio App.3d 550, 2002-Ohio-3053, 771 N.E.2d 331. The <em>Hodge </em>court stated: \u201cThe legislature did not intend for a motorist to be punished when road debris or a parked vehicle makes it necessary to travel outside the lane. Nor, we are quite certain, did the legislature intend this statute to punish motorists for traveling outside their lane to avoid striking a child or animal. We are equally certain the legislature did not intend the statute to give motorists the <em>option </em>of staying within the lane at their choosing. Common sense dictates that the statute is designed to keep travelers, both in vehicles and pedestrians, safe. The logical conclusion is that the legislature intended only special circumstances to be valid reasons to leave a lane, not mere inattentiveness or carelessness. To believe that the statute was intended to allow motorists the option of when they will or will not abide by the lane requirement is simply not reasonable.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">{\u00b6 20} The court in <em>Hodge </em>also stated that it did not intend for its decision to stand for \u201cthe proposition that movement within one lane is a per se violation giving rise to reasonable suspicion, nor does inconsequential movement within a lane give law enforcement carte blanche opportunity to make an investigatory stop.\u201d Id., 147 Ohio App.3d 550, 2002-Ohio-3053, 771 N.E.2d 331, at \u00b645. However, when an officer could reasonably conclude from a person\u2019s driving outside the marked lanes that the person is violating a traffic law, the officer is justified in stopping the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">{\u00b6 21} In this case, the trial court found that the trooper observed appellant drift across the white fog line on two occasions. The trooper had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that appellant had violated R.C. 4511.33, and after approaching the vehicle and speaking with appellant, the trooper had probable cause to arrest him for driving while under the influence of alcohol. We find no error in the trooper\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\n<em>B. Probable Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">{\u00b6 22} Appellant argues that an officer is warranted in stopping a vehicle only if the officer has probable cause to believe that a motorist has committed a crime. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Appellant cites <em>Dayton v. Erickson </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 3, 665 N.E.2d 1091, in which we held that \u201ca traffic stop based upon probable cause is not unreasonable, and that an officer who makes a traffic stop based on probable cause acts in an objectively reasonable manner.\u201d Id. at 11, 665 N.E.2d 1091. Further, we held that \u201c[wjhere a police officer stops a vehicle based on probable cause that a traffic violation has occurred or was occurring, the stop is not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution even if the officer had some ulterior motive for making the stop, such as a suspicion that the violator was engaging in more nefarious criminal activity.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b519-12\">Tricia M. Moore, Assistant Newark Director of Law, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">{\u00b6 23} Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Erickson </em>and on <em>Whren v. United States </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89, is misplaced. Probable cause is certainly a complete justification for a traffic stop, but we have not held that probable cause is required. Probable cause is a stricter standard than reasonable and articulable suspicion. <em>State v. Evans </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 405, 411, 618 N.E.2d 162. The former subsumes the latter. Just as a fact proven beyond a reasonable doubt has by necessity been proven by a preponderance, an officer who has probable cause necessarily has a reasonable and articulable suspicion, which is all the officer needs to justify a stop. <em>Erickson </em>and <em>Whren </em>do not hold otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">{\u00b6 24} In this case, the trooper observed appellant twice cross the white edge fine, and he was reasonable in concluding that appellant\u2019s driving was in violation of R.C. 4511.33. Therefore, the trooper not only had a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop appellant\u2019s vehicle, he also had probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">II. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">{\u00b625} In conclusion, a traffic stop is constitutionally valid when a law-enforcement officer witnesses a motorist drift over the lane markings in violation of R.C. 4511.33, even without further evidence of erratic or unsafe driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b519-9\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Calabrese, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b519-10\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b519-11\">Anthony 0.
