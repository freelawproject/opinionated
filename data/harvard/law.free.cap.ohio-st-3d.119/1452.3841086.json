This cause originated in this court on the filing of a complaint for a writ of mandamus. It appears from the records of this court that relator has not filed a merit brief, due September 5, 2008, in compliance with the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court and therefore has failed to prosecute this cause with the requisite diligence. Accordingly, pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. X(12),</p>\n<p id=\"Aki\">It is ordered by the court that this cause is dismissed sua sponte.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
