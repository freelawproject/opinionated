Appellee\u2019s motion for reconsideration was supported by amici curiae, the Clark County Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association. Defendant-appellant, Vincent Colon, filed a memorandum opposing reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">{\u00b6 2} In <em>State v. Colon, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917 <em>{\u201cColon I\u201d), </em>this court held that the indictment against defendant was defective because it failed to charge an essential element of the offense, the mens rea of the charged offense. Id. at \u00b6 19. We further held that the defendant did not waive the defect in the indictment by failing to raise that issue at trial. Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">{\u00b6 3} Our holding in <em>Colon I </em>is only prospective in nature, in accordance with our general policy that newly declared constitutional rules in criminal cases are applied prospectively, not retrospectively. In <em>State v. Evans </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 185, 61 O.O.2d 422, 291 N.E.2d 466, we stated that \u201c \u2018application of a new rule of law to a pending appeal is not retrospective,\u2019 and * * * the new rule applie[s] to the cases pending on the announcement date.\u201d Id. at 186, 61 O.O.2d 422, 291 N.E.2d 466, quoting <em>State v. Lynn </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St.2d 106, 108, 34 O.O.2d 226, 214 N.E.2d 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">{\u00b6 4} We recently restated this principle in <em>Ali v. State, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 328, 2004-Ohio-6592, 819 N.E.2d 687, at \u00b6 6: \u201cA new judicial ruling may be applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>only to cases that are pending on the announcement date. The new judicial ruling may not be applied retroactively to a conviction that has become final, i.e., where the accused has exhausted all of his appellate remedies.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">{\u00b6 5} Therefore, the rule announced in <em>Colon I </em>is prospective in nature and applies only to those cases pending on the date <em>Colon I </em>was announced.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">{\u00b6 6} We assume that the facts that led to our opinion in <em>Colon I </em>are unique. As we stated in <em>Colon I, </em>the defect in the defendant\u2019s indictment was not the only error that had occurred: the defective indictment resulted in several other violations of the defendant\u2019s rights. 118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917, \u00b6 29. In Colon <em>I, </em>we concluded that there was no evidence to show that the defendant had notice that recklessness was an element of the crime of robbery, nor was there evidence that the state argued that the defendant\u2019s conduct was reckless. Id. at \u00b6 30. Further, the trial court did not include recklessness as an element of the crime when it instructed the jury. Id. at \u00b6 31. In closing argument, the prosecuting attorney treated robbery as a strict-liability offense. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">{\u00b6 7} In a defective-indictment case that does not result in multiple errors that are inextricably linked to the flawed indictment such as those that occurred in <em>Colon I, </em>structural-error analysis would not be appropriate. As we stated in <em>Colon I, </em>when a defendant fails to object to an indictment that is defective because the indictment did not include an essential element of the charged offense, a plain-error analysis is appropriate. 118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917, \u00b6 23. Pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B), \u201cplain errors\u201d that affect a defendant\u2019s substantial rights \u201cmay be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d In most defective-indictment cases in which the indictment fails to include an essential element of the charge, we expect that plain-error analysis, pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B), will be the proper analysis to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">{\u00b6 8} Applying structural-error analysis to a defective indictment is appropriate only in rare cases, such as <em>Colon I, </em>in which multiple errors at the trial follow the defective indictment. In <em>Colon I, </em>the error in the indictment led to errors that \u201cpermeate[d] the trial from beginning to end and put into question the reliability of the trial court in serving its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23, citing <em>State v. Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, at \u00b6 17. Seldom will a defective indictment have this effect, and therefore, in most defective indictment cases, the court may analyze the error pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B) plain-error analysis. Consistent with our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>discussion herein, we emphasize that the syllabus in <em>Colon I </em>is confined to the facts in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-6\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, and Wolff, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b314-7\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b314-8\">William H. Wolff Jr., of the Second Appellate District, sitting for Cupp, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b314-9\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"At6\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">{\u00b6 9} I continue to adhere to my earlier dissent as I anticipate uncertainty among the members of the bench and bar as to the application of a structural-error analysis, as opposed to a plain-error analysis, following the court\u2019s decision today.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">{\u00b6 10} If I understand the majority, the error here is structural because it \u201cpermeate[d] the trial from beginning to end.\u201d <em>State v. Colon, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917, \u00b6 23, citing <em>State v. Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, at \u00b6 17. But this occurred only because Colon never raised the matter at the trial level and raised it for the first time on appeal. Wouldn\u2019t every error not raised by a defendant have the potential to become structural error?</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>State v. Hill </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 191, 199, 749 N.E.2d 274, we explained that \u201cthe concept behind structural error is that certain errors are so fundamental that they obviate the necessity for a reviewing court to do a harmless-error analysis.\u201d But application of the harmless-error standard assumes that the defendant preserved the error for review, and there is no similar \u201cstructural-error exception\u201d to the plain-error doctrine under Crim.R. 52(B) when the defendant fails to object in the trial court. See id.; see also <em>Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643; <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">{\u00b6 12} I agree that errors are \u201cstructural\u201d when they \u201cpermeate the trial,\u201d <em>Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, at \u00b6 17, and infect the entire \u201c \u2018framework within which the trial proceeds.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Fisher, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 127, 2003-Ohio-2761, 789 N.E.2d 222, \u00b6 9, quoting <em>Arizona v. Fulminante </em>(1991), 499 U.S. 279, 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302. I fail to grasp, though, how structural error occurred in this case, but that a different defendant who faces a defective indictment and raises the matter as Colon did on appeal should not be treated in the same manner as Colon. As the court in <em>Neder v. United States </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 1, 14, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35, emphasized, \u201c[A] constitutional error is either structural or it is not.\u201d See also <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number><em>Stewart </em>(CA.6, 2002), 306 F.3d 295, 322, citing <em>Neder </em>at 14, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (\u201cAfter all, structural error is not to be determined on a case-by-case basis. * * * The Supreme Court\u2019s approach to such errors has been categorical\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">{\u00b6 13} Structural-error analysis does not permit a court to determine that a particular error, e.g., omission of an essential element from an indictment, is structural error in one case but not structural error in another. Rather, structural-error analysis is applied when a particular error permeates the trial and renders it fundamentally unfair in <em>every </em>case, such that, when the error occurs, \u201cno criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.\u201d <em>Rose v. Clark </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 570, 577, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">{\u00b6 14} The Supreme Court has identified the following as structural errors, and <em>every </em>case in which they occur is subject to immediate reversal on appeal: denial of counsel, <em>Gideon v. Wainwright </em>(1963), 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799; biased trial judge, <em>Tumey v. Ohio </em>(1927), 273 U.S. 510, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749; racial discrimination in the selection of a grand jury, <em>Vasquez v. Hillery </em>(1986), 474 U.S. 254, 106 S.Ct. 617, 88 L.Ed.2d 598; denial of self-representation at trial, <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 168, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122; denial of a public trial, <em>Waller v. Georgia </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 39, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31; and a jury instruction defining reasonable doubt as \u201cgrave uncertainty,\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana </em>(1993), 508 U.S. 275, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">{\u00b6 15} Omitting an essential element from an indictment does not rise to that level.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">{\u00b6 16} Finally, the majority opinion appears to conflict with our holding in <em>State v. O\u2019Brien </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 122, 30 OBR 436, 508 N.E.2d 144, in which the indictment also failed to include a judicially interpreted mens rea element of recklessness, an essential element of the offense of child endangering. We rejected O\u2019Brien\u2019s constitutional argument that amendment of the indictment, pursuant to Crim.R. 7(D), by inserting the recklessness element allowed him to be convicted of an offense not charged by the grand jury. As we stated there, the \u201c[fjailure to include the element of \u2018recklessness\u2019 in an indictment for endangering children in no way alters either the name, identity or severity of the offense charged.\u201d Id. at 127, 30 OBR 436, 508 N.E.2d 144. Thus, we held, \u201c[a]n indictment, which does not contain all the essential elements of an offense, may be amended to include the omitted element, if the name or the identity of the crime is not changed, and the accused has not been misled or prejudiced by the omission of such element from the indictment.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b316-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>William D.

Thus, I fail to see how the omission of recklessness from Colon\u2019s indictment constitutes structural error or why it requires automatic reversal, particularly when Colon failed to object in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">{\u00b6 18} For these reasons, I continue to dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b316-6\">Lundberg Stratton and Lanzinger, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b316-7\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aih\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">{\u00b6 19} Although, on motion for reconsideration, the majority announces that its decision shall not be applied retroactively, I continue to maintain my dissenting opinion as previously expressed and also join Justice O\u2019Donnell\u2019s dissenting opinion with respect to structural error.</p>\n<judges id=\"b316-9\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
