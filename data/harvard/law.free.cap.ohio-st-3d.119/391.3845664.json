Because the records request was overly broad and relator has not established his entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief, we deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Respondent Shannon Jones is the representative for the 67th District in the Ohio House of Representatives. Along with respondent Representative Josh Mandel, she sponsored Sub.H.B. No. 151 (\u201cH.B. No. 151\u201d), which, if enacted, would require certain public investors to divest holdings in companies conducting specified types of business in Iran and Sudan, http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/ bills.cfm?ID=127_HB_151.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">{\u00b6 3} Relator, Jeffrey L. Glasgow, is an attorney who alleges that he is a Public Employee Retirement System (\u201cPERS\u201d) retiree concerned about the effect of H.B. No. 151 on the earnings of PERS and other public-employee pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">{\u00b6 4} In June 2007, Glasgow requested the following public records from Jones for the period from the date she took office, January 1, 2007, through June 14, 2007:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c1. All e-mails sent or received by you in your capacity as a State Representative from the date of your service as such Representative, specifically including, but not limited to, any e-mails having as their subject matter Substitute House Bill 151 of the 127th General Assembly or discussions that led to the introduction of Substitute House Bill 151 or any predecessor bill. This request includes any and all deleted e-mails and any e-mails stored on your office computer or on any other computer. This request also includes, but is not limited to, any and all e-mails on private e-mail systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c2. All text messages sent or received by you in your capacity as a State Representative from the date of your service as such Representative, specifically including, but not limited to, any text messages having as their subject matter Substitute House Bill 151 of the 127th General Assembly or discussions that led to the introduction of Substitute House Bill 151 or any predecessor bill and any text messages sent or received by you during committee hearings on such Bill. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>request includes any messages sent or received at any time on either state owned or private cellular communication devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c3. All written correspondence sent or received by you in your capacity as a State Representative from the date of your service as such Representative including, but not limited to, correspondence having as its subject matter House Bill 151 or discussions that led to or have any connection whatsoever with the introduction of Substitute House Bill 151 of the 127th General Assembly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">{\u00b6 8} Glasgow requested similar records from Mandel.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b6 9} Jones interpreted the request addressed to her to be limited to records related to H.B. No. 151 or the general subject of divestiture of investments in Iran and Sudan. In response to the request, Jones provided a box of documents that included 26 printed e-mail messages. The e-mail messages had been sent by citizens to the general e-mail account for the 67th House District. One e-mail chain from Jones\u2019s private AOL e-mail account, which was attached as an appendix to a briefing packet for the bill, was also provided to Glasgow. Jones did not, however, provide other e-mail messages from her private account because, at the time, she did not believe that these records could be public records. Jones provided all of her office\u2019s files concerning H.B. No. 151 and divestment, including materials that might be privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Mandamus Case</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">{\u00b6 10} On August 1, 2007, Glasgow filed this action for a writ of mandamus to compel Representatives Mandel and Jones to provide the requested records. Following an unsuccessful attempt at mediation, we granted an alternative writ on Glasgow\u2019s mandamus claim against Jones and stayed the claim against Mandel in accordance with the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, Section 522, Title 50 App., U.S.Code. Jones later provided ten more e-mails concerning H.B. No. 151 and the divestment of funds related to Iran and Sudan to Glasgow, which she discovered by asking the chief information officer of the House of Representatives to search her government e-mail account, shannon.jones@ohr.state.oh.us. Glasgow also received from PERS two e-mail messages sent to Jones at her personal AOL account that related to H.B. No. 151, which he implies establishes that Jones failed to turn over all of the requested e-mail messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">{\u00b6 11} Pursuant to the alternative writ, Glasgow and Jones submitted evidence and briefs. This case is now before the court upon Glasgow\u2019s mandamus claim against Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">Mandamus: General Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cMandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Physicians Commt. for Respon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>sible Medicine v. Ohio State Univ. Bd. of Trustees, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 288, 2006-Ohio-903, 843 N.E.2d 174, \u00b6 6; R.C. 149.43(C)(1). \u201c[T]he requirement of the lack of an adequate legal remedy does not apply to public-records cases.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Gaydosh v. Twinsburg </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 576, 580, 757 N.E.2d 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">{\u00b6 13} The Public Records Act reflects the state\u2019s policy that \u201copen government serves the public interest and our democratic system.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dann v. Taft, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 364, 2006-Ohio-1825, 848 N.E.2d 472, \u00b6 20. Consistent with this policy, we construe R.C. 149.43 liberally in favor of broad access and resolve any doubt in favor of disclosure of public records. <em>State ex rel. Carr v. Akron, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 351, 2006-Ohio-6714, 859 N.E.2d 948, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 14} Before considering the merits of Glasgow\u2019s mandamus claim, it is important to recall certain definitions. \u201c \u2018Public record[s]\u2019 means records kept by any public office * * \u201d R.C. 149.43(A)(1). \u201c \u2018Public office\u2019 includes any state agency\u201d and \u201c\u2018[s]tate agency\u2019 includes * * * the general assembly.\u201d R.C. 149.011(A) and (B). \u201c \u2018Public official\u2019 includes all officers, employees, or duly authorized representatives or agents of a public office.\u201d R.C. 149.011(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">{\u00b6 15} The Ohio House of Representatives is a public office, and Representative Jones is a public official subject to R.C. 149.43. As a representative, Jones considers, sponsors, and votes upon legislation and communicates with legislators and legislative staff about pending legislation, with constituents on matters of concern to them, and with citizens who may have an interest in pending legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Mandamus: Improper Request</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">{\u00b6 16} Jones contends that a request for all e-mail messages, text messages, and correspondence sent to and from a public official is not a proper public-records request. More specifically, Jones asserts that (1) e-mail is not a category of records, (2) the request lacks sufficient specificity and particularity to constitute an enforceable request, and (3) the request for correspondence does not match her storage method for those records (i.e., Glasgow asked for correspondence by date, but Jones stores correspondence by constituent name or bill number).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">{\u00b6 17} Glasgow requested broad categories of records (e-mail messages, text messages, written correspondence) sent and received by Jones for the entire time from when she took office until the date of the request. \u201c \u2018[I]t is the responsibility of the person who wishes to inspect and/or copy records to identify with reasonable clarity the records at issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Morgan v. New Lexington, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 33, 2006-Ohio-6365, 857 N.E.2d 1208, \u00b6 29, quoting <em>State ex rel. Fant v. Tober </em>(Apr. 28, 1993), Cuyahoga App. No. 63737, 1993 WL 173743, *1, affirmed in <em>State ex rel. Fant v. Tober </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 117, 623 N.E.2d 1202. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>In identifying the records at issue, the Public Records Act \u201cdoes not contemplate that any individual has the right to a complete duplication of voluminous files kept by government agencies.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Warren Newspapers, Inc. v. Hutson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 619, 624, 640 N.E.2d 174, citing <em>State ex rel. Zauderer v. Joseph </em>(1989), 62 Ohio App.3d 752, 577 N.E.2d 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">{\u00b6 18} For example, in <em>Zauderer, </em>62 Ohio App.3d at 756, 577 N.E.2d 444, the court held that a request that a police chief, county sheriff, and highway patrol superintendent provide access to \u201call traffic reports\u201d was improper because it was \u201cfirst unreasonable in scope and, second, if granted, would interfere with the sanctity of the recordkeeping process itself.\u201d And in <em>State ex rel. Dillery v. Icsman </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 312, 314, 750 N.E.2d 156, we held that a request to a police chief for \u201cany and all records' generated * * * containing any reference whatsoever to Kelly Dillery\u201d was overbroad and failed to identify that the relator actually wanted only offense and incident reports referring to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 19} Based on this precedent, we hold that insofar as Glasgow broadly sought all of Jones\u2019s work-related e-mail messages, text messages, and correspondence during her entire tenure as state representative, his request was improper because it was overly broad. In essence, Glasgow\u2019s general request impermissibly sought what approximated a \u201ccomplete duplication\u201d of Jones\u2019s files. Therefore, Jones acted appropriately in restricting her response to Glasgow\u2019s request to records related to H.B. No. 151 and the divestiture of investments in Iran and Sudan. We next determine the propriety of Glasgow\u2019s mandamus claim insofar as it is narrowed to records concerning these specified topics.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Records Subject to R.C. 149.43</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">{\u00b6 20} The requested e-mail messages, text messages, and correspondence are \u201crecords\u201d subject to the Public Records Act if they are \u201c(1) documents, devices, or items, (2) created or received by or coming under the jurisdiction of the state agencies, (3) which serve to document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Johnson, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 160, 2005-Ohio-4384, 833 N.E.2d 274, \u00b6 19; R.C. 149.011(G).'</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Mandamus: The Specific Records Requested</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">{\u00b6 21} E-mail messages and correspondence are \u201cdocuments, devices, or items\u201d under the first prong of the definition of \u201crecords.\u201d More specifically, e-mail messages constitute electronic records under R.C. 1306.01(G) because they are records \u201ccreated, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means.\u201d See R.C. 149.011(G), which includes \u201can electronic record as defined in section 1306.01 of the Revised Code\u201d as a \u201cdocument, device, or item\u201d within the definition of \u201crecord.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Second, the e-mail messages and correspondence requested are only those either created or received by Jones in her capacity as a state representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 23} For the final requirement, Jones concedes that e-mail messages created or received by her in her capacity as state representative that document her work-related activities constitute records subject to disclosure under R.C. 149.43 regardless of whether it was her public or her private e-mail account that received or sent the e-mail messages. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Wilson-Simmons v. Lake Cty. Sheriff\u2019s Dept. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 37, 42, 693 N.E.2d 789, fn. 1 (an e-mail message from a public office\u2019s e-mail system can be a public record if it documents the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the public office). Based on this concession, we need not address the issue whether an e-mail message sent from or to a private account can be a public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">{\u00b6 24} With respect to the types of records requested, the evidence here establishes that if the requested e-mail messages concerning H.B. No. 151 constitute records for purposes of R.C. 149.43, as conceded by Jones, they are subject to disclosure unless otherwise excepted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">{\u00b6 25} The requested text messages and correspondence, however, are not records. The evidence is uncontroverted that Jones\u2019s text messages do not document work-related matters. They are therefore not records subject to R.C. 149.43. <em>Johnson, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 160, 2005-Ohio-4384, 833 N.E.2d 274, \u00b6 25. In so holding, we need not decide the issue of whether text messages could generally constitute items subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">{\u00b6 26} For the requested correspondence, Glasgow limited his argument in his merit brief primarily to the requested e-mail messages and, to a lesser extent, the requested text messages. Thus, we do not address Glasgow\u2019s initial records request for correspondence. <em>State ex rel. Ohio Gen. Assembly v. Brunner, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 386, 2007-Ohio-3780, 872 N.E.2d 912, \u00b626, fn. 4 (court need not address claim for writ of mandamus that was raised in complaint but was not specifically argued in merit brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">{\u00b6 27} Therefore, Glasgow\u2019s mandamus claim is restricted to the requested email messages relating to H.B. No. 151. For these records, Jones has established that Glasgow has now received all the e-mail messages relating to H.B. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>151 that were sent or received by Jones in her capacity as state representative. Therefore, Glasgow\u2019s claim for these e-mail messages is moot. See <em>State ex rel. Toledo Blade Co. v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>106 Ohio St.3d 113, 2005-Ohio-6549, 832 N.E.2d 711, \u00b6 16 (providing requested records to a relator in a public-records mandamus case moots the claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">{\u00b6 28} Because Glasgow is not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus, we deny the writ. We thus do not address Jones\u2019s additional contention that the requested e-mail messages are excepted from disclosure because she is immune from suit and the e-mail messages are covered by legislative privilege under the Speech or Debate Clause of the Ohio Constitution. See <em>State ex rel. Sawyer v. Cendroski, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 50, 2008-Ohio-1771, 885 N.E.2d 938, \u00b6 10 (general rule that court will not issue advisory opinions).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Attorney Fees and Statutory Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">{\u00b6 29} Glasgow requests an award of attorney fees. An award of attorney fees under the applicable version of R.C. 149.43 is not mandatory. <em>State ex rel. Fox v. Cuyahoga Cty. Hosp. Sys. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 108, 529 N.E.2d 443, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cIn granting or denying attorney fees under R.C. 149.43(C), courts consider the reasonableness of the government\u2019s failure to comply with the public records request and the degree to which the public will benefit from release of the records in question.\u201d <em>Wadd, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 54, 689 N.E.2d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">{\u00b6 30} Because Glasgow\u2019s mandamus claim lacks merit, i.e., the request for records other than those related to H.B. No. 151 (because it was overbroad), the request for text messages (because none were work-related), the request for correspondence (because Glasgow abandoned his claim), and the request for email messages (because Glasgow has now received all of those related to H.B. No. 151), he is not entitled to attorney fees. <em>State ex rel. Musial v. N. Olmsted, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 459, 2005-Ohio-5521, 835 N.E.2d 1243, \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">{\u00b6 31} Glasgow is also not entitled to an award of statutory damages under the current version of R.C. 149.43. The amendment became effective on September 29, 2007, and does not apply retroactively to this mandamus case. 2006 Sub.H.B. No. 9; R.C. 1.48.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">{\u00b6 32} Because Glasgow\u2019s request was overbroad and he has not established his entitlement to the requested records, we deny the writ. We also deny Glasgow\u2019s request for attorney fees and statutory damages. This case remains pending on Glasgow\u2019s mandamus claim against Representative Mandel.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">Writ denied.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Plank &amp; Brahm and Aaron M.
