Because the sentencing judge did not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction to amend the sentencing entry, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">{\u00b6 2} In November 2006, appellee, Summit County Court of Common Pleas Judge Patricia A. Cosgrove, sentenced appellant, Phillip R. Plant, to two years in prison and five years of postrelease control upon his guilty plea to a charge of aggravated trafficking in drugs. In March 2007, Judge Cosgrove amended the sentencing entry to include the following language: \u201cBy law, this sentence must be served consecutively to any other sentence the Defendant is serving.\u201d The court of appeals dismissed Plant\u2019s appeal from the sentence based on that court\u2019s view that the common pleas court\u2019s 2006 entry was not final and appealable, as it did not set forth a finding of guilt. Judge Cosgrove subsequently issued another entry in February 2008 that rectified the omission, making it a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">{\u00b6 3} Plant filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Summit County for writs of prohibition and mandamus to compel Judge Cosgrove to void the amended sentence. The court of appeals dismissed Plant\u2019s petition sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">{\u00b6 4} In his appeal as of right, Plant asserts that the court of appeals erred in dismissing his petition. \u201cA court may dismiss a complaint sua sponte and without notice when the complaint is frivolous or the claimant obviously cannot prevail on the facts alleged in the complaint.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Brooks v. O'Malley, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 385, 2008-Ohio-1118, 884 N.E.2d 42, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cNeither mandamus nor prohibition will issue if the party seeking extraordinary relief has an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>Dzina v. Celebrezze, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 385, 2006-Ohio-1195, 843 N.E.2d 1202, \u00b6 12. In the absence of a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court having general subject-matter jurisdiction can determine its own jurisdiction, and a party contesting that jurisdiction has an adequate remedy by appeal. <em>State ex rel. Powell v. Markus, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 219, 2007-Ohio-4793, 874 N.E.2d 775, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b373-10\">Phillip R. Plant, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Arq\">Sherri Bevan Walsh, Summit County Prosecuting Attorney, and Richard S. Kasay, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">{\u00b6 6} Judge Cosgrove did not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction to amend Plant\u2019s sentence to correct it before his sentence expired. A trial court retains continuing jurisdiction to correct a sentence that disregards statutory requirements or to correct clerical errors. <em>State ex rel. Cruzado v. Zaleski, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-5795, 856 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 19-20. Plant did not specifically contend in his petition that Judge Cosgrove\u2019s amendment was not dictated by a statutory requirement as the amended sentencing entry appeared to suggest.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">{\u00b6 7} Therefore, because Plant\u2019s claims lacked merit, the court of appeals properly dismissed them. Plant has an adequate remedy by appeal from Judge Cosgrove\u2019s February 2008 sentencing entry. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b373-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
