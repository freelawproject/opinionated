We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">{\u00b6 2} Defendant-appellee, Charles W. Bartholomew, pleaded guilty to one count of rape of a minor under 13 years of age in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b). The trial court sentenced him to a prison term of ten years, imposed court costs, and ordered him to \u201cpay $426.00 restitution to the Attorney General\u2019s Victims of Crime [fund] for reimbursement to the victim\u201d for counseling expenses. Bartholomew did not object to his sentence or to the restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-14\">{\u00b6 3} Bartholomew appealed the order imposing restitution, arguing that counseling expenses do not constitute \u201ceconomic loss\u201d under R.C. 2929.18(A)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Third District reversed on other grounds, holding that the current version of R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) does not authorize the trial court to order Bartholomew to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>restitution to a third party, including the reparations fund in this case. The state appealed, and we accepted this discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">{\u00b6 4} First, we must clarify a misnomer in the trial court\u2019s order. The trial court referred to \u201cthe Attorney General\u2019s Victims of Crime [fund]\u201d and ordered Bartholomew to pay $426 \u201cfor reimbursement to the victim.\u201d But there is no fund identified as the \u201cAttorney General\u2019s Victims of Crime\u201d fund in the Revised Code. In fact, there are four funds associated with victims of crime: (1) the reparations fund, R.C. 2743.191, (2) the Court of Claims victims of crime fund, R.C. 2743.531, (3) the crime victims recovery fund, R.C. 2929.32(D), and (4) the recovery of offender\u2019s profits fund, R.C. 2969.06. The attorney general, however, may order payments to victims only from the reparations fund; therefore, we will focus on that fund.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Interpretation of R.C. 2929.18(A)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 5} In 1976, the General Assembly created a reparations fund for purposes of \u201crequiring] the state * * * to pay awards of reparations to victims of crimes and their dependents.\u201d Title of Sub.H.B. No. 82, 136 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1504. R.C. 2743.52(A) authorizes the attorney general to make awards of reparations for economic loss arising from criminally injurious conduct. In this case, the Attorney General\u2019s Office ordered an award of $426 to the victim\u2019s mother to reimburse her for the victim\u2019s counseling expenses and asked that Bartholomew\u2019s sentence include a restitution order in that same amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">{\u00b6 6} As part of a defendant\u2019s felony sentence, a trial court may impose one or more financial sanctions, including restitution, fines, or costs. R.C. 2929.18. Specifically, R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c[T]he court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a felony may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions authorized under this section * * *. Financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(1) Restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender\u2019s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the victim\u2019s economic loss. If the court imposes restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the victim in open court, to the adult probation department that serves the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>on behalf of the victim, to the clerk of courts, or <em>to another agency designated by the court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">{\u00b6 9} Thus, the question in this case is whether the reparations fund created by R.C. 2743.191 is a permissible \u201cagency designated by the court\u201d under R.C. 2929.18(A)(1). We hold that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">{\u00b6 10} When interpreting a statute, \u201cthe reviewing court must ascertain the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute. <em>Rosette [v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.], </em>105 Ohio St.3d 296, 2005-Ohio-1736, 825 N.E.2d 599, \u00b6 12. To determine the intent of a statute, a court looks to the language of the statute, giving effect to the words used. <em>Rice v. CertainTeed Corp. </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 417, 419, 704 N.E.2d 1217. A court is neither to insert words that were not used by the legislature nor to delete words that were used. Id.\u201d <em>Cleveland Mobile Radio Sales, Inc. v. Verizon Wireless, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 394, 2007-Ohio-2203, 865 N. E.2d 1275, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">{\u00b6 11} From the plain language of the statute, an \u201cagency designated by the court\u201d is one of four possible payees for whose benefit a trial court may order that restitution be paid. To determine whether the reparations fund is such an agency, we look to the legislative intent of the statute. The state argues that because we have previously determined that the Attorney General\u2019s office is an agency of the state, <em>Ohio Boys Town, Inc. v. Brown </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 1, 4, 23 O.O.3d 1, 429 N.E.2d 1171, and because the reparations fund is an arm of the Attorney General\u2019s Office, it also qualifies as an agency. It is true that the attorney general has significant duties with regard to the reparations fund. The attorney general is responsible for investigating a claim for reparations, R.C. 2743.59; determining whether an application for reparations will be granted, R.C. 2743.52; preparing an annual report of the activities of the program, R.C. 2743.69(A); creating a pamphlet which informs victims of the availability of awards of reparations, R.C. 109.42; and instituting and pursuing legal proceedings against an offender for repayment of an award. R.C. 2743.72(M).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">{\u00b6 12} Even if we did not consider the attorney general\u2019s role in the reparations program, it is beyond cavil that the purpose of R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) is to require the offender to reimburse the victim \u2014 or whatever entity paid the victim \u2014 for the economic loss caused by the crime. In the instant case, the reparations fund paid the victim\u2019s mother $426 for counseling expenses incurred as a result of the crime. It is clear, therefore, that the General Assembly intended the reparations fund to be a permissible agency to whom a court may order restitution. In fact, we need not rely on our interpretation of the legislature\u2019s intent, plain as it is, because this result is specifically authorized by R.C. 2743.72(E), which states that \u201c[t]he reparations fund is an eligible recipient for payment of restitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>{\u00b6 13} Nonetheless, the Third District ignored the plain language of R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) and determined that trial courts no longer have the authority to order that restitution be paid to anyone other than the victim or a survivor of the victim, based on our statement in <em>State v. Kreischer, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 391, 2006-Ohio-2706, 848 N.E.2d 496, \u00b6 1. There, we stated that on June 1, 2004, \u201cthe legislature amended R.C. 2929.18 to delete all references to restitution for third parties. See 2003 Sub.H.B. No. 52.\u201d The appellate court\u2019s reliance on <em>Kreischer </em>is misplaced for two reasons. First, <em>Kreischer </em>presented us with a certified conflict on the question whether a trial court may order a convicted defendant in a criminal case to pay restitution to <em>a third-party insurer </em>for medical costs it paid on behalf of the victim under former R.C. 2929.18(A)(1), 148 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 8674, 8767. Id. at \u00b6 5. We were not dealing with the statutory language at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">,{\u00b6 14} Second, in noting that subsequent amendments to R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) had \u201cdelet[ed] all references to restitution for third parties,\u201d <em>Kreisker </em>at \u00b6 1, we were perhaps not as precise as we should have been. The amendments to R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) did not eliminate all third-party payees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As noted above, a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>court under the current version of R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) retains the discretion to order that restitution be paid to certain third parties, namely, an adult probation department, the clerk of courts, or another agency designated by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">{\u00b6 15} Bartholomew also relies on decisions from the Third and Fourth Districts in support of his argument that the General Assembly intended to terminate restitution to third parties. In holding that the legislature meant to exclude all third parties, these decisions rely on a passage from the Legislative Service Commission\u2019s final Bill Analysis of 2003 Sub.H.B. No. 52, which states that the bill \u201crepeals all of the language that pertains to the restitution order requiring that reimbursement be made to third parties, including governmental agencies or persons other than governmental agencies, for amounts paid to or on behalf of the victim or any survivor of the victim for economic loss.\u201d <em>State v. Didion, </em>173 Ohio App.3d 130, 2007-Ohio-4494, 877 N.E.2d 725, \u00b627; <em>State v. Smith, </em>4th Dist. No. 07CA25, 2008-Ohio-142, 2008 WL 160922, \u00b6 4. This reliance on the bill analysis, however, is misplaced. First, the bill analysis notes only that the legislation repealed the language that <em>required </em>restitution to third parties. The amendment did not <em>prohibit </em>such restitution. Second, the quotation is incomplete. When the omitted language is added, it further refutes the notion that third-party restitution was forbidden: the bill \u201c[mjodifies the provisions regarding restitution as a financial sanction that may be imposed upon a felony offender by: (1) <em>clarifying that restitution is discretionary </em>and <em>repealing the language </em>that pertains to the restitution order <em>requiring </em>that reimbursement be made to third parties, including governmental agencies or persons other than governmental agencies, for amounts paid to or on behalf of the victim or any survivor of the victim for economic loss * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">{\u00b6 16} Thus, it is clear that the General Assembly intended to eliminate any perception that restitution to third parties was <em>mandatory. </em>If the General Assembly had truly intended that restitution could be paid only to a victim, it would have eliminated adult probation departments, clerks of courts, and other agencies as designated by the court as possible payees. It would have also repealed R.C. 2743.72(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">{\u00b6 17} Because we must give effect to the statute as written, we hold that R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) authorizes a trial court to order that a criminal defendant pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>restitution to the reparations fund for payments made by the fund to a victim of crime for economic loss caused by the offender.
