Judge Alexander presiding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-7\">Hai\u2019vey Hall filed his petition for- foreclosure of a mortgage, made to him by Wheelock and Willard, of certain lots of land. A <em>rule nisi </em>was granted and duly served on the mortgagors; and, at the May Term, 1847, of the Court below, the said Hall moved that bis rule be made absolute. This motion was resisted by Daniel McDougald, the plaintiff in error, who alleged his objections in writing, that he was himself the owner of a part of said land ; that the mortgage had been foreclosed before the land was s,old under it, and that at the sale he had purchased a part thereof; that there was nothing due upon the mortgage; that Wheelock and Willard neyer had any title to the land, and that he himself held a mortgage from Nathan P. Willard, the true owner. There were several other objections made by the said McDougald, all of which would have been good pleas if held by the mortgagors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-8\">The Court below overruled the objections, deciding that said McDougald was a stranger to the suit, not being a party thereto, and had no right to interfere to prevent the rule absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-9\">To this decision McDougald excepted, and the same is assigned for error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-10\">The counsel for the defendant in error, joined issue with a <em>pro* testando, </em>demurring to the writ of error, on the ground that thfe same was not filed and prosecuted by any party or privy to the suit pending.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-11\">Jones, Benning &amp; Jones, submitted the following points and authorities:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-12\">\u25a0 1st.

His application was not to be <em>made a party </em>to the Suit in the Court below- \u2014 he only appeared by his counsel,\u2022 and offered <em>objections </em>to the foreclosure of the mortgage ; and contends that that would have the effect to make him a party. We do not think so, nor do we think he had any right to be heard, until he was regularly made a party, by the <em>judgment of the court. </em>It would be intolerable, and greatly embarrass the proceedings in courts' of justice, if individuals, at their pleasure, could be permitted to interlope into cases to which they were not parties, and make objections. If McDougald has such rights and interests in the mortgaged property as is suggested by his counsel, we do not see in; what manner they are to be prejudiced by the foreclosure of th\u00e9 mortgage, as between other parties. When the judgment of foreclosure had between the parties to \u25a0 the record in this case&gt; shall be made to operate on his interests, he will have ample op-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>portunity to assert them : the judgment of foreclosure between Hall and Wheelock and \"Willard, will not foreclose any rights which he may have to the mortgaged property, unless he claims title under them. Let the \u2022 judgment of the Court below be affirmed..</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Judgment affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
