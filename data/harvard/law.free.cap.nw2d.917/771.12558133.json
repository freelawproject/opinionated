In both decisions, the WCCA concluded that Lein had established that her injury arose out of her employment.\n   <em>\n    Lein v.

In its 2017 decision, the WCCA relied, in part, on its decision in\n   <em>\n    Roller-Dick v.

Shortly thereafter, we held oral argument in\n   <em>\n    Roller-Dick v. CentraCare Health System\n   </em>\n   , and on August 8, 2018, we affirmed the WCCA's decision in that case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12557567\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/916/373/#p375\">\n    916 N.W.2d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 375 (Minn. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Based upon all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the decision of the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals filed and served on December 29, 2017 be, and the same is, affirmed without opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoff v.
