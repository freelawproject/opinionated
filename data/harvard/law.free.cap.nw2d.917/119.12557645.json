Because the district court sentenced appellant to the statutory maximum on count one, we conclude that it unduly exaggerated appellant's criminal conduct to impose both a consecutive sentence and the statutory maximum on count two. Thus, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for resentencing on count two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 15, 2015, then-12-year-old C.B., a developmentally and cognitively disabled girl, reported neglect and poor\n   conditions at home to a school counselor. A few days later, she told a school social worker that her parents-appellant Brian Arthur Barthman and his wife-needed help. C.B. said that appellant needed help because he physically and sexually abused her. During a forensic interview, C.B. described multiple incidents of sexual contact and sexual penetration by appellant, and indicated that appellant touched her on her breasts and between her legs, and that he sexually penetrated her with his penis and with a sex toy-the \"vibrator\" incident. The incidents occurred at the family's home sometime between October 31, 2012, and December 18, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   C.B. was removed from the home following the forensic interview. In a subsequent therapy session in January 2016, C.B. disclosed that her mother was present during some of appellant's sexual abuse and that her mother also had sexual contact with her. During a second forensic interview, C.B. described an incident in her parents' bedroom when both her mother and appellant had sexual contact with her genitals-the \"all three in bed\" incident. C.B. also described another incident in the living room when her mother was present and masturbated as she watched appellant sexually abuse C.B.-the \"mom in rocker\" incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant was charged with multiple counts of CSC. Appellant's criminal complaint was amended twice to include six counts of first-degree CSC. The case was tried to a jury in March 2017. C.B. and her mother testified at the trial, as did school workers, counselors, social workers, law enforcement, and medical professionals who had worked with C.B. and the family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the state rested its case-in-chief, the state moved to amend the complaint for a third time to charge only three counts of first-degree CSC and three counts of second-degree CSC based on the facts elicited at trial. The district court granted the amendment without challenge. The jury found appellant guilty on all six counts. The state sought aggravated sentences, and the jury affirmatively answered five questions related to the aggravating-sentencing factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the May 2017 sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced appellant to the statutory maximum sentence of 360 months (30 years) for first-degree CSC on count one, and to the statutory maximum sentence of 360 months (30 years) also for first-degree CSC on count two, to be served consecutively. Appellant asks this court to reverse his convictions or to remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.

There was sufficient evidence to find appellant guilty on count two.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction of first-degree CSC on count two-the \"vibrator\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   incident. Our review of the sufficiency of the evidence is limited to a thorough analysis of the record to determine if the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the conviction, is sufficient to allow the jurors to reach the verdict that they did.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Sexual penetration includes \"any intrusion however slight into the genital or anal openings ... of the complainant's body by ... any object used by the actor for this purpose.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.341\">\n    Minn.

The prosecutor then asked, \"Did dad put anything else inside of your private spot other than his penis?\" After C.B. responded \"yes,\" the prosecutor inquired, \"What did he-what was the next thing that he used on your private spot?\" C.B. testified that he used a \"bad\" or \"wrong toy,\" which she called a \"sex toy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Appellant contends that the prosecutor's use of \"on\" suggests that appellant put the vibrator \"on\" her vagina and not inside of it. But when the prosecutor's entire line of questioning is read in context, it shows that the prosecutor was asking about what else appellant put \"inside\" of C.B. other than his penis, and C.B. responded, a \"sex toy.\" Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to reasonably find that appellant sexually penetrated C.B. with a vibrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Appellant failed to show error warranting reversal on count two.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On appeal, appellant raises several alternative challenges to count two that he did not raise below. Generally, appellate courts do not consider issues not argued to or considered by the district court.\n   <em>\n    Roby v.

The third amended complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Appellant argues that the district court plainly erred by allowing the state to amend the amended complaint after it rested because the amended count two charged a new or additional offense that required different proof that prejudiced his ability to contest the evidence. \"The [district] court may permit an indictment or complaint to be amended at any time before verdict or finding if no additional or different offense is charged and if the defendant's substantial rights are not prejudiced.\" Minn.

The required elements for count two never changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The third amended complaint merely added \"vibrator\" to count two to clarify the underlying incident charged and to conform the complaint to the evidence produced at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The third amended count two did not charge a new or additional offense, and appellant has failed to show plain error that prejudiced his defense as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The jury instructions for first-degree CSC as charged in count two\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Appellant argues that the district court's jury instructions were plainly erroneous because they lacked clarity on the elements required to find him guilty of first-degree CSC in count two. We see no clear or obvious error in the language used or the law given in the district court's jury instructions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the district court did not explicitly state which instructions applied to which counts, it did instruct the jury to consider the instructions as a whole, in light of all the others, and to consider each count separately. The verdict forms also specified which incident(s) applied to which count. When read together, the instructions fairly and adequately instructed the jury on count two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Unobjected-to prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Appellant further contends that the prosecutor misrepresented C.B.'s testimony about the vibrator incident underlying count two during closing argument. For unobjected-to prosecutorial misconduct, if an appellant establishes plain error, then the state must prove there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury's verdict would have changed absent the misconduct.\n   <em>\n    State v. Ramey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8467889\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/721/294/#p302\">\n    721 N.W.2d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 302 (Minn. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Our review shows that the prosecutor slightly misstated C.B.'s testimony about the vibrator during closing argument but it was not intentionally misleading, and there is no reasonable likelihood that it affected the jury's verdict on count two.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6818578\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/876/310/#p335\">\n    876 N.W.2d 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335 (Minn. 2016) (noting prosecutors may not \"intentionally ... misstate the evidence or mislead the jury as to the inferences it may draw\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On this record, appellant has failed to show prejudicial plain error that would\n   warrant reversal and a new trial on count two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Failure to give an accomplice-corroboration instruction was not prejudicial.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   District courts \"have a duty to instruct juries on accomplice testimony in any criminal case in which it is reasonable to consider any witness against the defendant to be an accomplice.\"\n   <em>\n    Strommen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9406732\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/648/681/#p686\">\n    648 N.W.2d at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Appellant argues that the district court plainly and prejudicially erred by failing to give an accomplice-corroboration instruction sua sponte for counts four and six, denying him a fair trial. Appellant did not request the instruction at trial. Accordingly, our review is for prejudicial plain error affecting appellant's substantial rights.\n   <em>\n    State v. Gail\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8429024\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/713/851/\">\n    713 N.W.2d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 863 n.9 (Minn. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For count four-the \"all three in bed\" incident-appellant was convicted of second-degree CSC for aiding and abetting mother's sexual contact with C.B. C.B.'s mother pleaded guilty to this incident and admitted to lying between C.B. and appellant in bed and putting her finger inside of C.B.'s vagina and massaging it while also touching appellant's penis. For count six-the \"mom in rocker\" incident-appellant was convicted of second-degree CSC for sexual contact with C.B. on the couch in the living room, during which mother sat in a rocking chair and masturbated while she watched them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The district court did not give the accomplice-corroboration jury instruction, 10 Minnesota Practice, CRIMJIG 3.18 (2017). The state concedes that it was plain error not to give the instruction for count four but disputes whether mother was an accomplice for count six. We need not determine if mother was an accomplice for either count because, even assuming that she was, appellant has failed to show prejudice affecting his substantial rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The jury was instructed on general liability for the crimes of another, 10 Minnesota Practice, CRIMJIG 4.01 (2017), and the jury knew that mother was convicted for the \"all three in bed\" incident. The jury also learned that mother agreed to testify in appellant's trial as part of her plea agreement. In turn, the jury was instructed on witness credibility and told to weigh the testimony in light of all of the documents provided, photographs shown, and videos played at trial. We presume that the jury was able to weigh this information in evaluating mother's credibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Vang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7083056\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/774/566/#p578\">\n    774 N.W.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 578 (Minn. 2009) (noting reviewing courts assume jury followed district court's instructions on weighing testimony).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Although the accomplice-corroboration instruction was not given, the record shows that mother's testimony was corroborated by other strong evidence of appellant's guilt at trial-mother testified to substantially the same details for counts four and six that C.B. disclosed in her forensic interview and at trial. We note that appellant was not sentenced on the counts for which he now argues that the district court should have given an accomplice-corroboration instruction. Thus, the district court's failure to give the accomplice-corroboration instruction sua sponte was not prejudicial plain error affecting appellant's substantial rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

C.B. testified that she knew appellant possessed and viewed pornography at their home. The record also shows that appellant was convicted of gross misdemeanor sexual misconduct in 1996 for sexually abusing his younger sister C.P. when she was a teenager. In a 1996 interview, appellant admitted to watching TV with C.P. before sexually abusing her and also admitted to watching pornography with his other two younger sisters. C.P. testified that she did not watch pornography with appellant but knew that he used it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The district court admitted\n   <em>\n    Spreigl\n   </em>\n   evidence that appellant possessed over 15,000 images of child-exploitative materials (child pornography) on computers and thumb drives in his home. One investigator testified at trial about searching appellant's home and finding this evidence; the images themselves were not admitted. The district court found that this evidence was relevant and material to modus operandi based on appellant's offer to show C.B. pornographic images, and found that it corroborated C.B.'s and C.P.'s statements about appellant's pornography use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Even if we assume that the district court abused its discretion in admitting this evidence, though it did not, our thorough review of the record shows that the state's case against appellant-which included C.B.'s testimony, mother's testimony, and video of C.B.'s forensic interviews, as well as testimony from other professionals and law enforcement agents-was very strong. The strength of the state's case convinces us that there is no reasonable likelihood that this\n   <em>\n    Spreigl\n   </em>\n   evidence significantly affected the jury's verdicts. With or without this\n   <em>\n    Spreigl\n   </em>\n   evidence, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find appellant guilty of all six counts and to answer the aggravating-sentencing factors affirmatively. Any error committed by the district court did not prejudice appellant's case and therefore does not warrant reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

A district court may impose permissive consecutive sentences, without a departure, for multiple current felony convictions for first-degree CSC. Minn. Sent. Guidelines 2.F.2(a)(1)(ii); 6 (2012). Thus, the district court did not clearly abuse its discretion in imposing permissive consecutive sentences here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

For count one, the guidelines sentence was a presumptive commitment of 144 months\n   with an upper limit of 172 months. Minn. Sent. Guidelines 4.B (2012). On count two, the presumptive duration and upper duration limit for a permissive consecutive sentence were the same. Accordingly, a more-than-172-month sentence on either count was an upward durational departure. Minn. Sent. Guidelines 2.F.2(a); 4.B (2012). Here, the district court imposed 360 months on each count, the statutory-maximum sentence for a first-degree CSC conviction.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.342\">\n    Minn.

Thus, the cumulative 720-month sentence on both counts was more than double the cumulative presumptive duration of 288 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The district court found that appellant's particular cruelty and C.B.'s particular vulnerability justified this significant aggravated durational departure. To justify an aggravated departure, there must be \"substantial and compelling circumstances\" showing that the defendant's conduct was significantly more serious than typically involved in the commission of the offense in question.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In answering the\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   questions for particular vulnerability, the jury found that C.B. has a chromosomal defect and a cognitive developmental delay, and that appellant knew about these vulnerabilities. The jury's findings are clearly supported by the testimony of C.B.'s mother, school workers, and medical professionals, which showed that appellant was aware of C.B.'s ongoing services and appointments to address her cognitive and developmental delays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In answering the\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   questions for particular cruelty, the jury found that appellant subjected C.B. to multiple forms of sexual penetration and sexual contact. Again, there is ample evidence in the record to support appellant's particular cruelty, including C.B.'s forensic interviews and testimony, as well as the testimony of C.B.'s mother and the professionals who worked with C.B. The record shows that C.B. is now racked with feelings of guilt and desperation as a result of appellant's sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   On this record, the factors of C.B.'s particular vulnerability and appellant's particular cruelty legally and factually justified an aggravated departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

In our collective experience, appellant's 720-month cumulative sentence here is excessive, beyond the scope of the evidence presented, and unduly exaggerates appellant's criminal conduct in light of similar cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   A recent unpublished case from this court is instructive. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Guzman-Diaz\n   </em>\n   , we reviewed an appellant's first-degree CSC conviction for sexually abusing his daughter once or twice a week from the ages of 9 to 14. No. A17-1231,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203520535\">\n    2018 WL 3520535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1-2 (Minn. App. July 23, 2018). In that case, the father engaged in hundreds of incidents of sexual contact and sexual penetration of his daughter while she was in his care and control; he also threatened to kill her family members if she revealed the abuse.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *1. The father was found guilty by a jury of three counts of first-degree CSC, but the district court sentenced him to the upper limit, non-departure 172-month sentence on one count of multiple acts of sexual abuse over a period of time.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *2. We affirmed on other grounds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Guzman-Diaz\n   </em>\n   , no departure was requested and the district court adjudicated on only one verdict eliminating the potential of a permissive consecutive sentence. In comparing a 172-month sentence in that similar case involving horrific acts of child sexual abuse over several years, we believe that a 720-month sentence in appellant's case unduly exaggerates the criminality of his conduct. At sentencing, the state recommended the statutory maximum of 360 months on count one, and a consecutive 240-month sentence on count two, for a total of 600 months or 50 years. Here, the district court properly sentenced to the statutory maximum on count one because there are aggravating factors that could justify a statutory maximum sentence. On count two, the district court had discretion to durationally depart, but imposing a departure of more than double the guidelines sentence on a consecutive sentence for a single victim is inappropriate based on our collective experience and our caselaw.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rairdon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10697463\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/557/318/#p327\">\n    557 N.W.2d at 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
