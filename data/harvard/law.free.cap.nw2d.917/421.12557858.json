R. Prof. Conduct 1.3, 1.4(a)(2)-(4), 3.2, 3.4(c), 8.1(b), and 8.4(d), and Rule 25, Rules on Lawyers Professional Responsibility (RLPR).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Respondent and the Director have entered into a stipulation for discipline. In it, respondent waives his procedural rights under Rule 14, RLPR, and unconditionally admits the allegations of the petition, as corrected in the stipulation for discipline. The parties jointly recommend that the appropriate discipline is a public reprimand followed by 2 years of supervised probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This court has independently reviewed the file and approves the jointly recommended disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Based upon all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   1. Respondent Ryan Joseph Wood is publicly reprimanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   2. Respondent shall pay $900 in costs pursuant to Rule 24(a), RLPR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   3.

If, after diligent effort, respondent is unable to locate a supervisor acceptable to the Director, the Director will seek to appoint a supervisor. Until a supervisor has signed a consent to supervise, respondent shall on the first day of each month provide the Director with an inventory of active client files, as described in paragraph d. below. Respondent shall make active client files available to the Director upon request.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   d. Respondent shall cooperate fully with the supervisor in his or her efforts to monitor compliance with this probation. Respondent shall contact the supervisor and schedule a minimum of one in-person meeting per calendar quarter. Respondent shall submit to the supervisor an inventory of all active client files by the first day of each month during the probation. With respect to each active file, the inventory shall disclose the client name, type of representation, date opened, most recent activity, next anticipated action, and anticipated closing date. Respondent's supervisor shall file written reports with the Director at least quarterly, or at such more frequent intervals as may reasonably be requested by the Director.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   e. Respondent shall initiate and maintain office procedures which ensure that there are prompt responses to correspondence, telephone calls, and other important communications from clients, courts, and other persons interested in matters which respondent is handling, and which will ensure that respondent regularly reviews each and every file\n   and completes legal matters on a timely basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   f. Respondent shall initiate or continue current treatment by a licensed consulting psychologist or other mental health professional acceptable to the Director, and shall complete all therapy programs recommended by the therapist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   BY THE COURT:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   /s/ David L.
