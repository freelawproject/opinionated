The defendants' motion to dismiss is GRANTED and the application is DISMISSED, because the plaintiff-appellant is a vexatious litigator under MCR 7.316(C)(3). We direct the Clerk of this Court not to accept any further filings from the plaintiff-appellant in this matter unless the plaintiff-appellant has obtained leave and has submitted the filing fee required by MCR 7.319. The plaintiff's motion to waive fees is DENIED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
