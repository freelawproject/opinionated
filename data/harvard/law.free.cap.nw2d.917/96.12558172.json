After a hearing, respondent-commissioner concluded that Minn. Stat. \u00a7 256D.024, subd. 1 (2016), unambiguously conditions appellant's receipt of MSA benefits on submission to random drug testing. The district court concluded on appeal that the drug-testing requirement within section 256D.024, subdivision 1(a), does not violate the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. On appeal to this court, appellant argues that the commissioner erred in concluding that the statute unambiguously applies to her, and the district court erred in concluding that the statute is constitutional. Because the statute is ambiguous, and because the canons of construction resolve the ambiguity in favor of appellant, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2000, appellant Kim Verhein was convicted of fifth-degree possession of a controlled substance and sentenced to 17 months' imprisonment. At some point after her release from a correctional facility in 2001, she applied for and began receiving MSA benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November 2013, the Minnesota Department of Human Services informed respondent Washington County Community Services (the county) that appellant had a post-July 1, 1997, drug conviction. The county notified appellant that, under section 256D.024, subdivision 1(a), she is required to undergo random drug testing as a condition of receiving MSA benefits. In September 2015, the county notified appellant that her random drug testing would\n   occur on September 16, 2015. Appellant appeared for testing, but refused to provide a sample. The county terminated appellant's MSA benefits effective November 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In June 2016, appellant reapplied for MSA benefits. The county denied appellant's application and informed her that her prior refusal to submit to testing rendered her ineligible to receive benefits for five years. Appellant appealed the denial of her application to respondent Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Services (the commissioner), arguing that the drug-testing requirement did not apply to her, her refusal to submit to testing did not render her ineligible for a five-year period, a permanent drug-testing requirement violates the Fourth Amendment, and she is entitled to a curative payment for unpaid benefits dating back to November 1, 2015. After a hearing, the commissioner concluded that section 256D.024, subdivision 1(a), unambiguously requires random drug testing of persons convicted of certain felony drug offenses after July 1, 1997, as a condition of receiving MSA benefits. Appellant requested reconsideration of the decision. The commissioner denied the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2017, appellant appealed the commissioner's decision to the district court. Appellant argued that the testing requirement within section 256D.024, subdivision 1(a), is unconstitutional because it conditions her receipt of benefits on a relinquishment of her Fourth Amendment rights. The district court affirmed the commissioner's decision in part, concluding that the plain and unambiguous language of the statute conditions receipt of benefits for persons convicted of a drug offense after July 1, 1997, on submission to random drug testing. The district court concluded that appellant's Fourth Amendment challenge failed, citing precedent of this court indicating that the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions does not apply to the Fourth Amendment. The district court remanded the issue of whether a five-year ineligibility period applied to test refusals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I.

Appellant argues that the case presents a live controversy because she has challenged whether Minn. Stat. \u00a7 256D.024, subd. 1, requires her to submit to drug testing as a condition of receiving benefits, an issue that was not resolved when the case was remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The issue of whether an appeal is moot is a legal question subject to de novo review.\n   <em>\n    In re McCaskill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11646580\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/603/326/#p327\">\n    603 N.W.2d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 327 (Minn. 1999). \"[Appellate courts] consider only live controversies, and an appeal will be dismissed as moot when intervening events render a decision on the merits unnecessary or an award of effective relief impossible.

App. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Appellant appealed the denial of her application and demanded payments dating back to the termination of her benefits in 2015. On remand from the district court's order, the commissioner reversed the denial of appellant's application, permitting it to be processed. But appellant's receipt of benefits continues to be conditioned on compliance with testing requirements. It is this condition that appellant challenged below and continues to challenge on appeal. We therefore conclude that the appeal presents a live controversy between the two parties, and this court may afford effective relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Even if the commissioner's action on remand rendered this appeal technically moot, we conclude that the appeal is reviewable because it is \"functionally justiciable.\" \"[Appellate courts] have the discretion to consider a case that is technically moot when the case is functionally justiciable and presents an important question of statewide significance that should be decided immediately.\"\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856377\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/868/1/#p4\">\n    868 N.W.2d at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted).

It places a limitation on certain drug offenders' eligibility for benefits during the five years after completion of a court-ordered sentence unless certain treatment options are completed, underway, or unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The second sentence is the crux of the parties' disagreement. Both parties agree that the sentence is unambiguous, but they disagree on the meaning of the statute. Appellant argues that \"[p]ersons subject to the limitations of this subdivision who become eligible\" refers to persons within the ineligibility period who become eligible by satisfying one of the three conditions. Appellant also argues that she is not subject to the limitations of the subdivision because she is not within the five-year ineligibility period. The commissioner argues that the statute refers to all persons with a post-July 1, 1997, qualifying conviction who were ineligible for benefits because of the conviction and who later became eligible for benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because the dispute centers on the language \"[p]ersons subject to the limitations of this subdivision who become eligible,\" we begin by ascertaining the plain meaning of the words at issue, looking to the definitions of the words and the rules of grammar.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20645.08\">\n    Minn.

Likewise, \"subject to\" has been defined as \"governed or affected by.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1425 (6th ed. 1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   One reading of \"[p]ersons subject to the limitations of this subdivision who become eligible\" coincides with the commissioner's interpretation. In such an interpretation, \"limitations of this subdivision\" may refer to the restrictions on the scope of the statute's application- section 256D.024, subdivision 1, only applies to certain types of drug crimes and requires a conviction date after July 1, 1997. It does not apply to persons with drug convictions from 1996, for example. Under this interpretation, persons with the required qualities \"who become eligible for assistance under this chapter\" are required to complete random drug testing as a condition of continued eligibility. In such an interpretation, it does not matter when or how the person becomes eligible for benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We conclude that the subdivision has an alternative, reasonable interpretation when applied to the facts of this case. The statute clearly relates to a five-year restriction of benefit eligibility for persons defined in the statute. The five-year eligibility restriction is also a \"limitation\" contained within the subdivision. Appellant argues that she is no longer subject to this limitation because it has been more than five years since she completed her court-ordered\n   sentence. The only manner in which appellant could suffer or be exposed to an additional five-year ineligibility period would be if she committed an additional qualifying crime. Under this interpretation, appellant is no longer a person \"subject to the limitations of this subdivision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   However, the commissioner, accepting the ineligibility period as a limitation, argues that appellant's prior subjection to the five-year period of ineligibility coupled with her status as someone who is now eligible for assistance under the chapter satisfies the \"[p]ersons subject to the limitations of this subdivision who become eligible\" requirement. Reading the statute as a whole, it is clear the phrases \"[p]ersons subject to the limitations of this subdivision\" and \"who become eligible\" present further ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   First, the former phrase is written in present tense, implying the individual must be \"subject to the limitations of this subdivision\" at the time he or she becomes eligible for assistance under the chapter. Whether someone is presently subject to the limitations of the subdivision depends on whether the limitations are defined solely by the details of the individual's criminal conviction, or whether it relates to the ineligibility period. Under the latter, someone could \"become eligible for assistance under this chapter\" years after the ineligibility period has ended and thus not be \"subject to the limitations of [the] subdivision\" at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Second, the remainder of the subdivision provides an example of when a person may be both \"subject to the limitations of this subdivision\" and \"become eligible for assistance under this chapter.\" Those persons are the people who qualify for one of the three exceptions to the five-year period of ineligibility. Those persons are presumptively ineligible for benefits upon conviction until they are determined to have completed treatment, to be presently in treatment, or to not need treatment. The persons whom the county determines have satisfied one of those conditions are persons who are subject to the ineligibility period referenced in the subdivision, but who nevertheless become eligible. For example, one exception that enables a person to become eligible for benefits is if the person is \"participating in a drug treatment program.\" If the person otherwise qualifies for benefits under the chapter and is in a treatment program, the person may apply for and receive benefits. However, presumably, if the person fails to participate in a treatment program after the application for benefits is approved, the person would lose benefits and continue to be subject to the five-year ineligibility period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn.

In response to the federal legislation, Minnesota created the Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP), which includes cash and food assistance programs, as well as payments to third-party vendors who provide assistance to qualifying individuals.

Laws. ch. 85, art. 3, \u00a7 24, at 612. Families who had previously received general-assistance benefits became governed by MFIP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 256J.01, subd. 3 (Supp. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In making these changes to the general-assistance chapter, the legislature also adopted Minn. Stat. \u00a7 256D.024. Different versions of the senate bill that became section 256D.024 indicate that the senate originally sought blanket ineligibility for TANF benefits of persons with a qualifying conviction, S.F. 1, introduction (Jan. 9, 1997), and then changed the ineligibility period to two years for persons with a qualifying conviction seeking general-assistance benefits, S.F. 1, first, second, and third engrossments (Mar. 13 &amp; 20, 1997). The house of representatives sought to add a five-year period of ineligibility and the language, \"Persons subject to the limitations imposed by this section who become eligible for assistance under this chapter shall be subject to random drug testing as a condition of continued eligibility ....\" State of Minnesota,\n   <em>\n    Journal of the House\n   </em>\n   , 80th Sess. 902, 1898 (Mar. 20 &amp; Apr. 10, 1997). Both houses eventually passed the legislation as it stands today. The legislative history of the bill is inconclusive on whether the legislature intended the person to be presently subject to the period of ineligibility in order to be subject to the drug-testing requirement. We therefore look to provisions on similar subjects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The federal legislation that necessitated changes to Minnesota's assistance programs includes a provision that renders persons ineligible for food assistance and federally-funded TANF benefits if the person is convicted of a felony controlled-substance crime. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 862a(a) (2012). But individual states may opt out of the prohibition, or limit the period of ineligibility.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20603\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , (d)(1) (2012). Minnesota, in creating MFIP, opted to place certain limitations on applicants with prior qualifying drug convictions, but did not render those applicants ineligible permanently. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 256J.26 (2016). Applicants and participants in the food-support program of MFIP, \"who have been convicted of a drug offense that occurred after July 1, 1997, may, if otherwise eligible, receive food stamps or food support if the convicted applicant or participant is subject to random drug testing as a condition of continued eligibility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20603\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , subd. 1(b). At first glance, this provision appears to indicate\n   that a person will be subject to drug testing indefinitely for receipt of food-support benefits. However, under the subdivision, \"drug offense\" is defined as \"an offense that occurred during the previous ten years from the date of application or recertification.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20603\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , subd. 1(c). For other MFIP benefits, an applicant or participant who committed a drug offense \"during the previous ten years from the date of application or recertification\" is \"subject to random drug testing as a condition of continued eligibility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20603\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , subd. 1(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Under MFIP, participants are required to complete recertification forms for continued eligibility, and counties are required to recertify participants' eligibility \"in an annual interview.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 256J.30, subd. 4, 256P.04, subd. 8 (2016). Therefore, recipients are only subject to drug-testing requirements for ten years following the drug offense; upon recertification after the ten-year period, a recipient's prior crime no longer qualifies for testing purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Section 256D.024, subdivision 1(b), does not include the ten-year limitation in its definition of \"drug offense.\" It only limits the drug offenses to post-July 1, 1997 convictions. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 256D.024, subd. 1(b). But the language at issue in this case, \"[p]ersons subject to the limitations of this subdivision who become eligible for assistance,\" was not used by the legislature in drafting the drug-testing requirements under section 256J.26. Rather, the legislature used precise language to indicate that the drug-testing requirements under MFIP are limited to recipients and applicants within the ten-year period following a conviction, and limited in duration because of the annual recertification requirement. While indicating the legislature's intent to limit the duration of drug-testing provisions in parts of the same overhaul of state assistance programs, section 256J.26 does not answer the question of what the legislature intended by the language at issue in this case. But it does not follow that section 256D.024 's drug-testing period is unlimited in duration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The agency's interpretation of the provision in its manuals indicates that the drug-testing provision is intended to be limited in the manner advocated by appellant.

Granting effect to the commissioner's current interpretation of the statute would require persons receiving MSA or general-assistance benefits to undergo chemical testing indefinitely, even if decades have passed since the completion of a court-ordered sentence. In light of these considerations, and the department's inconsistent and contrary interpretations of the statute, we conclude that \"[p]ersons subject to the limitations of this subdivision who become eligible for assistance under this chapter\" applies to persons within the five-year period of ineligibility who become eligible through satisfaction of one of the three treatment-related conditions listed in section 256D.024, subdivision 1(a). Those persons are subject to the limitations of the subdivision, and thus are subject to random drug testing for continued eligibility. After the passage of the five-year period, those persons are no longer \"subject to the limitations of [the] subdivision\" and therefore are no longer required to undergo chemical testing for receipt of benefits. Those who, like appellant, have long since completed their court-ordered sentences and five-year period of ineligibility are not \"[p]ersons subject to the limitations of this subdivision\" and are not required to undergo chemical testing for receipt of benefits under chapter 256D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Appellant challenged the underpayment of MSA benefits based on the agency's misapplication of section 256D.024, subdivision 1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \"A county agency must issue a corrective payment for underpayments made to a participant or to a person who would be a participant if an agency or client error causing the underpayment had not occurred.\" Minn.

In July 2016, appellant made the commissioner aware of the error and the underpayment of benefits dating back to November 2015. Because the commissioner was notified of the error, and because all underpayments sought by appellant stemmed from the preceding 12-month period, the commissioner was obligated to issue full corrective payments based on the commissioner's erroneous application of drug-testing conditions to appellant. The commissioner erred in its decision to refuse to make corrective payments to appellant dating from November 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Minnesota Statutes section 256D.024, subdivision 1(a), is subject to multiple interpretations concerning the limitations of the subdivision and its application.

First, persons seeking general-assistance benefits may become eligible by satisfying the criteria in a statute captioned \"eligibility for general assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 256D.05 (2016 &amp; Supp. 2017).

Stat. \u00a7 256D.425 (2016 &amp; Supp. 2017) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 256D.33 (2016). Third, persons seeking either type of benefits who were convicted of a drug offense after July 1, 1997, may become eligible five years after their completion of a court-ordered sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 256D.024, subd. 1(a). Fourth, persons seeking benefits who were convicted of a drug offense after July 1, 1997, may become eligible by participating in a drug treatment program, by successfully completing a drug treatment program, or by being assessed and determined not to be in need of drug treatment.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Fifth, persons seeking benefits who have been convicted of a drug offense after July 1, 1997, and who previously satisfied one of the three treatment-related exceptions but then lost eligibility because of a positive test result may become eligible again after the expiration of another five-year period.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Verhein was convicted of a disqualifying drug offense in 1999. She became ineligible for supplemental-aid benefits at that time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 256D.024, subd. 1(a). She completed her court-ordered sentence in 2001. She became eligible again for supplemental-aid benefits in 2006.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Sometime thereafter, she applied for and began receiving supplemental-aid benefits, which implies that she satisfied the eligibility requirements in section 256D.425. Accordingly, she is a person \"subject to the limitations of this subdivision who bec[a]me eligible for assistance under ... chapter [256D].\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Because the statute\n   is not \"subject to more than one reasonable interpretation\" in its application to Verhein, the statute is unambiguous for purposes of this appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thonesavanh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338046\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/904/432/#p435\">\n    904 N.W.2d at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Verhein contends that the statute does not apply to her because the reference in the second sentence to \"the limitations of this subdivision\" necessarily refers to \"the limitation on MSA eligibility that appears immediately before it, in the first sentence of subd. 1(a), for individuals with drug convictions who are within the first five years after the completion of their sentence.\" She further contends, \"There is no other 'limitation' anywhere in subd. 1 to which this second sentence could be referring.\" Verhein's interpretation is flawed because it ignores the main clause of the first sentence, which makes a person ineligible for benefits based on a disqualifying drug offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 256D.024, subd. 1(a). She does not explain why that provision, which makes a person ineligible for benefits, is not a \"limitation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The majority reasons that the phrase \"[p]ersons subject to the limitations of this subdivision who become eligible for assistance under this chapter\" is ambiguous on the ground that it could refer either to persons who\n   <em>\n    previously were\n   </em>\n   subject to the five-year period of ineligibility or to persons who\n   <em>\n    presently are\n   </em>\n   subject to the five-year period of ineligibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 102-03. But the phrase need not be interpreted to refer to only one group or the other; it could refer to both groups of persons. That is the only reasonable interpretation in light of the principle that, in determining whether a statute is ambiguous, we should consider a statute \"as a whole and interpret its language to give effect to all of its provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Riggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868088,6868114\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/865/679/\">\n    865 N.W.2d 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 683 (Minn. 2015). In this case, we must give effect to the last word of the phrase: \"chapter.\" If the phrase were limited to persons who still are within the five-year period of ineligibility, the phrase would conclude, \"under this\n   <em>\n    subdivision\n   </em>\n   ,\" not \"under this\n   <em>\n    chapter\n   </em>\n   .\" Because the statute defines the group of persons subject to random drug tests more broadly to include persons who became eligible under any provision in chapter 256D, the statute refers to both types of persons, including persons who are beyond the five-year period of ineligibility and became eligible by satisfying the criteria in section 256D.05 and section 256D.425.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Furthermore, a related statute that expressly references section 256D.024 confirms this interpretation. The related statute, which was enacted in 2012, required the state court administrator to provide the commissioner with a report of all persons who had been convicted of felony-level drug offenses under chapter 152 after July 1, 1997, and, furthermore, requires the state court administrator, on an ongoing basis, to provide reports to the commissioner at six-month intervals of all persons convicted of such offenses during the previous six months.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20256.01\">\n    Minn.

The statute further provides, \"The commissioner shall determine whether the [persons included in the reports] are receiving public assistance under chapter 256D ... , and if [so], the commissioner shall instruct the county to proceed under section 256D.024....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20256.01\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 256.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 18c(b). The information provided by the state court administrator, which includes all convictions after July 1, 1997, would be useful for purposes of section 256D.024 only if persons who are beyond the five-year period of ineligibility are still subject to random drug testing. In determining whether a statute is ambiguous, we should \"interpret each section in light of the surrounding\n   sections to avoid conflicting interpretations.\"\n   <em>\n    Eclipse Architectural Grp., Inc. v.

Because section 256.01, subdivision 18c, ensures that the commissioner is aware of all persons who have been convicted of drug offenses since July 1, 1997, and because the statute directs the commissioner to use that information to enforce section 256D.024, it is apparent that persons who are beyond the five-year period of ineligibility are subject to random drug testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   If I were to agree with the majority's opinion that the statute is ambiguous, I would respectfully disagree with its view that the legislative history of the statute is \"inconclusive\" with respect to the meaning of the phrase \"[p]ersons subject to the limitations of this subdivision who become eligible for assistance under this chapter.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 104.

That is so because the \"subject to the limitations\" language was inserted into the bill at a time when the first sentence consisted\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   of the clause that contains the five-year ineligibility provision.

At that time, the bill did not yet contain the three treatment-related exceptions to ineligibility. If the word \"limitation\" had any meaning at the time it was inserted into the bill, it could have referred only to the five-year period of ineligibility and not to the three treatment-related exceptions. Accordingly, at that time, the phrase \"[p]ersons subject to the limitations of this subdivision who become eligible for assistance under this chapter\" must have meant persons who had completed a court-ordered sentence and had become eligible for benefits five years after completing a court-ordered sentence. Thus, if the legislative history informs the interpretation of section 256D.024, subdivision 1(a), it must lead to the conclusion that persons who previously were ineligible for benefits and became eligible due to the passage of five years' time are included in the group of persons who are required to submit to random drug testing as a condition of ongoing eligibility for benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   If I were to agree with the majority that the statute is ambiguous, I also would not resolve the ambiguity by referring to the department of human services' combined manual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 105-07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   As an initial matter, I question the legal authority by which we might interpret a statute in a manner consistent with an agency's prior interpretation but inconsistent with the agency's litigation position. To be sure, if an agency refers to its prior interpretation of an ambiguous statute to support its position in a pending case, a court may \"give deference to the administrative interpretation of the relevant statute by a state agency if the agency is charged with the responsibility of applying the statute on a statewide basis and its interpretation is reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    A.A.A. v.

It is also true that the caseworker's posture in the home visit is perhaps, in a sense, both rehabilitative and investigative. But this latter aspect, we think, is given too broad a character and far more emphasis than it deserves if it is equated with a search in the traditional criminal law context.\n   <em>\n    We note, too, that the visitation in itself is not forced or compelled, and that the beneficiary's denial of permission is not a criminal act.

The Court also reasoned that the certification requirement was \"not well designed to identify candidates who violated antidrug laws\" or to \"deter illegal drug users from seeking election\" because, with 30 days' notice, a person could circumvent the requirement by abstaining from use before a test.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 319, 117 S.Ct. at 1304.

In addition, a urine test conducted by the county's contractor with only five days' notice is well designed to identify persons who are using controlled substances, unlike the certification requirement in\n   <em>\n    Chandler\n   </em>\n   . Furthermore, Verhein does not contend that section 256D.024, subdivision 1(a), is merely symbolic, and we have no reason to doubt that the statute is a genuine attempt to promote policies stated in the supplemental-aid statute, such as \"maximiz[ing] the use of federal funds for public assistance purposes\" and providing assistance to Minnesota residents \"who are found to have maintenance needs.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn.
