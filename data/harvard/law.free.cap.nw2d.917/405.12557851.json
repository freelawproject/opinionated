On order of the Court, the answer having been received, the application for leave to appeal is again considered. We direct the Clerk to schedule oral argument on the application. MCR 7.305(H)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The appellant shall file a supplemental brief within 42 days of the date of this order addressing: (1) whether the trial court abused its discretion by allowing expert testimony on redirect about the rate of false reports of sexual abuse by children, see\n   <em>\n    People v.
