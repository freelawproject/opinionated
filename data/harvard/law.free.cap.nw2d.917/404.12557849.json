That court shall treat the defendant's delayed application for leave to appeal as having been filed within the deadline set forth in MCR 7.205(G)(3) and shall decide whether to grant, deny, or order other relief, in accordance with MCR 7.205(E)(2). The defendant made a timely request for the appointment of appellate counsel but, through no fault of his own, counsel was not appointed. Accordingly, the defendant was deprived of his right to file an application for leave to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
