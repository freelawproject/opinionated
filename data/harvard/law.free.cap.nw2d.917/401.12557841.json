The trial court erred by failing to determine, on the basis of legally admissible evidence, whether the statutory grounds for termination of the respondent's parental rights were proved by clear and convincing evidence. MCR 3.977(E)(3). Therefore, reversal of the trial court and remand for a new termination hearing was appropriate on that basis alone, and the Court of Appeals need not have addressed any further issues. We REMAND this case to the Family Division of the Muskegon Circuit Court for the proceedings ordered by the Court of Appeals-\"a new hearing on\n   whether there are statutory grounds to terminate respondent's parental rights.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
