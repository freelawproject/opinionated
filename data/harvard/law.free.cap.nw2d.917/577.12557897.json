But judicial decisions which express new rules normally are not applied retroactively to other cases that have become final. \"New legal principles, even when applied retroactively, do not apply to cases already closed,\" because \"at some point, 'the rights of the parties should be considered frozen' and a 'conviction ... final.' \"\n   <em>\n    Reynoldsville Casket Co. v.

Thus, as to those cases that have become final, the general rule allows only prospective application. However, there are \"certain special concerns-related to collateral review of state criminal convictions-that affect\" how courts determine whether a case should be considered closed.\n   <em>\n    Reynoldsville Casket Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339528\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/749/#p758\">\n    514 U.S. at 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339528\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/749/#p758\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In essence, these \"special concerns\" amount to exceptions to the general rule of nonretroactivity for closed cases, allowing a new legal rule to be applied on collateral review to an otherwise closed case. Both federal and state rules govern the retroactive\n   application\n   of new legal principles to criminal cases that are otherwise final but subject to collateral review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The federal standard for retroactivity under these circumstances was most recently laid out in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.
