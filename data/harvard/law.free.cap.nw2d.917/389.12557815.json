The Court notes that, although the defendant's motion has been styled as a motion for relief from judgment under subchapter 6.500 by the Wayne Circuit Court, it should not be regarded as a motion for relief from judgment for purposes of MCR 6.502(G)(1) in any future case. The defendant actually filed a motion under MCR 2.612, which was properly denied by the trial court, but due to a lack of merit, and not under the rules of MCR 6.501,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
