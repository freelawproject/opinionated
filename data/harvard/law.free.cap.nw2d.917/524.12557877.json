Prior to trial, Schoenfelder made an offer of judgment for $7,500. Fluth accepted, Schoenfelder paid Fluth, and Fluth filed a satisfaction of judgment. Weisser then moved for summary judgment, arguing a satisfaction of judgment discharges all other joint tortfeasors from liability. The circuit court granted the motion, and Fluth appeals. We reverse in part and affirm in part.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [\u00b62.] On June 3, 2012, a disgruntled tenant set off a gas explosion in the basement of one of Weisser's Mitchell, South Dakota rental properties. The explosion lifted the house off its foundation and caused extensive damage to the interior. After visiting the site, Weisser contacted Schoenfelder to demolish the home and grade the property to normal elevation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b63.] Shortly after Schoenfelder began tearing down the house, Weisser met with Brian Wendelboe, the Mitchell Water Distribution Department foreman. City officials had attempted to access the waterline themselves the night of or day after the explosion, but tree roots obstructed access to the shutoff valve at the curb. When deposed, Wendelboe claimed he told Weisser that the waterline accessing the property needed to be shut off by a licensed plumber at either the street-curb valve or at the water main beneath the street. Wendelboe also claimed he told Weisser that the waterline could be bent over and hammered shut only as a temporary fix. According to Wendelboe, when he asked Weisser how he intended to deal with shutting the water off permanently, Weisser responded, \"Let's not worry about it right now.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b64.] Weisser shut off the water in the basement and had the water meter removed. During demolition work on July 3, 2012, Schoenfelder broke the waterline. Schoenfelder bent the pipe over and hammered it shut to temporarily lessen the flow of water. Weisser then hired Krohmer Plumbing to shut off the water permanently at the curb. Schoenfelder dug up the curb stop, and Krohmer attempted to reach the shutoff valve. However, the tree again rendered the shutoff valve inaccessible. Schoenfelder claims that Weisser instructed Schoenfelder to \"finish the job, cover it up.\" Weisser did not subsequently contact the City of Mitchell to have the tree removed or have the water valve shut off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b65.] The following spring, Fluth noticed water penetrating her basement. After tearing out the boards and sheet rock on the west wall, Fluth discovered extensive water damage. On June 28, 2013, Fluth contacted law enforcement after seeing water pooling on Weisser's empty lot. Wendelboe called Weisser and informed him of the situation, and Weisser again hired Krohmer to shut off the water. The Mitchell Parks and Recreation Department cut down the tree in front of the\n   property, enabling Krohmer to access the shutoff valve at the curb. Fluth has not experienced any further trouble with ground water entering her basement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b66.] Fluth subsequently brought suit against Weisser and Schoenfelder,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging fraud and negligence. In her January 21, 2015 amended complaint, Fluth alleged the leak caused water to enter her basement, damaging her property and promoting growth of mold hazardous to her family's health. Fluth sought compensatory and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b67.] The court scheduled a three-day trial to begin on June 29, 2016. On June 2, 2016-just weeks before trial-Schoenfelder made Fluth an offer of judgment for $7,500. On June 15, 2016, Fluth accepted Schoenfelder's offer, and Schoenfelder later remitted the funds. On July 18, 2016, Fluth filed a satisfaction of judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b68.] On June 22, 2016, Fluth, having obtained permission from the court, filed a second amended complaint dismissing Schoenfelder as a defendant and adding claims of deceit and \"intentional, willful, wanton, and malicious conduct\" against Weisser. Fluth again requested compensatory and punitive damages. The court rescheduled the trial for January 2017 to allow the parties time to complete additional pretrial proceedings. On October 13, 2016, Weisser moved for partial summary judgment on the issues of punitive damages and on Fluth's theories of deceit, fraudulent concealment, and \"intentional, willful, wanton, and malicious conduct.\" At a November 16, 2016 motions hearing, the circuit court granted Weisser's motion for partial summary judgment on the issues of deceit and fraudulent concealment. However, it denied Weisser's motion to dismiss Fluth's claim of \"intentional, willful, wanton, and malicious conduct\" and her request for punitive damages. The court also allowed discovery of Weisser's financial information prior to trial but barred the jury from considering the issue of proportionate fault, stating that SDCL 15-8-17 only authorized a pro-tanto offset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b69.] On November 30, 2016, Weisser moved the circuit court to permit either a cross-claim or a third-party action against Schoenfelder. On December 15, 2016, Weisser filed another motion for summary judgment pursuant to SDCL 15-6-56(c)(2). Weisser argued that Fluth discharged all other joint tortfeasors from liability when she satisfied her claim with Schoenfelder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b610.] On January 3, 2017, Fluth and Weisser attended a hearing on Weisser's motions. Schoenfelder's counsel also appeared at the hearing. The court orally denied Weisser's motion to permit a cross-claim or third-party action against Schoenfelder, reasoning that \"allowing [a third-party action] at this late hour with trial next week and with a party already resolving their exposure through a satisfaction of judgment greatly prejudices that party....\" As to Weisser's motion for summary judgment, the court observed that the case presented a question of first impression. Citing the \"well-settled rule\" established in other jurisdictions that \"satisfaction of one judgment precludes action against another joint tortfeasor,\" the court granted summary judgment. The court set forth its rulings in an order dated January 6, 2017. Fluth appeals, raising the following issue for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. Whether the circuit court erred by granting Weisser's motion for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Weisser, by notice of review, raises several additional issues, which we consolidate as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   2. Whether Weisser is entitled to a pro-rata offset on the negligence claim as determined by a jury, and whether Weisser should have been permitted to bring a cross-claim or third-party action against Schoenfelder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   3. Whether the circuit court should have granted Weisser's motions for partial summary judgment on Fluth's request for punitive damages for Weisser's alleged intentional, willful, wanton, and malicious conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis and Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Whether the circuit court erred by granting Weisser's motion for summary judgment.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b611.] Fluth argues that the circuit court erred by granting Weisser's motion for summary judgment, contending that SDCL 15-8-16 permits a plaintiff to bring a claim against one joint tortfeasor despite obtaining a satisfaction of judgment against the other. According to Fluth, the words \"recovery of a judgment\" contained in SDCL 15-8-16 encompass a satisfaction. Thus, Fluth argues that filing a satisfaction of judgment against Schoenfelder had no effect on Weisser's liability. As a case of first impression in South Dakota, Fluth contends the statute's plain meaning and the decisions of out-of-state courts support her position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b612.] \"[S]tatutory interpretation is a question of law, reviewed de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Upell v.

Accordingly, satisfaction of a judgment against one tortfeasor discharged other tortfeasors who were liable for the same injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v.

However, he argues that satisfaction is a concept distinct from recovery and that \"recovery of a judgment\" does not include a satisfaction. Therefore, Weisser contends that although SDCL 15-8-16 permits a party to recover multiple judgments without discharging other joint tortfeasors, the statute only means a party may obtain multiple renditions\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   or executions\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on a judgment. Under Weisser's reading, SDCL 15-8-16 did not change the common-law rule of discharge for satisfactions, and thus Fluth discharged Weisser of any liability when she satisfied her claim against Schoenfelder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b616.] We first observe that SDCL 15-8-16 contains ambiguity. \"Ambiguity exists when a statute 'is reasonably capable of being understood in more than one sense.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Flaws\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6781342\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/885/580/\">\n    2016 S.D. 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6781342\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/885/580/\">\n    885 N.W.2d 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 587 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Zoss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10753359\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/598/550/\">\n    1999 S.D. 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10753359\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/598/550/\">\n    598 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   552 ).

Additionally, the court found its interpretation of \u00a7 3 of the UCATA better comported with \u00a7 4: \"construing the words 'recovery of a judgment' ... to mean merely the rendition of a judgment\" would result in an \"inconsistency between payment of a judgment by one joint tortfeasor discharging all other joint tortfeasors and payment for an ordinary release ... not discharging the other joint tortfeasors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20A.2d%20353\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the court concluded that a \"recovery of a judgment\" under \u00a7 3 included satisfaction of a plaintiff's judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20A.2d%20353\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the court noted that the amount of the satisfaction would reduce the claim against other joint tortfeasors in the same way a release would under \u00a7 4.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20A.2d%20353\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b619.] The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reached the opposite conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Hilbert\n   </em>\n   .

The Commissioner's Note on the recommendation stated: \"This was Section 3 of the 1939 Act.

Rather, satisfaction of a judgment reduces the award of a subsequent judgment against other tortfeasors using the same formula for releases under SDCL 15-8-17.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hackett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20A.2d%20353\">\n    48 A.2d at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Fluth's satisfaction of judgment against Schoenfelder did not automatically discharge Weisser, and the circuit court erred in granting Weisser's motion for summary judgment. On remand, the circuit court must first determine whether Schoenfelder's satisfaction of judgment was a full or partial satisfaction. Although a full satisfaction would discharge Weisser, a partial satisfaction would only reduce the award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDCL 15-8-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Whether Weisser is entitled to a pro-rata offset on the negligence claim as determined by a jury, and whether Weisser should have been permitted to bring a cross-claim or third-party action against Schoenfelder.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b624.] Weisser argues the court erred by allowing only an offset of $7,500, the amount of Schoenfelder's offer of judgment, in the event Fluth prevailed at trial. According to Weisser, SDCL 15-8-17 entitles him to a pro-rata reduction to be determined by a jury if such amount exceeds $7,500. Further, Weisser argues that the court erred by denying his motion to bring a cross-claim or third-party action against Schoenfelder. Weisser asserts that a cross-claim or third-party action may be asserted at any time, even after judgment. However, Fluth contends that the statute of limitations for negligence would bar Weisser's cross-claim or third-party action as untimely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDCL 15-2-14(3) ;\n   <em>\n    Rehm v.

And Schoenfelder, at the January 3, 2017 motions hearing, argued that a satisfaction of judgment amounts to a \"determination of fault\" by the jury, foreclosing the possibility for contribution unless a cross-claim was previously filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b625.] At the November 16, 2016 motions hearing, the circuit court, citing\n   <em>\n    Sheesley v.

At the January 3, 2017 motions hearing, the court stated that a defendant may nevertheless file a cross-claim or third-party action against the settling defendant to determine proportionate fault. However, the court noted that Schoenfelder probably \"would have insisted on a release if there was a cross-claim that [Schoenfelder] needed to resolve\" instead of a satisfaction of judgment and that Weisser should have pursued a cross-claim or third-party action prior to trial. Concluding that permitting \"a cross-claim after a party has settled greatly prejudices that party,\" the court denied the motion \"at this late hour with trial next week and with a party already resolving their exposure through a satisfaction of judgment[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b626.] SDCL 15-8-17 provides that a release reduces a claim against other joint tortfeasors \"in the amount of the consideration paid for the release, or in any amount or proportion by which the release provides that the total claim shall be reduced, if greater than the consideration paid.\" We stated in\n   <em>\n    Setliff v.

Even assuming SDCL 15-8-17 applied to a judgment of satisfaction operating as \"an effective release,\" the statute, by its plain language, does not provide for a pro-rata deduction unless so provided by the release, and here there is nothing in the satisfaction providing for a pro rata reduction.

The circuit court denied Weisser's motion because it was made too close to trial and granting it would have greatly prejudiced Schoenfelder, who decided to settle without knowing there would be a cross-claim. We note that in light of this appeal, the circuit court's concern with the late filing of the motion to file a cross-claim is no longer a concern. We also acknowledge that judicial economy favors allowing cross-claims for contribution to determine proportionate fault in a single trial.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Whiting v.
