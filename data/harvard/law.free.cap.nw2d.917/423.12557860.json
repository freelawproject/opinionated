See Minn. R. Prof. Conduct 4.4(a), 8.4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Respondent and the Director have entered into a stipulation for discipline. In it, respondent waives his procedural rights under Rule 14, Rules on Lawyers Professional Responsibility (RLPR), and unconditionally admits the allegations of the petition. The parties jointly recommend that the appropriate discipline is a public reprimand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This court has independently reviewed the file and approves the jointly recommended disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Based upon all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   1.
