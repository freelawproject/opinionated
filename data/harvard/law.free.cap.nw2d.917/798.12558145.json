He argues that he was denied a fair trial because the district court allowed the state to introduce prejudicial relationship evidence at trial and because the prosecutor committed misconduct. Appellant also argues that the district court erred when it sentenced him for two domestic-assault convictions arising from the course of conduct that included criminal sexual conduct with force or violence. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   M.P. and appellant were in a romantic relationship for six years. They lived together in a mobile home in Eastwood Estates in Redwood County. On August 13, 2016, the Redwood County Sherriff's Office received reports of a sexual assault at Eastwood Estates. After investigation, law enforcement arrested appellant. The state charged him with two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, one count of third-degree criminal sexual conduct, and two counts of domestic assault. The complaint alleged, as to each domestic-assault count, that, on or about August 13, 2016, appellant had \"hit [M.P.] repeatedly in the arms and face and kicked her in her pelvic area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the first day of trial, before the jury panel was brought in, the district court told the prosecutor:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   I'm going to ask you to share with ... law enforcement and any witnesses that testify, ... given the sensitive nature of this case I want to avoid ... disparaging ..., accusatory, and derogatory type phrasing. I mean it is ... a sexual assault, criminal sexual conduct case, it's not a rape case, things like that, and just to urge law enforcement, any lay witnesses you might have to maintain professionalism and decorum on the stand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the fourth sentence of the state's opening statement, the prosecutor said, \"Ladies and gentlemen this is a case about the Defendant raping [M.P.].\" Appellant's trial counsel did not object. The prosecutor used the word \"rape\" or \"raped\" several other times during the state's opening statement, including stating that appellant \"repeatedly hit [M.P.], held her down, and raped her.\" Appellant's trial counsel objected to none of these statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Three neighbors of appellant and M.P. testified that they were outside when M.P. came out of her residence screaming for help. She was bleeding down her leg, and she appeared scared and distraught. The three neighbors testified that they called 911 and told the dispatcher that M.P. said that she had been raped. Defense counsel did not object to these witnesses' use of the term \"raped.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   M.P. testified that she picked up appellant from his boss's house on August 12, 2016. They had consensual sex that night. M.P. stated that she drove appellant back to his boss's house the next morning to pick up a paycheck. The couple then drove to a dollar store. M.P. testified that appellant began arguing with her inside the store. She left the store to wait in her car. When appellant came out to the car, he continued arguing. M.P. testified that appellant grabbed her arm while she was driving, causing her pain. She could not call anyone because she had hidden her cell phone in the car's trunk on account of appellant's previous threats to break it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   M.P. stated that she was scared while she drove home. Appellant turned the radio up very loud, and grabbed her hand and legs, causing her pain. When the couple got home, M.P. stated that she sat in her car for a while after appellant went\n   inside the mobile home, then she went inside, changed into pajamas, and lay down on the bed because she had a migraine headache. She left her phone in the trunk of her car for safekeeping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to M.P., appellant came into the bedroom wearing only his boxer shorts. He asked her why she was lying down, then pushed her off the bed, causing her head to hit the dresser. Appellant then threw M.P. back onto the bed and threatened to \"treat [her] like a whore.\" M.P. testified that appellant sat on top of her, restraining her hands, and that he forced her legs open with his knees and forcibly penetrated her with his penis. She stated that she told appellant to stop, but he did not. She testified that appellant tried to sexually penetrate her again, and that he kicked her in the abdomen a few times and continued to throw her onto and off of the bed. M.P. stated that appellant eventually went into the bathroom. When he did, M.P. ran outside. She tried unsuccessfully to get her phone from the trunk of her car, and yelled for the neighbors to call 911 when she heard appellant coming outside. The neighbors called 911. Appellant walked away in the direction of a nearby store. M.P. stated that she had multiple cuts and bruises and that she was bleeding as a result of appellant's sexual assault against her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   During M.P.'s direct testimony, M.P. and the prosecutor referred to the incident several times as one in which appellant \"raped\" M.P., again with no objection from appellant's trial counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Redwood Falls Police Sergeant Randy Braun testified that he and Officer Anthony Evans, along with two other officers, responded to the 911 calls. Sergeant Braun testified that he had been told that there was a reported sexual assault involving appellant and M.P., both of whom the sergeant knew from prior contacts. The officers looked for appellant when they arrived at Eastwood Estates, but did not see him. About an hour later, law enforcement received a call from one of appellant's neighbors, stating that appellant had returned to his residence. Sergeant Braun obtained and executed a warrant to search appellant's residence. He found appellant sitting in the living room and arrested appellant. Sergeant Braun testified that the officers also found a broken glass and some blood in the kitchen. Officers also found blood on a mattress pad and blanket in the hallway, and on a bed. He also noted that most of the house was very tidy, but the blankets and sheets in the bedroom were in \"disarray where it appeared some sort of struggle or something happened.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer Evans testified that he responded to a reported sexual assault at Eastwood Estates. He stated that he met with M.P. and three other individuals there. Officer Evans testified that M.P. was crying, bruised, and bleeding on the inside of her legs. He further testified that the other three individuals all told him that they were outside when they heard M.P. yelling for them to call 911. Officer Evans stated that when he spoke to M.P., she told him that \"she had been sexually assaulted by [appellant].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The emergency room doctor testified that, when he treated M.P., she \"was in great emotional distress,\" \"her voice was breaking as she was sort of talking to [him],\" and it took a long time for M.P. to share information with him. The doctor also testified that M.P. told him that appellant had physically abused her by punching, kicking, and throwing her against walls, and that when she had gone to take a nap, she was awakened by appellant forcing her to have intercourse. According\n   to the doctor, this report was corroborated by M.P.'s injuries. The doctor also testified that he examined M.P. for sexual assault. He stated that he noticed dried blood near M.P.'s genital area and that M.P. was bleeding internally from her vaginal walls, which was inconsistent with a menstrual cycle but \"compatible with forceful penetration.\" On cross-examination, the doctor agreed that the bleeding could have been caused by consensual sex. The emergency-room nurse testified that M.P.'s heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rates were elevated, indicating distress. M.P. also vomited after she described what had happened, another indicator of distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The state also called appellant's ex-girlfriend, K.R., to testify about appellant's history of domestic assault against her. Outside of the presence of the jury, K.R. testified that, while she was dating appellant over a ten-year period, the following incidents occurred: appellant threw K.R. across the kitchen floor while she was pregnant, resulting in cracked ribs; appellant opened a cabinet into K.R.'s face, causing her to need stitches; appellant threw K.R. down the front steps of their house, fracturing her wrist; appellant forced K.R. to engage in nonconsensual sex between five and ten times; appellant pushed K.R. in the driveway of their house and K.R. hit appellant back; and K.R. obtained an order for protection against appellant. Appellant's trial counsel argued that the descriptions of these incidents were vague and that testimony to the jury about them would be \"far more prejudicial than probative.\" Over appellant's objection, the district court concluded that it would allow testimony about appellant throwing K.R. across the kitchen floor, appellant throwing K.R. down the front steps, and appellant pushing K.R. in the driveway and K.R. hitting him back as relationship evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   but excluded testimony of the other three incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   K.R. then testified before the jury to the three admissible instances of domestic conduct. Before K.R. testified, the district court instructed the jury that the relationship evidence that K.R. would provide \"is being offered for the limited purpose of demonstrating the nature and the extent of the relationship between [appellant] and family or household members in order to assist you in determining whether [appellant] committed\" the charged offenses, and cautioned the jury that appellant is not being tried for behavior beyond the charged offenses, nor should the jury convict appellant on the basis of previous conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The state rested its case, and appellant presented no evidence. In summation, the state argued that the physical evidence and testimony from M.P. and the neighbors who called 911 show that the sexual penetration was nonconsensual and that appellant physically abused M.P. and sexually assaulted her. The prosecutor stated \"He raped her\" and referred to the sexual assault as \"rape,\" again without objection. Appellant's trial counsel argued that the lack of bruising and the witnesses' inability to tell exactly when the assaults took place indicated that M.P.'s story was not true. Appellant's trial counsel also argued that the sex was consensual. In rebuttal argument, the prosecutor stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-24\">\n   Since when is the word of a rape victim not enough? Since when is [her] word, her under oath coming into the courtroom, taking an oath, facing the man who did this to her, and tell[ing] you in graphic detail what happened to her not enough. Ask yourselves, do you really have any reasonable doubt that [appellant] assaulted and raped her. If you do, if her word isn't enough for you, then\n   look at the physical evidence we have in this case, the bruising, the numerous spots on her body. ... And then ask yourselves does this look like consensual sex to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Retired judge of the Minnesota Court of Appeals, serving by appointment pursuant to Minn.

In other words, the jury determined that one incident of conduct constituted two different assault crimes. Because the domestic assault was part of the same course of conduct as the sexual assault,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.035\">\n     Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.035\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , subd. 6, permits the district court to impose punishment for domestic assault. But because the same conduct was charged in the complaint and tried to the jury in two counts of domestic assault,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.035\">\n     Minn.

Accordingly, the district court could not sentence appellant to consecutive one-year prison terms for both counts of domestic assault based on the very same described conduct of appellant.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    We also recognize that our prior holding in\n    <em>\n     State v.

But because appellant has not challenged the propriety of two domestic-assault convictions on these facts, the question of whether assault-fear and assault-harm are separate crimes or are instead alternative means of committing the same crime, is not before us. Based on the plain language of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.035\">\n     Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.035\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , subd. 1, the jury's determination that appellant's conduct as described in the complaint constituted both assault-harm and assault-fear allows only one consecutive sentence for that conduct.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    We therefore reverse appellant's sentences on the domestic-assault charges and remand for the district court to vacate the sentence for one of those convictions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. Appellant's pro se argument is based on matters outside the record.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Appellant argues in a pro se supplemental brief that his convictions should be reversed because he was forced to wear an ankle bracelet at trial. After a thorough review of the record, we see no mention of an ankle bracelet in any of the documents or in the transcripts of the district court proceedings. \"It is well settled that an appellate court may not base its decision on matters outside the record on appeal, and that matters not produced and received in evidence below may not be considered.\"\n    <em>\n     Plowman v.

The district court also did not err in convicting and sentencing appellant for one domestic assault because, under the plain language of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.035\">\n     Minn.
