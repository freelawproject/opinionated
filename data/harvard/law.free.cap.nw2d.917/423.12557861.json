Stat. \u00a7 629.294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1, art. III(a), arguing that respondent's conduct in moving for dismissal\n   of the complaint tolled the 180-day speedy-trial period, and that the district court denied appellant due process by dismissing the complaint without affording it notice and an opportunity to be heard. We agree and reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 22, 2017, appellant State of Minnesota charged respondent Jeremy Roy with two counts of fifth-degree controlled-substance possession under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.025\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 2(1) (2016). The district court released Roy on bail after his first court appearance. Roy failed to appear at his omnibus hearing on June 15 because North Dakota authorities had detained him for an alleged probation violation in connection with an offense committed in North Dakota. Due to Roy's nonappearance, the district court revoked his bond and issued a warrant for his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 3, 2017, Roy filed a Detainer Disposition Request under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (AID),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20629.294\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 629.294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1, art. III(a), to require the state to bring him to trial within 180 days. On August 17, the state accepted temporary custody of Roy from North Dakota authorities. On October 23, Roy filed a motion to dismiss for lack of probable cause, and the district court denied the motion on December 5. At a December 7 pretrial hearing, Roy pleaded not guilty and demanded a speedy trial. Without objection by Roy, the court set a trial date of January 9, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At a January 4, 2018 settlement conference with the district court, Roy asked the court to maintain the January 9 trial date. The court then sua sponte dismissed the complaint with prejudice on the basis that more than 180 days had elapsed since Roy filed his Detainer Disposition Request, and that the IAD therefore required that Roy be returned to North Dakota as soon as practicable. The state immediately requested reconsideration and a stay of the dismissal. The court took no action on the state's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Did the district court err by dismissing the complaint on the basis that the January 9, 2018 trial date violated Roy's 180-day speedy-trial right under the IAD?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To proceed with a pretrial appeal, the state must first demonstrate that the district court's error \"will have a critical impact on the outcome of the trial.\" Minn. R. Crim. P. 28.04, subd. 2(1). \"Dismissal of a criminal complaint satisfies the critical-impact requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Gerard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7063544\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/832/314/#p317\">\n    832 N.W.2d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 317 (Minn. App. 2013),\n   <em>\n    review denied\n   </em>\n   (Minn. Sept. 17, 2013). We conclude that because the district court dismissed the state's criminal complaint against Roy, the state has met the critical-impact test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The state argues that the district court erred by concluding that Roy's January 9, 2018 trial date violated his speedy-trial right because Roy's motion to dismiss tolled the IAD's 180-day trial period. The state argues that the district court should have tolled the 180-day trial period during the time necessary for the court to resolve Roy's motion to dismiss. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The IAD establishes procedures for resolving one state's outstanding criminal charge against a prisoner of another state, the United States, and the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 2010),\n   <em>\n    review denied\n   </em>\n   (Minn. Mar. 30, 2010). Minnesota is a compact state and codified the IAD at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20629.294\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 629.294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Under the IAD, a prisoner \"shall be brought to trial within\n   180 days\" on any out-of-state charges after the prisoner sends to the official having custody over him \"written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for final disposition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., subd. 1, art. III(a). The official with custody over the prisoner shall then forward the prisoner's request to the out-of-state prosecuting officer.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The official in the state with custody over the prisoner (sending state) \"shall offer to deliver temporary custody\" of the prisoner to the state with pending charges over the prisoner (receiving state).\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., subd. 1, art. V(a). Once in the custody of the receiving state, the district court \"may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance\" in open court, with the defendant and counsel present, \"for good cause shown.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., subd. 1, art. III(a). Without such a continuance, failing to bring the defendant to trial within the 180-day trial period results in dismissal of the charge with prejudice and return of the prisoner to the custody of the sending state.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., subd. 1, art. V(c), (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This court reviews questions involving the construction of the IAD de novo.\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=777%20N.W.2d%20529\">\n    777 N.W.2d at 531-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The IAD is a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact, and thus is a federal law subject to federal construction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=777%20N.W.2d%20529\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Although states interpret and apply IAD provisions, they are constrained by United State Supreme Court cases that address the same issues.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=777%20N.W.2d%20529\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=777%20N.W.2d%20529\">\n    at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In its January 4, 2018 order, the district court noted that Roy filed his Detainer Disposition Request under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20629.294\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 629.294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1, art. III(a), on July 3, 2017. The court concluded that the 180-day trial period ran continuously from July 3 until it expired on December 30, 2017. Because more than 180 days had elapsed since the filing of Roy's Detainer Disposition Request, and because the state did not request an extension of time for trial for good cause, the court concluded that the IAD required dismissal of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   No Minnesota case analyzes tolling of the 180-day trial period under the IAD. But the Minnesota Supreme Court has analyzed the tolling of the requisite trial period under the Uniform Mandatory Disposition of Detainers Act (UMDDA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20629.292\">\n    Minn.
