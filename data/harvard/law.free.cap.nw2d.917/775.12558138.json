We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Between 2011 and 2012, Richard Frick, president of appellant Minnesota Sands, LLC (Minnesota Sands), entered into several leases with various landowners in Winona County to use the properties to mine silica sand to be processed and used in hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural gas (fracking). Frick then assigned the leases to Minnesota Sands. At that time, this type of industrial mining was a conditional use requiring a conditional use permit (CUP) prior to excavation. In 2011, respondent Winona County (the county) received three applications for CUPs to engage in industrial mining for silica sand. None of the applications were for the parcels leased by Minnesota Sands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 10, 2012, the county denied the pending applications and enacted a three-month moratorium to allow its board of commissioners to study the issue more closely. After the moratorium expired, a company that is not a party in this litigation, Nisbit operation, submitted a second CUP application to engage in silica-sand mining, which the county granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2016, a local non-profit asked the county to renew discussions about amending the county's zoning ordinance governing sand mining. The county engaged in an eight-month-long process, during which it investigated the environmental concerns related to industrial mineral operations in particular, and received comments from over 200 county residents through public hearings and written submissions. On November 22, 2016, the county board formally adopted an amendment to the zoning ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The amendment prohibits all industrial mineral operations within the county and permits construction mineral operations, which remains a conditional use. Winona County, Minn., Zoning Ordinance (WCZO),\n   Ch. 10, \u00a7 11 (2016). It defines and distinguishes two groups of minerals:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Construction Minerals: The term \"construction minerals\" includes natural common rock, stone, aggregate, gravel and sand that is produced and used for local construction purposes, including road pavement, unpaved road gravel or cover, concrete, asphalt, building and dimension stone, railroad ballast, decorative stone, retaining walls, revetment stone, riprap, mortar sand, construction lime, agricultural lime and bedding sand for livestock operations, sewer and septic systems, landfills, and sand blasting. The term \"construction minerals\" does not include \"industrial minerals\" as defined below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Industrial Minerals: The term \"industrial minerals\" includes naturally existing high quartz level stone, silica sand, quartz, graphite, diamonds, gemstones, kaolin, and other similar materials used in industrial applications, but excluding construction minerals as defined above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Silica sand is categorized as an industrial mineral by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and the North American Classification System under classification no. 212322.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Silica sand\" has the meaning given in Minnesota Statutes, section 116C.99, subd. 1(d) : \" 'Silica sand' means well-rounded, sand-sized grains of quartz (silicon dioxide), with very little impurities in terms of other minerals. Specifically, the silica sand for the purposes of this section is commercially valuable for use in the hydraulic fracturing of shale to obtain oil and natural gas. Silica sand does not include common rock, stone, aggregate, gravel, sand with a low quartz level, or silica compounds recovered as a by-product of metallic mining.\" Minn. Stat. Section 116C.99, subd. 1(d).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ch. 4, \u00a7 2. Industrial mineral operations include the following activities: (1) acquiring industrial minerals through all digging, excavating, and mining of any sort; (2) processing, filtering, cleaning, and refining industrial minerals; (3) storing or stockpiling said industrial minerals; and (4) hauling or transporting any industrial minerals mined in the county.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Southeast Minnesota Property Owners (SMPO) sued the county in March 2017, alleging that the ordinance is arbitrary and capricious; violates the Due Process, Equal Protection, and Takings Clauses of the Minnesota and United States Constitutions; and violates the Interstate Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. In April 2017, Minnesota Sands sued and alleged the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the district court consolidated the two actions, Minnesota Sands and SMPO each filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims against the county. Specifically, each requested declaratory and injunctive relief to invalidate the amendment and enjoin its enforcement, as well as summary judgment as to all other claims set forth in the complaints. The county filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment. The district court granted the county's summary judgment motion, affirming the validity of the ordinance.

The first is whether the county may ban all silica-sand mining within its boundaries without transgressing Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The second is whether the ordinance prohibiting all silica-sand mining constitutes a regulatory taking of Minnesota Sands' compensable property interest for which it is owed just compensation pursuant to Article I, Section 13 of the Minnesota Constitution and the Takings Clause of the United States Constitution.

We have no reason to believe that the ordinance benefits in-state interests and burdens those out-of-state. The across-the-board application of the ordinance is detrimental to both in-state interests, such as those of Minnesota Sands, as well as out-of-state interests, which indicates that the ordinance does not discriminate on its face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Minnesota Sands also argues that the ordinance is facially discriminatory because it singles out the end-use of the industrial minerals; specifically, silica sand to be processed and used in fracking. In 2014, the Minnesota Environmental Quality Board (EQB) set forth model standards and criteria for local government use in developing local ordinances regarding the mining, processing, and transporting of silica sand. MINN. ENVTL. QUALITY BD. ,\n   <em>\n    Tools to Assist Local Governments in Planning for and Regulating Silica Sand Projects\n   </em>\n   (2014). The report noted that \"silica sand is highly desirable because it\n   <em>\n    can be processed into a product called frac sand\n   </em>\n   , which is used in [the] hydraulic fracturing method of producing oil and gas.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (emphasis added). It is evident that not all silica sand is frac sand. Rather, mined silica sand\n   <em>\n    becomes\n   </em>\n   frac sand after it undergoes\n   a specific process of crushing, cleaning, screening, washing, filtering, drying, sorting, and refining. But the ordinance outlaws all silica-sand mining-not just silica sand to be processed and used in fracking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The ordinance amendment defines silica sand as that which \"is commercially valuable for use in the hydraulic fracturing of shale to obtain oil and natural gas.\" WCZO, Ch. 4, \u00a7 2. Minnesota Sands argues that this amounts to facial discrimination against interstate commerce because Minnesota has no oil or natural gas reserves, and any silica sand processed into frac sand would be transported interstate and used elsewhere. But the ordinance does not discriminate against interstate commerce on its face by merely stating that silica sand is commercially valuable for use in fracking. Nor does it mean that silica sand has no other commercial uses; it simply describes one commercially valuable use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This reasoning is consistent with the affidavit of a registered professional geologist retained by Minnesota Sands as an expert, certifying that silica sand may be used for fracking operations, as well as in the manufacture of glass, filter media, and as a construction material or animal bedding. We do note, however, that the expert's comment about the use of silica sand as a construction material does not alter our conclusion that the ordinance does not discriminate against interstate commerce on its face. The use of silica sand as a construction material in other counties has no bearing on the plain language of the ordinance itself, which specifies that silica sand is an industrial mineral and bans all industrial-mineral mining regardless of its end use. Additionally, the ordinance's definition of \"construction minerals\" specifies that \"[t]he term 'construction minerals' does not include 'industrial minerals' as defined below\" and the definition of industrial minerals states the same relating to construction minerals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The ordinance's differentiation between silica sand-an industrial mineral-and other types of sand-construction minerals-is consistent with the record. Silica sand has a high quartz level, whereas sand within the definition of construction minerals includes many different rock types. Silica sand that is sought for industrial purposes is small, consistently-sized, round sand, which, after processing, becomes frac sand. Sand classified as a construction mineral is not dependent on the uniformity or silica quartz makeup of the mineral, and may have mineral and rock compositions that vary in makeup and size.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Minnesota Sands argues that the ordinance violates the dormant Commerce Clause because the county permits the Nisbit operation to mine silica sand that is sold for various purposes, including animal bedding. Before the county amended the ordinance, all sand mining was a conditional use in Winona County. WCZO, Ch. 10.4.6 (2011) (CUP required for mining);\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ch. 4.2 (mining includes \"the extraction of sand\"). On July 4, 2013, the county granted a CUP to the Nisbits to mine silica sand under this version of the zoning ordinance in effect prior to its amendment on November 22, 2016. The previous version of the ordinance, like the amendment at issue, did not distinguish between the end use of the mined product. In addition, the previous zoning ordinance did not distinguish between silica sand and other types of sand as the amendment does. One limitation imposed on the right of a governmental body to enact zoning restrictions is that such restrictions are subject to the preexisting uses already established within the zoning district.\n   <em>\n    Hawkins v. Talbot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"291679\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/248/549/#p551\">\n    248 Minn. 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 551,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"291679\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/248/549/#p551\">\n    80 N.W.2d 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 865 (1957). Thus, the preexisting use does not affect our dormant Commerce Clause analysis here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Minnesota Sands contends that the ordinance is discriminatory because \"industrial mineral operations\" includes \"hauling or transport, including, but not limited to, the loading, unloading, transfer, hauling, moving and transporting of industrial minerals extracted from a mine located in Winona County.\" WCZO, Ch. 4, \u00a7 2. But this provision of the amendment's definition of \"industrial mineral operations\" is rendered superfluous by the corresponding provision of the \"industrial mineral operations\" definition that prohibits all silica-sand mining. We interpret laws so that, when possible, their provisions will not be deemed superfluous.\n   <em>\n    ILHC of Eagan, LLC v.

However, the transportation provision at issue cannot reasonably be interpreted as anything other than superfluous, given the ban on all silica-sand mining, resulting in no silica sand in need of transport to which the provision may apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For these reasons, the ordinance's ban on silica-sand mining does not discriminate against interstate commerce on its face.

But the record\n   <em>\n    does not\n   </em>\n   confirm that only ordinary sand is used for \"local construction purposes.\" Rather, the record indicates that, both before and after the 2016 amendments to the zoning ordinance, silica sand has been and continues to be used for both \"local construction purposes\" and \"industrial\" purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For example, a report prepared by the state department of natural resources in 2014 describes the uses of silica sand:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Silica sand has been mined in the Upper Midwest for over a century.\n   <em>\n    Uses for this resource include a variety of products and applications like glass-making, abrasives, bedding for livestock, golf course sand traps\n   </em>\n   , and frac sand. Over the past decade, a sharp increase in demand for silica sand corresponded with a rapid expansion of shale oil and gas development. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Silica sand is found in the southeastern portion of the state. Five mines are currently known to extract silica sand for industrial applications.\n   <em>\n    An unknown number of silica sand mines produce silica sand for construction and agricultural uses.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In addition, evidence was presented to the county planning commission that \"there is no geological difference between the industrial mineral 'silica sand' and construction mineral 'sand' \" and that \"the only distinction in the Proposed Ordinance between 'construction minerals' and 'industrial minerals' is how they are used.\" There also is evidence that the \"mining, processing, storage and transportation operations\" related to the two categories of minerals in the draft ordinance \"are essentially the same,\" with the differences limited to \"the final stages of production when silica sand is washed and sorted.\" This evidence is consistent with an affidavit of a registered professional geologist, who stated\n   that silica sand is used both \"as a proppant in hydraulic fracturing\" and \"in the manufacture of glass, filter media, or a construction or bedding material\" and that the process of mining silica sand for its various purposes \"does not differ in any material way.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Furthermore, the county's own zoning administrator executed an affidavit in which he stated that \" 'sand and gravel' considered [by the zoning ordinance as] a construction mineral may include 'silica sand,' as silica sand is found throughout the County and used for construction purposes and animal bedding.\" Moreover, there is evidence in the record that the Nisbit mine (the only Winona County mine that received a conditional-use permit before the 2016 amendments to the county's zoning ordinance) produces silica sand that meets the specifications for hydraulic fracturing but is sold for use as animal bedding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In analyzing the effect of the county's zoning ordinance on interstate commerce, this court should not confine its review to the language of the ordinance. Rather, we should consider the realities of the marketplace. In reality, Winona County silica sand is used both for \"local construction purposes\" and for \"industrial\" purposes, such as hydraulic fracturing, even though the county's zoning ordinance deems silica sand to be an \"industrial mineral\" and defines \"industrial minerals\" to be mutually exclusive with \"construction minerals.\" Consequently, the county's zoning ordinance effectively allows the mining of silica sand for some uses, which are common in the Winona County area, but prohibits the mining of silica sand for other uses, which occur solely outside the state of Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In resolving the issues raised by the parties' arguments, we must be mindful of the procedural posture of the case. This is not a case in which the district court conducted a trial, resolved factual disputes arising from conflicting evidence, and made findings of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. R. Civ.

The ordinance allows the mining of sand that will be \"used for\n   <em>\n    local\n   </em>\n   construction purposes\" but prohibits the mining of sand that will be used for other purposes, such as hydraulic fracturing. Winona County, Minn., Zoning Ordinance (WCZO) \u00a7\u00a7 4.2, 9.10.2, 10.11.1.a (2016) (emphasis added). The record reveals that silica sand has been and continues to be mined and sold to consumers for purposes that are deemed by the ordinance to be \"local construction purposes.\" The record also reveals that hydraulic fracturing is utilized in other states (such as North Dakota and Texas) but is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   utilized in Minnesota and cannot be utilized in Minnesota because Minnesota does not have any significant reserves of oil or natural gas. The ordinance effectively allows silica sand to be mined and sold to local consumers but does not allow it to be mined and sold to consumers in other states. Thus, the ordinance suppresses interstate commerce, to the detriment of (among others) consumers of silica sand in other states, but the ordinance preserves local commerce, to the benefit of local consumers of silica sand, who are insulated from the effects of unrestricted trade in silica sand. For these reasons, the ordinance is discriminatory on its face because it favors \"local\" commerce over interstate commerce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oregon Waste Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147349\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/93/#p99\">\n    511 U.S. at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147349\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/93/#p99\">\n    114 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1350 ;\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780381\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/322/#p337\">\n    441 U.S. at 336-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780381\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/322/#p337\">\n    99 S.Ct. at 1736-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For this purpose, the county relies on the affidavit of its zoning administrator, who stated, \"If I were asked to enforce the Zoning Ordinance with respect to sand being used for a construction project across the river in Wisconsin, the fact that sand was used in Wisconsin would not necessarily make it a non-local use.\" This argument fails for at least four reasons. First, the county's argument is inconsistent with the common definition of the word local, which means \"[o]f or relating to a city, town, or district rather than a larger area.\"\n   <em>\n    The American Heritage Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1029 (5th ed. 2011). Second, there is no evidence in the record that Winona County sand actually is sold\n   in Wisconsin. The zoning administrator did not say so; he considered it to be a hypothetical. It appears unlikely that sand actually is sold in Wisconsin because the record indicates that operating sand mines are far more numerous in the Wisconsin counties that are immediately across the Mississippi River. Third, the zoning administrator did not commit to the interpretation on which the county relies in its brief. He merely stated that the out-of-state location of such use \"would not necessarily make it a non-local use.\" Fourth, and most importantly, any sale of Winona County sand in Wisconsin for \"local construction purposes\" likely would be in relatively small quantities and would not alter the fact that the ordinance disrupts a substantial amount of interstate commerce in silica sand while preserving commerce in silica sand within Winona County. In any event, even if the ordinance is not facially discriminatory because of the word \"local,\" it is discriminatory \"in practical effect.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179268\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/333/#p350\">\n    432 U.S. at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179268\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/333/#p350\">\n    97 S.Ct. at 2445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The majority opinion reasons that Minnesota Sands does not have standing to argue that the ordinance is facially discriminatory based on the ordinance's use of the word \"local.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 782-83. \"Standing is a legal requirement that a party have a sufficient stake in a justiciable controversy to seek relief from a court.\"\n   <em>\n    Enright v.

The fourth option was to \"take no action\" and to continue to rely on conditional-use permits. The record provides details concerning the fourth option: the conditional-use permit that was issued for the Nisbit mine includes numerous provisions to reduce and limit the effects of sand mining. The permit, among other things, requires an erosion-control plan, limits the hours of operation, requires setbacks from residences and wells, requires air-quality and water-quality monitoring, requires a fugitive-dust plan, prohibits stockpiles higher than 24 feet, prohibits any effect on wetlands, restricts noise and lighting levels, requires a road-use agreement that imposes responsibility on the mine for maintenance and replacement costs, limits truck traffic to a certain number of trips per day, requires a \"systematic approach to land reclamation,\" and requires a performance bond of 110 percent of the estimated\n   costs that might be borne by the mine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The United States Supreme Court considered an analogous situation in\n   <em>\n    Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v.

Even with the possible future financial and environmental risks to be borne by Alabama, such risks likewise do not vary with the waste's State of origin in a way allowing foreign, but not local, waste to be burdened.

The county determined at that time that there was no need for an environmental-impact statement with respect to the Nisbit mine, and this court affirmed that determination on appellate review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Environmental Impact Statement re Nisbit Quarry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6932726\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/849/71/#p84\">\n    849 N.W.2d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 84 (Minn. App. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The majority opinion upholds the district court's reasoning on slightly different grounds. The majority opinion reasons that Minnesota Sands does not have a compensable property interest on the ground that it has lost its leasehold interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 783-84. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Minnesota Sands has lost its leasehold interests. A simple review of the six leases indicates that each lease remains in effect. Three leases have an original term that ends \"five years after the issuance of a conditional-use permit.\" Two leases had an original term ending in October 2016 but were amended in 2015 to terminate either five years after all regulatory approvals or in 2023, whichever is earlier. The sixth lease was executed in 2015 and terminates either five years after all regulatory approvals or in 2023, whichever is earlier. None of the six leases has expired. The majority opinion relies on a lease provision stating that Minnesota Sands's \"obligations under this Agreement are conditioned upon [Minnesota Sands] obtaining any zoning or governmental approvals required\" for the mining of silica sand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 784. Minnesota Sands's principal obligation toward the six lessors is to pay royalties based on the volume of silica sand that is mined. The clause concerning Minnesota Sands's\n   <em>\n    obligations\n   </em>\n   under each lease does not affect Minnesota Sands's\n   <em>\n    rights\n   </em>\n   under each lease, which have not expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In essence, the majority opinion reasons that Minnesota Sands does not have a compensable property interest because it does not have a conditional-use permit. But of course, Minnesota Sands cannot obtain a conditional-use permit because the county will not grant one because of the ordinance that is being challenged in this case.
