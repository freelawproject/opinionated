At trial, the defendant presented evidence that at the time of the commission of the crimes with which he was charged he was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law as the result of a mental defect known as pathological or compulsive gambling. On the basis of the psychiatric testimony presented, the trial court found the defendant not guilty by reason of insanity pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53E-13.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendant was ordered committed to a state mental hospital under General Statutes \u00a753a-47(a) (l)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to determine whether \u201chis release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>[from custody] would constitute a danger to himself or others.\u201d General Statutes \u00a753a-47(a) (3). At a subsequent hearing under \u00a7 53a-47(a) (4), the trial court heard the testimony of Hans Lang-hammer, a staff psychiatrist at Norwich State Hospital called by the state, and Marvin Steinberg, a psychologist called by the defendant. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court in an oral decision found that the defendant did not constitute a danger to himself or others, and it ordered his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The state, after obtaining the permission of the trial court pursuant to $ 54-96 of the General Statutes, appealed to this court claiming that the trial court erred by interpreting the phrase \u201ca danger to himself or others\u201d in $ 53a-47(a) (4) to mean only a physical danger, and not a danger to property. The state argues that the trial court found the defendant to be a danger to property and that such a danger is included within the meaning of \u201ca danger to himself and others\u201d in the statute. The defendant responds that the court found only that the defendant was \u201cpossibly\u201d a danger to property, but that even if he were so, he was nonetheless prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>erly released because the statute is limited to physical danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In its oral decision, the court stated: \u201c[A]s this court understands the testimony, I believe Dr. Lang-hammer was very precise in this, he indicated that there was no danger as far as physical harm was concerned. There was a danger as far as property was concerned <em>possibly </em>by the defendant\u2019s action in this matter,\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is unclear whether the trial court was merely recapitulating the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony or whether it was making a finding of fact. Also, the use of the word \u201cpossibly\u201d regarding danger to property adds to the ambiguity of the court\u2019s oral decision. Whether the defendant was a danger to property is a question of fact which must be determined before we may properly review the claims made in this appeal. It is the function of the trial court, not this court, to find facts. It is therefore necessary for us to remand this case for a further articulation of the trial court\u2019s decision on whether the defendant was a danger to property. \u201cThe supervision of a case on appeal is in the Supreme Court.
