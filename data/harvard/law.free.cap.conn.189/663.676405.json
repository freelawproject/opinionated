On June 12, 1973, the plaintiff appeared without counsel before the New London Superior Court to be heard on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>motion filed by him concerning the appeal of his previous criminal conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the course of this hearing, the plaintiff and the court engaged in a colloquy which culminated in the court, <em>Naruk, J., </em>finding the plaintiff in contempt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon adjudging the plaintiff in contempt, the court imposed a sentence of thirty days, to be served consecutive to the prison term resulting from the plaintiff\u2019s prior criminal conviction. After an unsuccessful appeal to this court concerning the underlying criminal conviction,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiff was incarcerated at the Connecticut Correctional Institution in Somers.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">On May 21, 1979, the plaintiff filed an amended petition for writ of habeas corpus, wherein he claimed, inter alia, that his conduct before Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Naruk was not contemptuous and that therefore the finding of contempt and resulting sentence should be vacated. On May 23, 1979, the state moved to quash the petition on the ground that habeas corpus is not the proper proceeding in which to test the legality of a criminal contempt citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">After a hearing on the state\u2019s motion to quash, the trial court, <em>B. O\u2019Neill, J., </em>granted the motion on October 29, 1979. Construing the law as it existed in 1973, a stipulation agreed upon by the parties, the court concluded that a writ of error is the sole method by which the plaintiff may contest a judgment of criminal contempt committed in the presence of the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court ruled that habeas corpus is unavailable to the plaintiff as a vehicle to contest a summary criminal contempt citation. Prom this judgment, the plaintiff appeals. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Clear authority to the contrary notwithstanding; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>186 Conn. 256, 257, 440 A.2d 969 (1982); <em>Whiteside </em>v. <em>State, </em>148 Conn. 77, 78-79, 167 A.2d 450 (1961); <em>State </em>v. <em>Melechinsky, </em>36 Conn. Sup. 547, 549, 419 A.2d 900 (1980); the petitioner argues that a writ of error is not the sole method of review of a summary criminal contempt proceeding. Such an argument misconstrues the distinction between summary criminal contempt and civil contempt, as well as the disparate functions of a writ of error and a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Criminal contempt, as distinguished from civil contempt, \u201cis conduct that is directed against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>dignity and authority of the eourt.\u201d <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Shelton Education Assn., </em>173 Conn. 81, 85, 376 A.2d 1080 (1977). Sanctions are imposed in order to vindicate that authority. Id. Where contemptuous conduct is committed in the presence of the court, punishment may be announced summarily. <em>State </em>v. <em>Melechinsky, </em>supra, 549; see General Statutes \u00a7 51-33.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under such circumstances, \u201c \u2018no witnesses are required in proof of the contempt, and the eourt has inherent power to impose punishment on its own knowledge and of its own motion without formal presentation or hearing of the person adjudged in contempt . . . .\u2019 <em>Whiteside </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 78.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Civil contempt, conversely, is conduct \u201cdirected against some right of the opposing party . . . .\u201d <em>Tobey </em>v. <em>Tobey, </em>165 Conn. 742, 745, 345 A.2d 21 (1974). \u201c\u2018[A] contempt is considered civil when the punishment is wholly remedial, serves only the purposes of the complainant, and is not intended as a deterrent to offenses against the public.\u2019 <em>McCrone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>307 U.S. 61, 64, 59 S. Ct. 685, 83 L. Ed. 1108 [1939].\u201d <em>McTigue </em>v. <em>New London Education Assn., </em>164 Conn. 348, 352, 321 A.2d 462 (1973). Unlike a summary criminal contempt proceeding, civil contempt is initiated by the opposing party, who seeks vindication of a claimed civil right. <em>Stoner </em>v. <em>Stoner, </em>163 Conn. 345, 359, 307 A.2d 146 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Although a contemner may seek appellate review of a criminal contempt adjudication, our inquiry \u201cis limited to a determination of the jurisdiction of the court below.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 257. \u201cSubsumed in this inquiry are three questions, namely, (1) whether the designated conduct is legally susceptible of constituting a contempt ... (2) whether the punishment imposed was authorized by law . . . and (3) whether the judicial authority was qualified to conduct the hearing. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. \u201cWhere the contemptuous conduct occurs outside of the presence of the court, and the court acts on the motion of one of the parties, the contempt judgment is reviewable by appeal; <em>Leslie </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em>174 Conn. 399, 402, 389 A.2d 747 (1978); <em>Stoner </em>v. <em>Stoner, </em>163 Conn. 345, 359, 307 A.2d 146 (1972); and this is true even if the contempt sanctions imposed are criminal in nature.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Melechinsky, </em>supra; see <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Shelton Education Assn., </em>supra, 86; <em>McTigue </em>v. <em>New London Education Assn., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Where, however, a contemner seeks review of a summary criminal contempt adjudication, such review \u201chas been on a more restricted procedural basis . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Melechinsky, </em>supra. The reason for this limited appellate review lies in the unique character of summary criminal contempt proceedings. \u201c[S]uch adjudications, if they may be called such, are not judgments or awards in the nature of judgments. They are punishments imposed for offenses against the court as an organ of public justice, to enable it to maintain its dignity and duly perform its functions. The power to so punish is essential to a court to enable it to administer justice. Without it a court would be helpless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>against persons disposed to obstruct, delay, or thwart its proceedings. The power has consequently been held to be inherent in courts . . . .\u201d <em>Goodhart </em>v. <em>State, </em>84 Conn. 60, 62-63, 78 A. 853 (1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The ancient remedy of writ of error, \u201cformerly the only method ... of carrying up a cause from an inferior to a higher court for the revision of questions of law\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Caplan, </em>85 Conn. 618, 622, 84 A. 280 (1912); provides a narrow basis for appellate review. It is settled law in this jurisdiction that the scope of appellate review on a writ of error is limited solely to matters appearing as of record. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>180 Conn. 345, 347, 429 A.2d 900 (1980); <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>State, </em>119 Conn. 217, 223, 175 A. 582 (1934). \u201cA writ of error may not assign as error, nor may we review on a writ of error, allegations concerning the conduct of the trial court that contradict the record ... or findings of fact as distinguished from conclusions of law.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>supra. \u201cMatters occurring at the trial, as rulings on evidence, claimed errors in the charge and the like . . . have no place now in a writ of error .. ..\u201d Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. ^ 239</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Habeas corpus, as a remedy for illegal detention, is a special and extraordinary writ. <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>155 Conn. 591, 594, 236 A.2d 909 (1967). Although \u201c[t]he usual question involved in the proceeding is one of jurisdiction\u201d; <em>Wojculewicz </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>143 Conn. 624, 627, 124 A.2d 886 (1956); inquiry as to the claim of lack of jurisdiction ordinarily requires the presentation of evidence, whereas the question of jurisdiction pursuant to a writ of error is confined solely to matters appearing as of record. See <em>Arey </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>187 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>324, 331-32, 445 A.2d 916 (1982); General Statutes $ 52-470. Thus, while a habeas court may not \u201creview irregularities or errors of procedure or questions as to the sufficiency of evidence\u201d; <em>Wojculewicz </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>supra, 628; it may, and indeed under appropriate circumstances it must, consider relevant and material evidence beyond that contained in the record. See <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>594 F.2d 144, 145-46 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">It is the final nature of a summary criminal contempt adjudication, and the correspondingly narrow scope of appellate review available on a writ of error, which provides the basis for the established precedent that the writ is the sole means by which a contemner may contest such an adjudication. \u201cA court exercises considerable discretion in dealing with contemptuous conduct occurring in its presence, and its summary adjudication is accorded a presumption of finality.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Melechinsky, </em>supra. \u201cProm necessity the court must be its own judge of contempts committed within its presence.\u201d <em>Goodhart </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra. \u201c[T]he punishment, to be effectual, must be immediate and peremptory, and not subject to suspension at the mere will of the offender.\u201d <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Hamersley, </em>44 Conn. 393, 412, 26 A. 471 (1877). To subject a summary criminal contempt citation to the full multitude of claims of error ordinarily available on appellate review, or to jurisdictional challenges beyond those appearing as of record, would frustrate the inherent power of a court, as an organ of public justice, to punish persons disposed to obstruct, delay or thwart it. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>147 Conn. 167, 169, 158 A.2d 166 (1960). Only \u201cif it appears from the record that the court did not have jurisdiction, as, for example, that it had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>authority to impose the punishment inflicted, or that the act for which the punishment was inflicted could not constitute a contempt, [may] the action of the court ... be set aside on a writ of error.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Goodhart </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-7\"><em> </em>The plaintiff\u2019s motion was entitled \u201cAffidavit in Support Of Motion To Vaeate Judgment \u2014 Writ of Error.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\">\u201cThe Aceused: I\u2019ve already asked you a question and haven\u2019t got an answer on that.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. McClain, you keep this up and I will hold you in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">\u201cThe Aceused: And, your Honor, if I may say, the petitioner may hold the court beneath contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-13\">\u201cThe Court: Do you want to repeat that?</p>\n<p id=\"b676-14\">\u201cThe Accused: Will you have the stenographer read it back please.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-16\">\u201cThe Court: Read it,.

Do you want to leave that statement on the record? I am giving you an opportunity to withdraw it.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-21\">\u201cThe Accused: The petitioner would like for his statement to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-23\">\u201cThe Court: The court therefore finds you in contempt, and in addition to the sentence which you are presently serving, will herewith sentence you for contempt in open court to an additional thirty days in jail.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b676-25\"> <em>State </em>v. <em>McClain, 171 </em>Conn. 293, 370 A.2d 928 (1976). Judge Naruk\u2019s contempt citation was not raised as an issue in that appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b677-9\"> Although the court construed the law as it existed in 1973, it was not required to do so as the law governing appellate review of summary criminal eontempt adjudications has not changed since 1973.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b678-7\"> General Statutes \u00a751-33 states: \u201cpunishment for contempt of COURT. Any eourt may punish by fine and imprisonment any person who in its presence behaves contemptuously or in a disorderly manner; but no eourt may impose a greater fine than one hundred dollars or a longer term of imprisonment than six months or both.\u201d This statute was in effect without material change in 1973. General Statutes (Bev. to 1972) \u00a7 51-33.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\"> We reject the plaintiff\u2019s additional claim that even if he had brought a timely writ of error in 1973, he would not have obtained a hearing on the merits of the summary contempt citation because of the lack of a record. It is true that \u201c[w]hen the contempt is in the presence of the court, there is no written charge or complaint, and therefore there is no opportunity for the one who is punished to protect his rights unless the facts found are spread upon the judgment file. Hence, it is essential that the jurisdiction of the court appear on the face of the judgment.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>147 Conn. 167, 170, 158 A.2d 166 (1960). In 1973, however, Practice Book, 1963, \u00a7260 (now \u00a7327) stated: \u201cEach court shall keep a record of its proceedings and cause the facts on which it found its final judgments and decrees to appear on the record; and any sueh finding if requested by any party shall specially set forth such facts.\u201d Moreover, Practice Book, 1963, \u00a7 265 (now \u00a7 333) stated in pertinent part: \u201cA special finding of facts under Sec. 260 should rarely be requested or made but when made it becomes a part of the record with the same effect as though the facts were included in the judgment and claims of error may be based upon it as appearing of record. If the special finding is insufficient to support the judgment, the error is one upon the record. The purpose of a special finding is to place upon the record the material facts upon which the judgment is based . . . .\u201d In view of the foregoing, it is apparent that the plaintiff eould have secured an adequate record upon whieh to contest, by writ of error, the jurisdiction of the trial court. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cray, </em>88 Conn. 141, 144, 89 A. 1123 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">We further reject the plaintiff\u2019s claim that only with respect to citations issuing from a municipal court is the writ of error the sole means of reviewing a criminal contempt citation. Our cases make no such distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
