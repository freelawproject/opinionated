(See Docket No. 10552, <em>Grunschlag et al. </em>v. <em>Ethel Walker School, Inc., et al., </em>Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain.) \u201cThere is no question . . . concerning our power to take judicial notice of files of the Superior Court, whether the file is from the case at bar or otherwise.\u201d <em>Karp </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>162 Conn. 525, 527, 294 A.2d 633 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lenihan, </em>151 Conn. 552, 554, 200 A.2d 476 (1964). After a number of pleadings had been filed, the case was claimed for the jury docket and the trial list in March, 1977. The transcript<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed discloses that when it was reached for trial on the civil jury trial list on March 4, 1980, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel informed the court, <em>Hendel, J., </em>that \u201cboth plaintiffs live out of State; and are involved in scheduled public concert performances.\u201d The court replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll set it down for pretrial, and we\u2019ll set a date certain.\u201d It again appeared on the assignment list for March 11, 1980, and at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>that time the conrt said: \u201cOver to 4/8 for a date certain.\u201d On April 8, 1980, the conrt said: \u201cGrunsehlag versus Ethel Walker. That\u2019s specially assigned for 6/10.\u201d The judgment file in the record reflects in part that: \u201cSaid action came thence to June 10,1980 when the action was assigned for trial and when the Defendants appeared, but the Plaintiffs did not appear to prosecute their cause. The Court, on its own motion, entered a judgment of Dismissal as to both Plaintiffs.\u201d Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a \u201cMotion to Set Aside Dismissal.\u201d That motion, which sought to set aside the \u201csuo motu\u201d judgment of dismissal, contains various factual allegations, claimed as reasons for the setting aside of the judgment of dismissal. The court, <em>Hendel, J., </em>held a hearing on the motion and denied it as to the plaintiff Rosi Grunsehlag while granting it is to the plaintiff Toni Grunsehlag \u201cprovided each defense counsel is paid $260.00 by 12-15-80 in cashier\u2019s check.\u201d Thereafter, the plaintiff Rosi Grunsehlag took this appeal. In her brief on appeal she maintains that the \u201crecord\u201d does not support the trial court\u2019s action in dismissing her case on the grounds that it was not prosecuted with reasonable diligence and that that court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">A number of the factual allegations which appeared in this motion also appear in the \u201cStatement of the Facts\u201d in the plaintiff\u2019s brief; and the defendants claim that <em>\u201cnot one </em>of the ten paragraphs of plaintiff\u2019s \u2018Statement of the Facts\u2019 was properly supported in the record presented to [this] court by the plaintiff.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The defendants do, however, concede that a portion of one paragraph of this statement of facts is supported by the transcript of the \u201ccourt\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>weekly docket list call\u201d which has been filed by them, i.e., that the case was specially assigned on April 8, 1980, for June 10, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s \u201cstatement of facts\u201d asserts as facts, inter alia, the following: On June 3, 1980, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel conferred with the presiding judge in chambers<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and requested that the trial be postponed because most of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses would be unavailable on June 10 as they were employed in the academic field and had already dispersed for summer recess. He asserts that the judge granted his request and reassigned the case for trial on September 9, 1980, and so marked his assignment list. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel claims that on the morning of June 9, 1980, the defendants\u2019 counsel telephoned him, informing him that the presiding judge requested his immediate appearance in chambers. He complied, and the judge ordered him to be prepared to begin trial on the morning of June 10, 1980, or suffer a judgment of dismissal for failure to comply with this order. Despite the \u201cprotestations\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and his reference to the \u201creassignment date of September 9, 1980,\u201d the order to proceed on June 10, 1980, was not changed. Because, according to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, he was unable to commence trial on June 10, 1980, the presiding judge, <em>Hendel, J., </em>\u201csua sponte,\u201d rendered a judgment of dismissal on that date. None of these \u201cfacts\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is properly in the record before us except that the judgment of dismissal was rendered on June 10, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>From what we have said, it is clear that the record before us is quite inadequate to permit our determination of the issue presented. It is the burden of the plaintiff-appellant, utilizing the rules of practice, to present us with a proper record on the basis of which we can, in fairness to all the parties, determine the appeal. She has not carried this burden. In that regard, she has never moved either in the trial court or in this court for a further - articulation of the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 3082, 3060D. \"We have said that \u201c[t]his court cannot resort to matters extraneous to the formal record, to facts which have not been found and which are not admitted in the pleadings or exhibits which are not part of the record.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>173 Conn. 462, 465, 378 A.2d 547 (1977). That statement applies here. Although there have been changes in our rules of practice and we no longer have findings of fact in that format which we did prior to those changes, the observation that \u201c[a] reference made merely in the \u2018statement of facts\u2019 in the brief, without support in the finding, does not constitute a fact in the case\u201d which we made in <em>Windham Community Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Willimantic, </em>166 Conn. 113, 123 n.6, 348 A.2d 651 (1974), is directly in point. \u201cIn the absence of specific findings by the trial court and a basis for its decision, we are not able to determine whether the court\u2019s discretion was abused in this case. Where \u2018necessary to the proper disposition of the cause,\u2019 this court may \u2018remand the case for a further articulation of the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision.\u2019 Practice Book \u00a7 3060D; <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>183 Conn. 124, 125, 438 A.2d 845 (1981).\u201d <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>185 Conn. 42, 46, 440 A.2d 252 (1981).
