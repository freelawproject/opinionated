The court denied the motion to suppress after considering the additional testimony. The court also denied an oral motion for discovery and production of certain exculpatory information, made at the end of the state\u2019s case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this appeal the defendant claims that the trial court erred in twice denying his motion to suppress and in denying his oral motion for discovery and production.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Pretrial Identification Suppression Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The circumstances surrounding the court\u2019s action denying the motions to suppress prior to trial and after an evidentiary hearing are the following: On July 21, 1978, at about 10:30 p.m. Gail Cook was working as a clerk-cashier at the Food Bag store on West Main Street in Meriden. At that time there were about six people in the store. While Cook was attending a customer, Lucy Kennedy, at the reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ister, a young man with a bandana around his face walked in. As he walked through the door the bandana fell down off his face. He approached Cook and said \u201cit\u2019s [your] turn again, baby, this is a holdup.\u201d She recognized his face as she had seen him in the store before. She thought he was joking. She \u201ckind of argued with him\u201d and he repeatedly asked her to give him the money and she refused, shutting the cash register drawer. The bandana kept falling down and he kept putting it back up. He was just over the counter from her. The store was fully lit by fluorescent lighting. He eventually pulled out a knife and leaned over the counter even closer, to her, \u201conly two or three feet away.\u201d She then gave him the money, he fled and she called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">When the police arrived, she gave them a detailed description of the robber including height, weight, age, hair and clothing, and told them that she had seen him in the store before.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the night of the robbery she was taken to the police headquarters in Meriden where she reviewed trays of mug shots and she selected a photo of the defendant. Detective Fred J. Bucchieri, who investigated the robbery, brought this photo to court with him; it became an exhibit at the suppression hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cook told the police that the photo was of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>robber but that the length of hair and the fullness of face of the man who robbed her was different from the photo. On cross-examination she remained steadfast in her identification of this photo.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">On August 31, 1978, Cook returned to Meriden police headquarters at the request of the police where she viewed an array of seven photos. She picked one photo from this array which she told the police was that of the defendant. This photo was one of the defendant taken in 1978; the photo of the defendant she had selected on July 22 was taken in 1975. Bucchieri testified that he went to Cook\u2019s house sometime between July 21 and August 31 and showed her some photos. He, however, had no record of these photos nor did he make a report on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Lucy Kennedy testified that on the night of the robbery she drove to the Food Bag store with her sister-in-law to purchase a bottle of juice. While she was at the counter paying Cook, a man with a bandana over his face came in. She heard him say, \u201c[i]t\u2019s your time again\u201d to Cook, and the latter turned over the money after he drew out a knife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>and held it towards Cook. While in the store she observed the front and side of his face. Although the robber told Kennedy not to go anywhere, she walked behind him and ran out of the store. She estimated that the events of the robbery inside the store took up approximately two minutes. She got in her car and at this point she saw the robber running outside across the storefront toward a side street. At that point she observed him as the bandana was down around his neck. At that time she was about twenty feet from him looking through the window of her car. There were lights at the gas pumps<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and in the store. Kennedy then returned to the store, talked to the cashier and called the police to whom she gave a description. Although she went to the police station that night, she did not make an identification of the robber from the photos she viewed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Cook also testified at the trial and her testimony on her identification of the defendant from police photos was essentially as she had testified on the motion to suppress. She told the jury that as he walked through the door he said \u201c[i]t\u2019s your turn again, baby\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that the bandana \u201cfell off his face, down below his chin\u201d as he approached the counter. She refused to give him the money, thinking he was joking, until he pulled a knife and then she took him seriously. She saw him \u201cfull in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the face\u201d and she had seen him before. Cook recounted for the jury the description she had given the police on the night of the incident as well as the circumstances of her selection of the defendant\u2019s 1975 photo on July 21, 1978, and of his 1978 photo on August 31, 1978. She maintained that no police officer had shown her any photos at any time other than on July 21 and August 31. Additionally, she made an in-court identification of the defendant during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Bucchieri also testified at the trial that Cook had picked out a 1975 photo of the defendant on July 21, 1978, and that on August 31, 1978, she picked out a 1978 photo<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of him from an array of seven photos he had prepared. He testified that she had \u201c[n]o doubt whatsoever\u201d about the 1978 photo. Bucchieri\u2019s testimony on cross-examination about Cook\u2019s selection of the 1975 photo of the defendant at the police station was later advanced as a basis<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> by the defense for moving to reopen the court\u2019s earlier denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>along with Bucchieri\u2019s testimony that he thought that on one occasion between July 21 and August 31 he had shown Cook some police photos at her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The defendant claims that the identification procedures were impermissibly suggestive and unreliable and that, therefore, the denial of suppression of the identification was error. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u201c \u2018In determining whether identification procedures violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights, the required inquiry is made on an ad hoc basis and is two-pronged: first, it must be determined whether the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive; and second, if it is found to have been so, it must be determined whether the identification was nevertheless reliable based on examination of the \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Theriault, </em>182 Conn. 366, 371-72, 438 A.2d 432 (1980); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>185 Conn. 607, 611, 441 A.2d 595 (1981). \u2018\u201c[C]onvictions based on eyewitness identification at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph will be set aside on that ground only if the photographic indentification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u2019 <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S. Ct. 967, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1247 (1968).\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>178 Conn. 287, 291, 422 A.2d 323 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">In making his claim, the defendant, pointing to the fact that no record was made of the photos Cook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>selected on July 21, maintains that her testimony as to that identification coupled with Bucchieri\u2019s testimony that she was not positive at that time, along with the other identification procedures, satisfies the first prong of the test. Included in this argument is his claim that an identification procedure, for which the photos allegedly used are not available, took place between July 21 and August 31 when Bucchieri went to her house with police photos for her to view. Cook denied that this ever took place but Bucehieri\u2019s testimony suggests the contrary although he had no report of its occurrence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant argues further that the photo array, which she viewed on August 31,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> repeating as it did the defendant\u2019s photo as well as placing it among other photos not resembling the robber emphasized his photo<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and, thus, raised the danger of misidentification to an impermissibly suggestive level.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Even if we were, arguendo, to consider that these circumstances made the identification process suggestive, the defendant still could not prevail if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>identification itself was nevertheless reliable in light of the totality of the circumstances. This is so because reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 614; <em>State </em>v. <em>Theriault, </em>supra, 373; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 655, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980). \u201cThe standard, after all, is that of fairness as required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>supra, 113; <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 742, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979). \u201cReliability is to be determined by the totality of the circumstances as emphasized in <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 87 S. Ct. 1967, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1199 (1967), and <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401 (1972). <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>[177 Conn. 677, 742, 419 A.2d 866 (1979)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 655. \u201c \u2018[T]he factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of misidentification include the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.\u2019 <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>[409 U.S. 188, 199-200, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401 (1972)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>173 Conn. 545, 551, 378 A.2d 588 (1977). \u2018Against these factors is to be weighed the corrupting effect of the suggestive identification itself.\u2019 <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>[432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1977)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>[173 Conn. 545, 551, 378 A.2d 588 (1977)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The reliability of the identification is disclosed by the circumstances, most of which have already been set out. Cook had a sufficient opportunity to observe the robber at the time of the crime. Her degree of attention to him was quite adequate including that period when she thought he was joking about robbing her; she also insisted on cross-examination that she had \u201cconcentrated\u201d on him. Her prior description, including her written statement to the police on the night of the robbery, was not only quite accurate but detailed. The level of certainty demonstrated by her was high.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Under the circumstances the brevity of time between the crime and the confrontation contributed to the conclusion of reliability. On July 21, the night of the robbery, she viewed several hundred police photos and picked out only one photo \u2014 that of the defendant. Cook again picked the defendant\u2019s photo right out on August 31; Bucchieri himself said she did it without any doubt. At no time did she identify anyone other than the defendant as the robber. The trial court was not in error in concluding that the identifications should not be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>The defendant\u2019s other claim is that the trial court erred in denying his oral motion for production of exculpatory information which he made after the state rested. He maintains that the state should have been ordered to produce the photos shown to Cook by Bucchieri when he allegedly went with photos to her home between July 21 and August 31. This, he continues, would enable him to determine if she was shown a photo of the defendant and failed to identify him. Additionally, he argues that he could ascertain if any of the photos shown Cook at that time were repeated in the August 31 viewing. He then reasons that if such a rejected photo reappeared on August 31 as one of the six photos in that spread that was not of the defendant, it would therefore strengthen his claim that the August 31 identification procedure was suggestive. He also moved for the discovery and production of the photos selected by Cook and Kennedy on July 21. Included in his argument here is the claim that Cook selected more photos on July 21 than just that of the defendant. Production of these photos would, he asserts, have allowed him to cross-examine Cook and Kennedy, \u201con their inability to positively identify the Defendant as the robber.\u201d It is then his position that if any of those were \u201cvery different either from the description of the robber or from a fair description of the defendant\u201d the issue of this identification of the defendant as the robber, which \u201cwas the sole issue in the trial\u201d would have been in \u201cmuch doubt.\u201d We must reject these claims.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The defendant maintains that a \u201cspecific request for the photographs was made during trial at the earliest possible opportunity\u201d after Bucchieri\u2019s statement that the photographs existed. This request was made on June 4, 1980, after the state had rested and after defense counsel by his cross-examination had just elicited that no record had been made of the photos either Cook or Kennedy selected on July 21 or which Cook had \u201cviewed\u201d on that occasion when Bucchieri had allegedly brought photos to her home sometime between July 21 and August 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Before trial, the defendant had filed a motion for discovery and inspection which sought inter alia: \u201cAny and all exculpatory information or materials.\u201d The state\u2019s response to that request, which was filed on May 29, 1979, was \u201cPossible exculpatory material hereto attached.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Despite the fact that the material thus made available long before trial indicated to him the existence of \u201cpossible exculpatory material\u201d in the viewing of mug shots by the witnesses, he seems to argue that the state\u2019s response cannot be said to have alerted him to which materials to request although his motion was for the photos the witnesses viewed and those they selected as resembling the robber. This con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>travenes common sense as to the photos selected on July 21 by both witnesses because the response to discovery and inspection clearly demonstrates that photos were picked out at that time. As to the alleged identification procedure between July 21 and August 31 at Cook\u2019s home, we note that counsel for the state, in argument on this motion in the trial court, told the court that it was not until August 31 that the police had a second photo of the defendant so as to enable them to \u201cshow another display [to Cook].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In pressing his position here the defendant argues that the law has centered around the cases of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This presents a fair starting point in our analysis. In <em>Brady </em>the court held that \u201csuppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused . . . violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or the bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 87. In refining the <em>Brady </em>rule, <em>Agurs </em>said that it \u201carguably applies in three quite different situations\u201d: (1) where the prosecution\u2019s case includes perjured testimony that the prosecution knew of or should have known of; (2) where there has been a pretrial request for specific evidence; and (3) where there has been a general request for exculpatory material or no request at all. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra, 103-107. <em>Agurs </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>points out that where a request is made for \u201call <em>Brady </em>material\u201d or for \u201canything exculpatory,\u201d \u201c[s]ueh a request really gives the prosecutor no better notice than if no request is made . . .\u201d and that such a request is \u201ca general request.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra, 106-107; see also <em>Wagster </em>v. <em>Overberg, </em>560 F.2d 735, 739 (6th Cir. 1977). The defendant\u2019s pretrial request under the circumstances was general. Where only a general request is made, the burden is on the defendant to establish that the failure to disclose is a denial of due process. <em>Talamante </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>620 F.2d 784, 788 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 877, 101 S. Ct. 223, 66 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>579 F.2d 553, 560 (10th Cir. 1978); <em>Wagster </em>v. <em>Overberg, </em>supra. This is a \u201cheavy burden.\u201d <em>Wagster </em>v. <em>Overberg, </em>supra, 740. \u201cThe mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish \u2018materiality\u2019 in the constitutional sense.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra, 109-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">To prevail on a claimed violation of <em>Brady </em>and its progeny requires proof of: \u201c(a) suppression by the prosecution after a request by the defense, (b) the evidence\u2019s favorable character for the defense,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and (c) the materiality of the evidence.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>408 U.S. 786, 794-95, 92 S. Ct. 2562, 33 L. Ed. 2d 706, reh. denied, 409 U.S. 897, 93 S. Ct. 87, 34 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1972). The defendant argues that the photos were material. It is very often true, and it is true here, that the materiality of the evidence in question is key. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Winner, </em>641 F.2d 825, 833 (10th Cir. 1981); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>Talamante </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>supra, 787. \u201cProof of materiality is important because <em>\u2018Brady </em>is not a discovery rule, but a rule of fairness and minimum prosecutorial obligation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Talamante </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>supra, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beasley, </em>576 F.2d 626, 630 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 947, 99 S. Ct. 1426, 59 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1979); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Winner, </em>supra, 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u201cDue to the large array of evidence which can be considered favorable to the defense, courts have employed a sliding scale analysis in determining what level of materiality must be proven in order to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>579 F.2d 553 (10th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, sub nom., <em>Allen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>439 U.S. 981, 99 S. Ct. 569, 58 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1978).\u201d <em>Talamante </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>supra, 787. The third level of materiality announced by <em>Agurs </em>that applies to the defendant\u2019s general request here provides that his conviction will be constitutionally flawed only \u201cif the omitted evidence creates a reasonable doubt [as to his guilt] that did not otherwise exist. . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra, 112; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stassi, </em>544 F.2d 579, 584 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>184 Conn. 258, 279, 439 A.2d 983 (1981). \u201cThis means that the omission must be evaluated in the context of the entire record.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The issue of materiality is complicated by two somewhat intertwined circumstances peculiar to this case: the fact that no record was kept of the photos viewed on July 21 and the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the alleged viewing by Cook sometime between July 21 and August 31. Taking up the allegation of the photos selected on July 21, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>is no claim that there was a lack of procedural due process in the actual photo selection and so the inability to regroup or produce those photos does not make the photographic identification invalid per se. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Clemons, </em>445 F.2d 711, 714 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 956, 92 S. Ct. 322, 30 L. Ed. 2d 273 (1971). \u201cAdmittedly, it might have been a better procedure if the Police Department had kept a record of all such pictorial arrays. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>137 U.S. App. D.C. 89, 92, 420 F.2d 1292, 1295 (1969).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Clemons, </em>supra; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>92 Mich. App. 619, 625, 285 N.W.2d 392 (1979). We have said that \u201c[although the practice [of retention and preservation for examination at trial of the photographs at a pretrial identification] is highly desirable, it cannot be held, as a matter of law, to be a necessary condition precedent to a permissible in-court identification.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lally, </em>167 Conn. 601, 607, 356 A.2d 897, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 829, 96 S. Ct. 48, 46 L. Ed. 2d 46 (1975). Constitutional error does not arise unless the \u201comitted evidence,\u201d evaluated on the entire record, creates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra, 112. Here there is no such reasonable doubt. Cook picked one photo out on July 21, when her memory was fresh and it was that of the defendant. That photo was in evidence and she made an unequivocal in-court identification of him. In addition, her testimony also included an accurate and detailed description of the robber which she gave to the police right after the robbery. This bolstered her in-court identification. The significance of any photos selected by Kennedy on July 21 is not even minimal as the defendant specifically withdrew his motion to suppress as against her. Thereafter, she made an in-court iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>tification of the defendant. There was thus a strong independent source for the identification of the defendant as the robber apart from the photo identifications. The defendant cross-examined both Cook and Kennedy at some length on their identification testimony. The jury therefore had evidence before it which, if believed, putting aside any identification by photo, would sustain the identification of the defendant as the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The entire identification issue, including whether the identification procedures were suggestive, was thoroughly tried to the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaPierre, </em>10 Mass. App. 641, 411 N.E.2d 1314 (1980). Moreover, the question whether the alleged photo viewing by Cook at her home ever took place was left for the jury to decide.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The court charged the jury in detail concerning identification. In an instruction quite favorable to the defendant, it permitted the jury, over the exception of the state, to draw, if they wished, an unfavorable inference \u25a0against the state for the nonproduction of photographs.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We are not dealing with a guilty verdict which \u201cis already of questionable validity, [where] additional evidence of relatively minor importance might be sufficient to create a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra, 113. The materiality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>of the evidence in question has not been demonstrated and so the \u201comitted evidence\u201d does not rise to the level of constitutional error as claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime ...
