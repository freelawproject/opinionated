The defendant filed a cross application seeking to confirm the award. The trial court rendered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff has appealed claiming that the award should have been vacated because the arbitrators (1) rendered a decision upon an issue not within the scope of the submission and (2) failed to decide certain matters which were included in the submission. We have concluded that the award was deficient in both these respects and that the trial court erred in confirming the award. The case must be remanded for further proceedings, not to vacate, but to correct the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The construction contract contained provisions requiring arbitration of \u201c[a] 11 claims, disputes and other matters in question arising out of, or relating to this Contract or the breach thereof,\u201d except for certain specified exclusions. Both the plaintiff and the defendant submitted to the arbitration board detailed lists of claims and counterclaims pertaining to the performance of the work. On December 15, 1980, the arbitrators awarded the plaintiff $164,004.01 for its claims and awarded the defendant $107,628.66 for its counterclaims, resulting in a net award to the plaintiff of $56,375.35. Attached to the award was a \u201cmemorandum of opinion\u201d setting forth, by reference to each paragraph or sub-paragraph of the lists of claims and counterclaims, the amount allowed for each item submitted. Totals of these amounts are given, but the total for the items submitted by the plaintiff was $20,922.22, plus interest of $10,250, rather than $164,004.01 as stated in the award. This discrepancy is explained in the portion of the memorandum headed \u201ccomputations,\u201d where it appears that $132,831.79 due the plaintiff upon a requisition was added to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>$20,922.22 allowed for its contract claims and the $10,250 for interest, to make the total $164,004.01.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In the complaint the plaintiff alleged that the requisition referred to in the memorandum' gave credits to the defendant for certain items allowed to the defendant upon its counterclaims, thus duplicating the amounts credited for such items. The trial court refused to decide this contention and excluded the requisition from evidence, concluding that it would have to hear all of the evidence presented to the arbitrators and retry the case in order to determine whether there was any such duplication.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The plaintiff maintains that in determining the amount owed to it under the requisition, an issue which was not included in the submission, the arbitrators \u201cexceeded their powers\u201d as provided in General Statutes \u00a7 52-418<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>should accordingly be vacated. The defendant does not maintain that this issue was within the submission, but contends that in reviewing an arbitration award a court ought not to look beyond the award itself to the accompanying memorandum of the arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">\u201cIt is true that the award rather than the finding and conclusions of fact controls and, ordinarily, the memorandum of an arbitrator is irrelevant.\u201d <em>International Union </em>v. <em>Fafnir Bearing Co., </em>151 Conn. 650, 654, 201 A.2d 656 (1964). The memorandum, however, may be examined in determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his authority by making an award beyond the scope of the submission. <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Education Assn., </em>173 Conn. 287, 292, 377 A.2d 323 (1977). It is clear from our examination of the memorandum that the award of $164,004,01 on the claims of the plaintiff included $132,831.79 due upon a requisition concerning which no issue had been submitted to the arbitration panel. The statement of the plaintiff\u2019s claims was in the form of a list of specific items and included no reference to the requisition or to the balance due on the contract. The counterclaims of the defendant were stated similarly. It cannot be questioned that the award exceeded the scope of the submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-419<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that the court may modify or correct an award \u201cif the arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>trators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them unless it is a matter not affecting the merits of the decision upon the matters submitted . . . .\u201d \u201cThe use of the word \u2018unless\u2019 in this portion of the statute is confusing, but obviously the intendment of the enactment is that the court may strike out such portion of an award as is not responsive to the submission if, by so doing, the merits of the portion of the award which is within the submission are not affected.\u201d <em>Local 63, Textile Workers Union </em>v. <em>Cheney Bros., </em>141 Conn. 606, 614, 109 A.2d 240 (1954), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 959, 75 S. Ct. 449, 99 L. Ed. 748 (1955). This appeal presents a situation where the decision of the arbitrators on the claims and counterclaims submitted is independent of the amount included in the award for the balance due on the requisition, an issue not submitted. The elimination of that portion of the award does not affect the amounts awarded for either the plaintiff\u2019s claims or the defendant\u2019s counterclaims, but leaves the parties precisely where they would have been if the amount due on the requisition had not been included in the award. This correction may be made by subtracting from the award of $164,004.01 made for the claims of the plaintiff the amount of $132,831.79 included for the requisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The second ground for attacking the award, the failure of the arbitrators to decide some issues which were submitted, is based upon the following notation made in the memorandum concerning some of the claims in the plaintiff\u2019s list: \u201cNot in dispute, owner agrees to pay.\u201d No allowance was included in the award for any items so designated. The trial court concluded that this notation indicated that the particular claim had been withdrawn from arbitration. We do not believe the language used is capable of such a construction. The fact that the defendant had agreed to pay the particular claim does not mean that the plaintiff had withdrawn it and was content to rely upon a promise of payment rather than an award which could be converted into a judgment. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the plaintiff ever withdrew the items from arbitration nor does the defendant contend that such claims were actually withdrawn. The arbitrators used the designation \u201cwithdrawn\u201d with respect to some of the counterclaims of the defendant, a circumstance indicating something else was intended by the phrase in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">It appears that the total amount of the items marked as undisputed and to be paid by the owner is $3804.92, as the parties have agreed. General Statutes \u00a7 52-419 authorizes modification or correction \u201cif the award is imperfect in matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy\u201d and also \u201c[i]f there has been an evident material miscalculation of figures . . . .\u201d We construe these provisions to permit correction of the award by adding the sum of $3804.92, the agreed total of the undisputed but unpaid items, which the arbitrators neglected to include in the amount allowed for the plaintiff\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>The addition of $3804.92 for those items and the subtraction of $132,831.79 included by the arbitrators erroneously for the requisition results in a revision of the total amount awarded for the plaintiff\u2019s claims from $164,004.01 to $34,977.14. The amount awarded for the defendant\u2019s counterclaims, which is unchallenged, remains $107,628.66. The revisions result in a corrected net award of $72,651.52 to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">There is error, the judgment confirming the award is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\"> \u201cCOMPUTATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">$132,831.79 due Claimant per Req. #20</p>\n<p id=\"A3k6\">20,922.22 awarded Claimaut</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">10,250.00 interest awarded Claimant 3/10/78 - 12/20/80</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">$164,004.01 due Claimant</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">107,628.66 awarded Respondent</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">$ 56,375.35 due Claimant from Respondent\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-13\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 52-418. vacating award.
