Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"As7g\">The plaintiff in this case, Lundy Electronics and Systems, Inc. (Lundy), is a foreign corporation. At the time that this action was instituted, it was also the owner of certain personal property<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which was placed in the Hartford National Bank in the city of Hartford. This property was exempt from local personal property taxes pursuant to General Statutes \u25a0\u00a7 12-121a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 9, 1975, the tax assessor for the city of Hartford advised Lundy by letter that a penalty assessment was being levied against it for failing to file a listing of exempt personal property as required by General Statutes ^ 12-121b. Subsequent to this letter, on January 24, 1975, Lundy did file the proper forms. The tax assessor, however, refused to cancel the penalty and so notified Lundy on February 11,1975. Lundy appealed this decision on the penalty to the state tax commissioner (tax commissioner), which appeal was denied. Thereafter, Lundy appealed to the Superior Court. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>November 18, 1980, the court, <em>Corrigan, J., </em>rendered a decision sustaining Lundy\u2019s appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Lundy claims that General Statutes \u00a7 12-121b<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires the assessors in each municipality to provide property owners with effective notice of the information that they are required to file prior to assessing any penalties. Failure to provide adequate notice in sueh circumstances would, according to Lundy, violate the constitutional principles of due process and equal protection. Furthermore, it claims that the tax assessor for the city of Hart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>ford failed to comply with the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 12-43. That statute, entitled \u201cProperty of nonresidents,\u201d provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a] 11 owners of real estate, or of tangible personal property located in any town more than seven months during the year, who are nonresidents of such town, shall file lists of such real estate and personal property with the assessors of the town in which the same is located under the same provisions as apply to residents, and such personal property shall not be liable to taxation in any other town in this state. The list of each nonresident taxpayer shall contain his post-office and street address. <em>The assessors shall mail to each nonresident, </em>or to his attorney or agent having custody of his taxable property, at least fifteen days before the expiration of the time for filing lists, blank <em>forms for filing lists </em>of such property.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although not cited in Lundy\u2019s brief, General Statutes \u00a7 12-121b also has a provision requiring lists to be \u201con a form approved by the state tax commissioner and furnished by said assessors.\u201d By admission, the local tax assessor provided no list to Lundy within the time provided. This failure, according to Lundy, \u201cis a fatal defect as to the attempt of the municipality to impose a penalty assessment.\u201d Therefore, it submits that the Superior Court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The tax commissioner has raised three claims. First, he asserts that he had no jurisdiction to review Lundy\u2019s claim regarding the propriety of the penalty pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-12M. That statute provides as follows: \u201cIf, in the process of verification-for purposes of assessment under section 12-121c, the local assessor finds an owner\u2019s report to be unacceptable for any reason, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>he shall notify said owner, in writing, within sixty days following the assessment date, including in such notification, details as to why said report is not acceptable. The taxpayer may request a hearing before such assessor not later than thirty days following the receipt of such notice, and said taxpayer shall have the right to appeal to the state tax commissioner for a hearing not later than six months following the assessment date. The decision of said commissioner based on such hearing shall be binding, subject to the right of said taxpayer to appeal to the court of common pleas within sixty days of receipt of notice of said decision.\u201d In regard to the merits of Lundy\u2019s claim, the tax commissioner contends that Lundy had sufficient notice to satisfy constitutional standards citing, inter alia, <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Short, </em>454 U.S. 516, 102 S. Ct. 781, 70 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1982). The tax commissioner also claims that the local assessor was relieved of the burden of providing the necessary filing forms because Lundy had not previously submitted its name and address to the assessor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">We agree with the tax commissioner\u2019s claim that he was without jurisdiction under the statute to grant the relief sought by Lundy and, therefore, we hold that the Superior Court erred in not dismissing Lundy\u2019s appeal. Because of this holding, we do not reach the merits of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The tax commissioner \u201c \u2018must act strictly within [his] statutory authority, within constitutional limitations, and in a lawful manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fusco-Amatruda Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>168 Conn. 597, 604, 362 A.2d 847 (1975), quoting <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>144 Conn. 516, 523, 134 A.2d 351 (1957); see also <em>Page </em>v. <em>Welfare Commissioner, </em>170 Conn. 258, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>262, 365 A.2d 1118 (1976); <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>160 Conn. 226, 230, 278 A.2d 771 (1971); cf. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>162 Conn. 89, 93-94, 291 A.2d 721 (1971). In like manner, \u201c <em>\u2018 </em>[n] o administrative or regulatory body can modify, abridge or otherwise change the statutory provisions under which it acquires authority unless the statute specifically grants it that power.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fusco-Amatruda Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>supra, quoting <em>State ex rel. Huntington </em>v. <em>McNulty, </em>151 Conn. 447, 449, 199 A.2d 5 (1964); see also <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, and cases cited therein. In the present case, the tax commissioner\u2019s grant of authority is to be found in General Statutes \u00a7 12-12M as set out above. Our task is to determine whether, pursuant to that grant of authority, the tax commissioner is authorized to review the levying of a penalty assessment on a taxpayer who is late in filing the forms required by General Statutes \u00a7 12-121b. \u201cAs is true in every case involving the construction of a statute, our starting point must be the language employed by the legislature.\u201d <em>Verdon </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>187 Conn. 363, 366, 446 A.2d 3 (1982). General Statutes \u00a7 12-121d does not explicitly delineate the scope of any hearing before the commissioner. Rather, it merely states the \u201ctaxpayer may request a hearing before such assessor . . . and said taxpayer shall have the right to appeal to the state tax commissioner for a hearing.\u201d We must therefore look to the statute as a whole in order to determine the tax commissioner\u2019s statutory grant of authority. <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>188 Conn. 213, 222, 448 A.2d 1344 (1982); see also <em>Connecticut Theater Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>179 Conn. 672, 676-77, 427 A.2d 863 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>(1980); <em>LaProvidenza </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>178 Conn. 23, 29, 420 A.2d 905 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">General Statutes \u00a7 12-121d provides, in part, that \u201c[i]f, in the process of verification for purposes of assessment under \u00a7 12-121c, the local assessor finds an owner\u2019s report to be unacceptable for any reason, he shall notify said owner ... as to why said report is not acceptable.\u201d Lundy fixes upon the words \u201cunacceptable for any reason\u201d as providing the assessor with the authority to consider claims based upon the lack of statutory notice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The problem with this position is that it would require us to interpret these words in isolation from the rest of the statute. We have noted that words which are seemingly clear and unambiguous may be modified by the context in which they are found. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, </em>175 Conn. 49, 57, 392 A.2d 491 (1978); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>King, </em>169 Conn. 140, 144, 363 A.2d 68 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In the present case, a local assessor\u2019s authority to consider a problem raised by a taxpayer is limited by General Statutes \u00a7 12-121d to those claims that arise \u201cin the process of verification for purposes of assessment under [General Statutes] section 12-121c.\u201d The legislative history of the statute provides no assistance in determining the parameters of what is included in the \u201cprocess of verification.\u201d We must interpret these terms, therefore, according to their \u201ccommonly approved usage.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-la; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, </em>supra. The word \u201cverification\u201d has been defined as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>\u201cthe authentication of truth or accuracy by such means as facts, statements, citations, measurements, or attendant circumstances.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. The assessment procedure under General Statutes \u00a7 12'-121e requires an assessor to \u201csubmit to the state tax commissioner ... a list of the owners, together with an itemized statement of each such owner\u2019s acquisitions of personal property, showing the fair market value thereof.\u201d The verification process, therefore, requires an assessor to \u201cauthenticate\u201d the list of owners, the extent of their property holdings, and the value of those holdings. It follows from this that under \u00a7 12-121d, a report can be \u201cunacceptable for any reason\u201d only if arising from <em>these categories. </em>Therefore, we cannot accept Lundy\u2019s claimed interpretation of the words \u201cunacceptable for any reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">In so concluding, we note that the date on which forms are provided to a taxpayer, or the date on which the taxpayer files those forms is outside of the verification process. To hold otherwise would render insignificant that section of the statute providing, \u201c[i]f, in the process of verification for purposes of assessment under section 12-121c.\u201d It is well recognized that \u201c \u2018a statute should be construed so that no word, phrase or clause will be rendered meaningless.\u2019\u201d <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>supra, 221, quoting <em>C. White &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rocky Hill, </em>181 Conn. 114, 122, 434 A.2d 949 (1980) (Citations omitted); see <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, </em>supra, 58, and cases cited therein. Rather, \u201c \u2018there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>176 Conn. 17, 20, 404 A.2d 873 (1978), quoting <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, </em>supra. See also <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Connecticut </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number><em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>175 Conn. 349, 356, 402 A.2d 332 (1978); <em>State ex rel. Kennedy </em>v. <em>Frauwirth, </em>167 Conn. 165, 168, 355 A.2d 39 (1974). If we were to adhere to the position set out by Lundy, the statute could have simply read, \u201c[i]f the assessor finds an owner\u2019s report to be unacceptable for any reason,\u201d with no reference at all to the legislative language that \u201cunacceptable for any reason\u201d is expressly ref errant to \u201c[i]f, in the process of verification for purposes of assessment under section 12-121c.\u201d In construing a statute, \u201c \u2018the question before a court ... is not what the legislature actually intended but what intention it expressed by the words that it used.\u2019 \u201d <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>supra, 220, quoting <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 6, 434 A.2d 293 (1980); see also <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>162 Conn. 89, 98, 291 A.2d 721 (1971). \u201cIf\u201d means \u201cin the event that, in case.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. Thus, the phrase \u201cunacceptable for any reason\u201d clearly refers to the \u201cverification\u201d referred to in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The tax commissioner had the authority under \u00a7 12-121d to review only the local assessor\u2019s decision finding \u201can owner\u2019s report . . . unacceptable\u201d where such a report is \u201cin the process of verification for the purposes of assessment under section 12-121c.\u201d It follows that if the assessor did not have authority to review a claim within this limitation, then the commissioner had no authority to review it. In other words, the tax commissioner\u2019s authority under \u00a7 12-12M extends only to reviewing an assessor\u2019s action in finding an owner\u2019s report \u201cunacceptable for any reason\u201d arising explicitly \u201cin the process of verification . . . under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>12~121c.\u201d We, therefore, cannot accept the position advocated by Lnndy and we hold that the tax commissioner did not have authority to review Lundy\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It follows from this holding that the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction to hear and determine this action. See <em>Groton </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>169 Conn. 89, 101, 362 A.2d 1359 (1975); <em>Crouchley </em>v. <em>Pambianchi, </em>149 Conn. 512, 515, 182 A.2d 11 (1962). The trial court, therefore, should have dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In this opinion Speziale, C. J., Peters and Parskey, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-7\"> The property consisted of certain computers with an assessed value of $237,500.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b703-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-121a through 12-121d have since been repealed by Public Acts 1975, No. 75-213, \u00a7 50, effective May 12, 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b704-5\"> General Statutes $ 12-121b, entitled \u201cSubmission of lists of property not subject to assessment,\u201d provides: \u201cThe assessors in each municipality shall on or before the fifteenth day before the 1974 assessment date of sueh municipality, and annually thereafter, post on the sign posts therein, or publish in a newspaper published in such municipality or, if no newspaper is published therein, then in any newspaper published in the state and having a general circulation in sueh municipality, a notice requiring all persons therein who would have been liable to pay taxes on personal property acquired by them after the 1973 assessment date of sueh municipality except for the provisions of section 12-121a, to bring in written or printed lists of sueh property, belonging to them on the first assessment date following such notice, on or before the first day of the month following said assessment date. Such list shall be dated and signed under penalty of false statement and shall be on a form approved by the state tax commissioner and furnished by said assessors. Each sueh list shall include, with respect to each item of such property, the nature, cost, acquisition date and fair market value, determined by application of the rate of depreeiation allowed by said assessors under the method and schedule of depreciation applicable with respect to such property or similar property in the 1972 assessment year in the tax jurisdiction in which sueh property is located. After 1974, each such list shall also include, with appropriate designation, in addition to all new acquisitions, those items of such property no longer owned by the person submitting such list but which appeared on sueh person\u2019s list in the previous year. Any person who fails to file sueh list as herein provided shall be subject to a penalty assessment equal to the amount derived by multiplying the fair market value of the property required to be listed, as determined by the assessors, by the tax rate of such municipality for the year next preceeding.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b708-6\"> It argues that the appeal provisions of the statute are \u201csufficiently broad to enable the state tax commissioner to decide any [appeal by the taxpayer] under the statute, including a claim of lack of statutory notice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\"> Because of the limited issues raised by this appeal, we need not discuss alternative avenues of relief which may have been available to Lundy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b711-6\">Shea, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AI6\">(dissenting and concurring). I disagree with the remand for dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. I would find error in the judgment sustaining the appeal and direct a dismissal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">My disagreement is with the interpretation given to G-eneral Statutes \u00a7 12-12'ld as precluding an appeal where a penalty has been assessed under Greneral Statutes \u00a7 12-121b for failure of the owner to file a list of personal property within the time limit established by that statute. Although \u00a7 12-121d refers to \u201cin the process of verification for purposes of assessment under section 12-121e\u201d as the occasion for finding an owner\u2019s report to be \u201cunacceptable,\u201d it is inconsistent with the broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>language, \u201cunacceptable for any reason,\u201d to exclude a failure to file on time from the scope of the appeal provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">In any event, a failure to file any return at all as well as an omission of certain property from a list which has been filed, either of which events would subject the owner to a penalty assessment under \u00a7 12-121b, would qualify under the \u201cverification\u201d limitation of the grounds for unaeceptability which this opinion imposes. The \u201cprocess of verification\u201d under \u00a7 12-121c, which is referred to in \u00a7 12-121d, is the duty of checking the accuracy of the list to be submitted to the tax commissioner of the owners, their personal property and the values thereof, \u201cwhich would have been submitted to the local assessor for property tax purposes except for the application of section 12-121a.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to prepare such a list the assessors would have to verify (1) whether the owners who had submitted lists required under \u00a7 12-121b had included all taxable personal property and supplied the information required by the statute and (2) whether some owners who were obliged to file lists had failed to do so. Apparently it was \u201cin the process of\u201d this second kind of verification that the Hartford assessor discovered the presence of the two business machines owned by the plaintiff and situated at the Hartford National Bank. The consequences of that discovery, of course, resulted in the penalty tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>I see no distinction between the first type of verification (i.e., checking the lists which have been filed) and the second type (i.e., checking to see whether a list has been filed for certain items of taxable property) so far as the availability of an appeal under \u00a7 12-12'ld is concerned. Nothing in the language of the statutes justifies such a distinction and it is difficult to see why the legislature would have intended to allow an appeal in the first situation and not in the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">On the merits, I would reject the position of the trial court that the failure of the assessor to mail out the forms as provided in General Statutes \u00a7 12-43 excuses the failure of the taxpayer to file the required list by the November 1 deadline. The argument of the plaintiff that unless the assessors first sent the forms it would not have notice of the filing requirement established by \u00a7 12-43 disregards the familiar principle that every person, even a nonresident, is presumed to know the law. The plaintiff knew that its property was situated in Hartford and it was bound to observe all requirements of law which pertained thereto whether or not it had actual knowledge of them.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-5\"> The majority opinion appears to recognize this proposition: \u201cThe verification process, therefore, requires an assessor to \u2018authenticate\u2019 the list of owners, the extent of their property holdings, and the value of those holdings.\u201d To say, however, as the opinion does, that \u201cthe date that the taxpayer files those forms is outside the verification process\u201d overlooks the fact that the penalty imposed under \u00a7 12-121b results from the failure of the owner to file his property list by the date specified, a situation which the \u201cverification process\u201d was designed to discover.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
