On May 31, 1980, the then existing col-lectivebargaining agreement between the plaintiff, Accurate Forging Corporation (Accurate Forging), and the defendant, UAW Local 1017 (Loeal), expired. A strike was called and picketing began on June 1,1980. The picketing continued until June 12, 1980. On that date at about 7:45 a.m., a truck arrived to pick up a piece of machinery which the plaintiff wanted repaired. At that time there were some twelve picketing employees at the gate the truck was to enter; there were three chains and padlocks on that gate which had not been placed there by the plaintiff\u2019s employees. By the time the plaintiff\u2019s employees had sawed off the padlocks, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>a fourth padlock was placed on by one of the pickets. More employees gathered; there was shouting and abusive language which was directed to the two company men inside the gate. Rocks were thrown in from the outside. The driveway outside the gate was blocked with union employees\u2019 vehicles; pickets pushed the gate closed, putting new chains on it. They also dragged up a large pole \u201csimilar to a telephone pole\u201d and laid it across the outside of the gate. As the picketers became more hostile, the police were called in to control the situation. The police captain in charge, who responded with police assistance, concluded that he could open the gate with a force of some thirty to forty men in full riot gear, \u201cbut people would definitely be hurt and the gate could not be opened without violence.\u201d If the number of pickets increased, he would need more men. As a result of this altercation, the truck was prevented from picking up the piece of machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">On June 17, 1980, Accurate Forging filed a complaint in which it sought a temporary injunction, a permanent injunction, monetary damages and any other \u201cjust and proper\u201d relief against the Local, certain named individuals,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the International Union of United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (International). After hearings on the matter, the trial court, <em>N. O\u2019Neill, J., </em>granted a temporary injunction against the Local and all the named individuals. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to grant an injunction against the International. The plaintiff has not appealed this ruling. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>On August 6, 1980, the defendants appealed the order granting the temporary injunction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 28, 1980, the union membership ratified a new agreement that ran from June 1,1980, through May 31, 1982. At that time all picketing ceased, and there has been no picketing since that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The Local has raised a number of issues in its brief challenging the trial court\u2019s order. Guided, however, by our recent decision in <em>Waterbury Hospital </em>v. <em>Connecticut Health Care Associates, </em>186 Conn. 247, 440 A.2d 310 (1982), we find the issues raised by this appeal to be moot. Therefore, we need not address the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">In <em>Waterbury Hospital, </em>we concluded that the fact that the underlying strike had been settled precluded us from ordering any practical relief to either party. \u201c \u2018 \u201cIt is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 249, quoting <em>Connecticut Employees Union \u201cIndependent,\u201d Inc. </em>v. <em>CSEA, </em>183 Conn. 235, 246, 439 A.2d 321 (1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Exactly the same situation exists in the present case. The temporary injunction restrained the defendant Local and the individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>defendants from engaging in any picketing or other acts which would interfere with ingress and egress from the plant, and restrained them from committing or attempting to commit acts of violence against the plant or persons doing business with Accurate Forging. Since the strike was settled, however, the union membership has voluntarily restrained from engaging in any picketing. Under these circumstances, there is no practical relief that could emanate from this court that would benefit the Local.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">In oral argument before this court, counsel for the Local contended that this case fell within the parameters of the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d doctrine. This argument, however, was specifically rejected in <em>Waterbury Hospital </em>v. <em>Connecticut Health Care Associates, </em>supra, 253-54, and the defendants have provided this court with no basis for reconsidering that position in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Finally, the defendants allege that Accurate Forging has posted a bond \u201cto indemnify the union should [Accurate Forging] fail to \u2018prosecute the action to effect.\u2019 \u201d They claim that their potential rights upon the bond are a sufficient interest in the outcome of the appeal for this court to take jurisdiction. Regardless of the merits of this claim,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>nowhere in the record is there any indication that a bond was ordered, that it was posted or what its purpose was. \u201cThis court cannot resort to matters extraneous to the formal record, to facts which have not been found and which are not admitted in the pleadings, or to documents or exhibits which are not part of the record. See <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>164 Conn. 387, 389, 321 A.2d 443 [1973]; <em>American Can Co. </em>v. <em>Orange Pulp Co., </em>149 Conn. 417, 418, 180 A.2d 628 [1962].\u201d <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>173 Conn. 462, 465, 378 A.2d 547 (1977). Furthermore, \u201c[i]t is the appellant\u2019s obligation to provide this court with an adequate appellate record. Practice Book \u00a7 3082.\u201d <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>186 Conn. 387, 388 n.1, 441 A.2d 629 (1982). Therefore, we do not consider this aspect of the defendants\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Accordingly, the appeal is moot and is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-5\"> Accurate Forging claimed that the six named individuals were \u201cagents, representatives, officers and/or members of said International Union and Local Union.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b38-6\"> General Statutes <em>\u00a7 </em>31-118 specifically permits an appeal from the issuance of a temporary injunction in a case involving a labor dispute. <em>Connecticut Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>International Ladies Garment Workers Union, </em>177 Conn. 17, 19 n.3, 411 A.2d 1 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\"> The fact that the temporary injunction is technically still in effect also is of no significance. In <em>Waterbury Hospital </em>v. <em>Connecticut Health Care Associates, </em>186 Conn. 247, 440 A.2d 310 (1982), we stated that \u201c[t]he permanent injunction appealed from existed only for as long as the conditions which produced the injunction existed.\u201d Id., 250. This principle is equally applicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b39-6\"> In oral argument the plaintiff's counsel stated that the injunction issued in this case had no chance to take effect because the parties settled on their new collective bargaining contract without being aware that the injunction involved in this appeal had been issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\"> It should be noted that the defendants eite as authority for their claim the cases of <em>Liner </em>v. <em>Jafco, Inc., </em>375 U.S. 301, 84 S. Ct. 391, 11 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1964), and <em>Rochester Telephone Corporation </em>v. <em>Communications Workers of America, </em>456 F.2d 1057 (2d Cir. 1972). A recent United States Supreme Court decision, however, undermines the applicability of the <em>Liner </em>case to the present action. In <em>University of Texas </em>v. <em>Camenisch, </em>451 U.S. 390, 396, 101 S. Ct. 1830, 68 L. Ed. 2d 175 (1981), the court held that \u201cwhere a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>district court has granted a preliminary injunction, the parties generally will have had the benefit neither of a full opportunity to present their eases nor of a final judicial decision based on the actual merits of the controversy. Thus when the injunetive aspects of a case become moot on appeal of a preliminary injunction, any issue preserved by an injunction bond can generally not be resolved on appeal, but must be resolved in a trial on the merits. Where, by contrast, a federal district court has granted a permanent injunction, the parties will already have had their trial on the merits, and, even if the ease would otherwise be moot, a determination can be had on appeal of the correctness of the trial court\u2019s decision on the merits, since the case has been saved from mootness by injunction bond.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
