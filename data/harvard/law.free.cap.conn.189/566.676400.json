A hearing was held and her application for immediate release was denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff has appealed claiming that the court erred in deciding that the plaintiff\u2019s confinement at Norwich Hospital is not illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In the trial court the plaintiff filed a writ of habeas corpus in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 17-201,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claiming that she is being imprisoned illegally. No factual basis supporting it was alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>nor was any argument offered at the hearing to substantiate it. A motion to quash may be used to attack a writ of habeas corpus for defects appearing on the face of the writ. <em>Fasulo </em>v. <em>Arafeh, </em>173 Conn. 473, 490, 378 A.2d 553 (1977) <em>(Loiselle, J., </em>dissenting); <em>Paluga </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em>29 Conn. Sup. 434, 435, 290 A.2d 358 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In a writ of habeas corpus alleging illegal confinement the application must set forth specific grounds for the issuance of the writ including the basis for the claim of illegal confinement. <em>Timms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>188 Conn. 27, 30, 448 A.2d 202 (1982); <em>Fasulo </em>v. <em>Arafeh, </em>supra, 490; <em>Mayock </em>v. <em>Superintendent, </em>154 Conn. 704, 705, 224 A.2d 544 (1966). This the plaintiff failed to do. The court properly granted the motion to quash and denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\"> The defendant was confined under an order by the court, <em>Allen,, J., </em>on October 23, 1981. On March 8, 1982, three days before the hearing on the petition of habeas corpus, a decision was issued in Superior Court, G.A. 13 as a result of a timely review of the status of the plaintiff in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 54-56d. The court found that the plaintiff currently was incompetent to stand trial for criminal charges pending against her but that she would probably become competent within the foreseeable future. The plaintiff was returned to the Norwich Hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\"> At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s presentation at the habeas hearing, the defendants made an oral motion to quash, the application for failure to prove illegal confinement. The court subsequently granted this motion. The judgment file, however, does not indicate that the writ was quashed but rather states that \u201cthe writ of habeas corpus is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Practice Book \u00a7 532 authorizes the filing of a motion to quash before a return is filed to test the sufficiency of the petition on which the writ was granted and the propriety of the issuance of the writ. This procedure was not followed in the present case. The plaintiff, however, had the opportunity to present her ease to the trial court. There were no facts presented at the hearing which would alter our disposition of the case. While wo do not condone this defect in procedure, we conclude that to remand the case would serve no purpose since our ultimate decision would remain the same. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>135 Conn. 262, 266, 63 A.2d 589 (1948), aff\u2019d, 337 U.S. 901, 69 S.
