Both the decedent and the defendant were employed by the same construction company. In a special defense the defendant pleaded the applicability of General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which generally bars suits against fellow employees where workers\u2019 compensation is available to the injured employee. In her reply the plaintiff admitted that the accident was covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and that the defendant was a co-employee of the decedent. She claimed that her action could be maintained, nevertheless, under the exception in \u00a7 31-293a which permits a suit against a fellow employee \u201cfor negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle as defined in section 14-1.\u201d The trial court, in denying the motion of the defendant to set aside the verdict, held that the plaintiff\u2019s suit fell within this exception. This determination is the subject of the present appeal, in which the sole issue raised by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>defendant is whether at the time of the accident he was operating a motor vehicle as contemplated by \u00a7 31-293a. We conclude that he was not so engaged and find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The facts relevant to the question before us are not disputed. On December 18, 1975, the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, Jose Dias, and the defendant, Joseph Adams, were employed by D. German Construction Company, Inc., and were installing sewer pipes on Wigwam Lane, a public highway in Stratford. Adams was operating an Ackerman backhoe while Dias was in a trench wrapping a chain around the bars of a steel box which the backhoe was to remove from the trench. Suddenly the shovel on the backhoe, to which one end of the chain was attached, dropped and struck Dias, who was severely injured and died as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The backhoe was a self-propelled machine which used a diesel engine as its energy source both for locomotion and for movement of the boom to which the shovel or \u201cbucket\u201d was attached. It moved, not on rubber-tired wheels, but on two continuous metal treaded belts. The controls were situated in the cab of the backhoe, and the same levers which controlled its locomotion could also be used to operate the shovel once the operator manipulated a certain valve to transfer the power of the engine from the treads to the boom. The shovel could not be operated while the backhoe was in motion. At the time of the accident the operator had moved the valve into the proper position for operation of the shovel.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The defendant relies upon two grounds for support of his claim that the exception \u201cfor negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle\u201d is inapplicable: (1) that the backhoe was not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>delineated in General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (26),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to which \u00a7 31-293a refers for definition of that term; and (2) that he was not engaged in operating the backhoe as a motor vehicle when the accident occurred. As we agree with the second contention, we shall not discuss the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In <em>Davey </em>v. <em>Pepperidge Farms, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 469, 429 A.2d 943 (1980), the situation was quite similar to the present case. There the plaintiff was injured when a hydraulic hoist attached to a flatbed truck was unloading some concrete blocks. The plaintiff had driven the truck to the delivery site and had operated the hoist, which used the truck engine as its power source, until it became stuck in an upright position. The movement of the hoist was controlled either by switches from the truck bed or by hand held switches attached to a twenty-foot cable. After the plaintiff had telephoned his employer, the defendant, a fellow employee, who was a mechanic, came to the scene. The defendant decided that the truck and hoist should be returned to the employer\u2019s plant for repairs. He instructed the plaintiff, who was standing beside the truck holding the hand control device, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>to move the hoist. The plaintiff pressed a switch which caused the hoist to move and strike some high voltage wires. The accident resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">We held in <em>Davey </em>that the hoist attached to the truck and being controlled at the time of the accident by remote controls on the ground was not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as defined by General Statutes \u00a714-1 (26). Id., 472-73. We also indicated, moreover, \u201cthat operation as it refers to a motor vehicle relates to the driving or movement of the vehicle itself or a circumstance resulting from the movement of the vehicle.\u201d Id., 472 n.1; see General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (32); <em>State </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>125 Conn. 399, 404, 6 A.2d 359 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">In the ease before us it is clear that, when the mishap took place, the defendant was doing nothing related to driving or moving the vehicle itself, which had been immobilized by switching the power from the treads to the boom. He was engaged only in operating the shovel. His negligence, which the jury found to have caused the accident, did not occur, therefore, in the operation of a motor vehicle, as \u00a7 31-293a requires for the exception allowing such a suit against a fellow employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The plaintiff relies upon differences between the backhoe and the vehicle described in <em>Davey </em>to escape the effect of that precedent, particularly the fact that the controls which operated the shovel on the backhoe were an integral part of it, unlike those for the hoist in <em>Davey </em>which were not situated in the cab of the truck. We did say in <em>Davey </em>that \u201c[t]here is nothing to suggest that the use of any mechanical or electrical device not an integral part of the motor vehicle being driven can be considered operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d Id., 472 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>n.l. It does not follow, however, that the nse of controls which have a dual purpose constitutes operation of a motor vehicle at a time when those controls cannot function to propel the backhoe, but are being used for a different purpose. The differences between the backhoe and the truck hoist in <em>Davey </em>may be significant in respect to whether the statutory definition of a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d has been met, a question we leave unresolved. It is plain, nevertheless, that at the time of the accident each of these machines was performing a function unrelated to movement of the vehicle itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Although the legislative history of \u00a7 31-293a is not especially revealing, there is some evidence that the intention was to distinguish \u201csimple negligence on the job\u201d from negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Unlike the special hazards of the work place, the risk of a motor vehicle accident is a common danger to which the general public is exposed. Particular occupations may subject some employees to a greater degree of exposure to that risk. The nature of the risk remains unchanged, however, and in many employments it is no greater than for the general public. The legislature has chosen, therefore, not to extend the immunity given to fellow employees by \u00a7 31-293a to accidents having a less distinct relationship to the hazards of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>employment. At the same time it has accorded the injured employee, in addition to workers\u2019 compensation, the same remedy he would have against a member of the general public who caused a motor vehicle accident. Our decision to construe the term \u201coperation of a motor vehicle\u201d in \u00a7 31-293a as not including activities unrelated to movement of the vehicle comports with this policy of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">There is error, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded with direction to render a judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 31-293a. no eight against fellow employee; exception.

E. Proc., Pt. 9, 1967 Sess., pp. 3833, 4035, remarks of Eepresentative Paul Pawlak: \u201cSection 5. This section stops third party suits against fellow employees since such employee usually is unable to meet any judgment involving serious injuries. However, the section specifically permits suits against fellow employees where the injury or death was the result of wilful or malicious wrong by such fellow employee or involves the operation of a motor vehicle. We are here trying to make sure that a fellow employee cannot ordinarily be sued for simple negligence on the job, but we do not believe that he should be protected against wilful or malicious wrong, nor do we believe he should bo protected if the employee is injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
