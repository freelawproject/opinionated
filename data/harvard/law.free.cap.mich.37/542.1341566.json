At the same time the answer shows and the demurrer admits that the society has no property; that relator had acted in hostility to the interests of the society and had given grounds for regular removal and that his restoration would destroy the society. Moreover, enough is admitted to show that if restored he might be at once immediately put out.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Under these circumstances the discretion vested in the court will be but exercised by refusing to grant a peremptory mandamus. <em>State v.
