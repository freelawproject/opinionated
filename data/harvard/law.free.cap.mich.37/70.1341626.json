Kellogg &amp; Baker, creditors of his, a chattel mortgage on his stock in trade and on goods that should be afterwards acquired in keeping it up; that a part of the goods had been afterwards bought from the plaintiffs; that plaintiffs had actual knowledge of this mortgage as early as April 24, 1876; and that the mortgagees seized the goods and removed them from the 'depot where the plaintiffs had left them for transportation by the defendants. The court also found as a conclusion of law that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the goods at the time they were seized, since they had notice of the mortgage; that the mortgage gave the mortgagees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the power to seize the goods whenever the mortgagor should attempt to sell them otherwise than in the course of trade; that the mortgagees had a subsisting equity in the goods as against Benedict to seize them in payment of their debt ; and that the plaintiffs took subject to this equity. Judgment was entered for the defendant, and plaintiffs brought error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-4\"><em>Cowles &amp; Cahill </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad9\">A chattel mortgage cannot include property not in being, or not owned by the mortgagor at the time of executing the mortgage. 1 Pars.
