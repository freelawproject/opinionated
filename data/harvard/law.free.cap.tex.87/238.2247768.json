Rev. Stats., art 2899, subdiv. 2; Hendrick v. Walton, 69 Texas, 192; Ritz v. City of Austin, 1 Texas Civ. App., 455; Turner v. Eddy &amp; Cross, 83 Texas, 218.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b283-6\">GAIKES, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Agq\">The Court of Civil Appeals for the Fifth District certifies for our determination the following question: \u201cDoes article 2899, subdivision 2, of the Bevised Statutes of Texas, confer a right of action against a private corporation, other than a common carrier, for the death of any person caused by the wrongful act, negligence, unskillfulness, or default of such private corporation? In other words, does the word \u2018person,\u2019 as contained in said subdivision 2, include private corporations within its meaning?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The provision in question, with a part of its context, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\u201cArt. 2899. An action for the actual damages on account of injuries causing the death of any person may be brought in the following cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">\u201c1. * * * 2. When the death of any person is caused by the wrongful act, negligence, unskillfulness, or default of another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aok\">Since death can not be predicated of an artificial person, it is obvious that by the word \u201cperson,\u201d as expressly used in subdivision 2, is meant a natural person; and the contention on the part of those who hold the negative of the question would seem to be, that by the word \u201canother,\u201d as used in the same sentence, is meant another such person. The argument, in our opinion, is more plausible than sound. The sentence is rendered complete, with all its terms fully expressed, by the addition of the word \u201cperson\u201d only. If that was expressed which is left to be implied, subdivision 2 would read as follows: \u201cWhen the death of any person is caused by the wrongful act, negligence, unskill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>fulness, or default of another person.\u201d Because the word \u201cperson\u201d as first used is applicable to its context in a restricted sense only, it by no means follows that as subsequently used the Legislature did not intend it to have a more comprehensive meaning. It does not follow, that because you mean' a human being when you speak of the death of a person, you may not mean to include corporations when you speak of such death as having been caused by the act or omission of a person. In view <em>of </em>article 3140 of the Revised Statutes, this is especially true when applied to the statute in question. That article declares, in effect, among other things, that the word \u201cperson,\u201d wherever it appears in the Revised Statutes, shall be construed to include corporations, \u201cunless a different meaning is apparent from the context.\u201d The fortuitous circumstance, that the word as expressed in the provision in question applies only to natural persons, does not make it apparent to us that the Legislature intended that the same meaning should be given to it when impliedly repeated in a connection in which it is capable of a broader application, and thus to except it from the rule of construction so explicitly laid down. It is generally held in this State, as well as elsewhere, that the word \u201cperson\u201d in a statute includes a corporation. Fagan v. B. M. I. Co., 65 Texas, 324; Martin v. The State, 24 Texas, 68; Bartee v. Railway, 36 Texas, 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\">The statute of Rhode Island reads: \u201cIn all cases in which the death of any person ensues from an injury inflicted by the wrongful act <em>of </em>another,\u201d etc. In construing the law the Supreme Court of that state held, that corporations were liable under it in the same manner as natural persons. Chase v. Steamboat Co., 10 R. I., 79. The court in their opinion say: \u201cNeither does it appear that section 21 was intended to apply to injuries caused by natural persons only. The term \u2018 other person\u2019 includes corporations as well as individuals. The person liable to the action is not necessarily a natural person. * * * The injury may be inflicted by a corporation as well as by any other person; that is, the injury may ensue from the wrongful act of a corporation as well as from the wrongful act of an individual.\u201d The language so construed is substantially the same as that of our statute in the particular in question, but, unlike ours, it was not subject to a statutory rule of construction; and yet the court reach the result, that under the word \u201canother,\u201d meaning another person, a corporation is included. This case is directly in point upon the question certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The statute of California is similar to ours in the particular under consideration, and there seems to be no question in the courts of that State that corporations are liable. Munro v. Pacific, etc., Co., 84 Cal., 515. In Railroad v. Paulk, 24 Georgia, 336, in discussing the statute of Georgia, the Supreme Court of that State say: \u201cThe terms are, \u2018perpetrators of the injury,\u2019 and \u2018persons committing the act.\u2019 Row, the well settled rule of construction is, that corporations are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>embraced in the words of the statute under the designation of 'persons, \u2019 unless expressly excepted as excluded by necessary implication on the ground of the total inapplicability, as to the subject matter, to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that a private corporation is liable under the statute for injuries resulting in death from what may be deemed its own wrongful acts or omissions, as distinguished from the acts or omissions of its servants or agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The reasoning in the case of Ritz v. The City of Austin, 1 Texas Civil Appeals, 455, in which an application for a writ of error was refused by this court, is not in accordance with the view expressed in this opinion. That was a case of a municipal corporation, and is distinguishable from this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">In rejecting an application for a writ of error, we approve the result of the case as determined by the Court of Civil Appeals, but do not necessarily adopt the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Delivered June 25, 1894.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Motion for rehearing overruled October 8, 1894.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
