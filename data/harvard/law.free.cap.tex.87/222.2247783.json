The act of negligence was on the part of a section boss named Brooks, under whose immediate direction was the plaintiff at the time of the injury. The third complaint in the petition for writ of error, and which is referred to in the opinion, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\u201cThe Court of Civil Appeals also erred wherein it held that there was no error of which plaintiff in error could complain contained in that portion of the charge set out under the eleventh assignment of error, wherein the jury were instructed: \u2018If the said Brooks caused the plaintiff to get upon a handcar, and to take on said car a dangerous and extra hazardous position, and if the said Brooks had the management and control of said handcar, and if the said Brooks negligently caused the said handcar to be run at a high speed, and if while said handcar was so running the said Brooks negligently caused the said handcar to be suddenly stopped, and if thereby the plaintiff was thrown from and run over by the said handcar, and if the plaintiff was not himself guilty of contributory negligence, he would be entitled to recover of the defendant the damages, if any he sustained thereby; and if you so believe you will find for plaintiff the damages, if any, he so sustained therefrom, to be estimated by you from the evidence under subsequent parts of this charge.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-4\">The Court of Civil Appeals, in passing upon the eleventh assignment of error, said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AT9\">\u201cWe find neither allegation nor proof that Brooks caused the plaintiff to take a dangerous and extra hazardous position on the handcar, nor are we able to say from the evidence that said Brooks caused the handcar to be suddenly stopped; but we are of opinion that the charge, in requiring the jury to find these two acts of negligence to concur with the third, involving the high rate of speed, placed a burden upon defendant in error more onerous than the law required, and that this error was in favor of and not against the plaintiff in error; and for that reason we think the eleventh assignment of error must be overruled.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b267-6\"><em>Stanley, Spoonts &amp; Meek, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsT\">1.

This alleges negligence on part of the foreman in permitting the car to be run in a dangerous manner, and the absence of negligence on part of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">According to the averments in the petition, Brooks and plaintiff were not fellow servants. There is nothing either in the language or the reasoning in the opinion in Railway v. Williams, 75 Texas, 4, which leads to the contrary conclusion. It is true we there say, that \u201cthere are numerous cases which hold the employe who has charge of a special department of the company\u2019s business, with the power to employ the servants in his department, is not to be deemed the fellow servant of those under his control;\u201d but it was not meant by this that the department of the business should necessarily be a principal one. We think the rule applies to any special business of the master which is carried on by a number of employes under charge of another, with power to employ and discharge the servants engaged in that business. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>-We think the demurrer and exceptions to the petition were properly-overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\">We are of opinion, also, that it is unimportant that the power of employing and discharging hands exercised by Brooks was conferred upon him by the roadmaster. The material fact is that he had the authority; it is immaterial through what officer or agent of the company it was derived. It follows, that in our opinion there was no error in ' refusing the charge, the rejection of which is complained of as the second ground of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">The third assignment of error in this court complains that the Court of Civil Appeals erred in not sustaining the appellant\u2019s eleventh assignment in that court. That assignment complained of a certain paragraph in the charge of the court. Since we think that the Court of Civil Appeals properly disposed of that question in their opinion, it is unnecessary that we should add anything to what they have said as to that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The judgments of the Court of Civil Appeals and of the District Court are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Delivered June 18, 1894.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Motion for rehearing overruled October 8, 1894.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
