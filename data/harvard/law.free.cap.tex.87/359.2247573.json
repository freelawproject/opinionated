Bouldin and wife, Belle Bouldin, and D. W. Bouldin, Jr., in evidence, because by the terms of the deed from James E. Bouldin, Sr., to his four grandchildren, Charles, David, Powhatan, and James E. Bouldin, Jr., under which these grantors held, it was expressly provided that the land sought to be conveyed should be held in common and unsold until the youngest of the grandchildren should attain his majority, and at the execution of said two deeds, the youngest of said four grandchildren had not attained his majority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-17\">2.

Jacob Fisher\u2019s Digest, title \u201cDeeds,\u201d shows that the intention of the grantor in a deed is to be regarded as it is in a will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-4\">The breaking down of feudalism has had the effect to extend the owner\u2019s power over his land (2 Minor\u2019s Institutes, p. 73), and the power or rights over his lands has become like that of the king. The right of the king to impose restraints rested on the principle that he was feudatory of no man. Texas has maintained the policy of restraining alienation, and in this set the example to its citizens by grants of conditional certificates and in many of its colonial and military acts. While I of course do not claim that the right of the private owner is commensurate with that of the State, I do claim, in the absence of express legal restraints and subject to the maxim, \u201cSo use your own as not to injure your neighbor\u2019s,\u201d that there is nothing to control him in the use or disposition of his land. Yielding to Professor Gray, attorneys for appellee say, that \u201cno man should have an estate to live on but not an estate to pay his debts with.\u201d But the policy of Texas is not such and has never been, as witness its homestead and exemption laws and the history of their growth. In a State so solicitous to protect the family from the avarice of creditors, can it be consistently held that a reasonable safeguard thrown around his issue, by an ancestor, to protect them against the inexperience and accidents of nonage and young manhood, shall be disregarded in the interests of possible creditors of such minors, and positively disrespected even when no creditors exist at all?</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-5\">A is the owner of the field, Blackacre. B is indebted to C. C has no right to look to A for payment, nor any right of levy on Black-acre. Is he therefore injured because A conveys Blackacre to B with a brief restraint on B\u2019s right of alienation? This illustration, I trust, is sufficient to meet the untenable objection, that no man should have an estate to live on which is not an estate to pay debts with.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-6\">Suppose A, instead of consigning Blackacre to B, had given it to D.

If our titles are alodial, so are the titles in other States, and the idea that restraints of the power of alienation are void derives no extra force from the common law as intimated in appellant\u2019s argument, but on the contrary it only obtained existence on the abolition of feudal tenures, and those American courts which hold that such restraints are valid have followed the modern English authorities, which are based upon a relaxation of the common law rule, and the great weight of American authority is against the validity of such restraints. 1 Warv. on Vend., pp. 453, 454, and notes. This question in Texas, so far as we have been able to find out, is an open question, and we can not see that our statutes affect it one way or another. Article 553 of the Revised Statutes, cited by appellant, only authorizes the insertion of lawful clauses in deeds of conveyance, and the question recurs whether a clause (restraining the power in the grantee to alienate at any time he saw proper) in a deed conveying the entire estate vesting at once, would be lawful.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>3. The sale of the land by P. O. Saunders, guardian, was neither fraudulent nor void.

Court of this State has the power to direct the sale of a nonresident minor\u2019s land wherever the necessity is shown to exist for such purpose, and it is sufficient for such purpose if it is shown to be necessary for the maintenance or education of such minor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-8\">It is shown in the order granting the application to sell the land that there was a necessity for the sale, for the education and maintenance of the minors.

Thereupon plaintiffs filed a paper alleging no facts, but offering to refund any sum the court might find chargeable to them on account of any money received by their alleged guardian, who sold the land. This paper presents no issue, and the case will be considered as one of ordinary trespass to try title, with plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">James E. Bouldin, the common source of title, in 1876, in due form of law executed a deed which, divested of unnecessary verbiage, reads as follows: \u201cI, James E. Bouldin, in consideration of natural love and affection I have for my grandchildren, sons of David W. and Belle Bouldin, do hereby give, grant, alien, and convey unto Charles, David, Powhatan, and James Bouldin, in undivided equal portions, the following tracts or parcels of land, to be held in common and unsold until the youngest of said boys shall become of age, that is, the age of 21 years, known and described as follows, to wit.\u201d Then follows proper description of the land in controversy, and usual habendum and warranty clauses unto the said grantees, \u201ctheir heirs and assigns forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">It appears from the record that prior to the time the youngest of said grantees arrived at the age of 21, and before the sale of plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>lands by order of Probate Court hereinafter referred to, the two grantees, Charles and David Bouldin having deceased, leaving David W. and Belle Bouldin their sole heirs, said David W. and Belle Bouldin conveyed to defendant all their interest in the land in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">The Probate Court of Wise County convened July 21, 1884, and adjourned August 7, 1884. On application of plaintiffs, who were then over 14 years of age, and capable of selecting a guardian under our law, said court on the 2nd day of August, 1884, appointed a guardian of the estates of plaintiffs, which guardian on the same day qualified according to law and filed an inventory. The next term of said court convened September 15th, and adjourned October 6, 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The record shows an order of sale to have been entered upon the minutes of said court directing the sale of the land in controversy by said guardian. This order is not dated, and the Court of Civil Appeals finds as a question of fact that the record of this cause \u201cdoes not show affirmatively that the order of sale was made without a citation or the possibility of a citation served for the length of time required under article 2575 of the Bevised Statutes.\u201d The statute cited requires notice of applications to sell a ward\u2019s land to be given to \u201call persons interested in the ward,\u201d by posting same \u201cfor at least twenty days before the first day of the term of the court to which the citation is made returnable.\u201d The guardian\u2019s report of sale was confirmed by decree of the court filed October 4, 1884, which recites that it appeared to the court that the sale had been made \u201cin conformity with law and the order of the court heretofore made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The defendant deraigns title by mesne conveyances from the purchaser at such sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The court below rendered judgment for defendant, and the Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the same.</p>\n<p id=\"ArT\">The record shows, that at the time the probate proceedings were had plaintiffs were residents of California, and therefore plaintiffs claim that the Probate Court of Wise County, Texas, though it had jurisdiction to appoint a guardian, had no jurisdiction to order a sale for the purpose of educating the wards, but should have confined its orders to preservation of the estate. The statute authorizing the appointment of guardians in such cases expressly provides for the sending of money abroad to educate the nonresident minor. The nonresident minor can only dispose of his estate through the proceedings of the Probate Courts of Texas, and if such courts, when authorized by statute, can not make valid disposition of the minor\u2019s land for his education, then he might be forced to the alternative of moving into the State or foregoing the advantages of an education.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">We can not so construe the law as to make the preservation of the property of more importance than the education of the ward. Bev. Stats., art. 2515. The Probate Court being a court of general juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>diction within the scope of the powers conferred upon it in matters of guardianship, its proceedings can not be attacked collaterally for fraud, as seems to have been attempted in this case; but can only be .attacked for such cause in appropriate proceedings instituted for that purpose. Therefore we can not consider any assignment revising that issue. 80 Texas, 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\">Plaintiffs contend that the Probate Court had no jurisdiction to order the sale of the property, for the reason that no notice of the application to sell was given, as required by article 2675 of the Revised Statutes, above cited. We do not deem it our duty to consider or express \u25a0an opinion as to whether notice of the application to sell realty was, .at the time these proceedings were had, a jurisdictional fact, because the plaintiffs, who are seeking to attack the validity of the judgment \u2022of the Probate Court as being void for want of such notice, have not shown that no such notice was given. We can not say as a matter of law that the finding of the Court of Civil Appeals on this question, above set out, is without evidence. The law, in the absence of proof, presumes that all jurisdictional facts existed. If notice was a jurisdictional fact, the defendant relying upon the judgment was not called upon to establish such notice, nor to show the order of sale to have been entered at such a time as to make notice possible; but the burden was upon plaintiffs to establish the fact that notice was not given. We therefore conclude that the probate proceedings, aided by the legal presumptions above discussed, were not void, but were sufficient to pass the title of plaintiffs to the purchaser at the guardian\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap9j\">Plaintiffs claim, however, that the clause in the deed above set out, \u201cshall be held in common and unsold until the youngest of said boys shall become of age, that is, the age of 21 years,\u201d was a valid limitation on the power of each grantee and all persons claiming under them to dispose of the property until the youngest grantee arrived at the age of 21, and that therefore the deed from David W. and Belle Bouldin, above referred to, as well as the probate sale, were Aoid, because made before the youngest of said grantees was 21 years old. It is clear that the language used does not amount to a condition the breach of which would defeat the estate of the grantees or either of them, and cause same to revert to the grantor or his heirs. It is not contended by plaintiffs that the language of the deed is such as to annex a condition to the estate of the grantees therein, for it could avail them nothing, in this suit of trespass to try title, in which they must recover, if at all, on the strength of their own title, to show that such title had been defeated by condition broken. The language of the granting clause in the deed is sufficient under the statute of Texas to convey an estate in fee simple. Rev. Stats., art. 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The question is, could the grantor conveying to the grantees a vested estate in fee simple, without a condition the breach of which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>avoid the estate granted, impose a valid limitation or restriction upon the power of the grantees to convey the estate granted for any period of time, however reasonable? The estate of the citizen is not the land itself, but the status or relation which the law permits him to bear towards the land. The land is an inanimate body towards which different persons may under the law bear different relations, each constituting a status or estate in the land; as an estate for years in one, followed by an estate for life in another, and an estate in fee in another. The nature and incidents of these different estates are fixed by known rules of law. Some are necessary; others are usual incidents. The law will not permit private parties to dispense with the former by contract. Since these relations or estates are the creatures of the law, their nature and incidents may be changed thereby; from which it follows that, the State may, by law, impose restrictions and annex conditions to its grants, which the general rules of law forbid to the individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">We have seen that the deed in question vested in the grantees a fee simple estate. Unlimited power of alienation in the holder to the extent of his capacity to convey under the law is a necessary incident to a vested estate in fee simple; for if a condition not to alien, for a particular time, or to a certain person, etc., be annexed to the estate, <em>and if it be conceded, that such condition is valid, </em>nevertheless the conveyance which breaches the condition is good as between the grantor and grantee therein, the condition not inuring to the benefit of such grantor and he being estopped by his own conveyance, and is also good as to the original grantor, for whose benefit the condition was annexed, until he re-enters, for condition broken, livery of seizin being necessary to the creation of such estate, it could not at common law be defeated only by corresponding notoriety of re-entry. If, as above shown, the conveyance is good at all events against the grantor therein, and good as to the original grantor until re-entry for condition broken, even when there is a condition against alienation, then it results that the conveyance would be valid as to both of said grantors when there is no condition annexed to said estate. The first grantor could not complain, because there would be no condition broken, and therefore no right of re-entry in him; and the second grantor could not complain, because he would be estopped by his own conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Thus it appears that unlimited power of alienation exists in such cases, as stated above, no matter what conditions or limitations are sought to be imposed, and that the common law afforded no remedy for breach or violation of such conditions or limitation except the right of re-entry for condition broken; and that only affected the right of the grantee in the prohibited conveyance. Then, since this unlimited power of alienation is a necessary incident to such estate, and since there is no person who can enforce the attempted limitation on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>the power to sell when there is no condition, it follows that the words of limitation in the deed above are ineffectual in law, and the deed must be construed as if they had not been written therein. 29 Mich., 84; 38 Am.
