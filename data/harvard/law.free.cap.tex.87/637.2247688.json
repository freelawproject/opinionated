And there being no issue of fact for them to pass upon in this case, their action was not a judicial one, and required no exercise of judgment, and the manner in which they should discharge this duty being directed by law, and this statute being a mandatory one, a mandamus will lie to compel said Commissioners Court to order said election.

The act of the Commissioners Court in refusing to- order the election was a judicial act requiring the exercise of judgment, of which the court has jurisdiction, and the action of the court can not be revised by mandamus.

The act of the Commissioners Court in refusing, to order the election was a political act, from which there is no appeal, and which can not be revised by mandamus. Harrell v.

It confers upon the voters so petitioning a clear legal right to have the election ordered; and if the court upon its refusal to make the order can not be compelled by mandamus, it leaves them without a remedy for the enforcement of the right. It is a matter in which, from its nature, the petitioners can not have a pecuniary interest; but since the law expressly confers the right to demand the election, it can not be said that it does not recognize in them an interest for the enforcement. It was not contemplated, as we think, that they should be left without a remedy, or with a remedy dependent solely upon the will of the State\u2019s official attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">After stating that it is clear that in England a writ of mandamus to compel the performance of a public duty may be issued at the instance of a private relator, the Supreme Court of the Hnited States sa<em>y: </em>There is, we think, a decided preponderance of American authority in favor of the doctrine that private persons may move for a mandamus to enforce a public duty not due to the government as such, without the intervention of the government law officer.\u201d Strong, J., in Railway v. Hall, 91 U. S., 343, citing People v. Collins, 19 Wend., 56; Pike County v. The State, 11 Ill., 202; Ottawa v. The People, 48 Ill., 233; Hamilton v. The State, 3 Ind., 452; The People v.

Rem., secs. 431, 432; Cannon v. Janvier, 3 Hous. (Del.), 27. The following cases support the same doctrine: The State v. Brown, 38 Ohio St., 344; The State v. Francis, 95 Mo., 44; Attorney-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>General v. Boston, 123 Mass., 460; Scott v. County Commissioners, 17 Fla., 707; McConihe v.

City Council, 39 N. J. L., 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">There seems to be some conflicting decisions; but we do not find it necessary to decide the broad question in order to determine the point before us. Since the statute gives the requisite number of voters the right to demand an election by a petition, we think any one or more of the petitioners entitled to a writ of mandamus if .necessary in order to compel the performance of the duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The proceedings for the writ of mandamus are usually instituted in the name of the State; but when they are prosecuted in behalf of a private relator, this is a mere matter of form. The private relator is the real party, and it accords with the genius of our system of jurisprudence that the suit should proceed in his name. Such we think has been recognized as good practice in our courts from an early day. Land Commissioners v. Bell, Dall., 366; Glasscock v. Commissioner, etc., 3 Texas, 51; Cullem v. Latimer, 4 Texas, 329; Arberry v. Beavers, 6 Texas, 457; Sansom v. Mercer, 68 Texas, 488; Brown v. Ruse, 69 Texas, 589; Smith v. McGaughey, 87 Texas, 61. We therefore answer the second question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Delivered April 11, 1895.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
