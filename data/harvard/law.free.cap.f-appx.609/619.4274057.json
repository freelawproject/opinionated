Rodriguez contends that that he was sentenced pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, and that regardless of his status as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, he is automatically eligible for a reduced sentence pursuant to Amendment 782. He also argues that amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 made after his conviction eliminated his opportunity to reduce his sentence under Amendment 782, thereby violating the <em>Ex Post Facto Clause.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-22\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam). A court may only reduce a term of imprisonment in limited circumstances, including when a defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ..., if such a reduction is consistent with applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on retroactive reduction of sentences, \u00a7 1B1.10, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">In a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (d) below, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). As required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), any such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement, and therefore is not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because another guideline or statutory provision controls. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) &amp; cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Amendment 782 reduced by two levels the base offense levels that apply to most drug offenses listed in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, Amend. 782 (2014). The amendment applies retroactively to orders with an effective date of November 1, 2015, or later. <em>See id., </em>Amend. 788 (adding Amendment 782 to \u00a7 lB1.10(d)\u2019s list of retroactively applicable guideline amendments and directing that, if the court orders a reduced term of imprisonment, the effective date of the court\u2019s order must be November 1, 2015, or later). Amendment 782 did not make any changes to \u00a7 4B1.1, the career-offender guideline. <em>See id., </em>Amend. 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The offense level for a career offender is determined by \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than \u00a7 2D1.1, and a career offender automatically receives a criminal history category of VI. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b); <em>accord </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (2001). When a defendant has been sentenced as career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, his base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 plays no role in the calculation of his guideline range. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1320. \u201c[When] a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir. 2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Rodriguez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion. Although Rodriguez\u2019s initial base offense level was 28, pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6), his guideline sentencing range was based upon his status as a career offender, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. Thus, any change to his initial base offense level as a result of Amendment 782 would not change his guideline sentencing range because the range was based solely upon \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) &amp; cmt. n. 1(A); <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Moreover, there is no merit to his contention that post-conviction amendments to \u00a7 1B1.10 violated the <em>Ex Post Facto Clause. </em>The amendments did not increase the range of punishment applicable to Rodriguez above what it was at the time he committed his crimes. <em>See United States v. Colon, </em>707 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201c[The <em>Ex Post Facto Clause </em>] prohibits \u2018the imposition of punishment more severe than the punishment assigned by law when the act to be punished occurred.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Weaver v. Graham, </em>450 U.S. 24, 30, 101 S.Ct. 960, 965, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981))).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-23\">. U.S. Const, art.
