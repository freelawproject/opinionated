He was sentenced to 36 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release and ordered to pay a $6,000 fine and $18,575 in restitution. He contends that the district court clearly erred by applying a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C) for an offense involving sophisticated means.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-21\">Section 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C) provides for a two-level enhancement if the offense involved \u201csophisticated means.\u201d \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C). We review the district court\u2019s factual finding that \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C) applies for clear error. <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>726 F.3d 684, 695 (5th Cir.2013). A factual finding is not clearly erroneous so long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>Id. </em>at 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-22\">Ngo defrauded the fund reserved for victims of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill by misrepresenting both that he was the owner of a commercial fishing business and that he incurred losses as a result of the oil spill. He obtained and then altered licenses for commercial fishing and created numerous fictitious business invoices to support his claim and conceal the fact that the commercial fishing business did not exist. He continued to use these fraudulent documents in additional attempts to file fraudulent claims. The investigating agent testified that most fraud cases related to the oil spill did not involve a fictitious business or supporting documentation, bringing Ngo\u2019s conduct outside the scope of a simple fraud case. Therefore, the district court\u2019s finding that this offense involved sophisticated means was plausible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>in light of the record as a whole and not clearly erroneous. <em>See Valdez, </em>726 F.3d at 692, 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
