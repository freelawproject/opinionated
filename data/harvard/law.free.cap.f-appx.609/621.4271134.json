He appeals his conviction, raising one issue: whether his conviction is invalid because \u00a7 175(a) failed to provide him with fair notice that the conduct in which he engaged was prohibited. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>553 U.S. 285, 304, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 1845, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008), \u201c[a] conviction fails to comport with due process if the statute under which it is obtained fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 128 S.Ct. at 1845. Crump argues that a person of ordinary intelligence would not know that possessing a castor bean in its naturally occurring state \u2014 in which it contains ricin, a biological toxin \u2014 is illegal under \u00a7 175(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-18\">Section 175(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-19\">Whoever knowingly develops, produces, stockpiles, transfers, acquires, retains, or possesses any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system <em>for use as a weapon, </em>... or attempts, threatens, or conspires to do the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for life or any term of years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-20\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 175(a) (emphasis added). Section 175(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-21\">Whoever knowingly possesses any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system of a type or in a quantity that, under the circumstances, is not reasonably justified by a prophylactic, protective, bona fide research, or other peaceful purpose, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both. <em>In this subsection, </em>the terms \u201cbiological agent\u201d and \u201ctoxin\u201d do not encompass any biological agent or toxin that is in its naturally occurring environment, if the biological- agent or toxin has not been cultivated, collected, or otherwise extracted from its natural source.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-22\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 175(b) (emphasis added). Section 175(c) defines the phrase \u201cfor use as a weapon\u201d as including \u201cthe development, production, transfer, acquisition, retention, or possession of any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system for other than prophylactic, protective, bona fide research, or other peaceful purposes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-23\">Section 178 of Title 18 contains definitions for several of the terms in \u00a7 175, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>including \u201cbiological agent\u201d and \u201ctoxin.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 178. \u201c \u2018[B]iologieal agent\u2019 means any microorganism ... or infectious substance, ... capable of causing ... death, disease, or other biological malfunction in a human-\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 178(1). \u201c\u2018[TJoxin\u2019 means the toxic material or product of plants, animals, miocroorganisms ..., or infection substances, ... and includes ... any poisonous substance ... produced by a living organism....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 178(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Section 175(a) is not vague as applied to Crump. <em>See United States v. Wayerski, </em>624 F.3d 1342, 1347 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cWhere, as in this case, a vagueness challenge does not involve the First Amendment, the analysis must be as applied to the facts of the case.\u201d). The statute provides a person of ordinary intelligence with fair warning that possessing castor beans, while knowing how to extract ricin, a biological toxin, from the beans, and intending to use the ricin as a weapon to kill people, is prohibited. <em>See United States v. Lebowitz, </em>676 F.3d 1000, 1012 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam). Though \u00a7 175(b) excludes from liability the possession of \u201cany biological agent or toxin\u201d that \u201chas not been cultivated, collected, or otherwise extracted from its natural source,\u201d this exclusion explicitly applies only to subsection (b). It does not apply to \u00a7 175(a), under which Crump was prosecuted, and which requires the additional showing that the defendant \u201cknowingly ... possess [the] biological agent [or] toxin ... <em>for use as a weapon.\u201d </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 175(a) (emphasis added). Crump\u2019s conduct clearly transgressed 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 175(a). Thus, his complaint of vagueness is unavailing, <em>see United States v. McGarity, </em>669 F.3d 1218, 1234 (11th Cir.2012), and his conviction is,</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
