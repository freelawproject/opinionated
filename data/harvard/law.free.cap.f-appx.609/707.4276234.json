He was sentenced to 288 months of imprisonment. In November 2013, Bart\u00f3k filed a direct appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He later filed in that court a motion for bond pending appeal. Bartok\u2019s direct appeal, as well as his motion for bond, remain pending in the Second Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-16\">In August 2014, Bart\u00f3k filed a \u00a7 2241 petition in the Western District of Pennsylvania, the judicial district in which he is currently incarcerated. Bart\u00f3k argued that he is entitled to habeas relief because the indictment filed in his case was invalid and because of various errors made at trial. He attached to the \u00a7 2241 petition a copy of the motion for bond that he had filed in the Second Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-17\">The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissing the \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction because the proper channel for attacking a federal conviction and sentence is a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>which must be filed in the sentencing court. The Magistrate Judge found Bar-t\u00f3k did not establish that section 2255 was an inadequate or ineffective remedy to test the legality of his detention.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> .Overruling Bartok\u2019s objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the District Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Bart\u00f3k appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Vega v. United States, </em>493 F.3d 310, 314 (3d Cir.2007). We may summarily affirm a judgment of the District Court on any basis supported by the record if the appeal does not raise a substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6; <em>see also Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 247 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The District Court properly dismissed Bartok\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. A motion filed under \u00a7 2255 in the sentencing court is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge the validity of a conviction or sentence. <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). By contrast, \u00a7 2241 \u201cconfers habeas jurisdiction to hear the petition of a federal prisoner who is challenging not the validity but the execution of his sentence.\u201d <em>Coady v. Vaughn, </em>251 F.3d 480, 485-86 (3d Cir.2001) (noting that challenges to the execution of a sentence include, e.g., challenges to wrongful revocation of parole, place of imprisonment, and credit for time served) (internal citations omitted). We agree with the District Court that the claims that Bart\u00f3k raised in his \u00a7 2241 petition constitute attacks on the validity of his conviction and, as such, must be brought pursuant to \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">A petitioner can seek relief under \u00a7 2241 if the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249-51 (3d Cir.1997). However, \u201c[\u00a7 ] 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because the sentencing court does not grant relief, the one-year statute of limitations has expired, or the petitioner is unable to meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements of the amended \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). Rather, the \u201csafety valve\u201d provided under section 2255 is extremely narrow and applies only in unusual situations, such as those in which a prisoner has had no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for actions later deemed to be non-criminal by an intervening change in law. <em>See Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120 (citing <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">We agree with the District Court that Bart\u00f3k failed to show that a \u00a7 2255 motion would be an inadequate or ineffective vehicle to present his claims once his direct appeal proceedings have concluded. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Pirro, </em>104 F.3d 297, 299 (9th Cir.1997) (determining that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>delay in submitting a \u00a7 2255 motion until the direct appeal is resolved does not render \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective). Although Bart\u00f3k expressed concern that the sentencing court is biased and would not fairly adjudicate his claims, the District Court correctly concluded that the perceived bias of the trial court is not a basis for a section 2241 petition. <em>See Tripati v. Henman, </em>843 F.2d 1160, 1163 (9th Cir.1988) (stating that alleged judicial bias does not render \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective because a petitioner may raise the issue of bias on appeal or in a motion for recusal).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Finally, we conclude that the District Court did not err in declining to construe Bartok\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as a motion under \u00a7 2255 (to be transferred to the Southern District of New York), as such a motion would have been subject to dismissal as premature because it was filed prior to the resolution of Bartok\u2019s direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Dukes, </em>727 F.2d 34, 41 (2d Cir.1984); <em>see also Kapral v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 565, 570-72 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the appeal does not present a substantial question. We will therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Bartok\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel, for expedited judgment, and for release on bail pending appeal on habeas corpus are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b736-11\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-18\">. He also submits motions for appointment of counsel, for expedited judgment, and for release on bail pending appeal on habeas corpus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b737-7\">. We note that the Magistrate Judge incorrectly determined that Bart\u00f3k also filed in the Western District of Pennsylvania a motion for bond pending disposition of his direct appeal. As mentioned, Bart\u00f3k merely attached (apparently for informational purposes), a copy of the still-pending motion for bond that he had filed in the Second Circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b737-8\">. The District Court noted that to the extent Bart\u00f3k might wish to challenge the conditions of his confinement (some of which he had discussed in his objections), he should file a complaint subject to the Prison Litigation Reform Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b737-13\">.A certificate of appealability is not required to appeal the District\u2019s Court ruling. <em>See Burkey v. Marberry, </em>556 F.3d 142, 146 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
