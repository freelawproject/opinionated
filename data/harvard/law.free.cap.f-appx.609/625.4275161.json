On appeal, Champagnie argues that the district court lacked the authority to apply a 12-leyel increase to his base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), based upon a prior conviction that was neither charged in the indictment nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">\u201cWe review constitutional sentencing issues de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). We also \u201creview questions of law with respect to the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Garza-Mendez, </em>735 F.3d 1284, 1287 (11th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">The Supreme Court held, in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that the government need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions nor allege those prior convictions in its indictment in order to use those convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s statutory maximum sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. at 1222. We have recognized that we are \u201cbound to follow <em>Almendarez-</em>Torres unless and until the Supreme Court itself overrules that decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1035 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">We have affirmed a guideline range enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), which differs from \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), only in the number of levels of the enhancement, against a similar challenge to the use of a prior conviction not charged in the indictment and proved to a jury, noting that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), left <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>undisturbed. <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">As Champagnie concedes, binding precedent forecloses his argument that the district court erred by enhancing his advisory guideline range based on a prior conviction not charged in the indictment or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">Accordingly, upon review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
