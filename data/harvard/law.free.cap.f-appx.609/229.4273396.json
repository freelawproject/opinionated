The district court sentenced Reyes to the statutory maximum terms of imprisonment on each count and ordered the sentences to run consecutively, for a total sentence of 240 months of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release. Reyes argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>plication of the statutes of convictions and guidelines produced an excessive sentence that effectively punished him twice for the same conduct, i.e. the trafficking of firearms. He also argues that the 240-month sentence fails to take into account his difficult childhood and the age of his prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Reyes does not dispute that his 240-month sentence was imposed within a properly-calculated guidelines range. Thus, a presumption of reasonableness applies to his sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Reyes\u2019s mere disagreement with the applicable statutes of convictions and guidelines is insufficient to demonstrate that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Insofar as Reyes contends that the district court failed to take into account his personal history and characteristics, these factors do not require a district court to impose a sentence lower than a guideline range sentence. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). The district court heard defense counsel\u2019s arguments, but apparently determined that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range would provide an \u201cadequate fair and reasonable sentence.\u201d Reyes\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s evaluation of the sentencing factors is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
