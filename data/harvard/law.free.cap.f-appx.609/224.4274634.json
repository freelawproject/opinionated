He claims the court: committed plain error by failing to inquire, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, whether he had read the revised presentence investigation report and discussed it with his attorney; and erred by converting cash currency into drug equivalents for purposes of computing his base-offense level, pursuant to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(5), (c)(4) (setting offender\u2019s offense level at 32 for possession of at least 3,000, but less than 10,000, kilograms of marijuana equivalent). In response, the Government asserts, <em>inter alia, </em>that the appeal should be dismissed based on Eikelboom\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal, contained in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Pursuant to the terms of the waiver, Eik\u00e9lboom waived the right to directly appeal his sentence on any ground, except the denial of his motions to suppress and the applicability of the career-offender provision. Therefore, the waiver provision encompasses his Rule 32 and Guideline \u00a7 2D1.1 challenges. Because Eikelboom does not challenge the voluntariness, and the Government seeks enforcement, of the waiver, the appeal is dismissed. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Walters, </em>732 F.3d 489, 491 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
