Liberally construing her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>brief on appeal, Moody states that the district court erred in dismissing her complaint and denying her request to file a third amended complaint. She argues that she stated a claim under \u00a7 1983 arising from her 2011 arrest, detention, psychiatric hold, and prosecution. She claims that she should have been allowed to amend her complaint for a third time in order to properly allege a policy or custom of the City of Delray Beach that led to the violation of her constitutional rights. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">I. DISMISSAL OF MOODY\u2019S \u00a7 1983 CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Moody first challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of her two \u00a7 1983 claims. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Glover v. Liggett Grp., Inc., </em>459 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). To state a claim, \u201ca plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (alteration adopted) (quotation omitted). \u201c[A] complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d, Ashcroft <em>v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotation omitted). Though we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>filings, <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008), we do not \u201crewrite,an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Air Jam. Ltd., </em>760 F.3d 1165, 1168-69 (11th Cir.2014) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">A. CLAIM AGAINST THE STATE OF FLORIDA</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">The district court did not err in dismissing Moody\u2019s complaint against the State of Florida for failure to state a claim. \u201c[T]o prevail on a civil rights action under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must show that [she] was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). A state is not a person for purposes of \u00a7 1983. <em>Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2312, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). Thus, Moody\u2019s claims against the State of Florida were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">B. CLAIM AGAINST THE CITY OF DELRAY BEACH</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">Moody next challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of her \u00a7 1983 claim against the City- of Delray Beach for failure to state a claim. Unlike the State of Florida, the City of Delray Beach is a local government entity which we consider a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1983. <em>See McDowell v. Brown, </em>392 F.3d 1283, 1289 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c[T]o impose \u00a7 1983 liability on a municipality, a plaintiff must show: (1) that his constitutional rights were violated; (2) that the municipality had a custom or policy that constituted deliberate indifference to that constitutional right; and (3) that the policy or custom caused the violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To establish a policy or custom, a plaintiff must show a \u201cpersistent and wide-spread practice.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1290 (quotation omitted). However, a theory of respondeat superior will not establish a municipality\u2019s liability. <em>Id. </em>at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">Moody\u2019s complaint was properly dismissed because she failed to allege a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>city policy or custom that caused some violation of her constitutional rights. Instead, she attempts to rely on respondeat superior to establish the city\u2019s liability by alleging that the city allowed her to be harmed by various police officers, doctors, and attorneys. Moody\u2019s second amended complaint (titled \u201cDefinite Statement and Complaint\u201d) asserts that the City of Del-ray Beach \u201cwent right along\u201d with Moody\u2019s 2007 arrest and \u201callow[ed] its [police department] employee(s) ... to violate their municipal policy and custom contract.\u201d She also highlights that the City of Delray Beach \u201cnever made one attempt to get [Moody] out of the Psychiatric Forensic Hospital,\u201d \u201callowed [Moody\u2019s] mental state of mind' to be tortured\u201d through forced medication, \u201callowed [Moody] to be put through another arrest\u201d by a Delray Beach police officer, and \u201callowed [Moody] to be held against her will for 238 days\u201d in jail and at the mental hospital. These allegations make no mention of any unconstitutional custom or policy of the City of Delray Beach. Because Moody cannot rely upon respondeat superior to impose vicarious liability on the City of Delray Beach for the actions of its employees, the district court properly dismissed Moody\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\">II. DENIAL OF MOODY\u2019S MOTION TO AMEND</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">Finally, Moody challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to grant her a third opportunity to amend her complaint. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend a complaint for an abuse of discretion. <em>Coventry First, LLC v. McCarty, </em>605 F.3d 865, 869 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam). However, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>a decision that a particular amendment to the complaint would be futile.\u201d <em>Cockrell v. Sparks, </em>510 F.3d 1307, 1310 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 sets conditions within which a plaintiff may amend her complaint once, as a matter of course. However, later amendments may be done only with the consent of the opposing party or leave of the court. Rule 15 says that courts \u201cshould freely give leave when justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). Despite this generally permissive approach, a district court need not grant leave to amend where (1) \u201cthere has been undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, or repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed\u201d; (2) \u201callowing amendment would cause undue prejudice to the opposing party\u201d; or (3) the \u201camendment would be futile.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Dupree, </em>252 F.3d 1161, 1163 (11th Cir.2001) (per cu-riam):</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">The district court gave Moody two opportunities to amend her complaint. Despite the district court\u2019s specific explanation of the complaint\u2019s deficiencies, Moody failed in each earlier amendment to add facts which plausibly connect the City of Delray Beach to the constitutional harms she alleges she suffered. This is true even though \u201c[i]t is difficult to imagine how the district court could have been more explicit in expressing its concern over the complaint\u2019s deficiencies and in recommending the changes necessary to correct them.\u201d <em>Friedlander v. Nims, </em>755 F.2d 810, 813 (11th Cir.1985). Also, any further amendment against the State of Florida would have been futile, because no \u00a7 1983 suit can be properly pleaded against a state. <em>Bryant, </em>252 F.3d at 1163; <em>Will, </em>491 U.S. at 71, 109 S.Ct. at 2312. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Moody\u2019s request for amendment and dismissing her complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
