He argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-23\">Plain error review governs Melchor\u2019s sentencing challenge as he did not object on this basis in the district court. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). The presumption of reasonableness \u201cis rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-24\">As Melchor acknowledges, his argument challenging the presumption of reasonableness due to the lack of an empirical basis for \u00a7 2L1.2 is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 &amp; n. 7 (5th Cir.2009). While Melchor now contends that the district court improperly analyzed the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, he has not shown that the district court failed to give proper weight to any particular \u00a7 3553(a) factor, gave significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or that his sentence represents a \u201cclear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>To the extent Melchor seeks to have this court reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, this court will not do so, as such an analysis would contravene the deferential review that applies in this context. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Additionally, his contention that his offense is a mere international trespass has been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Finally, the district court\u2019s extensive reasons for the sentence are sufficient to support the imposition of the three-year term of supervised release in this instance. <em>See United States v. Becerril-Pena, </em>714 F.3d 347, 350-51 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
