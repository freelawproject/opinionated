HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b297-24\">Collie Lee Williams, federal prisoner #81586-004, appeals the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging his total 264-month prison sentence for (1) possessing with intent to distribute crack cocaine, (2) using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, and (3) being a felon in possession of a firearm. Williams also moves for a stay of these proceedings pending either a determination of the ret-roactivity of <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), or a decision in the rehearing of <em>Spencer v. United States, </em>727 F.3d 1076, 1087 (11th Cir.2013).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Williams argues that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holdings in <em>Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013), and <em>Des-camps, </em>his previous state convictions for strong armed robbery and possession of cocaine did not qualify as predicate offenses for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), and, therefore, the district court erroneously sentenced him to a mandatory statutory minimum. Williams also argues that he is entitled to invoke the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because (1) there was a \u201cfundamental error\u201d in his criminal proceedings, (2) \u00a7 2255 is invalid because the\u2018cases upon which he now relies were not available on direct review or during his initial collateral attack, and (3) any remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be inadequate to test the legality of his detention because his motion would be barred as second or successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). Because \u00a7 2241 is not a substitute for \u00a7 2255, a \u201csection 2241 petition that seeks to challenge the validity of a federal sentence must either be dismissed or construed as a section 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). A \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 only if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see also Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000). To demonstrate that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, Williams must establish that his claim is (i) \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] ... may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in [his] ... trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">The first \u201cfactor requires that a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establish that the petitioner is actually innocent,\u201d meaning that he \u201cmay have been imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited by law.\u201d <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830-31 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Williams\u2019s assertions that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender do not meet this standard. His claim challenges the assessment of predicate offenses; it does not argue that he is actually innocent of the offense for which he was convicted. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Kinder, </em>222 F.3d at 214. Additionally, a remedy under \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective based solely on the fact that Williams\u2019s previous \u00a7 2255 motion was unsuccessful or because any of Williams\u2019s subsequently filed \u00a7 2255 motions will like<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ly be classified as successive and, thus, barred. <em>See Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830; <em>Kinder, </em>222 F.3d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Furthermore, as Williams does not claim to be innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted and, thus, cannot satisfy the savings clause, <em>see Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904, his motion for a stay is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-10\">. Since Williams filed his motion for a stay, the Eleventh Circuit has issued its en banc opinion in <em>Spencer v. United States, </em>773 F.3d 1132 (11th Cir.2014) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
