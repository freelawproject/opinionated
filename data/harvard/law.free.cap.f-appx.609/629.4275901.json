Brown,' Patricia L. Diaz, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Fort Lauderdale, FL, Wifredo A. Ferrer, Andrea G. Hoffman, Kathleen Mary Salyer, Emily M. Smachetti, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Miami, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b657-18\">Ronald Larose, Washington, MS, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b657-20\">Before HULL, WILLIAM PRYOR and ROSENBAUM, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b657-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b657-22\">Ronald Larose, a federal prisoner, appeals <em>pro se </em>the denial of his motion to reduce his sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 782 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines and the denial of his motion for reconsideration, Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a). Larose argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motions because it improperly weighed the relevant sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-23\">We review for abuse- of discretion the denial of a motion to reduce a sentence based on a later change in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). And we review <em>de novo </em>the jurisdiction of the district court. <em>United States v. Oliver, </em>148 F.3d 1274, 1275 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-24\">A district court must follow a two-step process in ruling on a motion to reduce a sentence based on a later change in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the district court must recalculate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the defendant\u2019s sentence by \u201csubstituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is, \u201cthe court shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment[ ] ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). \u201cAll other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact.\u201d <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780 (quoting <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998)). Second, the district court must decide whether to retain the original sentence or to resentence the defendant under the amended guideline range based on the relevant sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781; see also <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760 (\u201cThe grant of authority to the district court to reduce a term of imprisonment [under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ] is unambiguously discretionary.\u201d). The district court is \u201cnot required to articulate the applicability of each factor as long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a), a district court may correct a sentence for an \u201carithmetical, technical, or other clear error\u201d within 14 days after sentencing. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a). That 14-day deadline is jurisdictional. <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1317 (11th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2010). In <em>Phillips, </em>we held that when a district court reduces a sentence under section 3582(c)(2) \u201cthe strictures of Rule 35 apply.\u201d 597 F.3d at 1197-99. We later held that the rationale of <em>Phillips </em>extends to cases in which the district court denies a motion to reduce a sentence on the merits because a \u201cdenial on the merits is still, in essence, a new sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>772 F.3d 662, 667 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Larose\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence. The district court correctly followed the two-step process for deciding whether to grant Larose\u2019s motion. The district court recalculated Larose\u2019s guideline range and weighed the relevant sentencing factors. The district court acted within its discretion when it found that Larose\u2019s original 151-month sentence was necessary to protect the public, promote respect for the law, and act as a deterrent. We affirm the denial of Larose\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">We cannot consider Larose\u2019s arguments about the denial of his motion for reconsideration. The district court lacked jurisdiction to deny Larose\u2019s motion for reconsideration more than 14 days after it had denied his motion to reduce his sentence. Accordingly, we vacate that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
