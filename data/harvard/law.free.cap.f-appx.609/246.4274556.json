California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Counsel also has implicitly moved to supplement the record with copies of adjudicative documents regarding Quesada-Rios\u2019s prior state conviction. Quesada-Rios has filed a response and has moved for the appointment of new counsel. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Quesada-Rios\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Therefore, counsel\u2019s implied motion for leave to supplement the record and motion for leave to withdraw are GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, Quesada-Rios\u2019s motion for appointment of new counsel is DENIED, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-26\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
