He contends that the district court erroneously applied the 16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on his state conviction of trafficking heroin. Relying on <em>Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013), he claims that the statute under which he was convicted encompasses conduct that is broader than the definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2 because it criminalizes the distribution or transportation of heroin without remuneration.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Because Zepeda-Rangel objected to the enhancement, we review <em>de novo </em>the legal question whether the conviction qualifies as a drug-trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 457 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1892, 191 L.Ed.2d 767 (2015). An enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) for a drug-trafficking conviction is warranted regardless of whether it required proof of remuneration or commercial dealing. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>782 F.3d 198, 204-05 (5th Cir.2015). In view of <em>Martinez-Lugo, </em>Zepeda has failed to show that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under \u2018 the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
