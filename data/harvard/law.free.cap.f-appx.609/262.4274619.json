Relevant to the appeal, the district court assessed a 12-level \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), based on Ramirez-Gan-darilla\u2019s 1989 federal conviction for possession with intent to distribute marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-21\">For the first time on appeal, Ramirez-Gandarilla argues that the district court plainly erred by applying the 12-level drug trafficking enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2 because his 1989 federal conviction for possession with intent to distribute marijuana could have been committed without evidence of remuneration or commercial activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-22\">This court recently held that an enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)\u00a9 for a prior drug trafficking offense, as that term is defined by the Sentencing Commission in \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iv)), is warranted regardless of whether the conviction for the prior offense required proof of remuneration or commercial activity. <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>782 F.3d 198, 204-05 (5th Cir.2015). Additionally, in <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>700 F.3d 751, 754 (5th Cir.2012), this court specifically stated that \u201c21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) is a federal drug trafficking offense as defined in Application Note 1\u201d of \u00a7 2L1.2. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
