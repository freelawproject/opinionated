He contends that the district court erred in refusing to grant him safety-valve relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(f). Arreola-Escalante argues that he satisfied the criteria to receive the reduction and, specifically, truthfully provided all required information and evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">A defendant may receive a two-level reduction in his offense level if he, inter alia, truthfully provides to the Government all information and evidence that he has about the offense of conviction or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or a common scheme or plan. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(16) (2013); . \u00a7 501.2(a)(5); \u00a7 3553(f)(5). The refusal of the district court to apply safety-valve relief based on a finding that a defendant has not truthfully provided all relevant information is a factual finding that typically is reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 345 (5th Cir.2011). However, because Arreola-Escalante did not object in the district court to the denial of safety-valve relief, our review is for plain error only. See <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). We need not determine whether the instant issue involves a question of fact that may never constitute plain error, see <em>United States v. Claiborne, </em>676 F.3d 434, 438 (5th Cir.2012), because Arreola-Esca-lante\u2019s claim is otherwise without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-16\">The record supports that Arreola-Esca-lante was previously involved in a conspiracy to transport marijuana that included the same participants as the instant offense and that he was connected to a drug trafficking organization. However, he did not disclose any information about his involvement in the prior conspiracy or the drug trafficking organization. Further, he does not now assert unequivocally that he was entirely truthful or identify evidence that he could present to show that he was totally forthcoming in his disclosures; he instead sets forth reasons for why he did not, or was unable to, provide all of the information that he possessed. His alleged excuses \u2014 i.e., the Government already knew about the drug trafficking organization, he provided statements in which he admitted his role in the instant offense, and he has mental and physical limitations that affect his memory \u2014 do not justify his refusal to reveal all information about other events that were part of the same course of conduct or a common scheme or plan. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5C1.2; \u00a7 3553(f). Thus, Arreola-Escalante has not shown that he truthfully provided all information to the Government and, thus, he has not shown that the district court erred in denying safety-valve relief. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>States v.
