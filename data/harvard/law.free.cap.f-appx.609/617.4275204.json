Specifically, Horton asserts that he received a document stating that his principal civil liberties had been restored, and that document did not mention a continuing restriction on his right to own firearms. Horton argues that, because his right to vote had been restored, his prior felony conviction did not satisfy \u00a7 922(g). Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-21\">We review the denial of a motion for new trial on the basis of newly-discovered evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Barsoum, </em>763 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1883, 191 L.Ed.2d 753 (2015). To succeed on a motion for new trial based on newly-discovered evidence, a defendant must prove that (1) the evidence was discovered after trial; (2) the failure to discover the evidence earlier was not due to a lack of diligence; (3) the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching; (4) the evidence is material; and (5) the evidence is such that a new trial would probably produce a different result. <em>Barsoum, </em>763 F.3d at 1341. \u201cCourts should use great caution in granting such motions as they are highly disfavored.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-24\">It is unlawful for anyone who has previously been convicted of a felony to possess firearms or ammunition. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Convicted felons whose civil rights have been restored are excluded from this restriction. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 921(a)(20).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-25\">Horton states that he received a document advising him that his civil rights had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>been restored, but the record only shows that he was registered to vote before he committed the offense conduct. The restoration of a convicted felon\u2019s right to vote, alone, is not sufficient to satisfy \u00a7 921(a)(20). <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>702 F.3d 604, 608 (11th Cir.2012). Therefore, a new trial would not produce a different result. <em>See Barsoum, </em>763 F.3d at 1341. Accordingly, the district court did not eiT in denying Horton\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
