In his plea agreement, Quiroz waived his right to appeal or attack collaterally his conviction or sentence, and reserved his right to appeal a sentence only based on: its exceeding the statutory maximum; an arithmetic error at sentencing; <em>the voluntariness </em>of his guilty plea or <em>the waiver; </em>or ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court varied downwardly from the Sentencing Guidelines advisory sentencing range and sentenced Quiroz to, <em>inter alia, </em>144 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Consistent with the above emphasized exception to the appeal waiver, Quiroz contends the waiver is invalid because: he was forced to agree to it in order to obtain a third point for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 3E1.1; and, therefore, he is not barred from claiming that the court erred in applying a three-level sentencing enhancement under Guideline \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) (enhancing offense level 3 levels if a \u201cmanager or supervisor\u201d), and that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. The Government responds by invoking the appeal waiver. Whether an appeal waiver bars an appeal is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Keele, </em>755 F.3d 752, 754 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1174, 191 L.Ed.2d 132 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-17\">The plea agreement and Quiroz\u2019 statements to the court reflect that he knowingly and voluntarily agreed to waive his right to appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 754-56; <em>United States v. Higgins, </em>739 F.3d 733, 736-37 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 2319, 189 L.Ed.2d 196 (2014). And, no evidence supports his claim that he was required to forgo his right to appeal to obtain a third acceptance point.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b255-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
