HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b302-24\">The Federal Public Defender appointed to represent Jose Gutierrez Villa has moved for leave to withdraw as counsel on appeal and has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Gutierrez Villa has filed responses. The record is not sufficiently-developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Gutierrez Villa\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; we therefore decline to consider the claim without prejudice to collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 123, 190 L.Ed.2d 94 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record, as well as Gutierrez Villa\u2019s responses. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. The motion for leave to withdraw is therefore GRANTED, and counsel is excused from further responsibilities in this case. Gutierrez Villa\u2019s request to proceed pro se is DENIED. See <em>United States v. Polanco-Ozorto, </em>772 F.3d 1053, 1055 (5th Cir.2014) (per curiam) (\u201c[A] criminal defendant\u2019s motion to proceed pro se on appeal will be denied if it is filed after the defendant\u2019s counsel has filed an <em>Anders </em>brief, as such a request is invoked too late.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). The APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
