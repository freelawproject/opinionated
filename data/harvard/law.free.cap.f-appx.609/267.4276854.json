He argues that the district court incorrectly applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Relying on the appellate waiver in the plea agreement, the Government seeks dismissal of the appeal, summary affirmance or, alternatively, an extension of time in which to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">We review the validity of an appeal waiver de novo. <em>United States v. Baymon, </em>312 F.3d 725, 727 (5th Cir.2002). The waiver provision broadly waived Blan-co-Gomez\u2019s right to appeal his sentence. He reserved the right to appeal only a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum or to bring a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that affected the validity of the plea or the waiver. The record of his rearraignment shows that the waiver was knowing and voluntary, as Blanco-Gomez knew he had the right to appeal and that he was giving up that right in the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292 (5th Cir.1994). Because the plain language of the waiver provision applies to Blanco-Gomez\u2019s challenge to his sentence, we will enforce the waiver \u00aband DISMISS the appeal. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544, 546 (5th Cir.2005). The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED, its motion for summary affirmance is DENIED, and its alternative motion for an extension of time is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
