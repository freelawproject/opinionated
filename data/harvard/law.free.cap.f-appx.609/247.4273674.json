He argues that the district court erred by applying a 16-level enhancement for his being removed following a conviction for a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence was greater than 13 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-21\">Villatoro\u2019s sentence has expired, and he has been released. Accordingly, the appeal of his sentence is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Ramon, </em>320 F.3d 519, 519-20 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-22\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
