He appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissing his habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. For the reasons that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>follow, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In 2004, after a federal jury trial in the Southern District of New York, Snype was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit bank robbery (18 U.S.C. '\u00a7\u00a7 371, 2113). The sentencing court imposed a mandatory life sentence under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, commonly known as the \u201cthree strikes law\u201d (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)). The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the conviction and sentence. In its affirmance, the Second Circuit reviewed the application of \u00a7 3559(c), which was based on Snype\u2019s three prior robbery convictions in New York State. <em>See United States v. Snype, </em>441 F.3d 119, 144-45 (2d Cir.2006). In 2007, Snype filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Among other things, Snype claimed that counsel was ineffective in failing to contest the applicability of \u00a7 3559(c) as to his prior convictions. In 2009, the sentencing court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion on the merits, noting that counsel did raise the sentencing issue on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Several years later, in February 2014, Snype filed a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition in the District Court, claiming that his sentence was improperly enhanced based on prior state convictions. In April 2014, the District Court dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction, noting that the dismissal was without prejudice to Snype requesting leave from the Second Circuit to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Ultimately, the Second Circuit denied Snype\u2019s request because none of the claims he raised met the \u00a7 2255(h) standard for authorizing the filing of a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Snype then returned to the District Court and filed another \u00a7 2241 habeas petition, again challenging the application of the sentence enhancement on the basis of his prior state convictions. Specifically, Snype noted that his state court prior convictions occurred more than twenty years before his federal offense, and that they are no longer considered to be prior convictions for purposes of New York state law. Thus, he argued that his federal sentence was erroneously enhanced on the basis of those prior convictions. The District Court dismissed Snype\u2019s habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction, explaining that Snype\u2019s inability to meet \u00a7 2255\u2019s gatek-eeping requirements for filing a second or successive motion did not allow him to evade those requirements by pursuing relief under \u00a7 2241.-</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Snype appeals. Upon notification that this appeal would be submitted for possible dismissal or summary action, Snype submitted a response in support of his appeal. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to any factual findings. <em>Cradle v. United States, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">A \u00a7 2255 motion filed in the sentencing court is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge the validity of a conviction or sentence. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974); <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). A petitioner can seek habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 only if the remedy provided by section 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249-51 (3d Cir.1997). As explained by the District Court, a \u00a7 2255 motion is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d merely because the petitioner cannot meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255, <em>Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120, or because the sentencing court does not grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>relief, <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.Bd at 539. Rather, the \u201csafety valve\u201d provided under \u00a7 2255 is extremely narrow and has been held to apply in unusual situations, such as those in which a prisoner has had no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime later deemed to be non-criminal by an intervening change in law. <em>See Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120 <em>(citing In re Dorsain-vil, </em>119 F.3d at 251).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">In his submission to this Court, Snype maintains that, under a procedural default analysis, his circumstances allow him to proceed with his habeas petition. He argues that he meets the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d standard for excusing procedural default in light of counsel\u2019s deficient performance at sentencing, that he is actually innocent of the enhanced sentencing provision of \u00a7 3559(c), and that failure to address his claim would result in a miscarriage of justice. Despite Snype\u2019s assertions to the contrary, these arguments have no bearing on the issue of whether \u00a7 2255 is an inadequate or ineffective remedy for addressing Snype\u2019s sentencing claim, and whether the District Court correctly dismissed Snype\u2019s \u00a7 2241 habe-as petition for lack of jurisdiction. In order to pursue his sentencing claim via \u00a7 2241, Snype must show that the inadequacy of \u00a7 2255 relief involves a limitation of scope or procedure preventing a full adjudication of the wrongful detention claims. <em>See, e.g., Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538. \u201cIt is the inefficacy of the [\u00a7 2255] remedy, not the personal inability to use it, that is determinative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Snype\u2019s dissatisfaction with counsel\u2019s performance at sentencing does not render the \u00a7 2255 remedy inadequate or ineffective for purposes of pursuing \u00a7 2241 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">For the above reasons, the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Snype\u2019s \u00a7 2241 habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction was appropriate. We have considered Snype\u2019s arguments and the record and find that no substantial question is presented. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b88-7\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
