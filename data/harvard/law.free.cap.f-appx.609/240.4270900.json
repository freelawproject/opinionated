While in the United States, Xiao incorporated Appellant JS Multi-Trading, a subsidiary of JS Multi-Trading, CC, \u201cfor the purpose of exporting domestic and foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>auto parts to Africa and operat[ing] as a full-featured retail auto-parts store.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 23, 2011, Appellant JS Multi-Trading filed a petition to classify Xiao as an L-1A nonimmigrant intracompany transferee. The USCIS denied Appellants\u2019 petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellants appealed the decision of the USCIS to the AAO, which dismissed their appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Appellants then filed this suit in federal district court, asking the court to vacate the judgment of the AAO and grant their petition for an Ll-A visa. The case was assigned to a magistrate judge, who offered a plain description of the facts and law and recommended that summary judgment be granted in favor of Appellees. The district court adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge, granted Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and denied Appellants\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment. We AFFIRM for essentially the reasons stated in the careful report of the magistrate judge adopted by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b268-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
