For the first time on appeal, he contends that the district court plainly erred in imposing a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on his 2001 District of Columbia conviction for distribution of a controlled substance in a drug-free zone because the statute of conviction, District of Columbia Code \u00a7\u00a7 33 \u2014 541(a)(1), 33-547.1 (1999), does not require proof of commercial activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-21\">This argument is foreclosed by our recent holdings in <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>782 F.3d 198, 204-05 (5th Cir.2015), and <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Bernal, </em>783 F.3d 1002, 1003, 1008 (5th Cir.2015). Accordingly, Ramos-Sorto has shown no clear or obvious error with regard to his sentence. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
