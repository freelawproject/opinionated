He contends that the district court erroneously applied a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)\u00a9 based on his prior Pennsylvania conviction of manufacturing, delivering, or possessing with the intent to manufacture or deliver cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-20\">De La Cruz first argues that the Pennsylvania statutory provision under which he was convicted does not constitute a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2 because it criminalizes the distribution of cocaine without remuneration. We recently rejected the same argument in <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>782 F.3d 198, 204-05 (5th Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-21\">De La Cruz also argues that Pennsylvania delivery does not qualify as a \u00a7 2L1.2 drug trafficking offense because a conviction under the state statute could rest upon administering a narcotic, an act not included in the Guidelines offense. In <em>United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 460 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1892, 191 L.Ed.2d 767 (2015), we required \u201ca realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.\u201d De La Cruz argues only that the available state documents do not preclude the possibility that his conviction was for administering or possessing with the intent to administer. He presents no situation in a case or his own case in which Pennsylvania courts have construed the Pennsylvania statute in such a way. As in <em>Teran-Salas, </em>this theoretical possibility is insufficient to show error in the application of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)\u00a9 enhancement. <em>See Ter-an-Salas, </em>767 F.3d at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
