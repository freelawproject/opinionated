BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">A federal grand jury charged Porter and others in an eleven-count superseding indictment. Porter was charged with (1) dealing in firearms without a license, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(1)(A) (Count 1); (2) knowingly possessing and selling a stolen firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(j) and 924(a)(2) (Count 9); being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e) (Count 10); and possessing with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D) (Count 11). Porter ultimately pled guilty to Counts 1, 9, and 10, without a plea agreement. Count 11 was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">At Porter\u2019s change-of-plea proceeding, the government summarized the charges against him, proffered what it would prove if the case proceeded to trial, and explained Porter could be subject to an ACCA-enhaneed sentence as to Count 10, because he had several prior felony convictions for crimes involving drugs and violence. After the government\u2019s proffer, Porter explained to the district judge he did not believe he was an armed-career criminal. The judge then asked defense counsel to address the issue of the ACCA enhancement. Defense counsel responded the ACCA\u2019s application was an issue that should be argued during sentencing. The judge asked Porter directly if he was comfortable reserving that issue until the sentencing proceeding; he responded he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-13\">During the change-of-plea proceeding, the government contended Porter was an armed-career criminal as to Count 10 for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Consequently, the government explained Porter would be subject to a mandatory-minimum-prison term of 15 years and a maximum-prison term of life. If the judge found the ACCA applied, she explained she would be obligated to impose a minimum 15-year-prison sentence; Porter stated he understood. Upon inquiry, Porter stated he understood everything and did not need to discuss anything further with the judge or his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-14\">Porter\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) stated the ACCA applied to him. Porter objected to the application of the ACCA and argued his prior convictions could not serve as the basis for an ACCA enhancement. At the sentencing hearing, the judge overruled Porter\u2019s objection and applied the ACCA, because Porter\u2019s prior convictions qualified as predicate offenses for ACCA purposes. Based on Porter\u2019s criminal history, ACCA status, and total-offense level, his Sentencing Guidelines range was 210 to 262 months of imprisonment. Nevertheless, the judge concluded that a total sentence of 15 years of imprisonment (180 months) was reasonable and sentenced him to that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-15\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-16\">A. <em>Invited Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-17\">On appeal, Porter argues his plea was not knowingly and intelligently made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>because, when he pled guilty, there was not yet a determination whether his prior convictions would subject him to an ACCA-enhaneed sentence. Where a party induces or invites a district judge to make an error, the doctrine of invited error applies, and we are precluded from reviewing that error on appeal. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>443 F.3d 822, 823-24 (11th Cir. 2006). In <em>Harris, </em>the parties jointly recommended an 80-month sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 823. The district judge asked the defendant if he was waiving his right to a PSI, and he answered affirmatively. <em>Id. </em>The judge accepted the recommended sentence. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the defendant argued he did not waive his right to a PSI, and the judge improperly sentenced him without one. <em>Id. </em>We noted the district judge failed to satisfy Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(l)(A)(ii) by failing to find the information in the record enabled a meaningful exercise of sentencing authority. Nonetheless, we determined the doctrine of invited error applied, because the defendant affirmatively waived the PSI and, consequently, induced any error that may have arisen. <em>Id. </em>at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">The doctrine of invited error precludes Porter from raising this issue on appeal, because he induced any error the district judge allegedly committed. <em>See id. </em>at 823-24. At the plea colloquy, the judge asked Porter\u2019s attorney to address the issue of his armed-career-criminal status; defense counsel responded it was an issue to be addressed at sentencing. The district judge then asked Porter directly if he was comfortable reserving the issue for sentencing; Porter stated he was. Like the defendant in <em>Harris, </em>who invited any Rule 32(c)(l)(A)(ii) error by affirmatively waiving a PSI, Porter invited any error by asking the court to accept his guilty plea and resolve the ACCA issue at sentencing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">B. <em>Constitutional Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">Porter argues for the first time on appeal the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the United States Constitution, because it allows for the imposition of mandatory-minimum sentences, based upon alleged prior convictions not included in the indictment, admitted by the defendant, or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Porter acknowledges the Supreme Court case of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), where the Court recognized that prior convictions need not be charged in an indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, he argues <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is inconsistent with the more recent opinion in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), under which facts that increase the minimum penalty of an offense were held to be elements of the offense that must be decided by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">We normally review constitutional sentencing issues de novo; however, we review for plain error, where a defendant fails to raise an objection before the district judge at sentencing. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>741 F.3d 1245, 1248 (11th Cir.2014). The Supreme Court in <em>Alleyne </em>was careful to note that its holding did not disturb the rule in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>that prior convictions need not be submitted to a jury. <em>See Alleyne, </em>564 U.S. at -, 133 S.Ct. at 2160 n. 1. We additionally have held that it is constitutionally permissible for a district judge to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence and impose a mandatory-minimum \u25a0 sentence, based on prior convictions that were not found by the jury. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2014) <em>(\u2018Alleyne </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments do not limit the use of [the defendant\u2019s] prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>convictions.\u201d); <em>Harris, </em>741 F.3d at 1249. In <em>Harris, </em>we addressed the issue directly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASA\">As this discussion indicates, <em>Alleyne </em>did not address the specific question at issue in this case, which is whether a sentence can be increased because of prior convictions without a jury finding the fact of those convictions. That question continues to be governed by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>... where the [Supreme] Court determined that the fact of a prior conviction is not an \u2018element\u2019 that must be found by a jury. Indeed, the <em>Alleyne </em>Court specifically recognized that, under <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>prior convictions are excepted from the general rule that a jury must find any fact that will increase the penalty for an offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\"><em>Harris, </em>741 F.3d at 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">Porter\u2019s argument regarding this issue is foreclosed by Supreme Court and circuit precedent. He does not dispute on appeal the fact of his prior convictions or that they could have served as predicate felonies for an ACCA enhancement. Instead, he argues <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is inconsistent with the Court\u2019s more recent <em>Alleyne </em>decision, which is a misreading of <em>Alleyne. </em>In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Court explicitly stated its decision did not disturb the \u201cnarrow exception ... for the fact of a prior conviction,\u201d recognized in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>to the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that \u201cfacts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed are elements of the crime\u201d that must be proved to a jury. <em>See Alleyne, </em>564 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. at 2160 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1 (quotation omitted); <em>see also Harris, </em>741 F.3d at 1249. Contrary to Porter\u2019s argument, <em>Alleyne </em>and <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>are consistent. He has failed to show \u00a7 924(e) is unconstitutional by allowing a district judge to impose a mandatory-minimum sentence by relying on prior convictions he did not admit and the government did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Smith, </em>775 F.3d at 1266. Therefore, we affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1037-11\">.
