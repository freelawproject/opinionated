He argues that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on a determination that he had been deported after being convicted of a drug trafficking offense. According to Alegria-Mera, his two Texas convictions for delivering a controlled substance do not qualify as drug trafficking offenses because, he urges, the definition of delivery under Texas law includes illegally administering a drug, but the definition in the Guidelines does not. Because he did not object to the enhancement in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In <em>United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 460-62 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1892, 191 L.Ed.2d 767 (2015), we rejected a substantially similar argument, explaining that there was no realistic probability that the defendant had been convicted under a theory involving administering a controlled substance in light of the nature of his conduct and observing that we could find no Texas case involving a conviction for illegally administering drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 460-61. Likewise, Alegria-Mera has not established a realistic probability that he was prosecuted for administering drugs. The state court judgments reveal that the conduct Alegria-Mera admitted did not involve administering: he was convicted first of \u201cdelivering] by offer to sell\u201d less than 28 grams of cocaine and later of \u201cdelivering] by actual transfer\u201d at least 400 grams of cocaine. Moreover, Alegria-Mera has pointed to no case where a Texas defendant was prosecuted for unlawfully administering a controlled substance. He has established no error, plain or otherwise, and accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
