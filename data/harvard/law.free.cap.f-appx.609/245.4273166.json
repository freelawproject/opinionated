Toole brings suit against numerous defendants, alleging that the Department of Veterans Affairs failed to pay benefits to her and her children. The district court dismissed the suit. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-23\">Ms. Toole\u2019s late-husband, James L. Toole, served in the United States Army in the 1950s and was discharged after he was struck in the left ear with a rifle during training. After he died, Ms. Toole alleged that her husband\u2019s death was service-related. The Board of Veterans Appeals disagreed. Ms. Toole appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, which affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ms. Toole appealed to the Federal Circuit, which dismissed the appeal as it was required to do under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2) after finding that Ms. Toole raised only factual challenges to the decision below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ms. Toole subsequently filed six more lawsuits in different federal district courts challenging the agency\u2019s decision, all of which were dismissed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This case is the seventh. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>brought against President Obama, numerous federal judges, and several administrative officers of the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">All claims against the President of the United States in his official capacity were properly dismissed because he is absolutely immune from any damages stemming from official acts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All claims against the named federal judges arise from actions taken in their judicial capacities, and it is long-settled law that a judge is immune from liability from actions \u201ctaken in the judge\u2019s judicial capacity.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, this Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Board of Veterans Appeals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We affirm the dismissal of all claims brought against Veterans Affairs employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The district court dismissed the appeal as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). For the well-stated reasons of the court below, we agree. We affirm the district court in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We DISMISS THIS APPEAL AS FRIVOLOUS and AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
