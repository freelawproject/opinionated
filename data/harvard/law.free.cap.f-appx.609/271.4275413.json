HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b299-22\">Julian Espinoza pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to manufacture and distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine and/or 50 grams or more of methamphetamine (actual). He was sentenced at the bottom of the advisory guidelines range to 262 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. As his sole issue on appeal, Espinoza requests that this court remand his case for resen-tencing under Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The Government opposes Espinoza\u2019s request and moves for summary affirmance. In the alternative, the Government requests an extension of time to file a brief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-23\">Summary affirmance is proper where, among other instances, \u201cthe position of one of the parties is clearly right as a matter of law so that there can be no substantial question as to the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Holy Land Found. for Relief &amp; Dev., </em>445 F.3d 771, 781 (5th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Espinoza was sentenced on July 8, 2014. The district court correctly used the Guidelines in effect at the time of Espinoza\u2019s sentencing. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>596 F.3d 284, 286 (5th Cir.2010). Amendment 782, however, which amended the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e) and effectively lowered most drug-related base-offense levels by two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>levels, became effective on November 1, 2014. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., App. C., Amend. 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Espinoza may seek a reduction in his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), to become effective on November 1, 2015, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 788; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(e)(l), but he cannot obtain relief on direct appeal, <em>see Martin, </em>596 F.3d at 286; <em>see also United States v. Moreno, </em>598 Fed.Appx. 261, 263 (5th Cir.2015) (per cu-riam). Although Espinoza attempts to distinguish <em>Martin </em>on the basis that he is not seeking a full resentencing hearing, <em>Martin </em>still stands for the proposition that a \u201cdistrict court is to sentence under the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing.\u201d 596 F.3d at 286. Moreover, once an amendment to a guideline takes effect retroactively, the \u201cproper mechanism\u201d for requesting a sentencing reduction based on that amendment is \u201ca motion brought under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 880 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>903 F.2d 341, 349 (5th Cir.1990) (\u201c[U]nder section 3582(c)(2), [the defendant] must first file his motion for modification of his sen tence with the district court.\u201d). It is ultimately the district court, not this court, that has the discretion to determine whether to grant a reduction. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">For the reasons stated above, Espinoza\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED, and the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for extension of time to file an Appellee\u2019s brief is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
