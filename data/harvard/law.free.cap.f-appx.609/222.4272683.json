Murphy, Texas prisoner # 1372192, appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit against remaining defendants Barry S. Andrews and Sherman Cooper following a jury trial. He asserts that (1) Andrews, Cooper, and other defense witnesses perjured themselves and misled the jury; (2) the district court improperly prevented him from cross-examining Andrews and Cooper regarding inconsistent statements that they made in their affidavits; (3) the State improperly prevented him from obtaining sworn declarations from unidentified individuals and from calling unspecified witnesses at trial by making them unavailable; (4) the district court improperly denied him an opportunity to thoroughly cross-examine the defendants\u2019 witnesses; (5) the activity logs to which the State\u2019s attorney referred during his cross-examination of Murphy were fabricated, and Murphy had not been previously notified of the defense\u2019s intent to rely upon them; (6) the cell door photograph to which the State\u2019s attorney attempted to refer during cross-examination of witness Bradius Davis was prejudicial and irrelevant; and (7) Davis and Murphy were purposely transported in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>van so that aspersions could be cast on Davis\u2019s credibility by suggesting that Davis and Murphy fabricated Davis\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Through his perjury argument, Murphy seeks, at base, for this court to overturn the jury\u2019s credibility determinations; however, such determinations are the jury\u2019s province, not ours. <em>See Martin v. Thomas, </em>973 F.2d 449, 453 (5th Cir.1992). Murphy\u2019s remaining arguments, which are devoid of citations to the record or supporting case law, are insufficient. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993) (holding that even pro se litigants must brief arguments to preserve them). In any event, they are not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court and DENT Murphy\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b250-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
