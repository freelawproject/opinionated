After review, we vacate and remand for further consideration consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">In <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>this Court instructed district courts to resolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for writ of habeas corpus prior to granting or denying relief. 960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc) (involving state prisoner\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition); <em>se</em>e <em>Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1291-92 (11th Cir. 2009) (applying <em>Clisby </em>to a federal prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion). If the district court does not address all claims prior to issuing judgment, this Court \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">Burgess argues, and the government concedes, that the district court failed to address a number of ineffeetive-assistance-of-counsel claims raised in his counseled amended \u00a7 2255 motion filed on May 10, 2013. We agree that the district court failed to address Burgess\u2019s constitutional claims that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to (1) advise Burgess that he could plead guilty without a plea agreement (\u201cGround I.E\u201d), (2) research and advise Burgess about the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cGround I.G\u201d), (3) object to the presentence investigation report\u2019s assessing criminal history points for two prior offenses for which Burgess was \u201cnever lawfully arrested\u201d (\u201cGround I.L\u201d), and (4) argue at sentencing that Burgess\u2019s criminal history category overrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history (\u201cGround IV\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">As to the first two claims listed above, the government argues that the district court considered the claims \u201cindirectly\u201d because the court addressed the factual bases supporting these claims in resolving other claims. However, even assuming that the district court made some findings arguably relevant to these claims, the district court never identified these as claims raised by Burgess, resolved the ultimate issue of whether counsel was ineffective, or otherwise disposed of the claims on timeliness or other procedural grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">The government also contends that the <em>Clisby </em>violation was \u201charmless\u201d because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the unaddressed claims were \u201cpatently without merit.\u201d We decline the government\u2019s invitation to consider the merits of the unaddressed claims. Under <em>Clisby, </em>our role is to vacate the judgment \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d and remand to the district court for consideration of the unaddressed claims in the first instance. <em>See Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 938 (noting that we will vacate and remand <em>\u201cwhenever </em>the district court has not resolved all such claims\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment without prejudice and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, including, but not limited to, a consideration of the timeliness of the unaddressed claims under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. We express no opinion as to the merits, or the timeliness, of the unaddressed claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-9\">. We recognize that the certificate of appeala-bility (\u201cCOA\u201d) in this case \u2014 granted on whether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc), by failing to address several \"federal constitutional claims\u201d raised by Burgess \u2014 does not expressly identify the constitutional claims for which Burgess has satisfied the standard of making \"a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), (c)(3); <em>Spencer v. United States, </em>773 F.3d 1132, 1137-38 (11th Cir.2014) (en banc). However, the government has not raised the issue of a potentially defective COA. Although we could <em>sua sponte </em>raise the defective COA issue, we exercise our discretion not to do so because, under the totality of the circumstances of this particular case, the COA sufficiently indicates that Burgess made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right with the claims raised in his May 2013 amended \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-16\">. Burgess filed his initial \u00a7 2255 motion <em>pro se, </em>but the district court appointed him counsel when it granted him an evidentiary hearing. Burgess moved to discharge his counsel on appeal, and this Court granted the motion. That is how he became <em>pro se </em>on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
