(\u201cLowe\u2019s\u201d) in his employment-discrimination suit brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>In denying Suber\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion, the district court concluded that it was \u201cboth untimely and without merit.\u201d Lowe\u2019s thereafter moved this court to dismiss Suber\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. To the extent that S\u00faber was appealing the summary judgment, we granted Lowe\u2019s motion in part because Suber\u2019s untimely Rule 59(e) motion did not toll the time period for appealing the summary judgment but we allowed Suber\u2019s appeal.to go forward with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for-reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">S\u00faber now raises a variety of arguments concerning the merits of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. He does not, however, offer any arguments addressing the denial of his motion for reconsideration as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">The courts of appeals have jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions of the district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. When the United States is not a party, a notice of appeal in a civil case \u201cmust be filed with the district court clerk within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). A post-judgment proceeding is viewed as a freestanding litigation, \u201cin effect treating the final judgment as the first rather than the last order in the case.\u201d <em>Mayer v. Wall St. Equity Grp., Inc., </em>672 F.3d 1222, 1224 (11th Cir.2012). When a district court lacks jurisdiction, we have jurisdiction on appeal for the sole purpose of determining whether that court erred in entertaining the suit. <em>Boyd v. Homes of Legend, Inc., </em>188 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cmust be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). This time limit for filing a Rule 59(e) motion is a claims-processing rule, not a jurisdictional rule, because it \u201cis not grounded in a statutory requirement.\u201d <em>See Advanced Bodycare Solutions, LLC v. Thione Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>615 F.3d 1352, 1359 n. 15 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b)(2), which prohibits a district court from extending the time for filing motions under Rule 59, is a claims-processing rule rather than a jurisdictional one because \u201cit is not grounded in a statutory requirement\u201d). A party can forfeit an objection to a court\u2019s failure to apply a claims-processing rule against its adversary. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Advanced Bodycare Solutions, LLC, </em>even though the district court improperly granted an extension to file a Rule 59(e) motion, it still \u201chad the authority to entertain\u201d the untimely motion because the other party had failed to object to the time extension, thereby forfeiting any objection. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Suber\u2019s motion for reconsideration because the motion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>untimely. Specifically, the district court entered judgment for Lowe\u2019s on December 20, 2013, but S\u00faber did not file his Rule 59(e) motion until 32 days later, on January 17, 2014. This exceeded the 28-day deadline for filing a Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
