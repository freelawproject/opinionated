Malloy asserts the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because he did not meet the \u201cin custody\u201d definition of \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">We review <em>de novo a </em>district court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>396 F.3d 1322, 1327 (11th Cir.2005). To bring a federal habeas action, a petitioner must be \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3). The Supreme Court has interpreted \u00a7 2241 as requiring that a habeas petitioner be \u201cin custody\u201d under the conviction or sentence that he seeks to attack at the time when his petition is filed. <em>Carafas v. LaVallee, </em>391 U.S. 234, 238, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968). The Supreme Court has also recognized habeas actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 2241 may be appropriate where \u201cmembers of the armed services ... have been unlawfully detained, restrained, or confined\u201d by the military. <em>Schlanger v. Seamans, </em>401 U.S. 487, 489, 91 S.Ct. 995, 28 L.Ed.2d 251 (1971). Although a petitioner can challenge his other than honorable discharge from the military in district court and seek declaratory judgment, \u00a7 2241 is not the proper vehicle for bringing such a claim. <em>See Harmon v. Brucker, </em>355 U.S. 579, 580-83, 78 S.Ct. 433, 2 L.Ed.2d 503 (1958) (finding the district court had jurisdiction to review petitioners\u2019 actions seeking declaratory judgments that the Secretary of Army\u2019s issuance of other than honorable discharge certificates were void and in excess of his powers).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">The district court did not err in dismissing Malloy\u2019s claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Malloy is not challenging his conviction or sentence related to his confinement in Alabama state prison, and he is not detained, restrained, or confined by the military. Thus, he does not meet the \u201cin custody\u201d definition of \u00a7 2241. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
