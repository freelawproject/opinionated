This court granted a certificate of appealability on one issue: \u201c[wjhether the district court erred in dismissing Aureoles\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-20\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred. Dam<em>ren v. Florida, </em>776 F.3d 816, 820 (11th Cir.2015). We also review de novo the denial of equitable tolling. <em>Chavez v. Sec\u2019y Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>647 F.3d 1057, 1060 (11th Cir.2011). We review the district court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error. <em>Damren, </em>776 F.3d at 820. As in other civil matters, a harmless error in a judgment on a \u00a7 2254 petition, which does not affect a party\u2019s substantial rights, is not a basis for vacating or modifying the judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-21\">A district court may consider the timeliness of a state prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition sua sponte. <em>Day v. McDonough, </em>547 U.S. 198, 209, 126 S.Ct. 1675, 1684, 164 L.Ed.2d 376 (2006). If the district court considers the timeliness of the petition sua sponte, it must give the parties \u201cfair notice and an opportunity to present their positions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210, 126 S.Ct. at 1684 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-22\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 established a one-year statute of limitations period for petitions filed under \u00a7 2254, which begins running, as pertinent here, on the date on which the judgment became final. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). The one-year limitations period is statutorily tolled during the time that a \u201cproperly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(2). However, a state petition does not revive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>limitations period if the petition is filed after the limitations period has expired. <em>Moore v. Crosby, </em>321 F.3d 1377, 1381 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">If a prisoner files his \u00a7 2254 petition more than one year after the judgment becomes final, the petition may still be timely if the petitioner is entitled to equitable tolling. <em>Damren, </em>776 F.3d at 821. A petitioner is entitled to equitable tolling if he can demonstrate that: (1) he has pursued his rights diligently; and (2) an extraordinary circumstance prevented him from filing a timely petition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The district court erred by dismissing Aureoles\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition sua sponte as time-barred before granting him fair notice and an opportunity to respond. <em>Day, </em>547 U.S. at 209-10, 126 S.Ct. at 1684. Nevertheless, the court considered Aureoles\u2019s arguments for equitable tolling on their merits when it reviewed his motion for a certificate of appealability, and it did not err in concluding that Aureoles filed'an untimely petition. Aureoles\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was filed after the one-year statute of limitations expired because more than one year elapsed between the date on which his convictions became final and the date on which he filed his first state post-conviction motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Aureoles presented no extraordinary circumstances that justified equitable tolling. His allegations of an inability to understand English and a lack of formal education did not establish extraordinary circumstances that warranted equitable tolling. <em>Rivers v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Montano, </em>398 F.3d 1276, 1280 n. 5 (11th Cir.2005). His claim that he received misinformation from a law clerk did not establish an extraordinary circumstance, as we do not usually permit claims of misinformation to justify equitable tolling when a petitioner has been misinformed by an attorney. <em>Helton v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>259 F.3d 1310, 1313 (11th Cir.2001). Finally, Aureoles was not entitled to equitable tolling based on the prison\u2019s failure to provide him with Spanish-language legal materials. He was required to provide details about the steps he took to file a timely \u00a7 2254 petition and the steps he took to find out about the statute of limitations. <em>Arthur v. Allen, </em>452 F.3d 1234, 1253 (11th Cir.), <em>modified in part on other grounds on reh\u2019g, </em>459 F.3d 1310 (11th Cir.2006). He was also required to provide details about when he discovered the prison library\u2019s deficiency. <em>Id. </em>He did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Because Aureoles presented no grounds for equitable tolling, the district court did not err in concluding that his \u00a7 2254 petition was time-barred. And, the court\u2019s dismissal of the petition before providing Aureoles with fair notice and an opportunity to respond was harmless error. Therefore, we affirm the dismissal of Aureoles\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
