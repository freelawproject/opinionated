Mr. Hunter argues that the administrative law judge erred by failing to discuss his physicians\u2019 treatment notes and to afford the appropriate weight to his treating physician\u2019s medical opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">In July of 2010, Mr. Hunter applied for disability insurance benefits, claiming disability due to a back injury, loss of feeling in his right foot and part of his left foot, removal of a portion of his vertebra, and high blood pressure. He alleged a disability onset date of April 1, 2010, and indicated that he stopped working in June of 2010 due to these medical conditions. In a subsequent pain questionnaire, Mr. Hunter stated that he also suffered from pain in his left shoulder, a neurogenic bladder, bowel problems, weakness in his legs, and pain in his lower back down to his feet. The SSA denied his application. -</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Mr. Hunter requested a hearing before an administrative law judge. The administrative law judge denied his application for disability insurance benefits, finding that Mr. Hunter was not under a disability within the meaning of applicable statutes and regulations. The administrative law judge found that Mr. Hunter had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since April of 2010 and had the following severe impairments: (1) degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with peripheral neuro-pathy; (2) degenerative changes of the right foot; and (3) obesity. But the administrative law judge concluded that Mr. Hunter did not have an impairment (or combination thereof) that met or equaled the severity required in one of the listings of impairment found in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, Subpt. P., App. 1. Finally, the administrative law judge concluded that Mr. Hunter had the residual functional capacity to perform light work, with some physical limitations, including that Mr. Hunter needed appropriate access to a restroom secondary to his neurogenic bladder. Mr. Hunter had performed past relevant work that did not exceed the physical demands of this category, including work as a substitute teacher and a benefits eligibility worker. Thus, he was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Mr. Hunter filed a complaint in the district court, arguing that the administrative law judge had erred by failing to consider the opinions of two of his' treating physicians, Dr. Charles Mark Homra, who treated him since 2005 for his neurogenic bladder, and Dr. Samuel Kulick, who treated him since 2007 for bilateral edema in his lower extremities. He also argued that the administrative law judge had failed to assign the appropriate residual function and that he should be classified as sedentary, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The parties consented to final disposition by a magistrate judge, who affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny Mr. Hunter benefits. The magistrate judge found that the administrative law judge did not specifically mention Mr. Hunter\u2019s doctors by name or specify the weight given to their opinions, but concluded that his doctors\u2019 notes did not support any additional limitations that would affect the vocational expert\u2019s testimony or the administrative law judge\u2019s decision. Further, even if the administrative law judge should have restricted Mr. Hunter to sedentary work, his prior employment as a benefits eligibility worker required only sedentary-level exertion. Mr. Hunter now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">In Social Security appeals, we review the administrative law judge\u2019s application of legal principles <em>de novo, </em>but \u201cthe resulting decision only to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>(llth Cir.1997). Thus, we may not decide the facts anew, make credibility determinations, or re-weigh the evidence. <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">A claimant must be under a disability to be eligible for disability insurance benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1). In relevant part, a claimant is under a disability if he is unable to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of a medically determinable impairment that can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). The claimant bears the burden to prove the disability, and is responsible for producing evidence in support of the claim. <em>See Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">To determine whether a claimant is disabled, the SSA applies a five-step sequential evaluation. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a). Under the first step, the claimant has the burden to show that he or she is not currently engaged in substantial gainful activity. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i). Under the second step, the claimant must show that he or she has a severe impairment or combination of impairments. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(h). Under the third step, the claimant has the opportunity to show that he or she has an impairment that meets or equals the criteria contained in one of the listings of impairment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii). Under the fourth step, if the claimant cannot meet or equal one the criteria in one of the Listings, the administrative law judge considers the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity and the claimant\u2019s past relevant work to determine if he or she has an impairment that prevents him or her from performing past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv). Under the fifth step, once a claimant establishes that he or she cannot perform past relevant work due to some severe impairment, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to show that significant numbers of jobs exist in the national economy that the claimant is able to perform. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">\u201c \u2018Medical opinions are statements from physicians and psychologists or other acceptable medical sources that reflect judgments about the nature and severity of [the claimant\u2019s] impairment(s), including [the claimant\u2019s] symptoms, diagnosis and prognosis, what [the claimant] can still do despite impairment(s), and [the claimant\u2019s] physical or mental restrictions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2011) (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(a)(2) &amp; 416.927(a)(2)) (alterations in original opinion). We have held that the medical opinions of a treating physician must be given \u201csubstantial or considerable weight\u201d unless \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown to the contrary. <em>Id. </em>at 1179. <em>See also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2) (providing, among other things, that the Social Security Administration gives more weight to the opinion of a treating physician). We have found good cause to exist where the doctor\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence, the evidence supported a contrary finding, or the doctor\u2019s opinion was conclu-sory or inconsistent with his or her own medical records. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">In addition, \u201c[t]he [administrative law judge] must state with particularity the weight given to different medical opinions and the reasons therefore].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]here is no rigid requirement,\u201d however, \u201cthat the [administrative law judge] specifically refer to every piece of evidence in his [or her] decision,\u201d so long as the decision is not \u201ca broad rejection\u201d that leaves the district court or this Court with insufficient information to conclude whether the administrative law judge considered the claimant\u2019s medical condition as a whole. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). When the administrative law judge\u2019s articulated reasons for assigning limited weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion are supported by substantial evidence, there is no reversible error. <em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1212. To the extent that an administrative law judge commits an error, the error is harmless if it did not affect the judge\u2019s ultimate determination. <em>See Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1983) (applying the harmless error doctrine in a Social Security appeal after finding that an administrative law judge made \u201cerroneous statements of fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Mr. Hunter has failed to demonstrate reversible error. First, although the administrative law judge did not specifically identify Mr. Hunter\u2019s treating physicians by name, the judge summarized Drs. Homra\u2019s and Kulick\u2019s treatment notes. The administrative law judge noted that Mr. Hunter\u2019s neurogenic bladder was mild and that he did not have to wear protective undergarments on a regular basis. This finding is supported by the record, as several of Dr. Homra\u2019s notes indicated that Mr. Hunter\u2019s condition was mild or that he was not incontinent. Further, Mr. Hunter did not wear protective undergarments to an independent medical examination (held in an unrelated worker\u2019s compensation matter) in July of 2010. The record is, at best, inconsistent about Mr. Hunter\u2019s need for protective undergarments or medicine to manage any incontinence issues, but substantial evidence exists to support the administrative law judge\u2019s findings on this point. The same holds true for Mr. Hunter\u2019s claim regarding Dr. Kulick\u2019s treatment for numbness in his right foot, edema, and peripheral neuropathy with foot drop, as the administrative law judge specifically noted these symptoms. Thus, the order demonstrates that the administrative law judge considered Mr. Hunter\u2019s medical condition as a whole. <em>See Dyer, </em>395 F.3d at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Moreover, Drs. Homra and Kuliek did not offer opinions as to how Mr. Hunter\u2019s medical conditions would impact his ability to perform his past relevant work. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1178-79. Conversely, the doctors upon whom the administrative law judge expressly relied specifically opined as to Mr. Hunter\u2019s work-related abilities in light of the existing medical conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">To the extent that the administrative law judge erred by failing to state with particularity the weight assigned to Drs. Homra\u2019s and Kulick\u2019s medical opinions, the error is harmless because it did not affect the administrative law judge\u2019s ultimate determination. <em>See Dyer, </em>395 F.3d at 1211. Substantial evidence supports the administrative law judge\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Hunter was not under a disability, as the medical records and expert testimony demonstrated that, despite his medical conditions, Mr. Hunter was still capable of performing his past relevant work. <em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211. One of Mr. Hunter\u2019s prior jobs \u2014 a benefits eligibility worker \u2014 is classified as sedentary skilled work. Mr. Hunter has not argued on appeal how his residual functional capacity is more limited than performing this prior job. Thus, Mr. Hunter is not disabled as defined in the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Upon review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
