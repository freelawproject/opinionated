Marquez-Apodaca challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that his sentence is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In support of his argument, he challenges the application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the illegal reentry guideline, in calculating his guidelines range, asserting that the guideline double counts his prior conviction and overstates the seriousness of his offense, which he asserts is an \u201cinternational trespass.\u201d Also, Marquez-Apodaca contends that the district court failed to account for his personal circumstances and the circumstances of this offense. Specifically, he notes that he returned to the United States to earn income for his family in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Although Marquez-Apodaca challenges the application of the presumption of reasonableness as applied to his within-guidelines sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2, he acknowledges that the issue is foreclosed and raises it only to preserve it for possible future review. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-367 (5th Cir.2009). We have rejected Marquez-Apodaca\u2019s \u201cdouble counting\u201d argument. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.2009). Similarly, we have rejected the argument that the Guidelines overstate the seriousness of illegal reentry because it is simply an international trespass. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The district court considered Marquez-Apodaca\u2019s arguments for a sentence below the guidelines range but found that a sentence within the guidelines range was appropriate. His contention regarding his benign motive does not rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
