August 5, 1903, appellee filed a bill and subsequently a supplemental bill against appellants to restrain them from collecting water rates from appellee, and cutting off the water from its premises, etc. Appellants answered the bill and supplemental bill, and such proceedings were had that the court rendered a decree sustaining the bill and supplemental bill and restraining appellants as prayed. The appeal is from this decree. The appellee, the University of Chicago, owns quite a large connected body of land in the city, on which are situated numerous buildings claimed by appellee to be used for the educational purposes of the University. May 19, 1902, the. City of Chicago adopted an ordinance amendatory of the rules and regulations prescribed by the department of public works of the city, which ordinance went into force in the year 1902, and section 24 of which is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-5\" pgmap=\"378\">\u201cThe commissioner of public works is hereby directed and instructed to remit and cancel all water taxes and rates heretofore levied and assessed, or which may hereafter be levied or assessed against such property of any charitable, religious or educational institution within the city of Chicago as is used in the immediate conduct and carrying on of the charitable, religious or educational purposes of such institution; provided the commissioner \u2022 of public works may require every applicant for a rebate or remission of said water rates or taxes to be verified by an affidavit of one or more taxpayers of the city of Chicago.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-6\" pgmap=\"378\">This section remained in force till March, 1905, when the city adopted a revised code of the city ordinances, sectipn 2402 of which is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-7\" pgmap=\"378\">\u201cExemption\u2014Charitable, religious and educational institutions.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-8\" pgmap=\"378(43) 379(44)\">\u201cThe commissioner of public works shall remit and cancel all water rates and charges heretofore levied and assessed, or which may hereafter be levied and assessed against. such property of any charitable, religious or educational institution in the city as is used in the immediate conduct and carrying on of the charitable, religious or educational purposes of such institution, and which is not used for gain or profit, or rented, conducted, maintained or oper\u00e1ted for the purpose of producing revenue for such institution.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-4\" pgmap=\"379\">The supplemental bill sets up this section 2402, it having been passed after the filing of the original bill. Section 2402 of the municipal code is substantially the same as section 24 above quoted, except that section 2402 concludes with the words \u201cand which is not for gain or profit, or rented, conducted, maintained or operated for the purpose of producing revenue for such institution.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-5\" pgmap=\"379\">It is averred in the original bill and admitted in the answer, that appellee is incorporated under the general incorporation law, chapter 32 of the Revised Statutes, for the purpose Of maintaining and conducting an institution of learning, but not for private gain or profit.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-6\" pgmap=\"379\">The only error assigned is that the court erred in rendering a decree in favor of the defendant. The decree commences by finding, generally, that all the material allegations of the bill and supplemental bill have been fully proved, and then finds that the City of Chicago owns and operates an extensive water works plant, for supplying water to the people and institutions of the city; that the city, May 19, 1902, passed section 26, above quoted, quoting the section, and that the same was in full force and effect until March, 1905, when the city passed section 2402 of the municipal code, quoting the section as heretofore quoted; and finding that, under and in accordance with said sections, the city is not accustomed to collect, and does not collect, from other educational institutions within the city, any charges for water used upon property employed in the immediate conduct of their purposes, and has remitted all such charges for water to other educational institutions than complainant. The decree then proceeds as follows:</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-3\" pgmap=\"380\">\u201cThe claimant, The University of Chicago, hereafter referred to as \u2018the University,\u2019 is a corporation created and existing under the general incorporation act \u00f3f the State of Illinois, commonly known as chapter 32 of the revised statutes of said state, for the purpose of maintaining and conducting an educational institution, but not for private gain or profit; said complainant was incorporated for the purpose of and ever since its incorporation has been and is now maintaining and carrying on such an educational institution commonly known as a University. The campus of this University is situated within the city upon the blocks bounded by Fifty-seventh and Fifty-ninth streets and Madison avenue on the east, and Cottage Grove avenue on the west, also the blocks bounded by Fifty-sixth and Fifty-seventh streets and- Lexington avenue on the east, and Ellis avenue on the west. The ground in this campus is all owned in fee simple by the complainant, and the main buildings of the institution are located upon it. It forms one connected body of land.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-4\" pgmap=\"380(153) 381(119)\">That complainant\u2019s educational institution has be-' come very expensive, there being commonly in attendance thereupon students to the number of about five thousand (5,000). That about twenty-nine per cent, of said students are residents of the city. The premises and buildings against which the water taxes and rates in question are levied are all owned by complainant in fee simple, are all used by complainant in the immediate conduct and carrying on of its said educational institution, and are all situated within said University campus. The University of Chicago and also like institutions throughout the United States all customarily furnish dormitories and dining halls for the use of their students, and all have the residences of their presidents located near the main college buildings. The board of trustees and faculty and congregation of the University of Chicago (which are the bodies having charge of this University) have always considered it necessary for the proper carrying on of the University that the buildings against which the water taxes and rates in question in this suit are levied, be furnished for the students and be located together, and they also deem it advisable and for the best interests of the University and its students and' their mental, moral and physical training, that the students, so far as possible, live together in dormitories provided for them, and also take their meals in a common dining hall or room, hereinafter described and known as the \u2018 Commons. \u2019 All of the buildings in question are convenient for and are arranged for the proper carrying on of the institution.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-4\" pgmap=\"381\">That complainant\u2019s educational institution was created and established exclusively by voluntary contributions and endowments, and is not and has not been at any time conducted for private gain or profit, but solely and only for the improvement and education of its students. The cost of conducting so large an institution is very great, and in order to furnish a part of such cost, certahrfees and charges for tuition and room rent are collected from the students. Such fees and charges so collected from the students are wholly insufficient to pay the great cost of the institution, and each year it is necessary to solicit and procure from persons interested in education a very large amount of money to make up the difference between the cost of operating the institution and the aggregate of fees collected from the students. Said annual deficit between the cost of operating the institution and the amount paid by students exceed seven hundred thousand dollars.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-5\" pgmap=\"381\">That said city now insists that complainant owes and is in arrears to the city for over twenty-eight hundred dollars ($2,800) of water taxes and rates for water supplied to various of its buildings hereinafter described, the bills for which are attached to the bill of complaint herein.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-6\" pgmap=\"381(8) 382(118)\">That the city, through its said superintendent of\" water, and its agents, has threatened and now is threatening to cut off the water from said premises unless the said bills are paid at once. The cutting off of the water from said premises would cause the complainant very great loss and damages which would not be ascertainable or determinable at law, and which would be irretrievable, as alleged in paragraph 6 of the bill of complaint herein. The complainant, previous to the commencement of this suit, applied to the commissioner of public works of the city for a rebate of the water taxes and rates in question in this suit, its application being verified by the affidavits of one or more taxpayers of the city.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-5\" pgmap=\"382\">That complainant, owing to its rapid growth, has found it necessary to purchase a large amount of property whereon to erect in the future buildings necessary to its purposes. Among its purchases are a large number of buildings which are used for private purposes, and are at present rented out by complain-, ant to various tenants. Upon all of complainant\u2019s said properties which are so rented out, it has at all times paid all water taxes, in accordance with the ordinances of the city, and to the same extent as private owners, and there are no water taxes or water rates due from complainant to the city from any of said properties which are so, as aforesaid, rented out to other parties.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-6\" pgmap=\"382\">That the only premises and buildings against which the water taxes and rates in question in this suit have been levied are known and described, as hereafter' set forth, and are, respectively, used by the University in the manner and exclusively for the purposes hereinafter set forth, and are not used for gain or profit, or rented, conducted, maintained or operated for the purpose of producing revenue for complainant\u2019s educational institution.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-7\" pgmap=\"382\">CHARLES HITCHCOCK HALL.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-8\" pgmap=\"382(9) 383(43)\">This is a dormitory occupied by men students attending- the University, and for no other purpose.

The first proposition of counsel is, that \u201cit is not within the power of the city, by ordinance or otherwise, to give away its property.\u201d Three decisions of the Supreme Court are cited in support of the proposition, each of which relates to property owned by a municipality in its public capacity, exercising governmental powers within the municipal bounds, as the agent of the state. There is a well-settled distinction between the power of a municipal corporation, in respect to such property, and its power in respect to property which it owns in a quasi private capacity. 1 Dillon on Mun. Corp., 4th ed., section 27. In Board of Park Commissioners v. Common Council of Detroit, 28 Mich. 228, the court, Cooley, J., delivering the opinion, say: \u201cWe also referred in People v. Hurlbut to several decisions in the Federal Supreme Court, and elsewhere, to show that municipal corporations, considered as communities endowed with peculiar functions for the benefit of their own citizens, had always been recognized as possessing powers and capacities and as be-' ing entitled to exemptions distinct from those which they possess, or can claim, as conveniences in state government. If the authorities are examined, it will be found that these powers and capacities, and the interests which are acquired under them, are usually spoken of as private, in contradistinction to those in which the state is concerned, and which are called public, thus putting these corporations, as regards all such powers, capacities and interests, substantially on the footing of private corporations,\u201d citing numerous cases. Ib. 237-8.</p> <p id=\"b392-5\" pgmap=\"392(102) 393(77)\">In Wagner v. City of Rock Island, 146 Ill. 139, 154, the court quotes with approval this language: \u201cA municipal corporation which supplies its inhabitants with gas or water does so in its capacity of a private corporation, and not in the exercise of its powers of local sovereignty. If this power is granted to a borough or city, it is a special private franchise, made as well for the private emolument and advantage of the city as for the public good. In separating the two powers\u2014public and private\u2014regard must be had to the object of the legislature in conferring them. If granted for public purposes exclusively, they belong to the corporate body in its public, political or municipal character; but if the grant. was for purposes of private advantages and emolument, though the public may derive a common benefit therefrom, the corporation quoad hoc is to be regarded as a private company. It stands upon the same footing as would any individual or body of persons upon whom the like special franchises had been conferred.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b393-4\" pgmap=\"393\">Such being the law, the city was not without power to grant the exemption.</p> <p id=\"b393-5\" pgmap=\"393\">Counsel for appellants urge that the court\u2019s construction of the ordinance, in holding on the facts found, that the dormitories and commons are exempt, within the meaning of the sections of the ordinances quoted supra, is erroneous. As we understand the argument of counsel, this contention is based on two reasons: First, that the dormitories and \u201ccommons\u201d are not within the words of the ordinances, that they are not used in the immediate conduct and carrying on of. the * * * educational purposes of- such institution; and, second, that the dormitories and commons are \u201cused for gain or profit.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b393-7\" pgmap=\"393\">Counsel in their argument say: \u201cTo us it is clear as anything can be, that the dormitories and restaurant .(commons) mentioned in the bill and decree, are not used in the immediate conduct and carrying on of this school. The immediate conduct of an educational institution is nothing more than imparting that knowledge to students. The buildings that are used in the immediate conduct of an educational institution are those that are used as class rooms or study rooms, libraries or laboratories.\u201d Manifestly, this is too narrow a view. The language of the ordinance is not merely the conducting and carrying on of a school. The language is, \u201cas is used in the immediate conduct and carrying on of * * * the educational purposes of such institution.\u201d In respect to the dormitories and commons, the court found as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b394-4\" pgmap=\"394\">\u201cThat for the use and occupation of the rooms respectively occupied by them in the buildings herein described as Hitchcock \u2018Hall, Snell Hall, Beecher Hall, Green Hall, Kelley Hall, Foster Hall and Foster Hall Annex, and each of them, the occupants thereof pay to said University certain sums of money in addition to their regular fees for tuition, which said sums of money are, as hereinbefore stated, used by the University in defraying a part of its running expenses. These last named buildings are provided by the University for students who have no homes in Chicago, but who come from outside of Chicago to attend the University, and it is almost exclusively such students who occupy them. The students who occupy rooms in said buildings use their respective rooms as living and also as study rooms during the daytime and evenings, the University not providing study halls in which the students can prosecute their studies between classes. The University maintains control of and supervision over the student life in each one of these last named buildings, by appointing some member of the faculty or some person associated with the faculty, to live in said buildings and to oversee the student life therein, there being one of said persons living in each one of said buildings as its head. For all meals served in the building described herein as the commons, the partakers thereof pay to said University of Chicago certain sums in addition to their fees for tuition, but, as stated above, such sums never' exceed the cost of the meals served.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b394-5\" pgmap=\"394\">There is no certificate of evidence in the record, therefore the facts found must be held to have been found by the chancellor on sufficient evidence. Brown v. Miner, 128 Ill. 148, 156; King v. King, 215 Ib. 100, 115.</p> <p id=\"b394-6\" pgmap=\"394(48) 395(287)\">Phillips Academy v. Andover, 175 Mass. 118, was an action by the academy to recover taxes paid under protest, on the ground that the property taxed was exempt from taxation. The statute under which the exemption was claimed provided: \u201cThe personal property of literary, benevolent, charitable and scientifie institutions, incorporated within this commonwealth, and the real estate belonging to such institutions, occupied by them or their officers for the purpose for which they were incorporated, shall be exempt from taxation.\u201d The court held that the academy was an institution within the meaning of the statute; and, in considering the words \u201coccupied by them or their officers for the purpose for which they were incorporated,\u201d say: \u201cIt is not enough, for instance, that an income is derived from the occupancy which is applied to carrying on the institution. Chapel of the Good Shepherd v. Boston, 120 Mass. 212, At the same time the occupancy may be of the kind contemplated by the statute, notwithstanding that as incident to it rent is received, or the pecuniary value to the officer occupying is taken into account in some other manner. Massachusetts General Hospital v. Somerville, 101 Mass. 319. The distinction lies, it seems to us, between an occupancy which is for the private benefit and convenience of the officer, and which is so regarded by the parties, as in the ordinary case of landlord and tenant, and an occupancy where, although necessarily to some extent the relation of landlord and tenant enters into it, the dominant or principal matter of consideration is the effect of the occupancy in promoting the objects of the institution in the various ways in which such occupancy may or will tend to promote them. In the former case the property would not be exempt, in the latter it would; and the fact that the institution incidentally derived some pecuniary advantages from the occupancy, would not deprive the property of the exemption to which it otherewise would be entitled.</p> <p id=\"b395-4\" pgmap=\"395(59) 396(299)\">\u201cIn considering whether property is occupied so as to be exempt, regard may be had, amongst other things, to the situation of the institution. If, for instance, it is so situated that desirable residences are not or may not be easily obtained, and those in charge of it are of opinion that such officers as the best interests of the institution and of those resorting to it require, can be more easily obtained if the institution provides places for them to live in, and it does so, this may be taken into account in determining whether the occupancy is for the purposes for which the institution was incorporated. Or again, if with the best interests of the institution as an educational institution in view, and for the purpose of enhancing its advantages to students, and of promoting discipline and good conduct and greater freedom of intercourse between students and professors and instructors, those in charge deem it advisable that the president and professors and others connected with the institution should occupy residences in the college yard, or in proximity to the college buildings, this also may be taken into account. The dominant purpose of the occupancy under such or similar circumstances may be as truly for that for which the institution was incorporated, as the occupancy of buildings for recitation purposes, or for offices, or for other like purposes would be. And the occupancy does not lose what may be termed its institutional character and purpose because, as incidental to it, the officers and their families are provided with homes, for the use and enjoyment of which by them compensation is allowed, or taken into account in some manner. In many, if not most, New England colleges and academies the presence of the families of the professors and other officers has been and is regarded as beneficial to the students, and as advantageous to the institution. The occupation, therefore, by them as homes of the property belonging to such institutions, would not necessarily be inconsistent with the spirit and intent of the exempting clause.</p> <p id=\"b396-4\" pgmap=\"396(46) 397(138)\">\u201cIn considering the purpose of the occupancy, due weight is also to be given to the intentions of those in charge of the institution. The institution can only act through agents. In Massachusetts General Hospital v. Somerville, 101 Mass. 319, 322, it is said that \u2018what lands are reasonably required, and what uses of land will promote the purposes for which the institution was incorporated, must be determined by its own officers. * * * In the absence of anything to show abuse, or otherwise to impeach their determination, it is sufficient that the lands are intended for and in fact appropriated to those purposes;\u2019 and again, later, \u2018the presumption is in favor of their judgment, and it requires something more than mere difference of opinion, upon a matter of opinion especially confided to them, to overcome that presumption.\u2019 Their conclusions are not final. But if consistent with other facts tending to show that the purpose of the occupancy is that for which the institution was incorporated, they well may be allowed to have a controlling effect.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b397-5\" pgmap=\"397(207) 398(53)\">In Yale University v. New Haven, 71 Conn. 316, the statute relied on for exemption, being section 3820 of General Statutes, provided that \u201cbuildings or portions of buildings exclusively occupied as colleges,\u201d etc., should be exempt from taxation. The court, in its elaborate opinion, showing, historically and by reference to the customs of other colleges, what the word \u201ccollege\u201d includes, say: \u201cAll the dormitories occupied by students, the building used as a dining hall, the observatory buildings, the two houses furnished by the college for the officers of the observatory, the adjoining land found to be reasonably necessary for the purposes of the observatory, and No. 121 Elm street, used as a college yard in connection with the college buildings, are non-taxable property under section 3820.\u201d Id. 334. The court, in the same case say, in respect to the dormitories: \u201cThe fact that certain sums are paid for use of the rooms occupied, does not alter the character of the occupation. A church is none the less a church because the worshipers contribute to the support of services by way of pew rent,.\u2019 \u2019 etc. Ib. 328. To the same effect are the following cases: Northampton Co. v. Lafayette College, 128 Penn. St. 132; Ramsey Co. v. Macalster College, 51 Minn. 437; Trustees, etc., v. State, 46 Ia. 275; Rural Cemetery v. Worchester County, 152 Mass. 408; State v. Ross, 24 N. J. L. 497; Academy of the Sacred Heart v. Irvey, 51 Neb. 755; Monticello Seminary v. The People, 106 Ill. 398.</p> <p id=\"b398-5\" pgmap=\"398\">The court found that the appellee, in addition to the regular tuition fees, charges the students who occupy the dormitories certain sums of money; and also charges the students who partake of meals served in the commons certain sums, in addition to the regular tuition fees; and counsel for appellants contend that these charges are gain or profit, within the meaning of section 2402 quoted in the statement preceding this opinion. It was evidently intended that section 2402 should have some effect as to educational institutions, and it must be so construed. But, if the contention of appellants is sound, the section can have no effect as to private educational institutions, because all such charge tuition fees, and appellants\u2019 contention is as applicable to tuition fees as to the charges in question. Therefore, appellants\u2019 contention cannot be sustained.</p> <p id=\"b398-6\" pgmap=\"398(155) 399(145)\">In Santa Clara Female Academy v. Sullivan, 116 Ill. 375, the academy was a corporation organized solely for educational purposes. It was objected that it was a corporation for pecuniary profit, in respect to which the court, after briefly stating the provisions of the academy\u2019s charter, say: \u201cThis is all\u2014not a word as to stock, stockholders, dividends, or suggestive of pecuniary profit to anybody. .It is said that fees are charged for tuition. We suppose this to be the case with all educational institutions, with hardly an exception, if any. ' What is meant by \u2018pecuniary profit,\u2019 is \u2018for the pecuniary profit of its stockholders or members, \u2019 in the words of section 26 (Rev. Stat. 1874, p. 290), before quoted. Such is not the purpose of this charter, but it is for educational purposes, and all the avails received are applied to the latter purposes. See McDonald v. M. G. Hospital, 120 Mass. 432, on this point. The proof is, \u2018there is no pecuniary profit to the members of the corporation from this institution. There are no dividends declared, no money given to any member. The trustees themselves derive no personal profit. The corporation is not conducted for any other purpose than educational and charitable purposes/ The record shows that the value of appellant\u2019s property but slightly exceeds the incumbrances and debts. That educational corporations are not corporations for pecuniary profit, is recognized by the law of this state in section 4, chapter 144, of the Bevised Statutes of 1874, page 1090, which provides that any educational corporation theretofore incorporated under any special law of the state may \u2018become incorporated under the provisions of f An Act concerning corporations,\u2019 approved April 18, 1872, relative to corporations not for pecuniary profit. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</p> <p id=\"b399-4\" pgmap=\"399\">Section 4 of chapter 144, referred to by the court, is still in force. Hurd\u2019s Rev. Stat. 1905, p. 2032.</p> <p id=\"b399-5\" pgmap=\"399\">Our conclusions are that all the buildings mentioned in the decree are used in the immediate conduct and carrying on of the educational purposes of appellee, and materially subserve and promote said purposes, and that they are all exempt from water taxes and rates within the meaning of appellant\u2019s said ordinances, notwithstanding certain charges are made by appellee, in addition to the ordinary tuition fees, against students who occupy the dormitories, and against students who partake of meals at commons.</p> <p id=\"b399-6\" pgmap=\"399\">The decree will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b399-7\" pgmap=\"399\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
