Rogers.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">On August 31, 1959, Rogers sustained an industrial injury to his back, neck and head while employed as an attorney for the State of California, Department of Public Works, Division of Contracts and Rights of Way. At such time he was also suffering from two preexisting nonindustrial disabilities: (1) a below the knee amputation of the left leg occurring in 1944 as a result of an injury in the armed service; and (2) a total loss of hearing in the left ear congenital in nature. On January 9, 1961, Rogers filed an application with the commission seeking not only a determination of liability for temporary and permanent disability and for medical treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>but also additional subsequent injuries benefits from the Fund based on his preexisting disabilities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Thereafter the commission issued findings and award determining that the injury caused permanent disability but no compensable temporary disability, that applicant might need further medical treatment and that the Fund had no liability upon the evidence. Accordingly the commission made an award of medical benefits in applicant\u2019s favor against the employer\u2019s carrier. The foregoing findings and award were grounded on a permanent disability rating of 32 per cent (reduced from 40 per cent after modification for age and occupation) which was based on disability factors described as follows in the referee\u2019s request for a rating: \u201cDisability in back, head, neck, limiting applicant to light to moderate work.\u2019\u2019 Since the rating of 32 per cent was less than the minimum disability of 40 per cent prescribed by the statute governing subsequent injuries benefits as in effect at the date of the injury, liability for such benefits did not attach to the Fund.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Rogers thereupon filed a petition for reconsideration alleging that the evidence justified a much higher rating, that the rating was based on a \u201cconclusionary type description\u2019\u2019 and that a more complete and detailed description of the factors of disability was required. Applicant\u2019s petition was granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>and Panel One of the commission thereupon submitted a more detailed description of the factors of disability together with a request for a rating.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Pursuant to above request and description, the rating bureau of the commission recommended the following ratings : (a) For the neck, spine and back disability 32 per cent (reduced from a standard 40 per cent); for the head disability 15 per cent (increased from a standard 10 per cent). These two ratings totaling 47 per cent were reduced to 43% per cent by application of a multiple disability rating table, (b) For the left lower leg disability 46 per cent; and for the hearing loss 13 per cent. The total of the above percentages, 102% per cent (43% per cent plus 59 per cent) was thereafter reduced to 77% per cent by application of the multiple disability rating table. The 43% per cent rating for the industrial injury was then deducted from the total disability rating of 77% per cent, to arrive at a difference of 34 per cent representing the preexisting disability chargeable to the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Petitioner requested that the case be set for further hearing to give it an opportunity to cross-examine the rating specialist. At the ensuing hearing, the rating specialist testified that he rated the head disability separately from the neck, spine and back disability; that he rated the back disability in the light of the direction that applicant was \u201climited to light to slightly moderate work\u201d; that if instead of being separated into two paragraphs (see footnote 3, <em>ante) </em>the factors of disability for the head, neck, spine and back were set forth in one paragraph, the recommended rating would be a standard rating of 40 per cent; but that both the headache factors of disability and the back factors of disability were separately stated in the rating schedule. The witness further testified over objection of applicant\u2019s counsel that when rating the preexisting disabilities he did not consider any factor of rehabilitation possibly undergone by the applicant and that therefore he rated both the leg disability and the ear disability as if they had occurred on August 31, 1959, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the date of the industrial injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He also explained the 46 per cent rating of the left lower leg disability as follows: The loss of the left leg below the knee was given a standard rating of 50 per cent, modified for the applicant\u2019s age and occupation to 41 per cent. To this was added a combined rating of 5 per cent for the swelling and drainage of the stump and the occasional slight to moderate pain, making a total of 46 per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Eventually the commission issued an amended decision after reconsideration making an award in favor of the applicant and against the employer\u2019s insurance carrier for permanent disability indemnity (based on a permanent disability rating of 43% per cent), medical treatment and medical expenses and also making an award in favor of the applicant and against the Fund for subsequent injuries benefits, based on an assessed liability of 34 per cent (i.e., a total permanent disability of 77% per cent less the above 43% per cent).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The Fund contends that (1) a portion of the permanent disability award was for a condition which was temporary rather than permanent; (2) a portion of the award against the Fund was for a disability that did not preexist the industrial injury; (3) the commission should have adjusted its ratings of preexisting disabilities to reflect prior rehabilitation; and (4) the commission\u2019s rating of the industrial disabilities was an unwarranted pyramiding of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Petitioner\u2019s first two contentions relate to the 5 per cent rating included in the total rating of 46 per cent for the applicant\u2019s left lower leg disability, as already explained above. In the second and more detailed request for a permanent disability rating, these factors of disability were described thusly: \u201c... recurrent swelling at stump, which breaks open and drains; occasional slight to moderate pain from time to time.\u201d It was these two factors in combination to which the rating specialist ascribed a rating of 5 per cent. Under its first contention the Fund argues that the condition of swelling and drainage was temporary rather than permanent. At the inception of the proceedings before us, the Fund took the position that the foregoing was the extent of its argument on this point and that it was not arguing that the swelling with drainage did not preexist the industrial injury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>However at oral argument the Fund maintained that the above described condition was not preexisting. Under its second contention, the Fund argues that the pain as described above did not preexist the industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The point of petitioner\u2019s first two contentions is this: Labor Code section 4751 (see footnote 2, <em>ante) </em>imposes liability on the Fund only for <em>permanent preexisting </em>disabilities. The first condition of recurrent swelling and drainage, says the Fund, was neither permanent nor preexisting. The second condition of pain was not preexisting.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The record discloses the following pertinent evidence: The applicant testified that after wearing the prosthesis for six months, he \u201chad no difficulty with the stump or the prosthesis\u201d; that for the ensuing period of approximately 15 years until his accident on August 31, 1959, he lost no work on account of his first injury; and that although sometimes after walking \u201cthere would be a redness or roughness on the stump but never any disorder,\u201d there never had been any drainage in the stump prior to the subsequent injury. It is to be noted that he neither expressly affirmed nor denied the existence of pain in the stump area prior to the subsequent injury. The record shows that intermittent drainage was first observed about three weeks after the 1959 injury; that over the next several months there was a continuous process of swelling and drainage in the stump area; that acting on the advice of his physician, Dr. Maloney, applicant in July 1960 underwent an operation to correct this condition; but that, nevertheless, approximately six weeks later, the condition recurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Dr. Lewis, who originally examined the applicant in November 1959, reexamined him on July 3, 1961, chiefly for the purpose of evaluating complaints of stump disability. This reexamination was approximately one year after the operation performed by Dr. Maloney and 22 months after the second injury. Dr. Lewis concluded in his medical report that the condition resulted from a cyst of the type common on amputation stumps.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dr. Haldeman who examined the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>cant on February 12, 1962, one week before the hearing, stated that the applicant then complained of intermittent drainage from the stump of the left leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Dr. Hedburg, who examined the applicant on February 1, 1962, also found the same complaint, noting in his medical report that \u201cThere were no episodes of inflammation or breaking down in the stump tissues at any time prior to the injury in question. \u2019' After remarking that there were \u201cvarying speculative opinions concerning etiology\" by other doctors, Dr. Hedburg\u2019s report continued: \u201cI am not fully able to resolve this conflict of opinion on the basis of available information. The stated fact that there had never been any similar inflammatory process during the previous fifteen years or more is not necessarily conclusive but deserves consideration. ... I would strongly suspect that a low grade infection of the periosteum or cortex of the distal stump of the fibula is responsible for the recurring drainage and it should be possible to clear up the situation once and for all by an appropriate surgical procedure designed to remove the focus of infection as well as the sinus tract.\" Petitioner relies on the last clause quoted above as strongly indicative of the temporary character of the recurrent swelling and drainage.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In our view, the foregoing evidence is supportive of the commission\u2019s determination that the two conditions presently under discussion and rated at 5 per cent were permanent in nature and preexisted the industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The applicable statutes provide no definition of permanent disability.  However it is now settled that a disability is permanent within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law when further change for better or for worse is not reasonably to be anticipated under usual medical standards. Either no further medical treatment is possible or the success of that which is suggested is so problematical as to warrant refusal to undergo it.  Generally speaking a permanent disability is one which will remain substantially the same during the remainder of the injured party\u2019s life. <em>(Sweeney </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1951) 107 Cal.App.2d 155, 159 [236 . P.2d 651] quoting from 1 Campbell, Workmen\u2019s Compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>tion, \u00a7 813, p. 719.) According to Hanna (2 Hanna, The Law of Employee Injuries and Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1954 ed.) p. 255) \u201cPermanent disability may be defined as any impairment of bodily or mental function which remains after maximum recovery has been attained from the effects of injury, and which causes impairment of earning capacity, impairment of the normal use of a member, or a competitive handicap in the open labor market.\u201d  Whether an injury is permanent is purely a question of fact for the determination of the commission which is final and conclusive on said issue if supported by any substantial evidence. <em>(Pullman Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 379, 385-386 [170 P.2d 10] ; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1931) 119 Cal.App. 200, 202 [6 P.2d 348] ; <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1936) 14 Cal.App.2d 134, 137 [57 P.2d 1341]; <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">In the instant ease, the evidence shows that the condition of recurrent swelling and drainage in the stump still existed approximately two years and five months after the industrial injury of August 1959 and approximately one year and a half after applicant\u2019s operation. This period of time, especially when considered with the attempted operative procedure, was sufficiently long so as to warrant the commission\u2019s determination that the condition was permanent. (Cf. <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>119 Cal.App. 200, 202.) Dr. Hedburg\u2019s report on which the Fund relies does not compel a different conclusion. He stated therein his inability to resolve the medical opinion as to the cause of the condition, his <em>strong suspicion </em>as to the cause and his opinion that it should be <em>possible </em>to clear it up. That portion of the statement relevant to the clearing up of the condition, when considered in context, is actually susceptible of two inferences \u2014one, that it is <em>possible </em>to clear up the condition and the other, that it is <em>not </em>possible to do so. (Cf. <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>107 Cal.App.2d 155, 159.) The commission chose to adopt the latter inference. In support of its claim that the condition was merely temporary, the Fund also adverts to the applicant\u2019s testimony that he intended to have further treatment including another operation,  But the need for further medical treatment is not incompatible with the status of permanent disability. <em>(Industrial Indemnity Exchange </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1949) 90 Cal.App.2d 99, 102 [202 P.2d 850]; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>119 Cal.App. 200, 202.)  We believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>therefore that the permanent character of the condition relating to the recurrent swelling and drainage has sufficient support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">However, we must inquire whether the record also supports the determination that this condition <em>preexisted </em>the industrial injury before it can be considered as a properly rateable factor of permanent disability for purposes of subsequent injuries benefits. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 <em>4751; Ferguson </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 469, 474, 479 [326 P.2d 145].) The commission argues that such evidentiary support is found in that portion of Dr. Lewis\u2019 medical report quoted by us above (see footnote 5, <em>ante). </em>We think this argument has merit. The above report in substance states that what Dr. Maloney removed from the stump in the operation of July 1960 was a cyst which had broken down and drained. It will be recalled that this drainage was first observed only three weeks after the industrial injury. Dr. Lewis further stated that \u201cCysts of this type are very common on amputation stumps,\u201d that at the time of his examination of the applicant in July 1961 (one year after the first operation) he found two more cysts which had not yet broken down, and that the industrial injury had no bearing on the development of stump cysts. From this evidence the commission was justified in inferring that the cyst, the drainage of which was first observed shortly after the industrial injury, was an old cyst which preexisted the injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">While the applicant testified that there was never any drainage in the stump prior to the industrial injury, this would not negate the existence of the old cyst which later drained. Nor does his testimony that he lost no work on account of the first injury preclude consideration of the condition as a factor of permanent disability.  Where a factor of permanent disability preexists the industrial injury and otherwise supports an award of permanent disability, it is not necessary that it must have been known to the employee or that it must have interfered with his employment in his particular field of work in order for such disability to ground an award of subsequent injuries benefits. <em>(Subsequent In</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>juries Fund </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 842, 846 [17 Cal.Rptr. 144, 366 P.2d 496].)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">This brings us to the second part of the problem: namely, whether the factor of pain described above preexisted the industrial injury. The applicant, testifying to the condition of drainage as it developed <em>after </em>the industrial injury, stated that the area was painful while the pressure was building up, that such pain was felt when he was \u201cstanding on the stump\u201d but not when he had removed the prosthesis. Dr. Hedburg\u2019s report, also speaking as of a time subsequent to the industrial injury, appears to confirm the attendance of pain upon the cyst indicating under the heading of subjective complaints that a tender lump increased in size and that before it burst walking became difficult because of the pressure. Accordingly we think that the commission could reasonably infer, as it now claims, that pain was a concomitant of the preexisting cyst.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The Fund argues that this inference cannot be drawn since the complaint, being subjective, by its very nature could not have existed without the applicant\u2019s knowledge and that the applicant testified to the absence of complaints Deferrable to the left lower extremity before the industrial injury and the inception of such complaints with the industrial injury. However, as we read the record, the applicant did not expressly negate a preexisting condition of pain. He said he had no <em>diffictilty </em>with the stump or the prosthesis for 14 or 15 years before the second injury. When asked if during that period he had \u201cepisodes of irritation or drainage\u201d he replied that there was never any drainage and that while sometimes on walking there was a \u201credness\u201d or \u201croughness\u201d there was never any <em>disorder. </em>He later testified that he had never been hospitalized for the stump. But he was not asked whether he felt pain in the stump <em>before </em>the industrial injury. Under examination by his own counsel, he <em>was </em>asked in what parts of his body he felt pain or discomfort <em>following </em>the industrial accident. In reply he referred to several parts of his body including his left leg from the \u201csocket\u201d all the way down to the stump. Shortly thereafter, in further reference to this description of pain, he explained in detail the condition of the stump <em>after </em>the industrial injury. It is clear to us that these inquiries were directed to his condition following the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Therefore we think that the commission could reasonably infer that pain was a concomitant of the preexisting cyst <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>condition, that such pain did in fact preexist the second injury but that it was not severe enough either to hospitalize applicant or keep him from his employment. Questions as to the weight of the evidence are not within our province.  There being some evidence which by reasonable inference will support the finding of the commission in respect to the foregoing factors of disability, we are without power to disturb it. <em>(Mercer-Fraser Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 102, 114 [251 P.2d 955] ; <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1953) 115 Cal.App.2d 684, 692 [252 P.2d 649].) We conclude that the 5 per cent rating for the factors of disability discussed above is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">We turn to the third contention on appeal. The point of the Fund's argument is this: The applicant had two preexisting disabilities for which he received subsequent injuries benefits: (1) below the knee amputation of the left leg in 1944, 15 years before the industrial injury; and (2) total loss of hearing in the left ear which was congenital and therefore existed for 39 years, the applicant being of that age at the time of the industrial injury. Nevertheless, argues the Fund, both of the above disabilities were rated by the commission as if they were the result of the industrial injury of August 31, 1959. Such ratings were therefore erroneously made because they were not adjusted for prior rehabilitation from the above two disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The applicant testified that he was first employed by the Division of Contracts and Rights of Way in 1948, 11 years before his industrial injury; that after the first year or so he was assigned to the trial of condemnation eases, eventually becoming the principal trial attorney; and that his prosthesis never hindered him in his work. While there is no testimony one way or the other as to whether his loss of hearing affected his trial work, his continuous activity as the chief trial attorney without any complaint as to the quality of his work would give rise to the inference that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">As we have already pointed out, the rating specialist rated both the preexisting leg disability and the preexisting ear disability as if they had occurred on August 31, 1959, as a result of the industrial injury. The record is clear that the commission adopted such ratings without any adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The same problem which derives from these circumstances was presented to and decided by the court in <em>State of Cali</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>fornia </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. [Springer] </em>(1954) 129 Cal. App.2d 302 [276 P.2d 820]. There the employee was 37 years old and a deaf-mute since birth. After completing two years of high school he became fairly steadily employed. At the time of his industrial injury he had been eontinously employed at the same job for eight years and after the injury returned to the same job at the same wage. There, as in the instant case, the commission gave the employee the same rating for his preexisting disabilities as if they had been caused by the industrial injury. Referring to Labor Code section 4660,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the court observed that the permanent disability rating schedule adopted by the commission pursuant thereto was only prima facie evidence of the percentage of permanent disability and that the rehabilitation theory as a principle underlying the schedule \u201cis basic in determining the extent of partial permanent disability in compensation cases. (1 Campbell, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, p. 728; <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>126 Cal.App.2d 554, 557-558 [272 P.2d 818].)\u201d (P.304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Holding that the prima facie evidence of the schedule had been rebutted by the other uncontradicted evidence before the commission, the court in <em>Springer </em>annulled the award with directions, Justice Dooling writing: \u201cThe patent error of the commission was to rate a congenital condition of deafmutism to which the applicant had so far adjusted himself as to be reasonably employable, after the injury as well as before, by the same standard that it would have been rated if the applicant had lost his hearing and speech in the same accident in which he received the injury to his hand. It is obvious that his disability would have been much greater if he had had the normal faculties of speech and hearing up to the time of his accident and had lost them then, with the whole period of adjustment to their loss before him, than it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>could possibly be with the whole period of adjustment to their lack behind him. \u2019 \u2019 (P. 304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Four years later the same problem which confronted the court in <em>Springer </em>and now confronts us was presented to the Supreme Court in <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 360 [325 P.2d 993]. There the employee was 42 years old, a deaf-mute since the age of 5 and unable to read lips. He worked as a painter for a number of years before his industrial injury. Upon the granting of a petition for reconsideration filed by the Fund, the commission rerated the employee\u2019s disability for deaf-mutism on the basis of <em>50 per cent </em>of the standard rating for loss of speech and loss of hearing industrially caused, thereby relieving the Fund from liability. The Supreme Court rejected the employee\u2019s contention that such adjustment of the standard rating was not sustained by the evidence and was unreasonable and arbitrary, Justice MeComb writing: \u201c(2) It is error to rate a congenital condition of deaf-mutism to which petitioner has so far adjusted himself as to be reasonably employable after the injury as well as before by the same standard that it would have been rated if petitioner had lost his hearing and speech in the same accident in which he received the industrial injury. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>129 Cal.App.2d 302, 304 [1] [276 P.2d 820] [hearing denied by the Supreme Court].) Petitioner\u2019s disability would have been much greater if he had had the normal faculties of speech and hearing up to the time of the accident and had lost them then, with the whole period of adjustment to their loss before him, than it could possibly have been with the whole period of adjustment to their lack behind him. . . . The court in such ease [i.e., <em>Springer] </em>indicated the correct procedure as that set forth under rule (2), <em>supra. </em>In the present case, the commission, in following this rule, concluded that deaf-mutism did not seriously affect petitioner\u2019s ability to be a painter and that he had adjusted well to his condition. There is thus sufficient evidence in the record to support its finding.\u201d (Pp. 365-366.)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The above decisions control the instant case. Indeed the commission does not challenge them, makes no mention of <em>Springer, </em>and cites <em>Gonzales </em>only in reference to the substantial evidence rule. The commission\u2019s argument that awards of permanent disability are sustainable even where there is no impairment of earning capacity is beside the point and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>does not squarely meet the issue before us. We hold that the commission should have made such further adjustments of the standard ratings for the preexisting disabilities as in the light of the evidence before it were in its sound discretion necessary and proper to give effect to any rehabilitation determined by it to have occurred in respect to these disabilities prior and up to the date of the industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Finally we consider the Fund\u2019s contention that the rating for the <em>industrial </em>injury was the result of an unwarranted pyramiding of compensation. The point of the argument is this: that the rerating of the disability to the back, head and neck upon a more detailed request describing the head disability in a separate paragraph (see footnote 3, <em>ante) </em>actually added nothing to applicant\u2019s overall disability and resulted in the pyramiding of compensation under which the applicant received an additional rating of 15 per cent for something which did not alter or extend his basic permanent disability-</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">As already pointed out, Panel One of the commission, having granted the applicant\u2019s petition for a reconsideration, submitted to the rating bureau certain factors of disability. These, we have seen, were described in more detailed form than in the referee\u2019s first request. They were set forth in two paragraphs\u2014the first pertaining to the head disability<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the second <em>to </em>the neck, spine and back disability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The record shows that the schedule for rating permanent disabilities was then applied as follows: In rating the head disability, the rating specialist used classification 1.7 \u201cheadaches\u201d (found under the general division \u201cBrain and Nervous System\u201d) which sets forth the following standard ratings\u2014slight, <em>5 </em>per cent; moderate, 15 per cent; severe, 60 per cent; pronounced, 100 per cent. He then gave the head disability a 10 per cent standard rating. It is easily seen, as the commission asserts and the Fund does not deny, that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>rating was midway between slight (5 per cent) and moderate (15 per cent). In rating the neck and spine disability, the rating specialist used classification 18.1 \u201cimpaired function of the neck, spine, or pelvis\u201d (found under the general division \u201cNeck, Spine, or Pelvis\u201d) which sets forth the following standard ratings\u2014slight, 30 per cent; moderate, 50 per cent; severe, 100 per cent. He then gave the back disability a standard rating of 40 per cent, clearly midway between slight (30 per cent) and moderate (50 per cent). As stated earlier, these two standard ratings after adjustment for age and occupation totaled 47 per cent and were thereafter further adjusted to 43% per cent by application of a multiple disability rating table.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The Fund\u2019s attack on these ratings is based largely on the subsequent testimony of the rating specialist. So far as is here pertinent, he stated that there was nothing in the description employed in the first paragraph (head disability) that would prevent the applicant from doing light to slightly moderate work; that so far as he could tell from the first paragraph description, the applicant\u2019s head disability did not extend his \u201coverall disability\u201d beyond being limited to light to slightly moderate work; that the description in the first paragraph actually did not \u201cadd anything to the ultimate description of the disability, \u2018[a]pplieant limited to light to slightly moderate work\u2019 \u201d; and that if all the factors had been put in one paragraph he \u201cwould think\u201d that the rating would be 40 per cent standard.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">He further testified that his key to his rating the back disability pursuant to the description in the second paragraph was the concluding phrase \u201c[a]pplieant limited to light to slightly moderate work\u201d; that the rest of the second paragraph, namely the detailed description relating to the neck, spine and back, added nothing and was considered sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>plusage; and </em>that <em>by </em>considering the above phrase, he chose the highest description of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">It is clear then that the rating expert, in response to the factors submitted by the panel, rated two separate disabilities, that is the head disability and the back disability, and thereupon applied multiple tables to avoid pyramiding the ratings arrived at. We sense that the Fund\u2019s objection to this rating procedure derives to a great extent from the fact that the first request for a rating was less detailed, in one sentence, and productive of a standard rating of only 40 per cent for disability in back, head and neck. That in our opinion is immaterial.  It was properly within the province of the commission to select and set forth the factors of disability which were to be the basis of the rating. Indeed, if it were necessary to find a justification for the second request, it could well be argued that the first request was so lacking in specificity and completeness as to be violative of the commission\u2019s rules. (See Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Industrial Accident Commission, rule 10927.)  The determination of the percentage of disability attributable to the industrial injury is a matter left to the sound discretion of the commission. <em>(Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1927) 202 Cal. 459, 464 [262 P. 466] ; <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1932) 215 Cal. 177, 188 [8 P.2d 1021] ; <em>Tanenbaum </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1935) 4 Cal.2d 615, 618 [52 P.2d 215]; W. P. <em>Fuller &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1962) 211 Cal.App.2d 9, 17-20 [27 Cal.Rptr. 401].)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The Fund argues that the rerating of the disabilities contravenes certain principles announced in <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>[Hutchinson] (1963) 59 Cal.2d 45 [27 Cal.Rptr. 702, 377 P.2d 902], That case dealt with two <em>separate </em>and <em>successive </em>industrial injuries. In July 1958, the employee sustained an injury to his neck. Based on a finding of minimal pain in the back of the neck extending to the shoulders and becoming \u201cslight\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d with certain activities, the commission gave the applicant\u2019s disability a permanent disability rating of 26 per cent. In November 1958, the employee sustained an injury to his back. The factors of disability were described as \u201cMinimal low back pain increased to slight on heavy work.\u201d The second disability was also rated at 26 per cent. It was clear that while not identical, the two disabilities <em>overlapped. </em>The rating expert testified that if the factors for both awards were com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>bined, the combined disability would warrant a rating of something more than 26 per cent but less than 52 per cent. The carrier for the employer contended that in the light of the above testimony, the second award represented an unwarranted pyramiding of compensation. The commission contended that if separate parts of the body were injured in separate industrial accidents, each injury should be rated separately and the combined disability was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><em>Hutchinson </em>involved an application of Labor Code section 4750<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and posed the problem of determining compensation for a later injury to an employee already suffering from a previous permanent disability. As the court pointed out, the above statute was interpreted in the <em>Smith </em>ease to mean that the second employer \u201cis not liable for compensation for the ensuing combined disabilities, but only for that portion of permanent disability which is caused by the last injury.\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 364, 365 [282 P.2d 64].) The problem in <em>Hutchinson </em>was in computing the percentage of disability attributable to the second injury, since the two disabilities <em>overlapped </em>and the combined disability rating for both was less than the sum of each taken separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The court annulled the award holding that \u201c[T]o the extent that the factors of disability due to both injuries overlapped, that is, to the extent that the second injury did not further reduce his earning capacity nor his ability to compete in the open labor market, he should not be compensated twice\u201d (59 Cal.2d at pp. 53-54) and that the percentage of disability should be calculated by subtracting the prior percentage of disability from the percentage for the combined disability after the second injury, following the method employed in <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1938) 28 Cal.App.2d 682 [83 P.2d 295], Justice Peters concluded that \u201cthe disability resulting from a subsequent injury should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>compensable only to the extent that it can be said that the employee\u2019s earning capacity or ability to compete has been decreased from what it was immediately prior to the second injury. The computation of this figure cannot be determined by a mechanical application of a method of apportionment based upon whether the injury occurs to the same anatomical part of the body. It must come from a consideration of the nature of the disability caused by the injury. \u2019 \u2019 (P. 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The Fund argues that the above rules which under <em>Hutchinson </em>apply to disabilities resulting from successive industrial injuries must necessarily apply to disabilities resulting, as they do here, from the same industrial injury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree. <em>Hutchinson </em>involves Labor Code section 4750 and the problem of calculating the percentage of disability attributable to the second of <em>two </em>separate industrial injuries with <em>overlapping </em>factors of disability. We find nothing in <em>Hutchinson </em>which states or intimates that the rule prescribed by section 4750 for <em>successive </em>injuries or the procedures approved in <em>Hutchinson </em>for rating such injuries, are applicable in the rating of disabilities for a <em>single </em>industrial injury. In support of its argument, the Fund hypothesizes a situation where the present applicant instead of sustaining head and back disabilities in <em>one </em>injury, sustained an injury to his back in one injury and a subsequent injury to his head in a later injury. All that is beside the point. This is not a case where a later disability adds to but at the same time overlaps a prior disability. Furthermore in attempting to infuse into the instant case the rationale of <em>Hutchinson, </em>the Fund appears to assume that the instant head and back disabilities overlap. The record shows that they were considered as separate disabilities. Even in a situation of successive injuries, <em>Hutchinson </em>recognized that \u201c [i] f successive injuries produce separate and independent disabilities then each is properly rated separately without concern for the theoretical 100 per cent assigned to \u2018total\u2019 disability.\u201d <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>[Hutchinson], <em>supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 45, 53; see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>44 Cal.2d 364; <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc.
