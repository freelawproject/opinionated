The complaint contains two causes of action. The first is on behalf of a minor child, who alleges that defendant refused to treat her on October 21, 1961. In the second cause of action the plaintiff is the father of the child, who alleges that on October 20, 1961, defendant agreed to render medical service to plaintiff\u2019s daughter, and that on October 21, defendant refused to render services, in violation of section 51 of the Civil Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>In the municipal court defendant made a motion for judgment on the pleadings upon the ground that Civil Code, sections 51 and 52, do not apply to the services of physicians. That motion was granted. Upon the entry of judgment against them plaintiffs appealed to the appellate department of the superior court, which reversed the judgment, and certified the case to this court to settle an important question of law. This court then ordered the case transferred to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The issue appears not to have come before an appellate court since the 1959 Legislature enacted the Unruh Civil Rights Act, which greatly broadened the area in which discrimination is forbidden. The question presented is whether the \u201cservices in all business establishments,\u201d to which all persons are entitled regardless of race or color under that statute, include the services of a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">There is nothing novel in referring to the practice of medicine as a business. Business and Professions Code, sections 2380<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 2380.5<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, which deal with advertising by licensed physicians, both refer to \u201cmedical business.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In <em>Young </em>v. <em>Board of Medical </em>Examiners, 93 Cal.App. 73 [268 P. 1089], the court upheld the revocation of a license under a statute which was the predecessor of section 2380. The opinion of the court stated (at p. 75): \u201cWhile the occupation of a physician more commonly is referred to as a profession, nevertheless it may properly be included within the broader word of \u2018business. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">In <em>Crutchett </em>v. <em>Lawton, </em>139 Cal.App. 411 [33 P.2d 839], the court held that the practice of medicine is a business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>within the meaning of Civil Code, section 1674<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (now Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16601).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Other cases referring to the practice of medicine as a business are <em>Ex parte Greenall, </em>153 Cal. 767, 769 [96 P. 804]; <em>Newhouse </em>v. <em>Board of Osteopathic Examiners, </em>159 Cal.App. 2d 728, 733 [324 P.2d 687]; and <em>People </em>v. <em>T. Wah Hing, </em>79 Cal.App. 286, 289 [249 P. 229],</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">In <em>Burks </em>v. <em>Poppy Construction Co., </em>57 Cal.2d 463 [20 Cal.Rptr. 609, 370 P.2d 313], the Supreme Court held that a company engaged in the business of developing, building and selling a tract of houses was a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d within the meaning of Civil Code, section 51. The opinion of the court declared (at p. 468): \u201cThe Legislature used the words \u2018all\u2019 and \u2018of every kind whatsoever\u2019 in referring to business establishments covered by the Unruh Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51), and the inclusion of these words, without any exception and without specification of particular kinds of enterprises, leaves no doubt that the term \u2018business establishments\u2019 was used in the broadest sense reasonably possible. The word \u2018business\u2019 embraces everything about which one can be employed, and it is often synonymous with \u2018calling, occupation, or trade, engaged in for the purpose of making a livelihood or gain.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Especially pertinent here is the portion of the <em>Burks </em>opinion which interprets the legislative history of the law: \u201cThe original version of the bill which was presented to the Legislature, in addition to affording protection in \u2018business establishments,\u2019 referred specifically to the right \u2018to purchase real property\u2019 and to other rights, such as the obtaining of \u2018professional\u2019 services. Section 51, as enacted in 1959, eliminated all such specific references. . . . These deletions can be explained on the ground that the Legislature deemed specific references mere surplusage, unnecessary in view of the broad language of the act as finally passed. [Citations.] It should be noted in this connection that in the original bill the general term \u2018business establishments\u2019 was not, as now, followed by the words \u2018of every kind whatsoever\u2019 and that those words were added in the draft that deleted the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>reference to the purchase of real property.\u201d (57 Cal.2d at p. 469.)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">This reasoning points inevitably to the conclusion that the phrase \u2018\u2018business establishments of every kind whatsoever\u201d was intended to embrace professional services as well as real estate sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Santa Ana etc. Hospital Assn., </em>58 Cal.2d 806 [26 Cal.Rptr. 640, 376 P.2d 568], the Supreme Court held that the Cartwright Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16700-16758) does not apply to the professions. There is no language in that act which compares with the sweeping phrase of Civil Code, section 51, and the decision in the <em>Willis </em>ease cannot be read as limiting anything said in <em>Burks </em>as to the scope of section 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Defendant\u2019s brief asserts that because of the personal nature of the relationship between physician and patient, the court should not attempt to compel a physician to treat an unwelcome patient. This argument is not pertinent to the issue in this case. Plaintiffs are seeking damages, and the personal nature of the physician-patient relationship creates no obstacle to a recovery of damages when service is refused by reason of the plaintiffs \u2019 race or color.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The services sought by the plaintiffs, as the complaint alleges, were services both to the father and to the child. It is the legal duty of the father to provide necessary medical care for his child. <em>(Slaughter </em>v. <em>Zimman, </em>105 Cal.App.2d 623 [234 P.2d 94].) The complaint here alleges, in the father\u2019s cause of action, that he had entered into an agreement with the defendant whereby defendant was to render services to plaintiff\u2019s minor child. Under these allegations, the services were to be rendered to and for the father although the patient was the child. <em>(Evans </em>v. <em>Noonan, </em>20 Cal.App. 288 [128 P. 794].) The defendant\u2019s alleged denial of services was therefore a violation of the father\u2019s right to services under Civil Code, sections 51 and 52. It follows that the complaint states a cause of action both on behalf of the father and on behalf of the child. There is no occasion to discuss, at this stage of the proceeding, what recovery, if any, either may be entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">The judgment of the municipal court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Shinn, P.
