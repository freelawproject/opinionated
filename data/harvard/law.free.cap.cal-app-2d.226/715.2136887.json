Suit was filed on November 19, 1963, and it is the theory of plaintiff that the accident was caused by the \u201cblowout\u201d of one of the tires on plaintiff\u2019s automobile, that the tire was defective, and that the automobile (and tire) had been purchased from the defendant petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">It appears from the petition and the exhibits thereto that, on approximately October 24, 1963, the petitioning insurance carrier had employed one R. S. Gordon, an independent adjuster, to investigate the accident and that Gordon had sent its employee, Edward H. Robinson, to conduct that investigation. On December 9, 1963, plaintiff took the deposition of Robinson. At the deposition hearing, Robinson stated that, at the request of his employer, Gordon, he had gone to Carpenter\u2019s Garage, in Oceanside, California, on October 24, 1963; that he then and there observed a 1961 Corvair automobile bearing license number FKS 464 (it seems to be conceded that this was the automobile involved in the litigation) ; that he talked to someone there \u201cin relation to securing the tire.\u201d As to an entire series of questions dealing with the tire and his securing of it,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Robinson refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>answer on the instructions of counsel for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Robinson stated that, on or about November 6, 1963, he had a conversation with a Jack Lynch from the office of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys; he refused to answer questions pertaining to the tire and the conversation relating to it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Robinson stated that he took a written statement from plaintiff, Gladys Bell; that at the time he took the statement there was a Ralph Heller who was a hospital administrator in the area; that he identified himself by giving Heller his business card and telling him that he represented R. S. Gordon &amp; Company, but he did not know if he told Heller whom Gordon represented. He refused to answer a series of questions concerning his conversation with Miss Bell with respect to taking a statement from her and inspecting the tire.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Robinson stated that he took written statements also from Ruby Meeks, John Felix, Alfred Johnson and William B. Justis. He stated that he talked to Mr. Felix after the accident, but refused to answer this question: \u201cWhat did Mr. Felix say to you ? \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Robinson stated that he inspected the scene of the accident, but refused to answer questions relating thereto.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cWe have another series of questions relating to the tire, but it appears to me that at the present time unless we have certain questions answered in Department 63 it is sort of useless to go along on this line of questioning, so we will just adjourn the deposition and go up to Department 63 and get a ruling on it.\u201d Defense counsel then stated: \u201cAll right. I would like to make a statement for the record at this time. Our objections are based on what we believe to be the work product rule, that the investigator merely has to disclose the persons that he has seen, but what he said or did during the course of said investigation we believe is privileged. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Plaintiff thereupon moved for an order, under section 2034, subdivision (a), of the Code of Civil Procedure, requiring Robinson to answer the questions above set out, and seeking, also (as permitted by the same statute), an award of attorney fees in connection with the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">The declaration filed by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in support of her application for the order to require answers clearly sets forth facts sufficient to make at least a prima facie showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>of necessity for obtaining the information desired by the questions put to the witness.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">In opposition thereto, the declaration of defendants\u2019 counsel states only that \u201cThey, believe that these questions- all relate to what the said Investigator investigated specifically for the defendants, and thus <em>for their </em>attorneys; that this information is privileged under the \u2018Work Product\u2019 rule of section 2016 of the Code of Civil Procedure as Amended in 1963.\u201d It is conceded that Eobinson took the tire from the automobile, but it is contended that \u201cthe information that the plaintiff is seeking can be discovered by their own investigation\u201d; that \u201cthe information concerning the tire and the condition the tire was in when Edward H. Robinson took it can be established by checking with the Carpenter\u2019s Garage where the tire was before Robinson took the same. This condition can then be compared with its present condition to see if any changes have been made.\u201d It is stated that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>subsequent to the date of the deposition, defendant has furnished plaintiff\u2019s attorneys with the statement of plaintiff taken by Robinson. Petitioners\u2019 points and authorities consisted only of the quotation of a portion of a sentence from section 2016, Code of Civil Procedure: \u2018' The work product of an attorney shall not be discoverable unless the Court determines that denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice the party seeking discovery in preparing his claim or defense or will result in an injustice . . and the statement that \u201cCommunications between an attorney and the agent of his client are entitled to protection from disclosure,\u201d citing <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Francis J. Lewald Coal Co., </em>214 Cal. 182, 187 [4 P.2d 532, 77 A.L.R. 675]; and Louisell, Modern California Discovery, page 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The trial court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion and assessed attorney fees in the amount of $150 against counsel for defendant Downtown Ford Sales, Inc. In its memorandum decision, the trial court said: \u201cEven if the court were disposed to assume that counsel was acting in good faith at the time the deposition was taken, the basis for any such assumption is dispelled by counsel\u2019s complete failure to follow through by making an appropriate showing in opposition to plaintiff\u2019s motion of the facts on which he relies to support his objections, or as a matter of law. While plaintiff\u2019s points and authorities leave much to be desired, it is quite apparent from the record, and the court finds that the refusal of the witness to answer the questions was without substantial justification and that plaintiff\u2019s motion is made with substantial justification, within the meaning of section 2034, subdivision (a), Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">\u201cWhile it is true that Mr. Wilson, who appeared as attorney for defendant at the deposition, has filed a declaration in opposition to plaintiff\u2019s motion, it is apparent from that declaration that he has no personal knowledge of any facts material to the matter now before the court. Plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident on October 19, 1963, allegedly caused by the blowout of one of the tires on her automobile which she claims to have purchased from defendant. The deposition shows that immediately thereafter the witness was employed by defendant\u2019s insurance carrier to make an appropriate investigation, which seems to have been completed about October 24, 1963. Throughout the relatively brief deposition of the witness taken December 9, defendant\u2019s attorney objected to all questions designed to find out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>what he did or saw or said during the investigation, and instructed the witness not to answer. The complaint in this case was not filed until November 19, 1963. Defendant\u2019s answer was filed December 4. Hr. Wilson makes no showing in his declaration that, as defendant\u2019s attorney, he had anything to do with the employment of the witness as an investigator (cf. <em>David </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>5 Cal.Disc. Proc. <em>90), or </em>that he had any knowledge of the accident or of the activities of the investigator at any time before he was employed to represent defendant after the complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><em>\u201cMr. </em>Wilson states in his declaration that \u2018they believe\u2019 that the information called for by the questions \u2018is privileged under the \u201cwork product\u201d rule of section 2016 of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended in 1963.\u2019 Counsel\u2019s belief is immaterial unless it is backed up by proof of the facts on which it is based. (See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Fuller, 5 </em>Cal.Disc. Proc. <em>76; Wolpe </em>v. <em>Camino-Poyales, </em>5 Cal.Disc. Proc. 97, Metropolitan News, Mar. 5, 1964.) An affidavit or declaration which goes no further than to state counsel\u2019s belief or opinions or conclusions does not constitute evidence. <em>(Tri-State Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>224 Cal.App.2d 442 [36 Cal.Rptr. 750] ; <em>Colvig </em>v. <em>KSFO, </em>224 Cal.App.2d 357 [36 Cal.Rptr. 701].) Mr. Wilson also states in his declaration that \u2018they believe the information that the plaintiff is seeking can be discovered by their own investigation.\u2019 They fail, however, to show how plaintiff can adequately discover what the investigator did or saw or heard except by direct questions put to the investigator himself. (Cf. <em>Grand Lake Drive In, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>179 Cal.App.2d 122 [3 Cal.Rptr. 621, 86 A.L.R.2d 129].)</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">\u201cIn seeking to avoid the imposition of sanctions, Mr. Wilson says in his declaration: \u2018By reason of the recent amendment to section 2016 of the Code of Civil Procedure, declarant believes that if it <em>[sic] </em>reasonably believes such information [as is called for by the questions] is privileged and that the Court must make the determination as to what questions should be answered, then counsel should not be penalized by sanctions if he has found his interpretation of said section of the Code on privilege was incorrect. \u2019 This argument is without merit in the absence of any attempt to show in opposition to plaintiff\u2019s motion that counsel\u2019s belief was reasonable as a matter of fact or as a matter of law. Mere reference in his points and authorities to section 2016, Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>of Civil Procedure, and to the rule that \u2018communications between an attorney and the agent of his client are entitled to protection from disclosure, \u2019 and to a stray page in Professor Louisell\u2019s recent book, \u2018Modern California Discovery,\u2019 without more, fall far short of convincing this court that counsel ever had any reasonable grounds for believing what he says he believes with respect to work product and privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">\u201cThe conduct of counsel for defendant as outlined above cast a wholly unnecessary burden on counsel for plaintiff and on the court. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The present petition for a writ of prohibition followed. We deny the petition but, because of the frequency with which some of the problems herein involved are presented by counsel, we have determined to set forth our reasons in a formal manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">It is clear that none of the questions put to Robinson in any way involve privileged communications. By no stretch of the imagination can a statement made by the plaintiff to an investigator hired by the defendant be deemed to have been privileged; nor, under any circumstances, would the observations of that investigator at the time of taking her statement, nor the statements made <em>by Mm to her, </em>be within any privilege known to our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">While, under some circumstances, statements made by an employee of a defendant, concerning matters within his own knowledge, may be privileged (see <em>D. </em>I. <em>Chadbourne, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 723 [36 Cal.Rptr. 468, 388 P.2d 700]), the testimony here sought is not the statement of any employee of petitioning defendant as to the facts of the lawsuit, but information relating to the <em>conduct </em>of an investigator, dealing with other persons, none of whom are shown to be employees' of defendant or, in any way, in a position where they would have intended as confidential anything said to, or done with, the investigator. We can see no basis in any decided case for any claim of confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">Further, none of the questions seek any statement made by Robinson, either to his employer, or to defendant, or to counsel.  While communications between lawyer and client are privileged, the privilege does not extend to an independent inquiry, at trial or on deposition, as to the facts so communicated. As was said in <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Public Works </em>v. <em>Donovan </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 346, at page 355 [19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 473, 369 P.2d 1] : \u201cThis knowledge, in and of itself, is not privileged, nor does it acquire a privileged status merely because it may have been communicated to the attorney. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Nor can we see, under the facts of this case, any possible basis for a reliance on the so-called \u201cwork product\" doctrine. As the trial judge pointed out in his memorandum, Robinson was hired by an agent of the insurance carrier, not by defense counsel; the matters as to which he was questioned took place before the lawsuit was filed and (at least as far as the declarations show) long before counsel was retained by or on behalf of defendant.  Whatever the extent of the concept of an attorney\u2019s work product may be, it is clear that, given the broadest possible definition, it is still the <em>attorney\u2019s </em>work, or that of his agents or employees, that is involved, and the attorney cannot, by retroactive adoption, convert the independent work of another, already performed, into his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">In addition, as we have pointed out above, plaintiff does not seek, and the trial court did not order, any disclosure of any communication made to defense counsel, nor even communications made to the insurance carrier. All that is sought is the testimony of the investigator, working on his own, and not as an agent or employee of the attorney, as to what he said, did, observed and heard, while making his own investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">From tvhat has been said, it is clear that the trial court was justified not only in its order requiring answers, but in its assessment of attorney fees against counsel who, without justification, invoked rules patently not in point. The amount assessed was well within the discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">The petition for a writ of prohbition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">Burke, P. J., and Jefferson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">Petitioners\u2019 application for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied Hay 27, 1964.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The caption of the petition, as filed in this court, is defective, since it does not identify either petitioner Wilson nor petitioner Universal Underwriters Insurance Company as parties, nor does it designate the real party in interest. Since the petition itself contains data sufficient to identify these parties, we have corrected the caption on this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"Aog\">The nature of the beneficial interest of petitioner insurance company as to a deposition of an employee of its contractor is not readily apparent. (See 3 Within, Cal. Procedure, Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7 55, p. 2543); in light of the disposition we make of the petition, we assume, without deciding, that its interest was sufficient to enable it to join in the present proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b735-9\">\u201cWhen you went to inspect the car, was there a tire on the left rear side of the car? .. .
