James, Assistant Attorney General, Woodruff J. Deem, District Attorney, Edwin M. Osborne, Chief Criminal Deputy District Attorney, and Edwin L. Laing, Deputy District Attorney, for Plaintiff and Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b719-9\">ROTH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY6v\">Appellant was convicted by a jury of violating Health and Safety Code, section 11503 (furnishing of substance other than narcotic after having agreed to furnish narcotic).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">On August 3, 1961, an undercover narcotics agent, together with an informer named Perez, approached appellant who was sitting in a car with two other occupants, for the expressly stated purpose of buying narcotics and as a consequence of that encounter, appellant agreed to a sale to the undercover agent, but at a different time and place. Approximately 35 minutes later, the transaction was consummated. The substance sold was not a narcotic.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">Perez was not called as a witness by or for the prosecution, he was called by appellant who knew about his connection with the undercover agent, and appellant had Perez testify to this connection in detail. Perez thereafter testified, among other things, that he was with the undercover agent and had signaled the car in which appellant was sitting for the purpose of buying narcotics unlawfully. Appellant at this pointed stated, \u201cthis witness is obviously adverse and at this time the defense claims surprise and damage ... .\u201d Appellant then attempted to impeach Perez by introducing his testimony from the preliminary hearing which was contradictory to his testimony on the stand. The People objected and the court resolved the matter by ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>THE COURT: ... \u201cI still don\u2019t think there\u2019s legal surprise there, but ... I am going to give you a lot of latitude. ... You can take that [testimony at preliminary hearing] up question by question and ask him did you or didn\u2019t you. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">On cross-examination, the deputy district attorney, with no objection from appellant, asked the following questions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">\u201cQ. What does it mean to say you\u2019re going to burn someone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>You\u2019re going to take his money and you\u2019re not going to give him anything in return.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">\u201c Q. In other words, you\u2019re going to sell him turkey, or a non-narcotic, isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-10\">\u201cQ. Now, isn\u2019t it true that Mr. Contreras asked you if it was all right if he burned Agent Orosco ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-11\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-12\">\n<em>( C</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-13\">\u201cQ. And you told Agent Orosco, didn\u2019t you, that you felt that this sale might be a burn, or a sale of non-narcotics ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-14\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-15\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. This was after the sale had been completed, was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-16\">' \u2018 A. I don\u2019t remember, if it was after or before. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-17\">Under section 11503 of the Health and Safety Code, the law requires a showing of specific intent to furnish a substitute nonnarcotic for a narcotic. Appellant contends that the court erred in admitting testimony of Perez on cross-examination, showing such intent because it was elicited after the prosecution had completed the presentation of its case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-18\">The tactic of withholding with calculation a vital part of the People\u2019s case in chief for use in rebuttal, is frowned upon and will, under certain circumstances, be considered prejudicial error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>48 Cal.2d 737 [312 P.2d 665]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>58 Cal.App.2d 415 [136 P.2d 626].)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-19\">In the case at bar Perez was called by appellant with full knowledge of who he was and what he had testified to at the preliminary hearing. The questions which were asked of Perez on cross-examination by the People\" were proper. (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>Dotson, </em>46 Cal.2d 891 [299 P.2d 875]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>113 Cal.App.2d 43 [247 P.2d 717].)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-20\">The rule enunciated in <em>Carter </em>and <em>Rodriguez, {supra) </em>does not apply to the situation where the evidence is presented on cross-examination. In <em>Carter, </em>the prosecution attempted to introduce testimony on rebuttal that should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>have been introduced in its case in chief. The court held the evidence to be crucial, and that the prosecution had not justified its change in the order of proof. In <em>Rodriguez, </em>the court in dicta and speaking in respect of a different factual situation held it prejudicial for the prosecution to hold back evidence for use on <em>rebuttal </em>instead of in its ease in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The reason for the application of this rule almost ceases when the defense calls a witness and on proper cross-examination the prosecution brings out theretofore undisclosed evidence. To apply the so-called \u201cred-cap\u201d rule to the facts here would be an unjustifiable limitation on an adversary\u2019s right to cross-examine and cannot be sustained. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>164 Cal.App.2d 285 [330 P.2d 942].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Wholly aside from the merits of appellant\u2019s position it should be added that his failure to object on proper grounds at any time to the testimony here complained of during the trial is fatal on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rosoto, </em>58 Cal.2d 304, 343 [23 Cal.Rptr. 779, 373 P.2d 867]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wein, </em>50 Cal.2d 383, 407 [326 P.2d 457].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Fox, P. J., and Herndon, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
