Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 38, par. 12 \u2014 11(a)(2)), burglary (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 38, par. 19 \u2014 1), and murder (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 38, par. 9 \u2014 1). Following a jury trial, verdicts were returned finding each defendant guilty of home invasion and burglary and not guilty of murder as to each defendant. Each defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of five years for burglary and 12 years for home invasion. Each defendant asserts on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his oral and written confessions, and that he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in the absence of the confessions. We affirm.</p> <p id=\"b148-13\" pgmap=\"148(21) 149(118)\">On the evening of August 20, 1981, 12-year-old Jimmy Lopez, an eyewitness, went to the apartment of the victim, Robert Reynolds. Lopez watched television with the victim for awhile. Later, Racanelli, Lopez\u2019 cousin by marriage, stopped by the apartment. Lopez testified that around 10 p.m. he went to sleep in the victim\u2019s bedroom. Sometime later he woke up and saw the victim and Watters in the bedroom. The victim was staggering about the room with a stab wound in his back. Lopez then saw Watters stab the victim in the chest with a butcher knife. Lopez began screaming at Watters to stop. At this point, Racanelli looked into the bedroom and called, \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d to Watters. Lopez stated that Racanelli had a knife in his hand. Defendants then exited through the front door of the apartment.</p> <p id=\"b149-5\" pgmap=\"149\">After the defendants left, Lopez testified that he dressed, padlocked the bedroom door as Racanelli had requested, and left the apartment. On his way out of the apartment, he noticed that two television sets, a stereo, headphones, a radio, speakers and a clock were missing. Lopez stated that he then walked through a vacant apartment next door to that of the victim to get to the back door of the building. Lopez recognized some articles in this apartment, including the headphones and a lamp which had been in the victim\u2019s bedroom before he went to sleep. He opened a cupboard in the vacant apartment and saw the knife Watters used to stab the victim lying on the shelf. After leaving the building through the back door, Lopez went to his father\u2019s house.</p> <p id=\"b149-6\" pgmap=\"149\">Lopez testified that Racanelli telephoned him a few days later telling him to \u201ckeep his mouth quiet\u201d and that \u201cit wasn\u2019t supposed to happen like that.\u201d Until the police arrested Lopez on September 2, he did not talk with the police about the incident. After the police informed him that he was a prime suspect in the murder and that they intended to try him as an adult, he told them about Racanelli and Watters. Lopez then gave a written statement to Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Francis Mahon, Jr.</p> <p id=\"b149-7\" pgmap=\"149(147) 150(18)\">An assistant public defender, William Kunz, testified that on January 11, 1982, he was present during a conversation with Jimmy Lopez at the public defender\u2019s office. He testified that Lopez told him he did not see the stabbing but rather found the victim lying dead next to him on the bed, that he had sex with the victim for money that evening, that the police had beaten him, and that he had made a statement that the police had instructed him to make. On cross-examination, Kunz stated there was no record of the conversation, although he could have summoned a court reporter if he had chosen to do so. Lopez testified that he did not recall talking with anyone from the public defender\u2019s office. He further testified that he knew the victim was a homosexual but that he had never had sexual relations with him. Lopez stated that he never told the public defender\u2019s office that he did not see the stabbing.</p> <p id=\"b150-3\" pgmap=\"150\">Lopez\u2019 testimony regarding the items found in the adjacent apartment was corroborated by Zonhair Dajani, the manager of the victim\u2019s apartment building. Dajani testified that he found a lamp and headphones in the unlocked apartment on August 23. He also found a bloody knife on the shelf of a cabinet. Sharon Ellis, a microanalyst, testified that the victim\u2019s blood type matched that of the blood found on the knife and on the victim\u2019s bed.</p> <p id=\"b150-4\" pgmap=\"150\">I</p> <p id=\"b150-5\" pgmap=\"150\">Defendant Racanelli argues that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress his oral and written statements because the police and prosecution failed to inform him of charges pending against him. At the hearing on his motion to suppress, Racanelli testified that on September 12, 1981, while in Tennessee, he phoned Detective Sappanos because one Johnny Lopez said the police wanted him to be a witness. Sappanos then told him he wanted to use him as a witness but did not tell him there was a warrant for him. Racanelli agreed to come to Chicago and be a witness. On September 18, 1981, he called Sappanos and his partner, who came to Johnny Lopez\u2019 house to meet them. They did not tell him about the warrant, did not handcuff him, nor tell him he was under arrest. On cross-examination, Racanelli testified that he could not remember whether the State\u2019s Attorney had told him that he was just a witness. He stated that he admitted burglarizing an apartment only after he had been told that he could go home after he made a statement. Racanelli remembered being told that he could see a lawyer but was not sure when that occurred.</p> <p id=\"b150-6\" pgmap=\"150(158) 151(72)\">Detectives Thomas Keane and Thomas Sappanos testified that Racanelli called them at the police station on September 18 and that they arranged to meet him at Lopez\u2019 apartment for the purpose of Racanelli\u2019s surrender. Sappanos testified that he had informed Racanelli of the warrant during the telephone conversation on September 18 and in an earlier conversation with him on September 12. During the earlier conversation, Racanelli asked Sappanos what his, Racanelli\u2019s, alternatives were. After being told that an arrest warrant had been issued for his arrest and that he had the option to continue to flee or to surrender, Racanelli stated he would prefer to surrender in Chicago. Sappanos testified that although his police report did not reflect that he had told Racanelli there was a warrant for his arrest, his report did state that Racanelli was planning to surrender himself in the near future. Keane testified that Racanelli was told he was under arrest when they left Lopez\u2019 apartment and went with the police willingly. He was not handcuffed, fingerprinted or placed in a cell at the police station. Keane stated that he also told Racanelli there was a warrant for his arrest regarding the apartment burglary and murder. Both detectives testified that Racanelli was given Miranda warnings several times, which he indicated he understood, and that he never requested a lawyer.</p> <p id=\"b151-5\" pgmap=\"151\">After arriving at the police station, the detectives called Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Robert Kaiser. After Kaiser arrived, he spoke with Racanelli. Detective Keane was also present. Kaiser stated that Racanelli indicated he still wanted to talk to him after Kaiser had explained his office to Racanelli and had given him Miranda warnings. Racanelli indicated that he understood the warnings. After talking with him for about 15 minutes, Racanelli communicated his willingness to make a statement. Kaiser again gave the Miranda warnings. Racanelli stated he understood them and signed a waiver of rights form. Racanelli then made a statement in the presence of a court reporter, Sappanos, Keane and Kaiser admitting his involvement in the apartment burglary. Kaiser stated that he did not tell Racanelli he was only a witness and denied telling him that he would not need a lawyer. After hearing all the testimony, the trial court denied Racanelli\u2019s motion to suppress the statements made to the police.</p> <p id=\"b151-6\" pgmap=\"151(247) 152(25)\"> It is the function of the trier of fact to determine the credibility of the witnesses, the weight to be given their testimony and the inferences to be drawn from that evidence. (People v. Akis (1976), 63 Ill. 2d 296, 298, 347 N.E.2d 733.) Where the evidence is merely conflicting, a court of review will not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact. (63 Ill. 2d 296, 298-99, 347 N.E.2d 733.) In the instant case, Racanelli\u2019s contention with regard to the motion to suppress is essentially a question of credibility. The trial court specifically stated at the conclusion of the hearing that he believed the testimony of the prosecution witnesses. Viewing the case in that posture, the evidence indicates that Racanelli made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights before making his statement. If a defendant chooses to speak and does not request a lawyer after being informed of and understanding his Miranda rights, a court may properly find that he understood those rights and chose not to exercise them. (People v. Winston (1982), 106 Ill. App. 3d 673, 682, 435 N.E.2d 1327.) In this case, the decision of the trial court was well within the limitation on review that a trial court\u2019s findings on a motion to suppress should not be disturbed unless contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. (106 Ill. App. 3d 673, 683, 435 N.E.2d 1327.) Accordingly, this contention is without merit. We find that the trial court did not err in denying defendant Racanelli\u2019s motion to suppress his oral and written statements.</p> <p id=\"b152-5\" pgmap=\"152\"> Raeanelli additionally urges that the authorities\u2019 failure on September 12, 1981, to inform him of the charges pending against him violated his sixth amendment right to counsel. He maintains that formal adversary proceedings were initiated against him on September 3, when the murder complaint was signed against him and a murder warrant was issued for his arrest. He argues, therefore, that he was entitled to know of the pending charges and to have counsel present during his telephone conversations with the police on September 12 and 18. The State responds that Racanelli\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel did not attach on September 3, when an arrest warrant was issued on a complaint signed by a police officer, but instead it attached on November 2 when Raeanelli was indicted.</p> <p id=\"b152-6\" pgmap=\"152\">An individual\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel attaches at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information or arraignment. (Kirby v. Illinois (1972), 406 U.S. 682, 689, 32 L. Ed. 2d 411, 417, 92 S. Ct. 1877, 1881-82.) The initiation of adversary proceedings is determined by looking to the point at which the government has committed itself to prosecute and the adverse positions of the parties have solidified. 406 U.S. 682, 689, 32 L. Ed. 2d 411, 418, 92 S. Ct. 1877, 1882.</p> <p id=\"b152-7\" pgmap=\"152\"> Hlinois law provides that felony prosecutions must be commenced by indictment or information and not by complaint. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 38, pars. 111 \u2014 1, 111 \u2014 2.) Further, only the State\u2019s Attorney has the authority to file a felony charge, and a police officer is Without that authority to prosecute such a charge. (People v. Pankey (1983), 94 Ill. 2d 12, 19, 445 N.E.2d 284.) Thus, the State cannot be said to have filed a formal charge committing itself to the prosecution of Raeanelli simply with the filing of a complaint by a police officer.</p> <p id=\"b152-8\" pgmap=\"152(128) 153(12)\">Illinois courts have expressly held that the issuance of an arrest warrant does not formally charge a defendant with a crime. (People v. Mitchell (1983), 116 Ill. App. 3d 44, 47, 451 N.E.2d 934; People v. Dockery (1966), 72 Ill. App. 2d 345, 355, 219 N.E.2d 687.) An exception to this rule has been found when the filing of a complaint by a police officer is made at the direction of the State\u2019s Attorney. (People v. Owens (1984), 102 Ill. 2d 88, 101, 464 N.E.2d 261.) In the case at bar, the complaint for warrant was not filed at the request of the State\u2019s Attorney and the rule of Owens is not applicable. We therefore find that Racanelli\u2019s right to counsel did not apply to the telephone conversations and that his sixth amendment right to counsel was not violated.</p> <p id=\"b153-5\" pgmap=\"153\">II</p> <p id=\"b153-6\" pgmap=\"153\"> Defendant Watters contends that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress his oral and written statements in light of his low intelligence. Watters, 16 years old at the time of the homicide, testified at the suppression hearing that he was arrested at 5 a.m. when he was awakened by a police officer holding a gun to his head. At the police station, Watters was handcuffed and placed in a small room for about an hour. Two police officers gave him Miranda warnings. Watters testified that he asked to see a lawyer. The police told him that he could see a lawyer when he went to the Audy Home, a juvenile detention center. Watters testified that he did not understand that any statements he might make could be used against him. He also did not understand the warning that he could be tried as an adult. Watters stated that he did understand that he could have a lawyer if he wanted to talk. Watters testified that sometime later a man came into the room, read him Miranda rights, and asked him to sign a statement. The man read the statement and told Watters to read it. Watters initialed the bottom of each page of his statement and printed his name at the end.</p> <p id=\"b153-7\" pgmap=\"153\">Detective Sappanos testified that he and Detective Keane conducted the initial interview with Watters at the police station advising him of his rights. Watters indicated that he understood his rights. Sappanos testified that Watters seemed reasonably intelligent and denied telling Watters that he would have a lawyer at the Audy Home.</p> <p id=\"b153-8\" pgmap=\"153\">During a second interview with Watters, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Mahon testified that he told Watters he was not his attorney but that he worked with the police. He advised Watters of his Miranda rights. Watters stated that he understood his rights and that he was willing to talk. Because he was 16 years old, Mahon told Watters he could be tried as an adult. Watters stated that he understood. Prior to taking Watters\u2019 written statement, to which Watters agreed, Mahon explained what questions would be asked of him when the court reporter arrived.</p> <p id=\"b153-9\" pgmap=\"153(71) 154(13)\">A third conversation ensued in the presence of Mahon, a youth officer named Muscolino, and a court reporter. Watters was again read his rights. He admitted his involvement in the burglary, but stated that Racanelli had stabbed the victim. In addition to signing the written statement, Watters signed a written waiver of rights form. Mahon testified that Watters did not ask to see a lawyer nor did he request that questioning cease. When asked if he could read, Watters responded affirmatively.</p> <p id=\"b154-5\" pgmap=\"154\">Paula Bailey, a Cook County Juvenile Court psychologist, testified that she administered a standard battery of psychological tests to Watters. She testified that he did not exhibit any psychoses but that his results were at a preschool level. She further testified that he had an I.Q. of 54, which is in the moderately retarded range. In her opinion, Watters probably could not understand Miranda warnings unless they were explained in simpler language. On cross-examination, Bailey stated that because these tests were not designed specifically to determine if Watters understood the Miranda rights, she had no personal knowledge as to whether he in fact understood them. She also testified that Watters would not understand the warning that he could be tried as an adult, but probably understood the words \u201ccourt,\u201d \u201cjudge,\u201d \u201clawyer,\u201d \u201csilent,\u201d \u201cfree,\u201d and \u201cno charge.\u201d The witness testified that Watters had six prior station adjustments, three prior referrals to juvenile court, and was probably \u201cstreet-wise.\u201d At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found that Watters waived his Miranda rights and denied his motion to suppress his statements made while in police custody.</p> <p id=\"b154-6\" pgmap=\"154\">The determination of whether an accused has waived his Miranda rights depends on whether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights. The inquiry as to whether, defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights focuses on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation. (Fare v. Michael C. (1979), 442 U.S. 707, 724-25, 61 L. Ed. 2d 197, 212, 99 S. Ct. 2560, 2571-72, reh\u2019g denied (1979), 444 U.S. 887, 62 L. Ed. 2d 121, 100 S. Ct. 186, quoting North Carolina v. Butler (1979), 441 U.S. 369, 373, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286, 292, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 1757.) When regarding the totality of the circumstances, both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation must be considered. People v. Stone (1978), 61 \u2022 5. App. 3d 654, 659, 378 N.E.2d 263.</p> <p id=\"b154-7\" pgmap=\"154(113) 155(116)\"> The characteristics of the accused which must be examined are those which bear upon his ability to make knowledgeable and independent decisions. Pertinent factors are the defendant\u2019s age, intelligence, prior experience with the criminal law and emotional stability. (People v. Stone (1978), 61 Ill. App. 3d 654, 659, 378 N.E.2d 263.) Although subnormal mental capacity alone does not render a confession involuntary, it is a factor to be considered in determining the voluntariness and the admissibility of a confession. (People v. Murphy (1978), 72 Ill. 2d 421, 437, 381 N.E.2d 677; People v. Hester (1968), 39 Ill. 2d 489, 500, 237 N.E.2d 466.) Juvenile confessions are to be carefully reviewed to ensure that they are voluntary and not coerced, suggested, or the product of a juvenile\u2019s ignorance of rights, his adolescent fantasy, fright or despair. (People v. Avery (1980), 88 Ill. App. 3d 771, 775, 410 N.E.2d 1093.) While the prosecution bears a heavy burden of establishing that a statement was made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily, where a trial court so finds after application of the proper legal standard, review is limited to whether that finding is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. People v. Kincaid (1981), 87 Ill. 2d 107, 116-18, 429 N.E.2d 508, cert, denied (1982), 455 U.S. 1024, 72 L. Ed. 2d 144,102 S. Ct. 1726.</p> <p id=\"b155-5\" pgmap=\"155\"> In the instant case, the trial court found that the confession was voluntary and stated that:</p> <blockquote id=\"b155-6\" pgmap=\"155\">\u201cI have testimony before me from a woman who claims that from her testing, at times some part of the test, he demonstrated the ability of a five-year-old or a seven-year-old. I have to take that into consideration. That is part of the totality, but I think his responses and the questions and the degree of difficulty that he might have with the questions that might appear difficult to a person of low intelligence, I think I have to consider all of that.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b155-7\" pgmap=\"155\">This statement demonstrates that the trial court did in fact apply the proper standard in evaluating the admissibility of the statements. This finding was supported by evidence that Watters could understand various words, that he appeared to understand the warnings, that he in fact told the police that he understood the warnings, that he testified that he knew he could talk with a lawyer, and that he had had some prior experience with the criminal court system. Although Bailey testified on Watters\u2019 behalf, the trial court specifically stated that her testimony was not persuasive. The trial court need not accept an expert\u2019s conclusions of fact. (People v. Grice (1984), 121 Ill. App. 3d 567, 568, 459 N.E.2d 1122.) Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s decision was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p> <p id=\"b155-8\" pgmap=\"155(121) 156(23)\">Watters cites People v. Redmon (1984), 127 Ill. App. 3d 342, 468 N.E.2d 1310, in support of his position. In Redmon, the defendant expressly stated during an interview with the police that he did not understand his right to talk to and be represented by a lawyer while being questioned. After this was explained, he asked that questioning cease. Defendant never signed a written waiver of rights form. In contrast in the instant case, Watters indicated at all times during questioning that he understood his rights. According to his own testimony at trial, he understood at the time he was questioned that he could have an attorney if he was willing to talk with the police. Testimony at trial revealed that Watters had several prior experiences with the law while the Redmon defendant had not. We find Redmon inapposite.</p> <p id=\"b156-5\" pgmap=\"156\">Ill</p> <p id=\"b156-6\" pgmap=\"156\"> Both defendants advance the argument that they were not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in the absence of their confessions. We disagree. Furthermore, as discussed earlier, the trial court did not err in denying either defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements admitting participation in the homicide. A reviewing court will not reverse a criminal conviction unless the evidence is so improbable as to raise a a reasonable doubt of a defendant\u2019s guilt. (People v. Manion (1977), 67 Ill. 2d 564, 578, 367 N.E.2d 1313, cert, denied (1978), 435 U.S. 937, 55 L. Ed. 2d 533, 98 S. Ct. 1513.) In a jury trial, it is the function of the jury to determine the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony. (People v. Akis (1976), 63 Ill. 2d 296, 298, 347 N.E.2d 733.) A court of review will not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact where the evidence is merely conflicting. 63 Ill. 2d 296, 298-99, 347 N.E.2d 733.</p> <p id=\"b156-7\" pgmap=\"156\"> The material elements of the offense of burglary are entry into a building without authority, or remaining after authority to enter has been withdrawn, with the intent to commit a felony or theft. (People v. Sansone (1981), 94 Ill. App. 3d 271, 273, 418 N.E.2d 862.) Defendants\u2019 entry into the victim\u2019s apartment, although initially with the victim\u2019s authority, exceeded that authority when they attacked the victim and removed his property. (See People v. Hudson (1983), 113 Ill. App. 3d 1041, 1044-45, 448 N.E.2d 178.) Defendants\u2019 confessions, coupled with inferences drawn from Lopez\u2019 testimony, establish the specific intent to commit a burglary. Lopez testified that certain items which were in the apartment when he arrived were missing when he left. He recognized several of these articles in the vacant next-door apartment as he exited the building. We find there was sufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants were guilty of burglary.</p> <p id=\"b156-8\" pgmap=\"156(93) 157(62)\"> Home invasion is the entry without authority of the dwelling place of another by a person not a peace officer acting in the line of duty, knowing that one or more persons is present and intentionally causing injury to any person within such dwelling place. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 38. par. 12 \u2014 11(a)(2).) The words \u201cwithout authority\u201d have the same meaning under the home invasion statute as they do under the burglary statute. (People v. Hudson (1983), 113 Ill. App. 3d 1041, 1045, 448 N.E.2d 178.) Therefore, defendants\u2019 presence in the apartment was without authority once they attacked the victim and removed his belongings from the apartment. Both defendants knew that the victim was present at the time. Lopez testified that he saw Watters stab the victim before Watters and Racanelli fled. We find that the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendants were proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of home invasion.</p> <p id=\"b157-5\" pgmap=\"157\">For the reasons stated, the judgment finding defendants guilty of burglary and home invasion are affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b157-6\" pgmap=\"157\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b157-7\" pgmap=\"157\">SULLIVAN, J.,</author> <p id=\"ALV\" pgmap=\"157\">concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b157-8\" pgmap=\"157\">JUSTICE PINCHAM,</author> <p id=\"Am8\" pgmap=\"157\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b157-9\" pgmap=\"157\">I dissent. These defendants should have been granted a severance. Their conflicting defenses during their joint trial violated each defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair and impartial trial. Moreover, the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish their commission of burglary or home invasion. In addition, Joseph Racanelli\u2019s confession was extracted from him in violation of his Federal and State constitutional right to counsel. His confession therefore should have been suppressed.</p> <p id=\"b157-10\" pgmap=\"157\">I</p> <p id=\"b157-11\" pgmap=\"157\">Joseph Racanelli and Johnny Watters were charged in an indictment with the offenses of murder, armed robbery, burglary, theft, home invasion and armed violence. The offenses were alleged to have been committed in Cook County on August 21, 1981, and Robert Reynolds was the alleged victim.</p> <p id=\"b157-12\" pgmap=\"157\">On their arraignment on the indictment, the public defender of Cook County was appointed as attorney for Joseph Racanelli and private attorney Robin Harris was appointed to represent Johnny Watters. Each defendant entered a plea of not guilty.</p> <p id=\"b157-13\" pgmap=\"157(93) 158(35)\">The defendants separately confessed, but each defendant denied the fatal stabbing of the deceased and attributed it to the other. Defendant Watters filed a motion for a severance of his trial from the trial of his codefendant Racanelli on the grounds that Racanelli had made \u201coral and written statements implicating\u201d Watters; that Racanelli\u2019s defense was \u201cin conflict with, inconsistent with and antagonistic toward\u201d Watters and that Watters could not obtain \u201ca fair and impartial trial [with Racanelli] because of the prejudice created by the inconsistent, conflicting and antagonistic defenses.\u201d Racanelli\u2019s attorney filed a similar severance motion and requested that Racanelli be tried separate from his codefendant Watters. Both defendants filed motions to suppress their respective confessions, and after evidentiary hearings their suppression motions were denied.</p> <p id=\"b158-5\" pgmap=\"158\">Four days later, on July 14, 1982, the defendants\u2019 severance motions were before the court, at which time Thomas Davy, the assistant State\u2019s Attorney, stated to the court, \u201cI believe both counsels [for the defendants] have filed motions for severance based on statements, based on inconsistent defenses. The State, having reviewed the motions and the applicable law, I believe that a motion for severance would lie in this particular case so we would not be objecting to that.\u201d The court granted the severance motions.</p> <p id=\"b158-6\" pgmap=\"158\">Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Donald Devlin, however, on December 14, 1982, requested the trial judge to reconsider his allowance of the defendants\u2019 severance motions and asked the court to deny the motions. After considerable argument by the attorneys in support of and in opposition to the State\u2019s request that the court reconsider its severance ruling, the trial judge denied the motion for reconsideration and stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to let my order of severance stand.\u201d Thereupon, in apparent dissatisfaction with the court\u2019s ruling, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Devlin requested \u201cthat both defendants be tried in front of two juries at the same time.\u201d Defense counsel objected, and after stating that he needed \u201ctime to think about it,\u201d the trial judge set a trial date for both defendants.</p> <p id=\"b158-7\" pgmap=\"158\">On February 28, 1983, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Devlin again requested the trial judge to reconsider his allowance of the severance motions. The defendants again objected, but this time the trial judge granted the State\u2019s request and \u201callow[ed] the defendants to be joined\u201d for trial. Thereupon, the State\u2019s motion to nol-pros the armed robbery, theft and armed violence counts was allowed. The jury selection began and was concluded on March 1, 1983.</p> <p id=\"b158-8\" pgmap=\"158\">A thorough search of the record on appeal fails to reveal what legitimate prosecutorial advantage was sought or obtained by the joint trial of these defendants. It is quite apparent, however, that the infelicitous advantage sought and obtained by the joint trial of the defendants was the presentation to the jury of the defendants\u2019 confessed involvement in the offenses and each defendant\u2019s attribution of the fatal stabbing of the deceased to the other.</p> <p id=\"b158-9\" pgmap=\"158(50) 159(217)\">During the trial, Jimmy Lopez, a State\u2019s witness, testified that at about 7 or 8 p.m. on August 20, 1981, he went to apartment 93 at 4240 North Clarendon, the apartment of the deceased, Robert Reynolds; that he had known Reynolds for about a year and a half and knew that he was a homosexual. Lopez testified that Reynolds was present when he arrived, that he and Reynolds watched T.Y. in the living room, and that later the defendant, Joseph Racanelli, came to the apartment. Lopez stated that after watching T.V., at about 10:30 p.m. he (Lopez) went into the bedroom and went to sleep. Lopez testified that when he awakened the following morning he saw Robert Reynolds and the defendant Johnny Watters in the bedroom and that Reynolds \u201cwas staggering around the floor with a stab wound in his back.\u201d Lopez testified that he (Lopez) \u201cstarted yelling,\u201d that Watters stabbed Reynolds in the chest with a butcher knife and that Reynolds fell on the bed. Lopez stated that Racanelli, with a knife in his hand, then stuck his head in the door and said to Watters, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Racanelli and Watters left out the front door. Lopez stated that he got dressed, locked the apartment door and also left. He stated that in leaving the building he went through apartment 90, an empty apartment on the same floor, and there on the floor he saw Reynold\u2019s property \u2014 a T.V., a stereo set, headphones, radio, speaker, radio alarm clock, and the knife with which Reynolds had been stabbed by Watters.</p> <p id=\"b159-5\" pgmap=\"159\">The testimony elicited on cross-examination of Lopez and the other prosecution witnesses by the defense attorneys are classic examples of shifting the responsibility for the offenses from one defendant to the other.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But each defendant, of course, in his defense had the right to endeavor to exculpate himself from involvement in the offenses and attribute the commission of the offenses to someone else, including a codefendant. The attorney for each defendant was obligated to staunchly and with vigorous tenacity present and pursue such defense. These rights of the defendants and this obligation of their attorneys were not and could not be curtailed, restricted or diminished by the expediency of a joint trial of the defendants.</p> <p id=\"b159-6\" pgmap=\"159(86) 160(44)\">Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Francis J. Mahon, a State witness, testified to the facts and circumstances surrounding Watters\u2019 written confession to him, after which he read Watters\u2019 confession to the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Watters confessed that on August 21, 1981, at about 5:30 a.m., he was in Reynolds\u2019 apartment at 4240 North Clarendon with Joseph Racanelli to take Reynolds\u2019 property. Reynolds woke up and Racanelli stabbed him in the chest with a butcher knife. Lopez told Racanelli to stop. Watters and Racanelli put Reynolds\u2019 T.V., radio, earphones and other property in an empty apartment next door and left. When Racanelli\u2019s attorney requested the trial judge to inform the jury that Watters\u2019 confession was admitted only as to Watters, the trial judge responded, \u201cThe jury will be instructed at the proper time.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b160-5\" pgmap=\"160\">Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Robert Kaiser, a State witness, testified to the facts and circumstances surrounding Racanelli\u2019s confession on September 18, 1981.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Kaiser was then requested to read Racanelli\u2019s confession to the jury. Watters\u2019 attorney asked the trial judge to admonish the jury that Racanelli\u2019s confession was not to be considered as evidence against Watters. The trial judge again responded, \u201cThey will be instructed at the proper time.\u201d Kaiser then read Racanelli\u2019s confession to the jury.</p> <p id=\"b160-6\" pgmap=\"160\">In his confession Racanelli stated that on the evening of August 21, 1981, at Reynolds\u2019 invitation, Racanelli went to Reynolds\u2019 house and started drinking with Reynolds, and that Racanelli and Reynolds drank about a quart of Bacardi. Reynolds got drunk and went to sleep, after which Racanelli and Watters moved Reynolds\u2019 household articles to an empty apartment. While Racanelli was in the empty apartment, he heard Lopez holler. Racanelli returned to Reynolds\u2019 apartment \u201cto see what was happening,\u201d and that he saw Reynolds fall away from Watters, who had a knife in his hand. Watters stabbed Reynolds and Racanelli asked Watters, \u201cWhy did [he] do it?\u201d Later that morning Racanelli gave Watters $30 for Watters\u2019 share of the purloined articles. Racanelli disposed of Reynolds\u2019 property by sale or gift.</p> <p id=\"b160-7\" pgmap=\"160\">The joint trial of Racanelli and Watters created an impermissible imbroglio that could have been and rightly should have been avoided, simply by a severance. The jury had before it three conflicting versions of the brutal and heinous homicide of Reynolds presented by the State, i.e., the Lopez version, the Watters version, and the Racanelli version. These contradictory renditions were aggravated by the defense attorneys\u2019 cross-examination of the State\u2019s witness, pursuant to their duty to zealously represent their respective clients, even in an antagonistic defense posture. Their numerous mistrial motions were imperviously overruled.</p> <p id=\"b160-8\" pgmap=\"160(54) 161(6)\">Neither defendant testified. The only testimony presented on their defense was that of William Kunz, an assistant public defender, to prove up Lopez\u2019 impeachment, i.e., that Lopez had said that he did not see the Reynolds\u2019 stabbing. The other defense witness, Paula Bailey, a clinical psychologist, testified that she tested Watters and con-eluded that he was intellectually subnormal.</p> <p id=\"b161-5\" pgmap=\"161\">The assistant State\u2019s Attorneys vociferously argued to the jury, with what they perceived to be convincing persuasion, that the evidence abundantly established the guilt of each defendant of murder and the other offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b161-6\" pgmap=\"161\">The only admonition the trial judge gave the jury regarding one defendant\u2019s confession being inadmissible against the other was Illinois Pattern Jury Instruction (IPI), Criminal, No. 3.08 (2d ed. 1981), that \u201c[a] statement made by one defendant may not be considered by you against any other defendant.\u201d This instruction was nothing but a futile and trivial collocation of words. The trial judge also instructed the jury on accountability (IPI Criminal 2d No. 5.03), that \u201c[a] person is legally responsible for the conduct of another person when *** he knowingly *** aid[s] the other person in the planning or commission of the offense.\u201d The trial judge thereafter encompassed the accountability instruction in the issues instructions on the State\u2019s burden of proof to sustain the charges of murder, home invasion and burglary, IPI Criminal 2d Nos. 7.02, 11.22 and 14.06, as to the defendant Racanelli, and then repeated the same instructions as to the defendant Watters.</p> <p id=\"b161-7\" pgmap=\"161\">The jury retired to deliberate. The defendants\u2019 repeated and renewed motion for a mistrial, because of the prejudice occasioned by the defendants\u2019 joint trial, was again overruled.</p> <p id=\"b161-8\" pgmap=\"161\">During their deliberation, the jury sent out the accountability instruction along with a handwritten note which read:</p> <blockquote id=\"b161-9\" pgmap=\"161\">\u201cJudge, for home invasion purpose, will you please clarify the definition of, (1) intentionally \u2014 if injury caused intentionally?, or if intent present on entering premises? (2) injury \u2014 personal or monetary?\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b161-10\" pgmap=\"161(132) 162(63)\">The trial judge responded with a note to the jury which read, \u201cYou have heard all the evidence and received all the instruction you are entitled to.\u201d During their deliberation the following day, the jury sent the trial judge two notes, along with two instructions. One of the instructions was on accountability, IPI Criminal 2d No. 5.03, previously set forth. The other instruction was IPI Criminal 2d No. 3.05, which had been given them and which read, \u201cYou should give separate consideration to each defendant. Each is entitled to have his case decided on the evidence and the law which is applicable to him. Any evidence which was limited to one defendant should not be considered by you as to the other defendant.\u201d One of the jury\u2019s notes inquired, \u201cWhat degree of murder is being tried? What latitudes are given in reference to a lesser charge?\u201d The other jury\u2019s note stated, \u201cOne of their statements is contradictory of the other.\u201d The trial judge pondered whether the jury was referring to the defendants\u2019 statements (confessions), which the jury had in the jury room. The judge directed the jury to continue its deliberation.</p> <p id=\"b162-5\" pgmap=\"162\">The prosecutors\u2019 perception of the persuasiveness of the State\u2019s evidence was erroneous. The ignominious prosecutorial advantage of the defendants\u2019 joint trial failed to fully achieve the ultimate intended purpose. The jury returned verdicts finding both defendants not guilty of the murder. However, both defendants were found guilty of burglary and home invasion, on which findings the court sentenced each defendant to concurrent imprisonment terms of five and 12 years, respectively.</p> <p id=\"b162-6\" pgmap=\"162\">Defendant Joseph Racanelli asserted in his post-trial motion that, \u201cThe court erred for two reasons. First, the statements which were then allowed into evidence in the trial of each defendant were inconsistent and deprived each defendant of his right to confrontation. Bruton v. United States (1968), 391 U.S. 123, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476, 88 S. Ct. 1620. Second, the defenses were so inconsistent that a single trial deprived each man of a fair trial. ***. More importantly, the two defendants were put into a position with antagonistic defenses, accusing each other of the crimes charged. On at least five occasions during trial and more-so during closing argument, defense counsel for Watters implied or tried to prove that Joseph Racanelli was framing Johnny Watters, and that Joseph Racanelli committed the murder, home invasion and burglary with Jimmy Lopez.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b162-7\" pgmap=\"162(128) 163(50)\">The conflict between these defendants was not resolved by and did not terminate on the jury\u2019s burglary and home invasion guilty findings, or the imprisonment sentences imposed thereon. In fact, after the trial judge had admonished the defendants of their right to appeal, Racanelli\u2019s attorney, an assistant public defender, responded, \u201cMr. Racanelli intends to appeal. I have not prepared the notice of appeal at this time. Could I present it to your Honor later on today for signing for appointment of the public defender?\u201d (Emphasis added.) Watters\u2019 court-appointed private attorney thereupon stated, \u201cJudge, Mr. Watters is also going to appeal, but somebody, I assume, other than the public defender would have to be appointed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Nevertheless, before this court, on this appeal, both defendants are represented by the same attorney, the public defender of Cook County, and in the defendants\u2019 joint brief the trial court\u2019s denial of their severance motions and the prejudice of their antagonistic defenses on their joint trial are not assigned by their appeal attorney as grounds for reversal.</p> <p id=\"b163-5\" pgmap=\"163\">It is provided in Illinois Supreme Court Rule 615 (87 Ill. 2d R. 615(a)) that on appeal, \u201cPlain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the trial court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 severance motions and their antagonistic defenses were brought to the attention of the trial court in the instant case, but this would not cause Supreme Court Rule 615 to be inoperative before this court; rather, it enhances its application here. People v. Crossno (1981), 93 Ill. App. 3d 808, 417 N.E.2d 827; People v. Benniefield (1980), 88 Ill. App. 3d 150, 410 N.E.2d 455; People v. Lagardo (1967), 82 Ill. App. 2d 119, 226 N.E.2d 492.</p> <p id=\"b163-6\" pgmap=\"163\">II</p> <p id=\"b163-7\" pgmap=\"163\">Thus, the threshold sua sponte question presented on this appeal is the ability of the defendants\u2019 attorney to firmly and loyally advocate the interest of each defendant before this court. I present this issue; however, I find it unnecessary to resolve it, because in my opinion the evidence is legally insufficient to sustain the guilty findings of burglary and home invasion.</p> <p id=\"b163-8\" pgmap=\"163\">In their confessions the defendants accused each other of committing the homicide. Each assigned antagonistic defenses in the trial court as grounds for their severance motions. Their separate attorneys, by cross-examination and by their arguments to the jury, endeavored to exonerate their respective clients by affixing guilt to the other defendant. Can a single attorney now before this court, with zeal, fidelity and integrity, simultaneously pursue the rights and interests of both defendants?</p> <p id=\"b163-9\" pgmap=\"163(114) 164(104)\">In People v. Echols (1978), 74 Ill. 2d 319, 385 N.E.2d 644, Johnny Wilson, Kenneth Echols and his brother, William Echols, were tried before a jury for a June 5, 1974, burglary of a Decatur tavern. All three defendants were represented by the public defender. During the trial, the evidence established the defendants\u2019 presence at the rear door of the burglarized tavern. The trial evidence further established the presence of three unidentified men at the drive-up window of the closed tavern. The defendants were arrested some distance from the tavern in an automobile, in the trunk of which property from the burglarized tavern was discovered. A fingerprint was found on a piece of broken glass from the tavern\u2019s drive-up window. The fingerprint on the broken glass matched the fingerprint on a fingerprint card (State\u2019s exhibit No. 11) bearing the name Kenneth Echols. An officer testified that he assisted Kenneth Echols in placing his fingerprint on the fingerprint card. When asked to identify the person whom he assisted in placing his fingerprint on the exhibit, the officer did not identify the defendant Kenneth Echols, rather he mistakenly identified the defendant Johnny Wilson. Thereupon, out of the jury\u2019s presence, the State sought to obtain the fingerprints of Wilson and Echols. Their attorney successfully resisted the effort.</p> <p id=\"b164-5\" pgmap=\"164\">Testimony was admitted that the fingerprint on the fingerprint card was identical to the print found on the tavern\u2019s broken drive-up window glass. In closing argument, the defendants\u2019 attorney argued that the ambiguity of the fingerprint evidence diminished its probative value as to all the defendants. He did not argue that the print did not belong to Wilson. In fact, it did not belong to Wilson. It belonged to Kenneth Echols. The State argued to the jury that the print belonged to Echols and the officer was confused by the resemblance between Echols and Wilson. The Echols brothers and Wilson were found guilty of burglary. The supreme court reversed and held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b164-6\" pgmap=\"164\">\u201c[Wilson] contends that the facts of this case demonstrate such hostility between his interests and those of the Echols brothers that the public defender could not adequately represent all three. We agree, and hold that the public defender\u2019s representation of the Echols brothers prevented the public defender from loyally representing [Wilson], thereby denying [Wilson] the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution, and by section 8 of article I of our constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, sec. 8).</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b164-7\" pgmap=\"164\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b164-8\" pgmap=\"164\">[WJhere such hostility [between defendants] is shown to exist, the joint representation of the conflicting interests denies a defendant the effective assistance of counsel, and such denial is presumed to be prejudicial. [Citations.]</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b164-10\" pgmap=\"164\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b164-11\" pgmap=\"164(60) 165(75)\">Finally, [Wilson] also argues that once the confusion occurred regarding the source of the fingerprint it became obvious that counsel could not give undivided loyalty to both Johnny Wilson and Kenneth Echols. We agree. As the State now concedes, and as the public defender should have known, the fingerprint on the window was not that of [Wilson]. Nonetheless, the public defender resisted the State\u2019s and the court\u2019s efforts to make that fact clear. Once the confusion occurred regarding the fingerprint, [Wilson\u2019s] interests and those of the Echols brothers diverged dramatically. It requires no speculation to reach the conclusion that competent, independent counsel would have advised [Wilson] to resolve that confusion, and would have argued in closing that, on balance, given all of the evidence, [Wilson] never entered the tavern.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b165-5\" pgmap=\"165\">Thus, there was a material hostility between the interests of [Wilson] and Kenneth Echols, and the public defender\u2019s commitment to Kenneth Echols prevented the public defender from representing [Wilson] with undivided loyalty. [Wilson] therefore was denied the effective assistance of counsel, which denial was prejudicial and was not waived by [Wilson\u2019s] silence.\u201d People v. Echols (1978), 74 Ill. 2d 319, 326, 326-29. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b165-6\" pgmap=\"165\">In Echols, the hostility between the defendants arose during the trial, out of the State\u2019s efforts to convict the defendants. In the case at bar, the hostility between the defendants occurred long before the trial, when they confessed and exculpated themselves and inculpated each other. Their antagonism was intensified throughout their joint trial. Their hostility before this court is therefore even more devastating.</p> <p id=\"b165-7\" pgmap=\"165\">In People v. Nelson (1980), 82 Ill. 2d 67, 411 N.E.2d 261, separate assistant public defenders represented the two defendants on their McLean County joint burglary charge. The defendant John Rogers pleaded guilty. On the defendant William Nelson\u2019s jury trial, the codefendant Rogers was called as a defense witness. Rogers had not been sentenced on his guilty plea, and he relied on his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination in refusing to answer the questions of Nelson\u2019s attorney. The jury found Nelson guilty. On appeal before the supreme court, Nelson argued for reversal that in the joint representation of the defendants by the public defenders in the trial court, there was a conflict of interest which denied his constitutional guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel. In Nelson, the supreme court disagreed with Nelson\u2019s contention, but in so doing stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b165-8\" pgmap=\"165(60) 166(18)\">\u201cThe rule, long established in this jurisdiction, is that a criminal defendant in need of representation is entitled to have appointed for him counsel who is free from adverse interests which might prejudice such representation. [Citation.] In furtherance of this principle, it has likewise long been held that an attorney should not be required to represent codefendants whose defenses are inconsistent, since to do so would inevitably prejudice the defense of at least one client.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b166-3\" pgmap=\"166\">***. The question to be addressed in cases where codefendants are jointly represented by one attorney or entity is whether there was an \u2018 \u201cactual conflict of interest manifested at trial.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] Once such an actual conflict is identified, it is unnecessary for a defendant to demonstrate that prejudice resulted therefrom in order to sustain a finding of a violation of the right to counsel. [Citations.] In formulating that rule, this court relied on Glasser v. United States (1942), 315 U.S. 60, 75-76, 86 L. Ed. 680, 702, 62 S. Ct. 457, 467, where it was said:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b166-4\" pgmap=\"166\">\u2018To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained *** is at once difficult and unnecessary. The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.\u2019 \u201d People v. Nelson (1980), 82 Ill. 2d 67, 71-73. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b166-5\" pgmap=\"166\">As before stated, I do not resolve this conflict of attorney issue because the convictions should be reversed. The evidence is legally insufficient to establish that either defendant committed burglary or home invasion.</p> <p id=\"b166-6\" pgmap=\"166\">Ill</p> <p id=\"b166-7\" pgmap=\"166\">The next sua sponte issue presented by this appeal is the validity of the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 severance motions. Section 114 \u2014 8 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 38, par. 114 \u2014 8) provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b166-8\" pgmap=\"166\">\u201cMotion for Severance. If it appears that a defendant or the State is prejudiced by a joinder of related prosecutions or defendants in a single charge or by joinder of separate charges or defendants for trial the court may order separate trials, grant a severance of defendants, or provide other relief as justice may require.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b166-9\" pgmap=\"166\">It is quite apparent from the contents of the defendants\u2019 confessions, their severance motions and the assistant State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s initial acquiescence in the defendants\u2019 severance motions that the defendants would be (and were in fact) prejudiced by their joint trial and that their severance motions should have been permanently allowed. Instead, the trial judge committed a grievous error when he shifted, abandoned his initial order, reversed himself and denied the severance motions.</p> <p id=\"b167-4\" pgmap=\"167\">The joint trial of the defendants was not only a contest between the State and the defendants, but it was also a lateral cross-accusation match between the defendants. The joint trial of the defendants was a mockery and farcical display of the adversary system between the State and the accused. It eviscerated the State\u2019s burden to prove the defendants\u2019 guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p> <p id=\"b167-5\" pgmap=\"167\">In the United States Supreme Court landmark decision of Bruton v. United States (1968), 391 U.S. 123, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476, 88 S. Ct. 1620, the question presented was \u201cwhether the conviction of a defendant at a joint trial should be set aside although the jury was instructed that a codefendant\u2019s confession inculpating the defendant had to be disregarded in determining his guilt or innocence.\u201d Bruton and Evans were jointly tried before a jury on a Federal charge of armed postal robbery. A postal inspector testified that Evans orally confessed to him that he and Bruton committed the robbery. Pursuant to Delli Paoli v. United States (1957), 352 U.S. 232, 1 L. Ed. 2d 278, 77 S. Ct. 294, the trial judge instructed the jury that Evans\u2019 confession was inadmissible hearsay against Bruton and had to be disregarded in determining Bruton\u2019s innocence or guilt. The court of appeals affirmed. The Supreme Court overruled Belli Paoli and reversed, holding:</p> <blockquote id=\"b167-6\" pgmap=\"167\">\u201c[Bjecause of the substantial risk that the jury, despite instructions to the contrary, looked to the incriminating extrajudicial statements in determining petitioner\u2019s guilt, admission of Evans\u2019 confession in this joint trial violated petitioner\u2019s right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b167-7\" pgmap=\"167\">*** [I]n Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, we confirmed \u2018that the right of cross-examination is included in the right of an accused in a criminal case to confront the witnesses against him\u2019 secured by the Sixth Amendment, id., at 404; \u2018a major reason underlying the constitutional confrontation rule is to give a defendant charged with crime an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses against him.\u2019</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b167-8\" pgmap=\"167\">*** Plainly, the introduction of Evans\u2019 confession added substantial, perhaps even critical, weight to the Government\u2019s case in a form not subject to cross-examination, since Evans did not take the stand. [Bruton] thus was denied his constitutional right of confrontation.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b167-9\" pgmap=\"167\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b167-10\" pgmap=\"167(30) 168(77)\">Here the introduction of Evans\u2019 confession posed a substantial threat to [Bruton\u2019s] right to confront the witnesses against him, and this is a hazard we cannot ignore. Despite the concededly clear instructions to the jury to disregard Evans\u2019 inadmissible hearsay evidence inculpating [Bruton], in the context of a joint trial we cannot accept limiting instructions as an adequate substitute for petitioner\u2019s constitutional right of cross-examination.

Miller (1968), 40 Ill. 2d 154, 238 N.E.2d 407, the motion of defendant Babitsch for a separate trial from his codefendant Miller on the ground that Miller had made a post-arrest statement incriminating Babitsch was denied. The trial court ordered the prosecutor to delete from Miller\u2019s statement any reference to Babitsch. Nevertheless the officer who arrested Miller testified that Miller denied committing the abortion for which the defendants were on trial, but that Miller admitted that defendant Babitsch performed the abortion and said, \u2018We spent the money.\u201d The supreme court reversed and held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b168-6\" pgmap=\"168\">\u201cThe defendant Babitsch argues that the court should have granted a severance because of the incriminating statement of Miller and also that the admission in evidence of this incriminating statement constituted prejudicial error. It is the rule that when a motion for separate trial is based on the foot that a co-defendant\u2019s confession implicates the moving defendant a severance should be granted unless the prosecution declares that the admission will not be offered in evidence at the trial, or if offered that there will be eliminated therefrom any and all reference to the party applying for a severance. (People v. Clark, 17 Ill. 2d 486, 490.) In the Clark case a severance was granted but a confession of a co-defendant implicating the defendant was admitted in evidence with a cautionary instruction that it should not be considered by the jury insofar as the defendant\u2019s guilt was concerned. We held that the admission of such evidence was reversible error in spite of the cautionary instruction.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b168-7\" pgmap=\"168(98) 169(29)\">***. In the present case, Babitsch had requested a severance based upon the possibility that Miller\u2019s statement incriminating him might be admitted in evidence. The court denied the request for a separate trial and the very thing which Babitsch had feared occurred. The testimony of the officer that Miller told him that Babitsch performed the abortion was so highly prejudicial to Babitsch that a new trial is required. The State contends that the jury was properly admonished not to consider the evidence. Even if the ruling on evidence on which the State relies could be so construed, the prejudicial effect of the testimony would remain and would be sufficient to require reversal.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

Also, in both cases, the court concluded that reversal was required despite a cautionary instruction given concerning the evidence. [Citations.] As noted by the court in Clark, &lt;*** \u00bfeSpi[te the court\u2019s efforts to prevent injustice by cautionary instructions as to limitations on the evidence, the prejudicial effect of the codefendant\u2019s confessions inevitably remained. ***.\u2019 [Citation.] The basis for this long-standing rule requiring severance in such situations is the constitutional guarantee of a fair and impartial trial and the conclusion, founded on the plainest principles of justice, that admission of a co-defendant\u2019s statement implicating the other party defendant works a substantial and unfair prejudice on the other party.

Ct. 2132, decided three years before McVay, does not validate denial of the defendants\u2019 severance motions and their unfair joint trial. In Parker, the defendants\u2019 confessions were found by the court to \u201cinterlock,\u201d for which reason the court held the defendants\u2019 severance motions were properly denied and that the defendants were not prejudiced by their joint trial. The opinion does not reveal whether there were any contradictions in the conduct attributed to the defendants in the commission of the offenses in the different confessions, however. Whether confessions (like the confessions in the instant case) which reveal that no violence was prearranged and which attributed infliction of the unplanned fatal blow to a codefendant, can be considered \u201cinterlocking\u201d confessions was not decided in Parker.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, in the case at bar, unlike in Parker, the defendants\u2019 confessions and the defense attorneys\u2019 cross-examination and arguments to the jury were flagrant, prejudicial and inflammatory efforts to exculpate one defendant by shifting commission of the offenses to the other defendant. (See Appendices A, B, E, F and G). Moreover, in Parker, unlike in the case at bar, each confession was subjected to a process of redaction in which references to the other defendant were replaced with the words \u201cblank\u201d or \u201canother person.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b170-6\" pgmap=\"170\">In the case at bar, the defendants\u2019 severance motions should have been allowed.

Their convictions should therefore be reversed.</p> <p id=\"b170-7\" pgmap=\"170\">IV</p> <p id=\"b170-8\" pgmap=\"170(37) 171(95)\">This cause should not be remanded for a new trial, however, for the reason that the State\u2019s evidence on which the defendants\u2019 guilty findings are predicated is legally insufficient and utterly fails as a matter of law to establish either defendant\u2019s guilt of burglary or home invasion. The State\u2019s enhanced opportunity to obtain guilty findings of murder against the defendants by their joint trial met with failure. The jury determined, within its province, that the evidence did not prove either defendant guilty of murder beyond a reasonable doubt and found both not guilty, perhaps because of the three conflicting versions by Lopez, Racanelli and Watters of Reynold\u2019s fatal stabbing. Although speculation on the reason for the jury\u2019s verdicts of not guilty of murder may satisfy a curiosity, such conjecture is otherwise unproductive.</p> <p id=\"b171-5\" pgmap=\"171\">The defendants were also charged with armed robbery. (HI. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 38, par. 18 \u2014 2.) Section 18 \u2014 2 provides that, \u201cA person commits armed robbery when he or she [takes property from the person or presence of another by the use of force or by threatening the imminent use of force] while he or she carries on or about his or her person, or is otherwise armed with a dangerous weapon.\u201d Although there may have been sufficient evidence presented to the jury on which it could have found the defendants guilty of armed robbery of Robert Reynolds beyond a reasonable doubt, the State nevertheless elected to nol-pros the armed robbery charge.</p> <p id=\"b171-6\" pgmap=\"171\">There was also a theft charge against the defendants. (HI. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 38, par. 16 \u2014 1.) Section 16 \u2014 1 provides, \u201cA person commits theft when he knowingly: (a) obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property of the owner; or *** (c) obtains by threat control over property of the owner; *** and (1) intends to deprive the owner permanently of the use and benefit of the property ***.\u201d There may also have been ample evidence presented to the jury on which the jury could have found the defendants guilty of theft of Robert Reynolds\u2019 property beyond a reasonable doubt; yet, the State chose to nol-pros the theft charge as well. To engage in suppositions or theories for the State\u2019s declination to prosecute the theft and armed robbery charges would not be beneficial.</p> <p id=\"b171-7\" pgmap=\"171\">The State in exercise of its prosecutorial discretion chose to proceed against the defendants only on the murder, burglary and home invasion charges. The burglary charge, in pertinent part, was as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b171-8\" pgmap=\"171\">\u201cThat on August 21, 1981 at and within said county Joseph G. Racanelli and Johnnie Watters committed the offense of burglary in that they without authority, knowingly entered, into a building, to wit dwelling of Robert Reynolds with the intent to commit the crime of theft therein, in violation of ch. 38, sec. 19 \u2014 1 of the Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979 as amended.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b171-9\" pgmap=\"171\">The burglary statute (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 38, par. 19 \u2014 1), which the defendants allegedly violated, provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b171-10\" pgmap=\"171(9) 172(21)\">\u201cA person commits burglary when without authority he knowingly enters or without authority remains within a building *** with intent to commit therein a felony or theft.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b172-5\" pgmap=\"172\">The home invasion allegation was that on August 21, 1981, Racanelli and Watters:</p> <blockquote id=\"b172-6\" pgmap=\"172\">\u201cCommitted the offenses of home invasion in that they, not being peace officers acting in the line of duty, without authority knowingly entered the dwelling place of Robert Reynolds, knowingly and had reason to know that one or more persons were present therein, intentionally stabbed and killed Robert Reynolds, within said dwelling place, with a knife, in violation of ch. 38, sec. 12 \u2014 11(a)(2) of the Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, as amended.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b172-7\" pgmap=\"172\">The home invasion statute (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 38, par. 12\u2014 ll(aX2)) provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b172-8\" pgmap=\"172\">\u201cA person who is not a peace officer acting in the line of duty commits home invasion when without authority he or she knowingly enters the dwelling place of another when he or she knows or has reason to know that one or more persons is present and . *** (2) Intentionally causes any injury to any person or persons within such dwelling place.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b172-9\" pgmap=\"172\">From the foregoing statute, it is manifest that one of the essential elements of the offenses of burglary and home invasion is the entry into a dwelling (or other edifice) without authority. (People v. Clark (1964), 30 Ill. 2d 216, 219, 195 N.E.2d 631; People v. Sansone (1981), 94 Ill. App. 3d 271, 273, 418 N.E.2d 862; People v. Bailey (1980), 80 Ill.

Del Percio (1985), 105 Ill. 2d 372, 374, \u201cThe State failed to allege that the defendant entered the victim\u2019s home without authority, a necessary and material element of home invasion.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b172-10\" pgmap=\"172\">The defendants in the case at bar were charged with entering Reynolds\u2019 dwelling without authority. Yet, not one iota of evidence was presented to the jury that Racanelli or Watters entered Reynolds\u2019 dwelling without authority. In fact, the State\u2019s evidence affirmatively established that Racanelli\u2019s entry into Reynolds\u2019 dwelling was with authority and by Reynolds\u2019 invitation. Lopez\u2019 complete testimony of Racanelli\u2019s entry into Reynolds\u2019 apartment was as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b172-11\" pgmap=\"172\">\u201cQ. When you first went to Robert Reynolds\u2019 apartment, who was there?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b172-12\" pgmap=\"172\">A.

And then did anyone else later come to the apartment?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-5\" pgmap=\"173\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-6\" pgmap=\"173\">Q. And who was that?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-7\" pgmap=\"173\">A.

About 10:30.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b173-16\" pgmap=\"173\">The only other evidence in the record on Racanelli\u2019s entry into Reynolds\u2019 apartment is Racanelli\u2019s confession which was admitted into evidence through the testimony of Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Kaiser. Racanelli stated in his confession that he was in Reynolds\u2019 apartment at Reynolds\u2019 invitation, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b173-17\" pgmap=\"173\">Q. *** Okay, Joseph, on the night of August 21, 1981, who were you with that evening?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-18\" pgmap=\"173\">A.

I went over and started drinking with him.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-23\" pgmap=\"173\">Q. Did you both go over to his house?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-24\" pgmap=\"173\">A. Not at first. I did.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-25\" pgmap=\"173\">Q. This was part of your plan, is that right?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-26\" pgmap=\"173\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-27\" pgmap=\"173\">Q. You were going to drink with him?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-28\" pgmap=\"173\">A. Not at that time, I was not planning it because he had invited me to drink with him.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-29\" pgmap=\"173\">Q. But, you and Johnnie Watters then decided to rob Mr. Reynolds?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-30\" pgmap=\"173\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-31\" pgmap=\"173\">Q. Now, how much did you and Mr. Reynolds drink?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-32\" pgmap=\"173\">A. About a quart of Baccardi.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-33\" pgmap=\"173\">Q. What happened after you drank that? What did Mr. Reynolds do?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-34\" pgmap=\"173\">A. After he got drunk, he went to sleep.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-35\" pgmap=\"173\">Q. What did you do then?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b174-3\" pgmap=\"174\">A. I was talking to somebody on the phone and I gave him a half hour to make sure he was asleep.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b174-4\" pgmap=\"174\">Q. What did you do then?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b174-5\" pgmap=\"174\">A. I called Johnnie Watters over.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b174-6\" pgmap=\"174\">Q. Where was he when you called him?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b174-7\" pgmap=\"174\">A. Over to Johnny Lopez\u2019 house.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b174-8\" pgmap=\"174\">Q. When Johnnie Watters came over, what did you and him do?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b174-9\" pgmap=\"174\">A. We started unplugging the TV and the stereo and stuff and set them by the door.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b174-10\" pgmap=\"174\">From Racanelli\u2019s confession, it is apparent that he did not enter Reynolds\u2019 apartment via a ruse or subterfuge, nor did he induce Reynolds\u2019 invitation; rather, he entered at Reynolds\u2019 \u201cmotivated\u201d invitation. Racanelli imbibed in intoxicants with Reynolds over an extended period. It was sometime after Racanelli had entered the apartment and Reynolds had become inebriated and gone to sleep that Racanelli and Watters planned to covertly pilfer Reynolds\u2019 property. Racanelli\u2019s confession was given freely and voluntarily, according to the testimony of Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Kaiser, and the trial court so found. Although the circumstances of Racanelli\u2019s entry into Reynolds\u2019 apartment are relatively clear, any ambiguity in Racanelli\u2019s confession regarding his entry should have been clarified by the interrogatory skills of this trained prosecuting attorney. His failure to have done so cannot be held against Racanelli.</p> <p id=\"b174-11\" pgmap=\"174\">There is no competent evidence in the record which establishes how Watters entered Reynolds\u2019 apartment. The State was obligated to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Watters\u2019 (and Racanelli\u2019s) entry was without authority. Instead, the record is silent on Watters\u2019 entry.</p> <p id=\"b174-12\" pgmap=\"174\">Lopez testified that he awakened the following morning in Reynolds\u2019 apartment. He testified:</p> <blockquote id=\"b174-13\" pgmap=\"174\">\u201cQ. And what if anything did you see when you woke up?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b174-14\" pgmap=\"174\">A. I woke up and I saw Robert Reynolds and Johnnie Watters in the bedroom.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b174-15\" pgmap=\"174\">Q. And would you describe what Robert Reynolds was like what you first saw him, when you woke up?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b174-16\" pgmap=\"174\">A. He was staggering around the floor, with a stab wound in his back.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b174-17\" pgmap=\"174\">Lopez did not utter a single testimonial word on Watters\u2019 entry into Reynolds\u2019 apartment. Lopez\u2019 mere testimony of Watters\u2019 presence in the apartment does not satisfy the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Watters entered, the apartment without authority.</p> <p id=\"b174-18\" pgmap=\"174(23) 175(70)\">Watters gave a written, signed confession to Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Francis J. Mahon, Jr., and Mahon testified that Watters did so freely and voluntarily and with a thorough understanding and a knowing waiver of his Miranda rights. Thus, there were no restrictions or inhibitions to curb Mahon\u2019s inquiry of Watters. Yet, Mahon did not ask Watters a single question on Watters\u2019 mode of entry into Reynolds\u2019 apartment, whether by invitation or force, or whether it was with or without authority. Mahon inquired of Watters during his confession as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b175-5\" pgmap=\"175\">\u201cQ. On August 21st, 1981, were you in the apartment of Robert Reynolds at 4240 North Clarendon at about 5:30 in the morning?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b175-6\" pgmap=\"175\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b175-7\" pgmap=\"175\">Q. What were you doing there?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b175-8\" pgmap=\"175\">A. I was robbing, taking some speakers and stuff.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b175-9\" pgmap=\"175\">Racanelli stated in his confession that after Reynolds \u201cgot drunk [and] went to sleep,\u201d he \u201ccalled Johnnie Watters over [and they] started unplugging the TV and the stereo and stuff and set them by the door.\u201d It need not be decided whether, from Racanelli\u2019s confession, Racanelli could authorize Watters\u2019 entry into Reynolds\u2019 apartment because Racanelli\u2019s confession was not admissible as evidence against Watters. Racanelli\u2019s confession was admissible as evidence only against Racanelli. No man can confess for another. The trial judge correctly so instructed the jury: \u201cA statement made by one defendant may not be considered by you against any other defendant.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b175-10\" pgmap=\"175\">In Bruton v. United States (1968), 391 U.S. 123, 128 n.3, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476, 480 n.3, 88 S. Ct. 1620, 1623 n.3, the Supreme Court commented on the inadmissibility of a codefendant\u2019s confession as evidence against Bruton as follows: \u201cWe emphasize that [the codefendant\u2019s] hearsay statement inculpating [Bruton] was clearly inadmissible against [Bruton] under traditional rules of evidence, [citations].\u201d The Illinois Supreme Court in People v. Clark (1959), 17 Ill. 2d 486, 490, 162 N.E.2d 413, stated that \u201c[confessions or admissions made by an accomplice outside the presence of a defendant are not admissible against the latter whether or not the parties are jointly tried ***.\u201d Accordingly, in the case at bar the means via which Watters entered Reynolds\u2019 apartment as set forth in Racanelli\u2019s confession is inadmissible against Watters. There remains then only Lopez\u2019 testimony and Watters\u2019 confession about the circumstances of Watters\u2019 entry into Reynolds\u2019 apartment. Both are silent on this subject. Thus, the State\u2019s evidence legally fails to establish that the defendants committed burglary or home invasion.</p> <p id=\"b175-11\" pgmap=\"175(43) 176(105)\">The majority opinion acknowledges that (1) \u201cThe material elements of the offense of burglary are entry into a building without authority\u201d; (2) \u201cDefendants\u2019 entry into the victim\u2019s apartment [was] initially with the victim\u2019s authority\u201d; and (3) \u201cHome invasion is the entry without authority of the dwelling place of another.\u201d The majority, however, necessarily resorted to phantasmagoric rationale to affirm the burglary and home invasion convictions. The majority holds that \u201cDefendants\u2019 entry into the victim\u2019s apartment, although initially with the victim\u2019s authority, exceeded that authority when they attacked the victim and removed his property. *** Therefore, defendants\u2019 presence in the apartment was without authority once they attacked the victim and removed his belongings from the apartment.\u201d The majority magically concludes that the defendants entered Reynolds\u2019 apartment without authority and that, therefore, the defendants were proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of burglary and home invasion.</p> <p id=\"b176-5\" pgmap=\"176\">The majority\u2019s reliance on People v. Hudson (1983), 113 Ill. App. 3d 1041, 448 N.E.2d 178, is misplaced. Hudson relied on People v. Fisher (1980), 83 Ill. App. 3d 619, 623, 404 N.E.2d 859, as authority. The court pointed out in Fisher (which also occurred in Hudson), that \u201c[djefendants\u2019 entry that evening was gained as a result of misrepresentation and subterfuge. *** [The residents] were deceived into allowing defendants into their apartment, and such entry was not in accordance with the will of the occupants and is therefore unauthorized.\u201d The court concluded in Hudson and Fisher that even though the entry into the apartment was initially by invitation, because such invitation was obtained by subterfuge, the entry was without authority. Also in Hudson and Fisher, it was promptly after the defendants\u2019 surreptitiously induced invitation into the apartment that the defendants threatened the residents with firearms and ransacked the premises. In the instant case, Reynolds was not deceived into allowing defendants into his apartment. The entry into Reynolds\u2019 dwelling was not gained surreptitiously by misrepresentation or subterfuge, nor was Reynolds\u2019 invitation induced by Racanelli or Watters. In Hudson and Fisher, the defendants planned to rob the owners before they entered the premises. They deceived the owners into extending them an invitation into the dwelling in order to accomplish their purpose. Such are not the facts in the instant case. Hudson and Fisher are therefore grossly inapposite to the instant case.</p> <p id=\"b176-6\" pgmap=\"176(105) 177(71)\">A recent case, People v. Sanders (1984), 129 Ill. App. 3d 552, 472 N.E.2d 1156, is also inapposite to the case at bar. In Sanders, there was competent evidence which established that Macon, the invited guest in the home, admitted Sanders and the other defendants into the McGee dwelling to rob the McGee family. As before stated, there is no competent evidence in the instant case which established the circumstances of Watters\u2019 entry into Reynolds\u2019 dwelling. If the court in Hudson, Fisher and Sanders intended by judicial interpretation to repeal the requirement of \u201centry into a dwelling without authority\u201d from the offense of home invasion, such is the exclusive responsibility of the legislature and not the courts. Furthermore, the title of the offense, \u201cHome Invasion,\u201d coupled with the expressed requirement that the entry be \u201cwithout authority,\u201d unequivocally establishes that the entry into the dwelling be by \u201cInvasion.\u201d The court by judicial fiat in Hudson, Fisher and Sanders, however, has attempted to rewrite and change the offense from \u201cHome Invasion\u201d to \u201cHome Invitation.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b177-5\" pgmap=\"177\">It is obvious that the State erred in its selection of which charges to nol-pros and which charges to prosecute. Unfortunate as this may be, it was the State\u2019s choice, and it is not the function, duty or responsibility of this court to rectify or correct such prosecutorial misjudgments. Because the evidence, as a matter of law, fails to establish that the defendants committed the offense of burglary or home invasion, their convictions should be reversed.</p> <p id=\"b177-6\" pgmap=\"177\">V</p> <p id=\"b177-7\" pgmap=\"177\">Joseph Racanelli contends before this court that his statements and confessions were obtained from him in violation of his State and Federal constitutional right to the assistance of counsel. On the evidentiary hearing of his motion to suppress his statements and confessions, it was established that Chicago police detective Ford signed a complaint for examination, in which Racanelli apparently was charged with the murder of Reynolds. On September 3, 1981, Detective Ford appeared before and presented the complaint to circuit court Judge Murphy, who issued a warrant for Racanelli\u2019s arrest. All the statements and confessions were extracted from Racanelli after the murder complaint had been filed against him and after Judge Murphy had issued the warrant for his arrest. Therefore, Racanelli urges, his statements and confessions were obtained from him after adversarial judicial proceedings had been instituted against him, without benefit of Ms counsel, in violation of his constitutional right.</p> <p id=\"b177-8\" pgmap=\"177(132) 178(9)\">It is provided in the sixth amendment to the Constitution of the UMted States that \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right *** to have the assistance of counsel for Ms defense.\u201d This sixth amendment constitutional right to the assistance of counsel \u201cin all criminal prosecutions\u201d is made obligatory and binding on the States by the fourteenth amendment to the UMted States Constitution, wMch states, \u201cNor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.\u201d (Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), 372 U.S. 335, 342, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799, 804, 83 S. Ct. 792, 795.) Section 8 of article 1 of the Illinois Constitution provides, \u201cIn criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right to appear and defend in person and by counsel; ***.\u201d Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, sec. 8.</p> <p id=\"b178-5\" pgmap=\"178\">The trial judge did not properly address Racanelli\u2019s constitutional right to counsel argument when he denied his motion to suppress his confession. Indeed, the trial judge tacitly intertwined Racanelli\u2019s constitutional right to counsel with his Federal and State constitutional right against self-incrimination and his right to Miranda warnings thereunder. But this inextricable maneuver did not resolve this simple issue. The trial judge reasoned:</p> <blockquote id=\"b178-6\" pgmap=\"178\">\u201c*** [A]s far as the adversary proceedings and the Sixth Amendment, *** \u00a1Racanelli] was informed that he had a right to consult with a lawyer, that he had a right to have a lawyer present during his interrogation.

I don\u2019t think any case law goes that far. ***. The motion will be denied.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b178-7\" pgmap=\"178\">The rationale by which the majority affirms this ruling is predicated on erroneous legal concepts. The majority holds that at the time Racanelli made his statements and confessions, his constitutional right to counsel had not yet attached because adversarial judicial proceedings had not been instituted against him. The majority reasons:</p> <blockquote id=\"b178-8\" pgmap=\"178\">(1) \u201cOnly the State\u2019s Attorney has the authority to file a felony charge.\u201d</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b178-9\" pgmap=\"178\">(2) \u201c|T]he State cannot be said to have filed a formal charge committing itself to the prosecution of Racanelli simply with the filing of a complaint by a police officer.\u201d</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b178-10\" pgmap=\"178\">(3) \u201c[T]he complaint was not filed at the request of the State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b178-11\" pgmap=\"178\">(4) \u201cWe therefore find that Racanelli\u2019s right to counsel did not apply to the telephone conversation and that his sixth amendment right to counsel was not violated.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b178-12\" pgmap=\"178\">There is not one iota of evidence in the record as to whether Detective Ford did or did not file the complaint against Racanelli \u201cat the request of the State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b178-13\" pgmap=\"178(98) 179(105)\">The majority opinion incorrectly states, \u201cIllinois law provides that felony prosecutions must be commenced by indictment or information and not by complaint.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

In fact, section 111 \u2014 2(a) further provides, \u201cNo prosecution may be pursued by information unless a preliminary hearing has been held or waived *** and at that hearing probable cause to believe the defendant committed an offense was found, and the provisions of section 109 \u2014 3.1 of this Code have been complied with.\u201d Section 111\u2014 2(b) provides, \u201cAll other prosecutions may be by indictment, information or complaint.\u201d Ill.

Later that day, under extremely suspicious circumstances, the defendant appeared before the court, and in the absence of a representative from the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office, entered a plea of guilty and was fined $50 plus costs. The following day, the State\u2019s Attorney filed an information, sworn to by the arresting officer, which properly charged the aggravated-battery offense. The defendant moved to dismiss the information on double jeopardy grounds. The State\u2019s Attorney contended that defendant\u2019s former prosecution under the invalid information was procured by the defendant without the knowledge of the proper prosecuting office and that prosecution of the defendant therefore was not barred under the subsequent valid information. The court pointed out that \u201c[t]he State\u2019s Attorney, as a representative of the People of the State of Illinois, has the duty \u2018[t]o commence and prosecute all actions, suits, indictments and prosecutions, civil and criminal, in the circuit court for his county, in which the people of the State or county may be concerned.\u2019 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 14, par. 5(1).)\u201d (People v. Pankey (1983), 94 Ill. 2d 12, 16.) The court held that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the State in the original guilty plea proceedings because the State\u2019s Attorney was not present, knew nothing of and did not acquiesce in the proceedings. The court also held that the police officer was without authority to prosecute the charge and therefore the double jeopardy clause of the State and Federal constitutions (U.S. Const., amend. V; Ill. Const, art. I, sec. 10) did not bar the subsequent prosecution. Pankey is not authority for the majority proposition that \u201conly the State\u2019s Attorney has the authority to file a felony charge.\u201d Accordingly, the previously set forth assertions of the majority are clearly erroneous. The trial court erred in holding that Racanelli\u2019s telephone conversations and subsequent confessions were not obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s State and Federal constitutional right to counsel. The majority here likewise err in affirming the trial court\u2019s erroneous ruling.</p> <p id=\"b180-5\" pgmap=\"180\">Escobedo v. Illinois (1964), 378 U.S. 478, 12 L. Ed. 2d 977, 84 S. Ct. 1758, is initially the appropriate authority for Racanelli\u2019s contention that his statements and confessions were obtained in violation of his right to counsel. In Escobedo, the defendant was in police station custody. His request to see his lawyer and his lawyer\u2019s police station request to see Escobedo were denied. Escobedo\u2019s motion to suppress his confession, which was made after the aforesaid denials, was overruled. The Supreme Court pointed out that \u201c[t]he interrogation here was conducted before petitioner was formally indicted. But in the context of this case, that fact should make no difference.\u201d (378 U.S. 478, 485, 12 L. Ed. 2d 977, 982, 84 S. Ct. 1758, 1762.) So it is in the case at bar. Also, in Escobedo, the court pointed out further, \u201cPetitioner had become the accused, and the purpose of the interrogation was to \u2018get him\u2019 to confess his guilt despite his constitutional right not to do so.\u201d (378 U.S. 478, 485, 12 L. Ed. 2d 977, 982, 84 S. Ct. 1758,1762.) The Supreme Court further held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b180-6\" pgmap=\"180(69) 181(105)\">\u201cThe \u2018guiding hand of counsel\u2019 was essential to advise petitioner of his rights in this delicate situation. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69. This was the \u2018stage when legal aid and advice\u2019 were most critical to petitioner. [Citation.] It was a stage surely as critical as was the arraignment in Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, and the preliminary hearing in White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59. What happened at this interrogation could certainly \u2018affect the whole trial,\u2019 Hamilton v. Alabama, supra, at 54, since rights \u2018may be as irretrievably lost, if not then and there asserted, as they are when an accused represented by counsel waives a right for strategic purposes.\u2019 *** It would exalt form over substance to make the right to counsel, under these circumstances, depend on whether at the time of the interrogation, the authorities had secured a formal indictTnent. Petitioner had, for all practical purposes, already been charged with murder.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 378 U.S. 478, 486, 12 L. Ed. 2d 977, 983, 84 S. Ct. 1758,1762.</blockquote> <p id=\"b181-5\" pgmap=\"181\">In the case at bar, Racanelli had in fact been charged with murder and he was the accused in allegations pending in a judicial tribunal. Under these circumstances, it was a violation of his constitutional right to counsel to interrogate him in the absence of his counsel.</p> <p id=\"b181-6\" pgmap=\"181\">The treasured constitutional right to counsel should not be abridged by the rhetorical manipulation of the point at which adversarial judicial proceedings are initiated, from the filing of a complaint to the return of an indictment, in order to salvage an illegally extracted confession. The Supreme Court stated in Kirby v. Illinois (1972), 406 U.S. 682, 688, 32 L. Ed. 2d 411, 417, 92 S. Ct. 1877,1881:</p> <blockquote id=\"b181-7\" pgmap=\"181\">\u201cIn a line of constitutional cases in this Court stemming back to the Court\u2019s landmark opinion in Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, it has been firmly established that a person\u2019s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel attaches only at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against him.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b181-8\" pgmap=\"181\">The filing of the complaint in the case at bar by Chicago police detective Ford before Judge Murphy, which charged Racanelli with Reynolds\u2019 murder, and the judge\u2019s issuance of a warrant for Racanelli\u2019s arrest thereon, elevated Racanelli from a police investigation suspect to an adversarial judicial defendant, and at that time Racanelli\u2019s constitutional right to counsel attached.</p> <p id=\"b181-9\" pgmap=\"181\">The defendants were displayed to crime witnesses in post-indictment lineups, without the benefit of their counsel\u2019s presence in United States v. Wade (1967), 388 U.S. 218, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149, 87 S. Ct. 1926, and Gilbert v. California (1967), 388 U,S. 263, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1178, 87 S. Ct. 1951. The Supreme Court in both cases held that such post-indictment proceedings were a critical stage of the criminal prosecution and, when conducted in the absence of a defendant\u2019s counsel, denied the defendant his sixth and fourteenth amendment rights to counsel, thus necessitating suppression of the lineup and in-court identification.</p> <p id=\"b181-10\" pgmap=\"181(15) 182(113)\">In Kirby v. Illinois (1972), 406 U.S. 682, 684, 32 L. Ed. 2d 411, 414, 92 S. Ct. 1877, 1879, the Supreme Court was asked \u201cto extend the Wade-Gilbert per se exclusionary rule to identification testimony based upon a police station showup that took place before the defendant had been indicted or otherwise formally charged with any criminal offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Supreme Court declined to do so. In the case at bar, however, Racanelli had been formally charged with a criminal offense in a complaint for preliminary examination. The formal charge against and the arrest of Racanelli were not \u201ca routine police investigation\u201d as was the defendants\u2019 identification in Kirby. The following language of the Supreme Court in Kirby is most applicable to Racanelli:</p> <blockquote id=\"b182-5\" pgmap=\"182\">\u201cThe initiation of judicial criminal proceedings is far from a mere formalism. It is the starting point of our whole system of adversary criminal justice. For it is only then that the government has committed itself to prosecute, and only then that the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified. It is then that a defendant finds himself faced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed in the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law. It is this point, therefore, that marks the commencement of the \u2018criminal prosecutions\u2019 to which alone the explicit guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are applicable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 406 U.S. 682, 689-90, 32 L.

It was the \u201cstarting point of our whole system of adversary criminal justice.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b182-7\" pgmap=\"182\">In People v. Burbank (1972), 53 Ill. 2d 261, 272, 291 N.E.2d 161, the . defendant had not been charged with murder when he was identified as the offender in a lineup. The supreme court held his right to counsel therefore had not attached. The supreme court additionally held, however:</p> <blockquote id=\"b182-8\" pgmap=\"182\">\u201cThe [Supreme] Court enumerated \u2018formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment\u2019 [In Kirby v.

(Emphasis added.) This contention is in direct contravention to and absolutely ignores the holding of the supreme court in Burbank.</p> <p id=\"b183-5\" pgmap=\"183\">Furthermore, in People v. Marshall (1977), 47 Ill. App. 3d 784, 786, 365 N.E.2d 367, this court held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b183-6\" pgmap=\"183\">\u201cDefendant initially contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the lineup identifications because such identifications were effected after a charge had been placed against the defendant and at a time when the defendant was not represented by counsel. The record reveals that on January 30, 1973, defendant was arrested and identified in a lineup and that during this lineup defendant was not represented by counsel. Approximately one week before this lineup, a complaint for preliminary examination charging defendant with armed robbery and an arrest warrant had been issued.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b183-7\" pgmap=\"183\">In Kirby v. Illinois [citation], the United States Supreme Court held that the requirement of presence of counsel at a lineup extends to any \u2018adversary judicial criminal proceedings \u2014 whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\u2019 Relying on Kirby, this court in People v. Hinton [citation], held that the issuance of a complaint, followed by an arrest warrant and the actual arrest of the defendant was a formal charge\u2019 within the purview of Kirby and required the presence of counsel at the lineup. We similarly believe, in the instant case, at the time of the lineup adverse judicial proceedings had begun and that defendant should have been afforded counsel.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b183-8\" pgmap=\"183\">The holding of this court in the case at bar is in direct conflict with the court\u2019s holding in Marshall.</p> <p id=\"b183-9\" pgmap=\"183\">The majority also holds that \u201cthe rule of Owens is not applicable to the instant case.\u201d In People v. Owens (1984), 102 Ill. 2d 88, 101, 464 N.E.2d 261, the defendant was arrested on a Will County court warrant on a murder charge. Without counsel, he confessed. His suppression motion was overruled. A jury found him guilty. On appeal, the supreme court declined to decide the sixth amendment right to counsel issue, stating:</p> <blockquote id=\"b183-10\" pgmap=\"183(33) 184(20)\">\u201cWe note that, to date, neither the Supreme Court [citation] nor this court has resolved whether sixth amendment rights [to counsel] automatically attach upon the filing of a complaint.

Owens (1984), 102 Ill. 2d 88,101, 464 N.E.2d 261.</blockquote> <p id=\"b184-4\" pgmap=\"184\">The Supreme Court of the United States, however, held in Moore v. Illinois (1977), 434 U.S. 220, 228, 54 L. Ed. 2d 424, 433, 98 S. Ct. 458, 464, that \u201c[t]he prosecution *** was commenced under Illinois law when the victim\u2019s complaint was filed in court. Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, sec. Ill (1975),\u201d and that the defendants\u2019 sixth amendment right to counsel attached at that time. In Moore, six days after rape and other sex offenses had been committed upon the victim in her home, the victim was taken by a police officer to court, where she signed a complaint which charged Moore with being her assailant. Later that day, when the defendant\u2019s case was called, the defendant appeared without counsel and the victim identified him as her attacker. The hearing was continued. The defendant was later indicted and his pretrial motion to suppress his identification by the victim was overruled. He assigned the ruling as error on his appeal. The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed. In reversing, the Supreme Court of the United States held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b184-5\" pgmap=\"184\">\u201cIn Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682 (1972), the plurality opinion made clear that the right to counsel announced in Wade and Gilbert attaches only to corporeal identifications conducted \u2018at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\u2014 whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\u2019 406 U.S., at 689. This is so because the initiation of such proceedings \u2018marks the commencement of the \u201ccriminal prosecutions\u201d to which alone the explicit guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are applicable.\u2019 Id., at 690. Thus, in Kirby the plurality held that the prosecution\u2019s evidence of a robbery victim\u2019s one-on-one stationhouse identification of an uncounseled suspect shortly after the suspect\u2019s arrest was admissible because adversary judicial criminal proceedings had not yet been initiated.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-6\" pgmap=\"184\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-7\" pgmap=\"184(103) 185(11)\">The Court of Appeals *** read Kirby as holding that evidence of a corporeal identification conducted in the absence of defense counsel must be excluded only if the identification is made after the defendant is indicted. ***.

[Citation.] The filing of a complaint and issuance of an arrest warrant against the defendant must therefore be treated as having occurred after the lineups. Thus, no adversary judicial proceedings had, been instituted, and no right to counsel at the lineups had attached. For these reasons, the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights were not violated ***.\u201d (Emphasis added.) People v. Harrell (1982), 104 Ill.

Under the Federal and State constitutions, the defendant, Racanelli, was also entitled to be represented by counsel in that controversy. Racanelli\u2019s right to counsel had attached when he talked to the officers and when he confessed. His constitutional right to counsel was violated by the admission of his illegally extracted, without counsel, confession as evidence against him.

I told him not to say nothing.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b194-33\" pgmap=\"194\">E. Excerpts of the opening argument by Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Linda Amdur:</p> <blockquote id=\"b194-34\" pgmap=\"194(76) 195(59)\">\u201cAfter the police talked to Jimmy Lopez, they then went on to locate Johnnie Watters and placed Johnnie Watters under arrest. *** What did Johnnie Watters tell the assistant State\u2019s Attorney when he was interviewed? *** Basically, what Johnnie Watters told the assistant state\u2019s attorney was that he was in Robert Reynolds\u2019 apartment on the 21st of August at about 5:30. He was there with the defendant Racanelli, and they were, in his words, robbing the place, taking speakers and stuff, and he also said at that time Robert Reynolds was asleep and Lopez was asleep. *** Watters says that when he came back, that\u2019s when he saw Racanelli stab the victim with the knife *** he was soon to go on downstairs and get in a cab and leave the scene with defendant Racanelli.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b195-5\" pgmap=\"195\">I submit to you under this statement and by his own admission, defendant Watters is guilty of murder. He\u2019s committing a burglary and during the commission of that burglary, as he works with defendant Racanelli, the victim in this case Robert Reynolds was stabbed to death.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b195-6\" pgmap=\"195\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b195-7\" pgmap=\"195\">Basically what Racanelli told the police was that Robert Reynolds had invited him over to his apartment. He said that he and Watters then planned to, what they call, rob Reynolds which, in law, would be to burglarize Reynolds\u2019 apartment.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b195-8\" pgmap=\"195\">Racanelli went on over to Reynolds\u2019 apartment and he started drinking with him, and he said they drank a lot that night. He waited until Reynolds fell asleep from drinking. ***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b195-9\" pgmap=\"195\">He called Watters and told him to come over, and Watters came on over and they started to go through the apartment, and they started to take exactly what they wanted.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b195-11\" pgmap=\"195\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b195-12\" pgmap=\"195\">[Racanelli] says, now Johnnie Watters grabbed one of those knives *** that he saw the defendant Watters stabbing the victim Robert Reynolds, and he saw Reynolds fall back away from Johnnie Watters and Johnnie Watters was holding a knife.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b195-13\" pgmap=\"195\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b195-14\" pgmap=\"195\">What did Racanelli confess to in this statement. He confesses to a lot of things. He tells you how Robert Reynolds let him into the apartment. He was given consent to enter the apartment, but he tells how he planned with Watters what they would do.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b195-15\" pgmap=\"195\">F. Excerpts of the closing argument by assistant public defender John McNamara, attorney for defendant Joseph Racanelli:</p> <blockquote id=\"b195-16\" pgmap=\"195\">\u201cThere\u2019s something about this case that makes me very angry as an attorney, and that is the attitude of the prosecutors, that they can just throw this case right in front of you and say, let\u2019s let those two defense attorneys fight it out and decide who the jury is going to take down. It\u2019s the attitude of the prosecutors that say, we don\u2019t have any murder in this case. We don\u2019t have anything to prove in this case. In fact, we can\u2019t prove anything, so we\u2019ll just tell you, well, the two defense counsel, let them prove who is innocent and who is not.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b196-4\" pgmap=\"196\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b196-5\" pgmap=\"196\">The State has brought in evidence of statements by both of these men, both of these young men. *** was Joseph Racanelli there when Watters made a statement? Was Joseph Racanelli able to see that statement and say, no, it\u2019s not true, yes, it is true? In fact, he has stated it is not true by pleading not guilty. *** and what does he [Jimmy Lopez] actually say about Joseph Racanelli? Does he say he saw him stab anyone? No. Does he say he was in the bedroom at the time of the stabbing? No. What do we know about Jimmy Lopez and his first story to the police? *** Then, he [Lopez] said, well, I didn\u2019t do it; it was Johnnie Watters.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b196-7\" pgmap=\"196\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b196-8\" pgmap=\"196\">[A]nd now they expect us to fight it out amongst each other.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b196-9\" pgmap=\"196\">G. Excerpts of the closing argument by Robin Harris, attorney for defendant Johnny Watters:</p> <blockquote id=\"b196-10\" pgmap=\"196\">\u201c*** so they went out and got who everybody\u2019s scapegoat in this case is, Johnnie Watters, and after they got a statement from him, then they charged him, but not from Jimmy Lopez\u2019 testimony, not on what he said.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b196-11\" pgmap=\"196\">Remember that [Jimmy Lopez] is related to Joseph Racanelli. Joseph Racanelli\u2019s mother is Jimmy Lopez\u2019 brother\u2019s wife. They are related. Has he got a motive? I believe the judge will instruct you that you can look at motives that people may have in this case. Has he got a motive to lie? He certainly does. He has more than one. Not only would he like to \u2014 as I asked him, would he like to protect Joseph Racanelli, but he certainly wants to protect himself. For all we know, he and Joey Racanelli planned to rob Mr. Reynolds. ***.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b196-12\" pgmap=\"196\">Then [Jimmy Lopez] came back and locked the bedroom door. Maybe he was protecting his brothers. Maybe he was protecting Joey Racanelli. We don\u2019t know. We know he doesn\u2019t care at all about Johnnie Watters. He\u2019s got no reason to try to protect him, but every reason in the world to put it on Johnnie Watters. He\u2019s not related to him.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b196-13\" pgmap=\"196\">MR. McNAMARA: I have to object.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b196-14\" pgmap=\"196\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b196-15\" pgmap=\"196\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b196-16\" pgmap=\"196\">This honest witness, Jimmy Lopez, who didn\u2019t call the police, not because he wanted to protect Johnnie Watters, but because he was protecting either himself or those he loved and was related to.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b196-19\" pgmap=\"196\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b196-20\" pgmap=\"196(13) 197(21)\">You\u2019ve got a statement. This is a copy of the statement you are going to get from Johnnie Watters. That\u2019s another link in their chain.
