We agree with the circuit court and, accordingly, affirm the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Appellee is a Delaware corporation, headquartered in Virginia, with computer support facilities in Silver Spring, Maryland. A leading corporation in the media industry, appellee is the parent company to many wholly-owned subsidiary media companies. Appellee maintains four centralized, intercompany accounts with its subsidiaries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The subsidiaries deposit their proceeds in the appropriate account and then draw on that account to pay their related individual expenses. If a subsidiary deposits more proceeds than it withdraws, appellee maintains an interest-free debit with the subsidiary. If the subsidiary spends more money than it deposits, appellee maintains an interest-free credit with the subsidiary. For the tax years 1990-92, appellee maintained with its subsidiaries a credit in three of the four intercompany accounts. The parties stipulated to the Maryland Tax Court below, in writing, that these credits were a form of interest-free debt. Appellant claims that, under two federal tax code provisions, it may assess income tax against these credits by imputing interest income from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>The first provision, I.R.C. \u00a7 482 (1999), states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-4\">\u00a7 482. Allocation of income and deductions among taxpayers</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-5\">In any case of two or more ... businesses (whether or not incorporated, whether or not organized in the United States, and whether or not affiliated) owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests, the Secretary may distribute, apportion, or allocate gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances between or among such ... businesses, if he determines that such distribution, apportionment, or allocation is necessary in order to prevent evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect the income of any of such ... businesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The second provision, I.R.C. \u00a7 7872 (1999), states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">\u00a7 7872. Treatment of loans with below-market interest rates</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-8\">(a) Treatment of gift loans and demand loans.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-9\">(1) In general.\u2014For purposes of this title, in the case of any below-market loan to which this section applies and which is a gift loan or a demand loan, the foregone interest shall be treated as\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-10\">(A) transferred from the lender to the borrower, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-11\">(B) retransferred by the borrower to the lender as</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-12\">interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-13\">(b) Treatment of other below-market loans.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-14\">(1) In general.\u2014For purposes of this title, in the case of any below-market loan to which this section applies and to which subsection (a)(1) does not apply, the lender shall be treated as having transferred on the date the loan was made (or, if later, on the first day on which this section applies to such loan), and the borrower shall be treated as having received on such date, cash in an amount equal to the excess of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-15\">(A) the amount loaned, over</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>(B) the present value of all payments which are required to be made under the terms of the loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">(2) Obligation treated as having original issue discount.\u2014For purposes of this title\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">(A) In general.\u2014Any below-market loan to which paragraph (1) applies shall be treated as having original issue discount in an amount equal to the excess described in paragraph (1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">(B) Amount in addition to other original issue discount.\u2014Any original issue discount which a loan is treated as having by reason of subparagraph (A) shall be in addition to any other original issue discount on such loan (determined without regard to subparagraph (A)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">(c) Below-market loans to which section applies.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-9\">(1) In general.\u2014Except as otherwise provided ... this section shall apply to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-10\">(C) Corporation-shareholder loans.\u2014Any below-market loan directly or indirectly between a corporation and any shareholder of such corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-11\">(D) Tax avoidance loans.\u2014Any below-market loan 1 of the principal purposes of the interest arrangements of which is the avoidance of any Federal tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-12\">(E) Other below-market loans.\u2014To the extent provided in regulations, any below-market loan which is not described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (F) if the interest arrangements of such loan have a significant effect on any Federal tax liability of the lender or the borrower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-13\">(h) Regulations.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-14\">(1) In general.\u2014The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section, including\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-15\">(C) regulations exempting from the application of this section any class of transactions the interest arrange<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>ments of which have no significant effect on any Federal tax liability of the lender or the borrower.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">For the tax years in question, 1990-92, appellee, as it was allowed to do, filed a consolidated federal tax return on behalf of itself and all of its subsidiaries with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Appellee did not report the intercompany account credits on its federal tax return because any interest income that could have been imputed from the credits under I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 482 and 7872 would have been offset by the reciprocal imputed interest deduction attributed to each subsidiary. In other words, any interest income appellee would have had to report on its consolidated federal tax return would presumably have been eliminated by any interest expense deduction that appellee could have claimed on behalf of its subsidiaries. The IRS, which conducted an audit on other grounds, accepted the returns as filed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The Maryland income tax code bases \u201cthe Maryland modified income of a corporation\u201d on \u201cthe corporation\u2019s federal taxable income for the taxable year as determined under the Internal Revenue Code....\u201d Md.Code (1988, 1997 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-304(1) of the Tax-General Article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Maryland Code, however, does not allow related corporations to file consolidated returns. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 10-811. The Maryland income tax code thus required appellee to base its Maryland modified income on the portion of its reported federal consolidated taxable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>income earned by it in Maryland. Because appellee did not report the three intercompany account credits on its consolidated federal return, it did not report them on its individual Maryland tax form.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Appellant alleges that not reporting the intercompany credits allowed appellee to understate its portion of the consolidated federal taxable income on its separate Maryland income tax return.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Believing that I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 482 and 7872 allowed it to impute interest income from appellee\u2019s intercompany credits, appellant recalculated appellee\u2019s Maryland modified income. It originally assessed $2,216,066 in additional income tax against appellee. Appellee sought a revision of the assessment before an administrative hearing officer, who upheld the assessment but reduced it to $1,279,785. Appellee appealed that ruling to the Maryland Tax Court, arguing that the intercompany account credits were not debt and that, if they were, appellant had no authority to impute interest income from that debt unless the IRS had required it on appellee\u2019s federal tax return. The Maryland Tax Court disagreed and affirmed. Appellee sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, which reversed, ruling that appellant did not have the authority to impute interest income based on the I.R.C. provisions. Appellant appealed that ruling to the Court of Special Appeals and this Court granted a writ of certiorari prior to that court\u2019s hearing the matter. Appellant presents the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">Does the Maryland requirement of a separate corporate tax return require a restatement of federal taxable income from the amount that appears on a consolidated return to the amount required by I.R.C. \u00a7 482 or \u00a7 7872 for taxpayers that file a separate federal return?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Appellee presents a slightly different version of the question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APE\">Did the Circuit Court for Montgomery County correctly rule that the Tax Court erred as a matter of law in holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>that [appellant] had authority under Maryland\u2019s tax laws to impute interest income on intercompany account balances that [appellee] maintained with its subsidiaries?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Avd\">A. Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The facts of this case generally are not in dispute; the issue before us is strictly a question of law. \u201cThe lower court\u2019s interpretations of law enjoy no presumption of correctness on review: the appellate court must apply the law as it understands it to be.\u201d <em>Rohrbaugh v. Estate of Stern, </em>305 Md. 443, 447 n. 2, 505 A.2d 113, 115 n. 2 (1986) (citing <em>Elza v. Elza, </em>300 Md. 51, 55-60, 475 A.2d 1180 (1984); <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 124-31, 372 A.2d 231, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 939, 98 S.Ct. 430, 54 L.Ed.2d 299 (1977); <em>Sica v.

Inter City Land Co., </em>239 Md. 549, 558, 212 A.2d 262, 266 (1965) (\u201cThe conclusions of law based upon the facts are reviewable by this Court.\u201d); <em>Porter v.

Regarding questions of law answered by the Maryland Tax Court, we have said that \u201ca reviewing court is under no statutory constraints in reversing a Tax Court order which is premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 834, 490 A.2d 1296, 1301 (1985) (citing <em>Supervisor of Assessments v. Carroll, </em>298 Md. 311, 469 A.2d 858 (1984); <em>Comptroller v. Mandel, Lee, Goldstein, Burch Re-election Comm., </em>280 Md. 575, 374 A.2d 1130 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">When ambiguities arise in construing tax statutes, Maryland courts must interpret tax code provisions that aid in determining taxable income in the taxpayer\u2019s favor. We noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>in <em>Comptroller v. John C. Louis Co., </em>285 Md. 527, 539, 404 A.2d 1045, 1053 (1979), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">when ... the applicability of a tax statute and not a tax exemption is being construed, it is the established rule not to extend the tax statute\u2019s provisions by implication, beyond the clear import of the language used, to cases not plainly within the statute\u2019s language, and not to enlarge the statute\u2019s operation so as to embrace matters not specifically pointed out. In case of doubt, tax statutes are construed \u201cmost strongly against the government, and in favor of the citizen.\u201d <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Mandel Re-Election Comm., </em>280 Md. 575, 580, 374 A.2d 1130, 1132 (1977); <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. M.E. Rockhill, Inc., </em>205 Md. 226, 234, 107 A.2d 93, 98 (1954).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-6\"><em>See also Scoville Serv., Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>269 Md. 390, 396, 306 A.2d 534, 538 (1973) (\u201c[W]here there is doubt as to the scope of the statute, ... it should be construed most strongly in favor of the citizen and against the state.\u201d) (citing <em>F. &amp; M. Schaefer Brewing Co. v. Comptroller, </em>255 Md. 211, 257 A.2d 416 (1969); <em>McConihe v. Comptroller, </em>246 Md. 271, 228 A.2d 432 (1967); <em>Fair Lanes, Inc. v.

Comptroller, </em>290 Md. 126, 136-37, 428 A.2d 1208, 1214 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">The determination of whether Xerox\u2019s interest income is taxable under [former Article 81,] \u00a7 280A [ (currently \u00a7 10-304) ] necessitates consideration of whether \u00a7 280A(c)(4) is a \u201cdefinition\u201d of taxable income, and therefore to be construed strictly against the State, or an \u201cexemption\u201d from taxable income, to be construed in favor of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">In <em>Balto. Foundry v. Comptroller, </em>211 Md. 316, 127 A.2d 368 (1956), ... the Court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\">\u201cIt may be observed that the exclusion of tangible personal property purchased for the purpose of resale in its original form, or for the purpose of incorporation into a finished product, is by force of the definition and not by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>inclusion in the exemptions set out in sec. 322. Sales in the categories mentioned are simply not within the scope of the taxing statute. Thus the rule of strict construction of an exemption does not apply, but the rule is applicable, that, where there is doubt as to its scope, a tax statute should be construed most strongly in favor of the citizen and against the State.\u201d 211 Md. at 319-20, 127 A.2d at 369.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">B. Authority to Impute Income Under I.R.C. \u00a7 482</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Appellee\u2019s main argument is that \u201c[t]he Maryland Tax Code does not expressly authorize [appellant] to impute interest income\u201d and that appellant \u201cis <em>not </em>granted that discretionary authority by Federal law.\u201d Further, appellee contends that if appellant wishes to have such authority, appellant should seek it from the Legislature, not this Court. Appellant argues that section 10-304\u2019s equation of Maryland modified income to federal taxable income and section 10-811\u2019s requirement of separate returns for each affiliated corporation together \u201cmandate a restatement of taxable income from the number that appears on the federal consolidated return\u201d to determine the Maryland modified income of each separate business entity. It implies that its statutory mandate empowers it to utilize the income-determining provisions of the I.R.C. in their entirety, as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The Legislature, however, has not bestowed such authority upon appellant. Appellant correctly notes that, under section 10-304, the Maryland modified income is equal to the federal taxable income. Appellant\u2019s error, however, is in assuming that section 10-304 provides it with the full panoply of powers provided to the IRS by the I.R.C. to help define federal taxable income. Our previous interpretations of section 10-304 reflect that the legislative intent behind the provision was for appellant to accept the taxable income figure reported on the federal return as the Maryland modified income, subject to certain statutorily prescribed modifications; namely, the additions and subtractions listed in sections 10-305 through 10-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>Comptroller v. American Satellite Corp., </em>312 Md. 537, 540 A.2d 1146 (1988), provides a strong argument for interpreting such an intent behind the state tax code. In <em>American Satellite, </em>appellant argued that a state tax statute allowed it to allocate, as taxable income, certain capital gains earned in Maryland to a corporation that had filed a consolidated federal return reporting no taxable income. This Court disagreed, holding that the state capital gains provision in question could not increase the state modified income figure, because only sections 10-305 through 10-308 authorize appellant to adjust the federal taxable income figure. In doing so, we discussed the legislative intent behind this system of Maryland income tax reporting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">[Legislative committee reports clearly indicate that the purpose in enacting ch. 142 in 1967 [, the current tax code,] was to bring the State taxation system in conformity with the federal scheme. <em>Report of the Committee on Taxation and Fiscal Reform (Report) </em>(February 1, 1967). <em>See also Katzenberg v. Comptroller, </em>263 Md. 189, 204-05, 282 A.2d 465[, 473] (1971); <em>Evans v. Comptroller, </em>273 Md. 172, 175, 328 A.2d 272[, 274] (1974); <em>Marco Assoc. v. Comptroller, </em>265 Md. 669, 674, 291 A.2d 489[, 492] (1972); 66 Op. Att'y Gen. 242, 247 (1981); 52 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 451, 452-53 (1967). As the report indicates, such conformity was thought to foster enforcement. <em>Report </em>at 8. This effort to simplify the taxation system might not fulfill its purpose if, after using federal taxable income as the base for determining State tax liability, the Maryland statutes then imposed additional adjustments which significantly altered the base, <em>other than the simple modifications provided by [Article 81,] \u00a7 280A(b) and (c) </em>[now embodied in sections 10-305 through 10-308].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 545, 540 A.2d at 1150 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">We have interpreted the state tax code in a similar manner in cases where taxpayers sought to modify their income based on federal tax provisions. For instance, in <em>Marco Associates, Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>265 Md. 669, 291 A.2d 489 (1972), the taxpayer corporation had paid no federal income tax on a large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>portion of its reported income because it filed with the IRS as a \u201cSubchapter S\u201d corporation. It subsequently deducted that portion of its income on its Maryland tax return. Maryland, at the time, did not recognize Subchapter S corporate filings. We agreed with appellant that it was the total federal taxable income figure upon which Maryland income tax was based, not the portion of that income that was actually taxed after the federal tax break.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Since our Act does not accord Subchapter S treatment to a corporate taxpayer which elects to be treated as such for federal tax purposes, it follows that such a taxpayer is looked upon for purposes of the Maryland tax as if it were an ordinary business corporation, and its Maryland stockholders as if they were the holders of shares in such a corporation, <em>see </em>\u00a7 280(b)(5), \u00a7 280(c)(2). This may not be fair, but it is a fact of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 675-76, 291 A.2d at 498 (citation omitted). Marco Associates further argued that its having to report the untaxable federal income was because of \u201ca technical requirement of the Internal Revenue Code, rather than because of any real change in the situation of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678, 291 A.2d at 494. We replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">This argument ... overlooks the manner in which the Maryland income tax is structured. Its focus is on the taxable income of a corporation, or the adjusted gross income of an individual, <em>as the same is developed in the taxpayer\u2019s federal income tax return, subject to the modifications permitted by the Act, </em>whether a federal tax is or is not generated by the federal return.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">The fact that a gain recognized by a Subchapter S corporation and reflected in its taxable income may be attributed to the corporation\u2019s shareholders under federal law does not alter the fact that it remains within the concept of taxable income under the <em>Act\u2014a figure upon which the Maryland tax is based.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-9\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In other words, the portion of Marco Associates\u2019 income earned in Maryland was derived from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>taxable income figure provided on its federal income tax return regardless of how that income was actually taxed under the I.R.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">We reached a similar conclusion in <em>NCR Corp. v. Comptroller, </em>313 Md. 118, 544 A.2d 764 (1988). In that case, the taxpayer had claimed on its 1976 federal tax return a credit for certain foreign income taxes paid on foreign-earned dividends. I.R.C. \u00a7 78 required that the company \u201cgross-up\u201d the income reported on its federal return by the amount of the credit. Prior to 1977, the Maryland Code did not allow the company to subtract that gross-up amount from its Maryland income, even though the gross-up served no relevant state income tax purpose. We nonetheless held that appellant could tax NCR based on the grossed-up figure reported on its federal income tax form. In doing so, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">As we have seen, \u00a7 280A(a) instructs, as it did in 1976, that \u201c[t]he net income of a corporation shall be the taxable income of such taxpayer as defined in the laws of the United States ... for the corresponding taxable period.... \u201d The purpose of that provision is \u201cto bring the State taxation system in conformity with the federal scheme.\u201d <em>Comptroller v. American Satellite Corp., </em>312 Md. 537, 545, 540 A.2d 1146, 1150 (1988). Since NCR\u2019s 1976 federal taxable income included the gross-up, and <em>since the Maryland statutes applicable to 1976 contained no authority to adjust or deduct that figure, it should, one would think, be included in Maryland taxable income.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 123, 544 A.2d at 766 (emphasis added) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Finally, in <em>Katzenberg v. Comptroller, </em>263 Md. 189, 282 A.2d 465 (1971), we reviewed the effect of the 1967 overhaul of the Maryland income tax code on capital gains taxes. Prior to 1967, capital gains were not taxed in Maryland as income. When the Legislature adopted the federal taxable income figure as the Maryland modified income, capital gains, which were taxed by the federal government, became taxable in Maryland. The taxpayers in <em>Katzenberg </em>argued that the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>tax provisions did not apply to their 1967-68 capital gains because they were earned on pre-1967 investments. Examining the use of the federal taxable income figure, we reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abd\">[T]he whole thrust of the Maryland Act is to impose a tax on the amount determined under the Internal Revenue Code as the adjusted gross income of an individual or the taxable income of a corporation. This is a formula or yardstick objectively derived which initially takes no account of the source, nature or composition of the funds; it is simply a figure developed by the federal return.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 204-05, 282 A.2d at 478. We added:</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">It is undoubtedly true that the General Assembly, had it seen fit to do so, could have imposed a tax on a taxpayer\u2019s gross income, without considering the source from which it came, whether it be earnings, investment income or profits realized from the sale of capital assets, and without granting exemptions, allowing deductions or permitting any other adjustments. If it could validly do this, and we think it could, there is no reason to doubt that it could select some other figure, objectively arrived at, upon which the tax could be based, <em>Tawes v. Strouse, </em>182 Md. 508, 512-13, 35 A.2d 233[, 235] (1943). It did this when it chose to base the tax on the figures for adjusted gross income and taxable income, <em>as developed by the federal returns.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 205-06, 282 A.2d at 473 (emphasis added). Ultimately, we upheld the assessment against the taxpayers, rejecting their argument, <em>inter alia, </em>that the new law was unconstitutionally arbitrary in its application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">It seems to us that the State has the better of this argument when it says that the Act uses as a base an individual taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income reported for federal income tax purposes, with certain additions and subtractions. The Act is not directed at payments received from installment sales before the date of its enactment. Neither does it purport to be a tax on capital gains as such or a tax on installment payments as such. It is rather a tax measured by the yardstick of income reported for federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>tax purposes, whether capital gains be reflected in this figure or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 203-04, 282 A.2d at 472. <em>American Satellite, Marco Associates, NCR Corp. </em>and <em>Katzenberg </em>all lead to the same interpretation of section 10-304: the figure reported as federal taxable income on a federal return is the base figure used on the Maryland tax form as Maryland modified income, subject to recalculation only by sections 10-305 through 10-308.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant apparently understands this interpretation of its power to compute Maryland income tax to be correct. In its own regulations, COMAR, 03.04.03.05(B), \u201cUse of Federal Figures,\u201d appellant has determined that \u201c[t]he starting point for the Maryland return is the taxable income as defined in the Internal Revenue Code <em>and developed on the federal </em>return.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The Illinois Appellate Court, in <em>Bodine Electric Co. v. Allphin, </em>70 Ill.App.3d 844, 27 Ill.Dec. 356, 389 N.E.2d 168 (1979) , <em>aff'd, </em>81 Ill.2d 502, 43 Ill.Dec. 695, 410 N.E.2d 828 (1980) , made a similar interpretation of their state\u2019s corporate income tax code. The parties in <em>Bodine Electric </em>debated the effect a federal tax code provision regarding net operating losses had on the taxpayer\u2019s state taxable income. Noting that the state income tax \u201cprovisions mandate that the taxpayer\u2019s state base income is equal to its Federal taxable income as determined on a separate return basis and subject to specified adjustments,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 846, 27 Ill.Dec. 356, 389 N.E.2d at 170, the Appellate Court balked at the parties\u2019 implication that the I.R.C. provision at issue had any effect on the amount of state taxable income:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-8\">There is no provision in the Illinois Act which specifically adopts all federally allowed deductions; however, the Illi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>nois Act does specifically adopt federal taxable income as the starting point upon which the state tax is computed....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">Although the legislature has adopted federal taxable income as a starting point for calculating state corporate income tax, it has not enacted a specific statutory provision allowing a deduction for net operating loss....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">... We must, therefore, conclude that the taxpayer is entitled to a net operating loss deduction only in the same manner and amount as the taxpayer would have been entitled to such a deduction on its federal income tax return for the same taxable year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 847, 848, 27 Ill.Dec. 356, 389 N.E.2d at 171, 172. In affirming, the Illinois Supreme Court held that \u201cthe legislature\u2019s intent [is] that a net-operating-loss deduction is relevant to the computation of Illinois tax liability only insofar as this deduction enters into the computation of base income under the relevant provisions of the Act.\u201d 81 Ill.2d at 510, 43 Ill.Dec. 695, 410 N.E.2d at 832. <em>See also B.W. Co. v. State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>370 Mass. 18, 20, 345 N.E.2d 884, 886 (1976) (noting that a gain not included on the taxpayer\u2019s federal tax return \u201cwas not part of its Federal gross income and literally, therefore, was not part of the taxpayer\u2019s Massachusetts gross income.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">We note that appellant responds to appellee\u2019s argument that I.R.C. \u00a7 482 authorizes only the IRS to allocate income by pointing out several I.R.C. provisions that empower the IRS to perform various income-determination functions. Appellant implies that it too can enforce these provisions to ensure that taxpayers accurately report their Maryland modified income. Most of the I.R.C. provisions cited by appellant, however, either impose mandatory powers upon the IRS or grant it the authority to impose mandatory regulations in order to calculate federal taxable income.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is completely different from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>I.R.C. \u00a7 482, which grants the IRS full discretion to individually impute income between affiliated taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">If a taxpayer failed to report certain income on its federal tax return that the I.R.C. <em>mandated </em>it to report, and the IRS accepted that figure, appellant should be permitted to recalculate the Maryland modified income because the federal taxable income figure it relies on would be incorrect. Likewise, if the IRS exercised its discretion to create mandatory regulations that required the taxpayer to report certain income, and the taxpayer failed to do so, appellant could follow those IRS regulations in recalculating the Maryland modified income. In both cases, the statute or regulation are rigid and objective in their determination of what is taxable income. If we were to hold that appellant could never apply such provisions, then taxpayers who evade their federal income taxes would be free, without considering criminal sanctions, to evade their Maryland income tax obligation as well.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We should not attribute such an illogical intent to the Legislature\u2019s 1967 revision of the state tax code. <em>See Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 418, 722 A.2d 887, 895 (1999) (\u201c[W]e should construe the statute in a manner that results in an interpretation \u2018reasonable and consonant with logic and common sense.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 654, 705 A.2d 1128, 1131 (1998))); <em>Edgewater Liquors, Inc. v. Liston, </em>349 Md. 803, 808, 709 A.2d 1301, 1303 (1998) (\u201c[W]e approach statutory construction from a common sense perspective.\u201d); <em>Lewis, </em>348 Md. at 662, 705 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>at 1135 (\u201cWe shall not interpret a statute to produee unusual or extraordinary results, absent the clear legislative intent to enact such a provision.\u201d); <em>D &amp; Y, Inc. v. Winston, </em>320 Md. 534, 538, 578 A.2d 1177, 1179 (1990) (\u201c[Construction of a statute which is unreasonable, illogical, unjust, or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided.\u201d); <em>Blandon v. State, </em>304 Md. 316, 319, 498 A.2d 1195, 1196 (1985) (\u201c[R]ules of statutory construction require us to avoid construing a statute in a way which would lead to absurd results.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">I.R.C. \u00a7 482, on the other hand, is completely within the subjective discretion of the IRS: \u201cthe Secretary <em>may </em>distribute, apportion, or allocate gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances between or among ... businesses.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As stated in Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.482-1(a)(1) (as amended in 1994), \u201c[t]he purpose of section 482 is to ensure that taxpayers clearly reflect income attributable to controlled transactions, and to prevent the avoidance of taxes with respect to such transactions.\u201d As a result, \u201c[t]he [IRS] district director <em>may </em>make allocations between or among the members of a controlled group if a controlled taxpayer has not reported its true taxable income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1.482-1(a)(2) (emphasis added). I.R.C. \u00a7 482 and its corresponding regulations, therefore, grant the IRS a choice whether to allocate income between affiliated taxpayers when evidence exists that the taxpayer had not reported its income correctly. Because we must construe our own income-determining statutes against appellant, <em>see supra, </em>we cannot extend such a discretionary choice to appellant. If the IRS fails to impute discretionary federal taxable income to the taxpayer, appellant must accept that determination, and the resulting federal taxable income figure, as the Maryland modified income. As we noted in <em>Marco Associates, </em>265 Md. at 676, 291 A.2d at 493,\u201d[t]his may not be fair, but it is a fact of life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The New York Court of Appeals made a similar interpretation of its state income tax provisions in <em>People ex rel. Barcalo Mfg. Co. v. Knapp, </em>227 N.Y. 64, 124 N.E. 107 (1919). At the time, in New York</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>[a] definition of the words \u201cnet income\u201d was not incorporated in the [state] statute. The meaning given and characterizing them through and as used in the Federal statutes was their meaning as used in the state statute. The conditions and limitations, expressed in the Federal statutes, creating their office and effect under those statutes are adopted by the state statute. It used the term net income as established by the Federal statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 70-71, 124 N.E. at 108. To the court, this meant that \u201cwithin the legislative intention the net income of the statute is that <em>returned or reported </em>to the United States in accordance with the Federal statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71, 124 N.E. at 108 (emphasis added). The court noted, as we do in the case <em>sub judice, </em>that \u201cthe [state tax] commission is free to fix, from the return and any other information, the true and correct amount of the net income, but not to change the nature or definition of it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the state tax agency is free to correct falsehoods and incorrect statements made on the federal income tax return, subsequently transferred to the state return, but not alter the definition of what is or is not the taxpayer\u2019s income. The authority bestowed upon the IRS by I.R.C. \u00a7 482 is a power in the latter category. Thus, for appellant to possess authority similar to that contained in I.R.C. \u00a7 482, they must seek it from legislative enactment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">That several of our sister states\u2019 legislatures have adopted statutes that specifically incorporate I.R.C. \u00a7 482 into their tax code or bestow \u00a7 482-type powers upon its state revenue agency bolsters our holding that appellant can only exercise such powers with the grace of the General Assembly. The legislatures of Alaska, California, and Hawaii, for instance, have expressly incorporated I.R.C. \u00a7 482 into their own tax codes. <em>See </em>Alaska Stat. \u00a7 43.20.021(a) (Lexis 1998); Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax.Code \u00a7 24725 (West 1999); Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 235-2.3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>(Supp.1998). A number of other state legislatures have adopted their own statutes based upon the language of I.R.C. \u00a7 482. <em>See </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 43-942(A) (West 1998); Ark.Code Ann. \u00a7 26-51-805(e) (Michie 1997); Colo.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 39-22-303(6) (West 1999); D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 47-1810.3 (1997); Ind.Code Ann. \u00a7 6-3-2-2(m) (Michie 1998); Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 79-32,141 (1997); La.Rev.Stat.

Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 71.30(2), .80(1)(b) (West 1999). At least six other states provide their respective tax authority with broad power to prevent distortions of net income and deceptive tax accounting methods. <em>See </em>Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 12-226a (1997); Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 48-7-58(a) (1995); N.Y. Tax Law \u00a7 211(5) (Consol.1990); N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 105-130.16 (1997) ; R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 44-11-4 (1995); Va.Code. Ann. \u00a7 58.1-446 (Michie 1997). There is no reason why appellant could not seek similar authority from the General Assembly. However, until appellant obtains the authority to allocate income for tax enforcement purposes, it cannot assume that it has such authority from the provisions of the federal tax code. <em>See Allison v. Department of Revenue, </em>11 Or. Tax 431, 435 (1990) (holding that the state legislature had not adopted I.R.C. \u00a7 482 by reference); <em>cf. Ex Parte Jones Mfg. Co., </em>589 So.2d 208, 210 (Ala.1991) (noting that the state legislature had statutorily adopted I.R.C. \u00a7 337, which prevented gains made from a total liquidation of assets from being assessed, but not I.R.C. \u00a7 1245, which required any part of those gains that recaptured depreciation to be assessed); <em>In re Estate of Armstrong, </em>133 Mont. 328, 331-32, 323 P.2d 595, 596-97 (1958) (holding that a state law authorizing taxpayers to use the \u201cbest accounting practice in the trade or business\u201d did not incorporate by reference a federal tax provision granting special capital gains tax status to breeding animals and that, to hold otherwise, would \u201camount[ ] to judicial legislation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Finally, we address appellant\u2019s implication that section 10-107, which states \u201c[t]o the extent practicable, [appellant] shall apply the administrative and judicial interpretations of the federal income tax law to the administration of the income tax laws of this State,\u201d requires it \u201cto apply ... all relevant principles of federal tax law,\u201d including those contained in I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 482 and 7872. Section 10-107 is not a direct authorization for appellant to incorporate into the Maryland tax code whatever I.R.C. provisions it sees fit to apply; rather, section 10-107 expresses a policy of comity that, when exercising any legislatively-authorized powers that parallel an I.R.C. provision, appellant must comply with the judicial and administrative interpretations of that federal statute. We noted as much in <em>Lyon v. Campbell, </em>324 Md. 178, 185, 596 A.2d 1012, 1015 (1991):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">Section 10-107 applies where the Maryland tax code is \u201c \u2018inextricably keyed\u2019 \u201d to the federal tax code \u201cby virtue of its adoption of the federal law.\u201d <em>Comptroller v. Chesapeake Corp., </em>54 Md.App. 208, 213-14, 458 A.2d 459, 463 (1983). It avoids the \u201canomalous result\u201d of the taxpayer achieving a different result regarding payment of Maryland tax where the Maryland tax provision incorporates the federal tax provision. <em>See Comptroller v. Diebold, Inc., </em>279 Md. 401, 409, 369 A.2d 77, 82 (1977) (holding that where the Maryland tax code incorporates a federal tax code provision, the interpretation of the Maryland and federal tax provisions should be consistent).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Other states have interpreted their particular version of section 10-107 in a similar manner. In <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Allphin v. Borders, </em>267 S.W.2d 940, 941 (Ky.1954), the taxpayer argued that Kentucky\u2019s version of the statute stood \u201cfor the proposition that the federal law would be applied unless the state law expressly provided for a different result.\u201d The Court of Appeals of Kentucky agreed with the state tax authority, however, that the statute \u201ccontemplated only the adoption of <em>interpretations </em>of federal law in those cases where the same or a similar situation arose under the state law, or where the provisions of the federal and state laws were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>similar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also noted that \u201c[i]f we were to accept the argument of the taxpayer, it would mean that every deduction allowed under the federal law and not mentioned in the state law would have been allowable for state income tax purposes.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, in <em>Central Maine Power Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, </em>382 A.2d 302, 320 (Me.1978), has said that Maine\u2019s version of the statute \u201cmerely attempts to resolve semantic conflicts in the interest of efficiency.... [W]e do not view [the statute] itself as mandating our passive acceptance of all federal interpretations of federal tax statutes.\u201d <em>Cf. In re Estate of Armstrong, </em>133 Mont. at 331, 323 P.2d at 596-97 (noting that when a specific Montana \u201cincome tax law in force ... bore no likeness to the Federal law,\u201d that \u201c[r]esort to the Federal statutes or decisions\u201d would provide \u201cno aid in the <em>interpretation </em>of the state statute.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Section 10-107 does not grant any authority to appellant. The statute merely states that, when appellant is specifically empowered to enforce an I.R.C. provision, it must obey the previous administrative and judicial interpretations of the tax law at issue as precedent. The statute does not allow appellant to put forth its own interpretation that a federal tax law is incorporated into the Maryland tax code.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">C. Authority to Impute Income Under I.R.C. \u00a7 7872</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The plain language of I.R.C. \u00a7 7872 reflects that it is a mandatory income-determining provision for the IRS. It does not grant the IRS, as I.R.C. \u00a7 482 appears to, any discretion over whether to enforce its terms, except through self-imposed regulations. Thus, appellant may enforce the terms of that federal statute in determining Maryland modified income, when its application affects the federal taxable income figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">We noted, <em>supra, </em>that section 10-107 mandates that appellant comply with all judicial and administrative interpretations of I.R.C. \u00a7 7872. The IRS has adopted regulations describing what types of transactions are to be affected by I.R.C. \u00a7 7872. They state in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>(3) <em>Loans without significant tax effect. </em>Whether a loan will be considered to be a loan the interest arrangements of which have a significant effect on any Federal tax liability of the lender or the borrower will be determined according to all of the facts and circumstances. Among the factors to be considered are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-5\">(i) Whether items of income and deduction generated by the loan offset each other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">(ii) The amount of such items;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-7\">(iii) The cost to the taxpayer of complying with the provisions of section 7872 if such section were applied; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-8\">(iv) Any non-tax reasons for deciding to structure the transaction as a below-market loan rather than a loan with interest at a rate equal to or greater than the applicable</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE6\">Federal rate and a payment by the lender to the borrower.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ade\">Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.7872-5T(c)(3) (as amended in 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">Section 10-107 requires appellant to follow this regulatory interpretation as worded by the IRS. As appellee argues, the regulation is only concerned with the effect a transaction will have on federal tax liability; in this case, the intercompany account transactions had no effect because their tax consequences offset each other, a situation specifically addressed by the regulation. As a result, I.R.C. \u00a7 7872 could not affect appellee\u2019s taxable income as reported on its federal return. Because appellee complied with both the statute and the regulation, the corporate taxable income figure is correct as reported on its federal tax return. As we noted, <em>supra, </em>appellant may enforce a mandatory provision, like I.R.C. \u00a7 7872, to ensure that the federal taxable income figure transferred to the Maryland tax form is correct. Appellant wishes to take the auspices of I.R.C. \u00a7 7872 a step further, however, and impute income for purely State income tax purposes. This it cannot do; once the federal taxable income figures are verified as true and correct under the mandatory I.R.C. provisions, appellant must accept those figures. In this case, the credits legitimately were left unreported on appellee\u2019s federal tax return; appellee could not thereafter add <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>those credits to appellee\u2019s Maryland modified income in order to generate State income tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">In calculating Maryland modified income for an affiliated corporation in Maryland, appellant generally must accept the figure adopted as taxable income on the corporate taxpayer\u2019s consolidated federal return, subject to the specific Maryland modifications allowed under Maryland\u2019s tax code. In this case, appellee\u2019s modified federal taxable income as reported on its consolidated tax returns did not reflect any income derived from I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 482 and 7872. Appellant could only allocate appellee\u2019s portion of that consolidated income based on the remaining applicable state code provisions pertaining to apportionment and modification. None of those provisions grant any power to appellant, similar to that contained in I.R.C. \u00a7 482, to allocate or impute income for tax enforcement purposes. Nor do any of these provisions authorize appellant to enforce I.R.C. \u00a7 7872 beyond its terms in order to generate state income tax from income legitimately not reported on a taxpayer\u2019s federal return.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The decision of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\">.

The parties debate the effect of the IRS audit. The audit is irrelevant to the case <em>sub judice </em>for two reasons. First, the IRS was concerned with an I.R.C. provision different from the provisions involved in this case. Second, as noted, <em>supra, </em>the parties submitted a written stipulation to the Maryland Tax Court in which appellee admitted the inter-company credits constituted debt for the purposes of assessing Maryland income tax. In that stipulation, appellee reserved the right to appeal appellant\u2019s authority to impute taxable interest income from those debts, but bound itself not to appeal whether the credits constituted debt. What <em>is </em>relevant to this case, as explained, <em>infra, </em>is the final taxable income figure accepted by the IRS on the federal tax return.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b767-8\">.

There are other provisions that affect the final income figure reported on the Maryland tax form; for instance, 10-402 requires that only Maryland-earned income be reported by corporations and section 10-811 requires affiliated corporations to allocate income to each separate business entity.

Similar to the I.R.C. provisions, section 10-504 specifically grants appellant the authority to allow the taxpayer to change its accounting period.
