Respondent\u2019s license suspension was based upon his refusal to take a chemical breath test as requested by an officer of the Maryland State Police after the officer had stopped Respondent while driving his pickup truck in Carroll County during the early morning hours of October 24, 1997. Respondent seeks to challenge the validity of his driver\u2019s license suspension through constitutional scrutiny of the officer\u2019s initial stop. Our task is to determine whether such a challenge is legally viable. More specifically, we must decide in this appeal whether the exclusionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>rule of the Fourth Amendment applies in a civil administrative driver\u2019s license suspension proceeding conducted pursuant to \u00a7 16\u2014205.1(f) of the Transportation Article of the Maryland Code. We shall hold that the rule does not apply and shall therefore reverse the judgment rendered by the Circuit Court for Carroll County in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Shortly after midnight on October 24, 1997, Trooper F.W. Quisay, Jr. of the Maryland State Police was driving through Carroll County on the northern edge of the town of Westminster.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As he was patrolling the area and traveling north, the trooper \u201clooked up on Naugahyde Drive and ... observed a vehicle\u2019s tail lights either stopped or close to stopping in the middle of the road right there towards the end of the road.\u201d Aware that \u201cCarroll County ha[d] been experiencing a rash of vehicle thefts and night time burglaries ... in the area of Westminster and north of Westminster,\u201d and noting that there were no houses in the vicinity where the vehicle had slowed or stopped, Trooper Quisay \u201cdecided to turn around and check the vehicle to see where [the driver] might be going and see if he was going into one of the houses [on the street].\u201d Trooper Quisay followed the vehicle, a dark green pickup truck with a \u201cdealer tag,\u201d onto Naugahyde Drive. Knowing this road to be a dead end street, the officer surmised that the driver \u201ceither lived there or he had no real business there.\u201d The pickup truck \u201cwent all the way to the dead end of Naugahyde Drive, turned around and came back out ... without stopping at any of the houses.\u201d Thereupon Trooper Quisay stopped the vehicle: because it was \u201c12:30 in the morning I just felt that was a little odd so I decided to stop the car and check on the driver and see what business he may have had in the neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">When Trooper Quisay spoke to the driver, later identified as Respondent, he immediately \u201cdetected a strong odor of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>alcoholic beverage.\u201d Trooper Quisay asked Respondent to step out of the pickup truck and proceeded to administer field sobriety tests. Based on Respondent\u2019s performance on the tests, Trooper Quisay arrested him and took him to the police barracks. At the barracks, Respondent refused Trooper Quisay\u2019s request to take a chemical breath test for blood-alcohol content. Upon Respondent\u2019s refusal, the trooper issued an order suspending Richards\u2019s driver\u2019s license pursuant to this State\u2019s \u201cadministrative <em>per se </em>\u201d statute, codified under Maryland Code (1977, 1999 Repl.Vol., 1999 Supp.) \u00a7 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1(f), Respondent requested a hearing to determine whether his driver\u2019s license was properly suspended. The Administrative Law Judge (hereinafter \u201cthe ALJ\u201d) concluded that Respondent\u2019s license was suspended properly as a result of his refusal to take the chemical breath test requested by Trooper Quisay: the trooper had reasonable grounds to believe that the Respondent was driving while intoxicated based upon the odor of alcohol and Respondent\u2019s poor performance of the field sobriety tests. As to the propriety of the initial stop, the ALJ stated that he had no jurisdiction over the legality of the stop other than to determine whether the stop was made in good faith, which he found to be true in Respondent\u2019s case. In that regard, the ALJ stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">The stop itself was a good faith stop. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the stop was made because of suspicion of drinking or not. What matters is that the stop be made just as a good faith stop, in other words, that people aren\u2019t stopped just because they\u2019re a different color or whatever or that there\u2019s some kind of personal animosity or whatever. In this case it\u2019s clear that the officer had grounds to believe that there was suspicious activity based on what was going on so he had a grounds to stop the car. Once he did stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the car, then the question becomes did he have a reasonable basis to believe that Mr. Richards had been driving while intoxicated. He notes a moderate odor of alcohol on his breath. He gave him field sobriety tests, which he failed, all of which mean that the officer\u2019s process was correct----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The ALJ ordered Respondent\u2019s license suspended for 120 days for refusing to take a breath test when properly requested to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">On judicial review of the administrative proceeding, the circuit court reversed the judgment of the ALJ and held that the suspension of Respondent\u2019s license was improper because Trooper Quisay did not have any justification to stop Respondent\u2019s vehicle. In announcing its decision, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-h\">. Well, I guess good faith is equating to articulable suspicion or maybe something less than articulable suspicion, but there is a constitutional right to not be capriciously or arbitrarily pulled over by any police officer and questioned about anything, and there\u2019s a freedom of movement, ... a citizen has a right to be on the public streets----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">$ * # * <em>$ </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">... [E]ven though perhaps the Administrative Law Judge does not feel he can consider the legality of the stop, I think somewhere the constitution has to come into play and to follow his reasoning, as I say, any officer could stop any other officer, and we have very restrictive procedural matters, particularly when it comes to things like roadblocks and stopping all the people that come down the road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">So I think, on those grounds, there was absolutely no right of Trooper Quisay, at that point. He followed this vehicle far enough that he could have developed any\u2014any articulable suspicion that there was someone driving under the influence of alcohol.... So, although we don\u2019t get into the legality of the stop too often, I think this is pretty blatant. I don\u2019t think there was any justification for the stop of the person in the first place and, of course, anything after that, I think, would not be chargeable to the Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>dant. So, I\u2019m gonna reverse the ... Administrative Law Judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The Motor Vehicle Administration (hereinafter \u201cthe MVA\u201d or \u201cthe State\u201d) petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari to review the circuit court\u2019s ruling. We granted certiorari to consider whether the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment (1) applies in the civil administrative driver\u2019s license suspension proceeding provided for under \u00a7 16-205.1(f) and (2) thus bars introduction of evidence based on a purportedly unlawful motor vehicle stop, when an administrative law judge has found that the officer conducting the stop had a good faith basis for taking that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">As the petitioner in this case, the MVA argues that the license suspension proceeding under \u00a7 16-205.1(f) does not fall within any exception to the general rule that the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment does not apply to civil proceedings. The MVA further contends that the marginal benefits of applying the exclusionary rule to this proceeding are far outweighed by the substantial social costs its application would impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Respondent counters that regardless of legislative enactments or administrative rule-making, the exclusionary rule applies to \u201crefusal hearings\u201d under \u00a7 16-205.1 because of the nature and purpose of those hearings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">Since the refusal to take the test is the crux of the refusal hearing, is inadmissible in the criminal proceeding[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] and clearly does not provide any evidence of intoxication <em>vel non, </em>the administrative sanction is clearly punitive. As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>purely punitive measure, the refusal hearing is more in the nature of a quasi-criminal proceeding such as in One <em>1995 Corvette </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Respondent\u2019s Brief at 7. The case to which Respondent refers, <em>One 1995 Corvette v. Baltimore, </em>353 Md. 114, 724 A.2d 680 (1999), is a recent decision by this Court in which we held the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment applicable in civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture proceedings. <em>See also One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, </em>380 U.S. 693, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 14 L.Ed.2d 170 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Central to this case are the purpose, legal effect and constitutional ramifications of Maryland\u2019s \u201cimplied consent, administrative <em>per se </em>\u201d motor vehicle law, codified as \u00a7 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article. In 1988, the General Assembly established a Task Force on Drunk and Drugged Driving \u201cbecause \u2018the problem of drunk and drugged driving is of continuing concern to the citizens of the State of Maryland.\u2019 \u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Gaddy, </em>335 Md. 342, 347, 643 A.2d 442, 444 (1994) (quoting Joint Resolution No. 15 of the Acts of 1988). As we reiterated last year,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">Among the several matters studied by that task force were (1) an <em>administrative per se </em>law, making both the refusal to take an alcohol test and the taking of such a test that revealed 0.10 or greater alcohol concentration an administrative offense that would lead to the rapid <em>and mandated </em>suspension of the offender\u2019s driver\u2019s license, and (2) a <em>criminal per se </em>law, that would make driving with an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more a <em>per se </em>criminal offense. <em>See </em>Task Force on Drunk and Drugged Driving Minutes, September 13, 1988, September 27, 1988, October 13,1988.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-9\"><em>Janes v. State, </em>350 Md. 284, 304, 711 A.2d 1319, 1329 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">The Task Force issued a report during the 1988 legislative interim which \u201caddressed the possibility of establishing an administrative per se law to provide immediate suspension of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>driver\u2019s license of a person detained by police on the suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while intoxicated or under the influence.\u201d Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Bill Analysis for Senate Bill 398, at 3 (1989). During .the 1989 legislative session, the General Assembly acted upon the Task Force\u2019s recommendation and enacted an implied consent, administrative <em>per se </em>statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The first two subsections of the statute establish that (1) by driving on a Maryland public roadway a person impliedly consents to taking a test to determine breath or blood alcohol concentration if reasonably requested to do so and (2) although a motorist may refuse to take such a test, such a refusal entails a suspension of the license to drive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, those subsections provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\u00a7 16-205.1. Suspension or disqualification for refusal to submit to chemical tests for intoxication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">(a) <em>Definitions; implied consent to chemical </em>test.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">(2) Any person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State is deemed to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>consented, subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-802 through 10-309, inclusive, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, to take a [breath or blood specimen] test [to determine alcohol concentration] if the person should be detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while intoxicated, while under the influence of alcohol, while so far under the influence of any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">(b) <em>No compulsion to take chemical test; consequences of </em>refusal.\u2014(1) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a person may not be compelled to take a test.

For a test refusal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">A. For a first offense, suspend the driver\u2019s license for 120 days; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">B. For a second or subsequent offense, suspend the driver\u2019s license for 1 year....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">The portion of the statute immediately succeeding those above provides that \u201cif a police officer stops or detains any person who the police officer has reasonable grounds to believe is or has been\u201d driving or attempting to drive while impaired by alcohol and/or drugs, \u201cthe police officer shall ... [d]etain the person; ... [r]equest that the person permit a test to be taken; and ... [a]dvise the person of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed for refusal to take the test ....\u201d\u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2). The statute then designates that if a motorist licensed to drive in Maryland refuses to submit to the requested test, the officer is obligated, <em>inter alia, </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>conf\u00edscate the Maryland driver\u2019s license, serve an order of suspension, issue a temporary 45-day license, and advise the motorist of the right to request an administrative hearing to review the propriety of the license suspension. <em>See </em>\u00a7 16-205.1(b)(3). The prerequisites and scope of such a hearing are specified by subsection (f), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">(f) <em>Notice and hearing on refusal to take test; suspension of license or privilege to drive; disqualification from driving commercial vehicles. </em>\u2014(1) Subject to the provisions of this subsection, at the time of, or within 30 days from the date of, the issuance of an order of suspension, a person may submit a written request for a hearing before an officer of the Administration if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">(i) The person is arrested for driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while intoxicated, while under the influence of alcohol, while so far under the influence of any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">(ii) 1. There is an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more at the time of testing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">2. The person refused to take a test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-9\">(7) (i) At a hearing under this section, the person has the rights described in \u00a7 12-206 of this article, but at the hearing the only issues shall be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">1. Whether the police officer who stops or detains a person had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or attempting to drive while intoxicated, while under the influence of alcohol, while so far under the influence of any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>2.

Whether the police officer requested a test after the person was fully advised of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed, including the fact that a person who refuses to take the test is ineligible for modification of a suspension or issuance of a restrictive license under subsection (n)(l) and (2) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">4.

If the hearing involves disqualification of a commercial driver\u2019s license, whether the person was operating a commercial motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the MVA is required to suspend the Maryl\u00e1nd driver\u2019s license of the motorist for 120 days for a first offense if it has been shown that the investigating officer complied with the mandates and duties under the statute, there was use by the motorist of alcohol and/or drugs, and the motorist refused to submit to the properly requested test. <em>See </em>\u00a7 16-205.1(f)(8).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">As we explained in <em>Janes, </em>the General Assembly made a deliberate effort in drafting \u00a7 16-205.1 to keep the criminal and administrative proceedings resulting from a suspected drunk-driving incident wholly separate. <em>See id., </em>350 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>304, 711 A.2d at 1328. Moreover, subsection (f)(7) makes paramountly clear that the constitutionality of the stop giving rise to the test request is not one of the issues to be presented at the hearing, nor is the possible exclusion of unconstitutionally seized evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, Respondent concedes that the language of the statute itself gives him no relief in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>present matter. Rather, the core thrust of his appeal is an attack upon the ALJ\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute as not affording exclusion, under the Fourth Amendment, of his refusal to take the test from the evidence presented at his license suspension hearing. Fleshed out more fully, Respondent\u2019s central contention is that whereas the officer\u2019s reasons for requesting the test that he refused to take resulted from a constitutionally invalid stop, those reasons should not be available to demonstrate that the officer had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe a test was called for.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The United States Supreme Court just over a year ago revisited the possibility of extending the operation of the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment beyond the criminal trial context and, once again, declined to do so. <em>See Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation v. Scott, </em>524 U.S. 357,-, 118 S.Ct. 2014, 2020, 141 L.Ed.2d 344 (1998). The majority summarized the Court\u2019s historical approach to the applicability of the exclusionary rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">We have emphasized repeatedly that the State\u2019s use of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment does not itself violate the Constitution. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 906, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 3411-3412, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984); <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 482, 486, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 3046-3047, 3048-3049, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976). Rather, a Fourth Amendment violation is \u201c \u2018fully accomplished\u2019\u201d by the illegal search or seizure, and no exclusion of evidence from a judicial or administrative proceeding can \u201c \u2018cure the invasion of the defendant\u2019s rights which he has already suffered.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Leon, supra, </em>at 906, 104 S.Ct., at 3412 (quoting <em>Stone v. Powell, supra, </em>at 540, 96 S.Ct., at 3074 (White, J., dissenting)). The exclusionary rule is instead a judicially created means of deterring illegal searches and seizures. <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 348, 94 S.Ct. 613, 620, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974). As such, the rule does not \u201cproscribe the introduction of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>against all persons,\u201d <em>Stone v. Powell, supra, </em>at 486, 96 S.Ct., at 3049, but applies only in contexts \u201cwhere its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served,\u201d <em>United States v. Calandra, supra, </em>at 348, 94 S.Ct., at 620; see also <em>United States v. Janis, </em>428 U.S. 433, 454, 96 S.Ct. 3021, 3032, 49 L.Ed.2d 1046 (1976) (\u201cIf ... the exclusionary rule does not result in appreciable deterrence, then, clearly, its use in the instant situation is unwarranted\u201d). Moreover, because the rule is prudential rather than constitutionally mandated, we have held it to be applicable only where its deterrence benefits outweigh its \u201csubstantial social costs.\u201d <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S., at 907, 104 S.Ct., at 3412.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">Recognizing these costs, we have repeatedly declined to extend the exclusionary rule to proceedings other than criminal trials. <em>Id., </em>at 909, 104 S.Ct., at 3413; <em>United States v. Janis, supra, </em>at 447, 96 S.Ct., at 3028-3029.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 118 S.Ct. at 2019. Prior to <em>Scott, </em>the proceedings outside a criminal trial to which the Supreme Court had refused to extend the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment included grand jury proceedings, <em>see Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 94 S.Ct. 613; federal civil tax proceedings, <em>see Janis, </em>428 U.S. 433, 96 S.Ct. 3021; and civil deportation proceedings, <em>see I.N.S. v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984). It thus remains true in the wake of <em>Scott </em>that \u201c[i]n the complex and turbulent history of the [exclusionary] rule, the Court never has applied it to exclude evidence from a civil proceeding, federal or state.\u201d <em>Janis, </em>428 U.S. at 447, 96 S.Ct. at 3029.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In each case in which the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Court has considered so extending this remedy, \u201cthe Court determined that the potential benefit of applying the exclusionary rule was outweighed by the resulting cost to societal interests.\u201d <em>Riche v. Director of Revenue, </em>987 S.W.2d 331, 334 (Mo.1999) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">This Court has also been called upon several times to determine the applicability of the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment to civil proceedings in various contexts. In only one case have we held the exclusionary rule applicable to a proceeding other than a criminal trial. <em>See One 1995 Corvette v. Baltimore, </em>353 Md. 114, 724 A.2d 680 (1999) (following Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, </em>380 U.S. 693, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 14 L.Ed.2d 170 (1965) and ruling exclusionary rule of Fourth Amendment applicable in civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture proceedings, in part because of their \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d nature).

Furthermore, the Supreme Court has unequivocally \u201cestablished that the \u2018prime purpose\u2019 of the rule, if not the sole one, \u2018is to deter future unlawful police conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Janis, </em>428 U.S. at 446, 96 S.Ct. at 3028 (quoting <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 347, 94 S.Ct. at 619); <em>Whitaker, </em>307 Md. at 381, 514 A.2d at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">We have noted the marginal deterrent effect and the substantial costs of applying the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment beyond the context of criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings. For example, in rejecting the application of the rule in public nuisance proceedings, we noted that \u201c[a] detective who might be tempted to obtain evidence illegally for use in a criminal case may not even consider the effect of such illegality upon a proceeding to abate a public nuisance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 514 A.2d at 12. We have also expressed concern with the effect of applying the exclusionary rule in streamlined administrative proceedings. <em>See Sheetz, </em>315 Md. at 215 n. 8, 553 A.2d at 1284 n. 8 (\u201c \u2018On the cost side there is the loss of often probative evidence and all of the secondary costs that flow from the less accurate or more cumbersome adjudication that therefore occurs.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. at 1041, 104 S.Ct. at 3485)).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Given the general background of the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment and the substantial body of precedent under both the Supreme Court and this Court generally refusing to extend its operation beyond the context of a criminal trial, we shall now proceed to determine whether the rule should be applied as a matter of principle to hearings conducted pursuant to \u00a7 16\u2014205.1(f). In light of that precedent, we shall focus on whether the benefits of applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>exclusionary rule to administrative license suspension hearings outweigh the costs of such.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">At the outset, we reject the notion that an administrative license suspension proceeding under \u00a7 16\u2014205.1(f) requires the application of the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment because such a proceeding is \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d in nature. Respondent has taken great pains to distinguish the administrative proceeding in the present case, a \u201crefusal\u201d hearing, from a hearing under the same statute with respect to a person who took the chemical breath test and \u201cfailed\u201d (by registering a blood-alcohol content of .10 percent or higher) as well as from other purely civil proceedings. Along these lines, Respondent asserts the refusal hearing to be \u201cpurely punitive\u201d and \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d in nature, therefore analogizing it to the civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture proceeding, to which we recently held the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment applicable. <em>See One 1995 Corvette v. Baltimore, </em>353 Md. 114, 724 A.2d 680 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Writing for the Court in <em>1995 Corvette, </em>Judge Cathell stated that \u201cthe <em>Fourth Amendment </em>applies to <em>all </em>\u2018unreasonable searches and seizures\u2019 by the government, regardless of context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 724 A.2d at 688 (citation omitted) (first emphasis added). On the other hand, as Judge Cathell prefaced, the <em>exclusionary rule </em>of that Amendment \u201cis a judicially-created remedy intended to apply primarily to criminal and \u2018quasi-criminal\u2019 proceedings.\u201d <em>Id., </em>724 A.2d at 688. Moreover, in labeling the forfeiture proceeding in <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, </em>380 U.S. 693, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 14 L.Ed.2d 170 (1965), \u201cquasi-criminal,\u201d the Supreme Court explained that the object of a forfeiture proceeding, \u201clike a criminal proceeding, is to penalize for the commission of an offense against the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 700, 85 S.Ct. at 1250 (quoted in <em>1995 Corvette, </em>353 Md. at 121, 724 A.2d at 683).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">We disagree with Respondent\u2019s characterization of \u00a7 16-205.1 as \u201cquasi-criminal.\u201d This Court has on several occasions addressed the purposes behind this State\u2019s legislation against \u201cdrunken driving.\u201d It is true that \u201c[t]he General Assembly\u2019s goal in enacting the drunk driving laws ... is \u2018to meet the considerable challenge created by this problem by enacting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>series of measures to rid our highways of the drunk driver menace.

Nevertheless, as we emphasized in <em>Shrader, </em>\u00a7 16-205.1 and related statutory provisions \u201cwere enacted for the protection of the public and not primarily for the protection of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464, 597 A.2d at 943 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">This Court has also previously found \u201cthat license suspensions generally serve remedial purposes,\u201d a conclusion \u201cdrawn from the purposes served by licensing systems themselves, <em>%.e. </em>to protect the public from unscrupulous or unskilled operators who would otherwise engage in the licensed activity.\u201d <em>State v.

Moreover, as we went on in <em>Jones </em>to elaborate,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">From the licensee\u2019s perspective, it is certainly true that suspension or revocation of a license may feel like \u2018punishment.\u2019 <em>A licensing system\u2019s ultimate goal, however, is to prevent unscrwpulous or incompetent persons from engaging in the licensed activity. </em>To this end, revocation or suspension of a license clearly prevents a wrongdoer from further engaging in the licensed activity, at least temporarily-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 252, 666 A.2d at 136 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court made similar observations while reviewing Massachusetts\u2019s implied consent, administrative <em>per se </em>statute in 1979. Albeit expressed in the context of reviewing that statute for comportment with the requirements of due process, those observations are nonetheless appropriate here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN_\">The Commonwealth\u2019s interest in public safety is substantially served by the summary suspension of those who refuse in several ways to take a breath-analysis test upon arrest. First, the very existence of the summary sanction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>of the statute serves as a deterrent to drunken driving. Second, it provides strong inducement to take the breath-analysis test and thus effectuates the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in obtaining reliable and relevant evidence for use in subsequent criminal proceedings. Third, in promptly removing such drivers from the road, the summary sanction of the statute contributes to the safety of public highways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">The summary and automatic character of the suspension sanction available under the statute is critical to attainment of these objectives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-6\"><em>Mackey v. Montrym, </em>443 U.S. 1, 18, 99 S.Ct. 2612, 2621, 61 L.Ed.2d 321 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Given the similarly multi-purposed nature of the sanctions in \u00a7 16-205.1, we do not view the statute as quasi-criminal. <em>See Powell v. Secretary of State, </em>614 A.2d 1303, 1307 (Me.1992) (concluding that \u201ca license suspension hearing is not a quasi-criminal proceeding\u201d). Nor do we see any principled reason to differentiate for our present inquiry a license suspension hearing under \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(l)(ii)(1)\u2014for test failures\u2014from one under \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(l)(ii)(2)\u2014for test refusals. Though prompted by distinct occurrences, the two hearings are both remedial in nature: their primary goals are first, to help effectuate the administrative goals of the MVA in ridding Maryland roadways of drunk drivers and, second, to encourage both general compliance with Maryland law as well as specific fulfillment of the consent to taking a properly requested chemical breath test implied by a motorist\u2019s entry upon and usage of this State\u2019s roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">With respect to the benefit of applying the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment in a \u00a7 16\u2014205.1(f) hearing, whether the case involves test failure or test refusal, we do not view any possible deterrent effect to be sufficiently significant. In either case, there would likely be only scant marginal deterrence because the police already suffer the exclusion of unlawfully seized evidence from criminal proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Penn-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>sylvania Bd. of Probation v.

Furthermore, because the MVA is a separate and independent agency from the police department and has no control over the actions of police officers, imposing the exclusionary rule in license suspension proceedings would add little force to the deterrence of unlawful police action. <em>See Riche v. Director of Revenue, </em>987 S.W.2d 331, 335 (Mo.1999) (en banc); <em>Westendorf v. Iowa Dept. of Transp., </em>400 N.W.2d 553, 557 (Iowa 1987). We find as a general matter that the administrative mechanisms and proceedings relative to license suspension or revocation fall \u201coutside the offending officer\u2019s zone of primary interest.\u201d <em>Janis, </em>428 U.S. at 458, 96 S.Ct. at 3034; <em>see also Scott, </em>524 U.S. at-, 118 S.Ct. at 2022.

Therefore, in this context, the exclusionary rule, designed to deter such violations, is not particularly useful.\u201d (footnote omitted)); <em>Com., Dept. of Transp. v. Wysocki, </em>517 Pa. 175, 535 A.2d 77, 79 (1987) (stating that basis for employing Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is to deter police officials from engaging in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>improper conduct for purpose of obtaining criminal convictions). <em>Cf. 1995 Corvette, </em>353 Md. at 138, 724 A.2d at 692, (with respect to law enforcement forfeitures, noting that \u201cgovernments increasingly have filed civil forfeiture actions in lieu of criminal charges, knowing that constitutional protections provide greater obstacles to their criminal cases, and that forfeitures have a great financial impact not only on the defendant but on the government\u2019s coffers as well\u201d). Finally, as we have stated in the past, police officers still will be deterred from violating drivers\u2019 constitutional rights despite the non-exclusion of evidence in administrative license proceedings because they are subject to other penalties and civil liabilities for engaging in such conduct. <em>See Chase v.

The underlying purpose of administrative license suspensions, the protection of the public, would be undermined. <em>See Powell, </em>614 A.2d at 1307.

[A] license suspension hearing is not a quasi-criminal proceeding, but rather a \u201creasonable regulatory measure to protect public safety.\u201d Requiring hearing examiners to apply the exclusionary rule would unnecessarily complicate and burden an administrative proceeding designed to focus on the single issue of whether a person was operating a vehicle with excessive alcohol in his blood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\"><em>Powell, </em>614 A.2d at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">In <em>Janes v. State, </em>350 Md. 284, 301, 711 A.2d 1319, 1327 (1998), we observed that proceedings like those under \u00a7 16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>205.1 are intended to be informal and summary in nature. <em>See also Riche, </em>987 S.W.2d at 334 (concluding that extending the exclusionary rule to administrative license suspension hearings \u201cwould impose significant costs to society ... [and] would unnecessarily complicate and burden an administrative process designed to remove drunken drivers from Missouri\u2019s roads and highways as quickly as possible.\u201d). Affording licensees the opportunity to invoke the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment in license suspension proceedings would not only interfere with the informal and summary nature of those proceedings but also alter their purposefully limited scope, as prescribed under \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7). <em>Cf.

We need not, however, dictate an exception to our general rule that the exclusionary rule does not apply in administrative license suspension proceedings, as we found necessary in those two cases with respect to the administrative proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>involved therein.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The current statutory and regulatory framework for \u00a7 16-205.1 adequately addresses our similar concerns in the present matter.

In 1989, the MVA alerted the Task Force on Drunk and Drugged Drivers as to the purposeful non-inclusion of constitutional protections for Maryland drivers with respect to license suspension hearings under \u00a7 16-205.1, either in its pre-amended form or under the proposed (and later adopted) amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">The current law in Maryland under TR 16-205.1 requires that the police officer who stops or detains the individual have reasonable grounds to believe the individual was driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs or both. It does not require the police officer to have probable cause to arrest. Nor does it require that the stop be constitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">}{{ S{\u00ab Ss* H* ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">It should also be noted that the issue of probable cause to arrest cannot be raised now in administrative hearing nor will it become an issue under the draft bill. This is often a confusing area for lawyers and judges because in criminal prosecutions the defense may move to suppress evidence obtained by police officers if they did not have probable cause to arrest the driver, which sometimes involves an examination of whether the officers had a constitutional right to stop the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">The draft bill is no different from present law in properly excluding from consideration at an administrative suspension hearing whether a police officer had probable cause to arrest the motorist at the time of the stop or detention. Whether there was probable cause to arrest may be a factor to be considered in the criminal trial, but it has no relevance in an Administration suspension hearing. Even if it were later determined that the officer did not have probable cause to arrest, this would not negate an administrative finding that the officer had reasonable grounds to stop or detain the licensee and request a chemical test for intoxication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">Revised Memorandum from Ann E.

The Court reasoned that \"it would derogate due process of law to presume conclusively that in such cases the police officer acted in good faith.\u201d 309 Md. at 253, 522 A.2d at 1363.

Given our determination that the exclusionary rule is <em>not </em>applicable, this COMAR provision is indeed not a \"good faith exception\u201d but rather a \"bad faith\u201d basis for exclusion of evidence of test refusal or test failure at a license suspension hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
