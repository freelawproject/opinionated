The plaintiffs-appellants, who are the Maryland Association of Health Maintenance Organizations and Deron Johnson, a member of a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), claim that the Commission has exceeded its statutory authority in two ways: (1) by implementing the Inflation Adjustment System (IAS), and (2) by allowing excess revenue to be used toward community service programs. They also contend that the Commission violated Maryland\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by not following APA rulemaking procedures when the IAS was implemented. The Commission argues that the plaintiffs-appellants have no standing to raise these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The General Assembly established the Health Services Cost Review Commission in 1971. <em>See </em>Ch. 627 of the Acts of 1971, presently codified as Maryland Code (1982, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1999 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 19-201 through 19-227 of the Health-General Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission has \u201cjurisdiction over the costs and rates of hospitals, health care institutions and related institutions located in Maryland.\u201d <em>Blue Cross v. Franklin Sq. Hosp., </em>277 Md. 93, 95, 352 A.2d 798, 800 (1976) <em>(Franklin Square I). </em>In \u00a7 19-212(5), the Commission is given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>three-fold duty of assuring each purchaser of health care facility services that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">\u201c(i) The total costs of all hospital services offered by or through a facility are reasonable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">(ii) The aggregate rates of the facility are related reasonably to the aggregate costs of the facility; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">(iii) Rates are set equitably among all purchasers of services without undue discrimination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">In order to carry out this duty, the Commission is authorized to \u201creview and approve or disapprove the reasonableness of any rate that a facility sets or requests.\u201d \u00a7 19\u2014219(b)(1). Beginning in 1974, the Commission commenced setting hospital rates. A regulated hospital is prohibited from charging any rate not approved by the Commission. \u00a7 19\u2014219(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The record in this case reflects an historical account of the Commission\u2019s setting of rates. The Commission at first conducted \u201cfull rate reviews\u201d with respect to every hospital and related institution within its jurisdiction. Under a full rate review, the Commission split the hospitals into groups based on whether they were urban or rural and then computed the actual cost per unit of service department-by-department, including \u201call overhead, routine, ancillary, and outpatient areas.\u201d <em>See also </em>COMAR 10.37.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The Commission learned, however, that completing the full rate review process for the more than 50 hospitals within its jurisdiction was burdensome. The Commission sought a new methodology that was more efficient, less administratively burdensome, and less expensive. The solution was the IAS, the purpose of which was two-fold: first, to adjust rates in a more administratively practical manner so as to reflect changes that had occurred in the hospitals since their initial full rate reviews, and second, to provide incentives for the hospitals to perform more efficiently. After the IAS was implemented, hospital rates went from 25% above the national average in 1976 to 11% below the national average in 1992. While the differential has lessened in the years since 1992, the Commission has acted accordingly, appointing the Targets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Task Force in 1995 to recalibrate the system. The Task Force, which was comprised of representatives of insurers, HMO\u2019s, hospitals, business, and labor, recommended several changes to the ratesetting system, including the addition of the System Correction Factor (SCF) to the IAS.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The SCF is a formula used to create a factor which is added to the IAS in order to reduce rates otherwise created under the IAS. The SCF was first applied in 1997; however, from 1992 until the implementation of the SCF, hospital rates in Maryland never exceeded <em>3% </em>below the national average.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Despite the implementation of the SCF, the plaintiffs Deron Johnson and the Association argue that the use of the IAS, as a ratesetting methodology, is improper. They contend that use of the IAS exceeds the Commission\u2019s statutory authority because it is based upon \u201csystem-wide inflation factors\u201d rather than \u201chospital-specific\u201d data. (Plaintiffs\u2019 reply brief at 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Deron Johnson and the Association filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a six-count complaint seeking a declaratory judgment, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, and the issuance of a writ of mandamus. Counts 1, 3, and 4 of the complaint are at issue before this Court. Those counts alleged that the Commission had violated its statutory authority by implementing the IAS, that the Commission violated the statute by allowing excess revenue to be used toward community service programs, and that the Commission violated Maryland\u2019s APA by failing to follow APA rulemaking procedures when the IAS was first implemented.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>When the complaint was filed, the only named defendant was the Commission. Shortly thereafter, the Maryland Hospital Association and the Maryland Hospital Coalition were permitted to intervene as defendants. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing and that some of the issues were not ripe for decision. The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment as to counts 1, 3, and 4, and the Commission filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on the same counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Following a hearing on the motions, the circuit court dismissed counts 2, 5, and 6 on the ground that the issues were not ripe for decision, and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on counts 1, 3, , and 4. The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, challenging the grant of summary judgment on counts 1, 3, and 4. Prior to oral argument in the Court of Special Appeals, this Court issued a writ of certiorari. <em>Maryland </em>Assoc. <em>of HMO\u2019s v. Health Services Costs, 349 </em>Md. 105, 707 A.2d 90 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Preliminarily, the Commission argues in this Court that neither Deron Johnson nor the Association had standing in the circuit court to raise the issues encompassed by counts 1, 3, and 4 of the complaint. The Commission asserts that Johnson has not and will not be affected differently from the general public by the Commission\u2019s action. <em>See Medical Waste v. Maryland Waste, </em>327 Md. 596, 611 n. 9, 612 A.2d 241, 248-249 n. 9 (1992) (in order to have standing to challenge a government agency\u2019s action, ordinarily the challenger\u2019s \u201c \u2018interest therein must be such that he is personally and specifically affected in a way different from that suffered by the public generally,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery Co., </em>247 Md. 137, 144, 230 A.2d 289, 294 (1967)). <em>See also Sugarloaf v. Dep\u2019t of Environment, </em>344 Md. 271, 288, 686 A.2d 605, 614 (1996), and cases there cited. The Commission contends that the Association lacks standing because it has no interest of its own, separate and distinct from that of its members. <em>See Medical Waste v. Maryland Waste, supra, </em>327 Md. at 612-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>613, 612 A.2d at 249 (\u201cUnder Maryland common law principles, for an organization to have standing to bring a judicial action, it must ordinarily have [an] \u2018... interest of its own\u2014 separate and distinct from that of its individual members,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Citizens Planning and Housing Ass\u2019n v. County Executive, </em>273 Md. 333, 345, 329 A.2d 681, 687-688 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Section 19-227(c) of the Health-General Article of the Code, entitled \u201cstanding,\u201d provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[a]ny person ... that contracts with or pays a facility for health care services has standing to participate in Commission hearings and shall be allowed\u201d to seek judicial review of the Commission\u2019s final decisions. In <em>Franklin Square I, </em>277 Md. at 105-106, 352 A.2d at 806, we took the position that one who pays hospital insurance premiums, with the insurer then paying the hospital, is also a \u201cpurchaser\u201d of hospital health care services within the meaning of the statute. Deron Johnson is a member of an HMO. As such, he pre-purchases hospital services, if needed, by paying a monthly premium to his HMO. This premium is based, in part, upon rates set by the Commission. In addition, Johnson is a member of the Commission\u2019s Task Force which studies and makes recommendations to the Commission with regard to its rate-setting system. Although the present case is not a judicial review action under \u00a7 19-227(c) of the statute, nevertheless the General Assembly contemplated that persons in Johnson\u2019s position would have standing to challenge the Commission\u2019s actions. Moreover, in our view, Johnson is affected by the Commission\u2019s action in a different way than a member of the general public. Consequently, Johnson has standing to maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">In light of our holding that Johnson has standing, it is unnecessary for us to determine whether the Association also has standing. \u201cWhere there exists a party having standing to bring an action or take an appeal, we shall not ordinarily inquire as to whether another party on the same side also has standing.\u201d <em>Board v. Haberlin, </em>320 Md. 399, 404, 578 A.2d 215, 217 (1990), and cases there cited. <em>See also, e.g., Sugarloaf v. Dep\u2019t of Environment, supra, </em>344 Md. at 297, 686 A.2d at 618; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number><em>People\u2019s Counsel v.

Reclamation, </em>328 Md. 229, 232 n. 1, 614 A.2d 78, 80 n. 1 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Turning to the first issue on the merits, we hold that the use of the IAS is within the statutory authority of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">As discussed in Part I, the General Assembly gave the Commission three broad statutory duties. The Commission\u2019s mandate is to assure each purchaser of hospital services that the total costs of hospital services are reasonable, that aggregate hospital rates are related reasonably to aggregate hospital costs, and that rates are set equitably among all purchasers without undue discrimination. \u00a7\u00a7 19-212(5), 19-219(a) of the Health-General Article. In order to carry out these duties, the Commission \u201cmay review costs and rates\u201d (\u00a7 19-219(a)), and \u201ctake into account objective standards of efficiency and effectiveness\u201d when \u201cdetermining the reasonableness of rates.\u201d \u00a7 19-219(b)(3). Specifically with regard to the IAS, the use of \u201calternate ratesetting methods\u201d is expressly provided for under the statute. According to \u00a7 19-219(c), \u201cthe Commission may promote and approve alternate methods of rate determination and payment that are of an experimental nature,\u201d in order \u201cto promote the most efficient and effective use of health care facility services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The IAS, at its inception, was an alternate ratesetting method of an experimental nature adopted in order to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of both the Commission and the regulated hospitals. Within just one year of setting rates, the Commission came to the conclusion that full rate reviews were neither the most efficient nor the most effective means of setting rates. The full rate review process could take up to 6 to 8 months and could cost $50,000 to $200,000, depending upon the individual circumstances. As a result, the Commission adopted the IAS to replace, at the hospitals\u2019 option, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>time-consuming, expensive, and administratively difficult full rate reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">The IAS makes annual adjustments in hospital rates using the hospital\u2019s initial full rate review as a base the first year. For each subsequent year, the IAS adjustments are applied to the previous year\u2019s rate. As a result, actual hospital costs are taken into account from the very beginning. The adjustments are based upon national inflation rates in goods and services which the Commission believes to be comparable to goods and services actually utilized by Maryland hospitals. The inflation indices are category-specific: salaries and fringe benefits; food; supplies; utilities; equipment; and other expenses. Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, the implementation of the IAS is based upon \u201chospital-specific\u201d data. The category-specific inflation indices are individually applied to each hospital\u2019s own category-specific cost structure. Again, actual costs are taken into account. Volume adjustments are also made according to respective increases and decreases in volume of services in each particular hospital. Finally, other adjustments are made to reflect the individual hospital\u2019s pricing practices, changes in uncompensated care levels, and unusual or government-mandated costs. The completed rate order is offered to the individual hospitals, which have the option of a full rate review if they do not believe that the rate order under the IAS is appropriate. Since its inception, the large majority of hospitals have utilized the IAS as opposed to the full rate review without complaint. In fact, there had been 1000 rate adjustments from 1977 until the time this action was filed, but only 35 were formal rate reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The record in this case indicates that the IAS works: it is administratively less burdensome for both the Commission and the regulated hospitals, and it has accomplished the goals set by the General Assembly. Between 1976 and 1992, Maryland hospital rates fell 36 percentage points in comparison to the national average. As mentioned in Part I, the IAS has been less successful in the years since 1992; however, the Commission has acted promptly and effectively with the addition of the SCF, and rates have always remained at or below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>3% less than the national average. Although the IAS may be imperfect, specifically in its performance since 1992, its record over the past 22 years shows that the system does work. <em>See P.G. Doctors\u2019 Hosp. v. Health Serv. Cost Rev. Comm\u2019n, </em>302 Md. 193, 204, 486 A.2d 744, 749-750 (1985) (the Commission\u2019s use of the Guaranteed Inpatient Review (GIR) System was within the authority of the Commission despite the fact that the method had imperfections). With the implementation of the SCF, the record shows that the IAS is constantly being improved. <em>See P.G. Doctors\u2019 Hosp., </em>302 Md. at 209, 486 A.2d at 752 (the Commission\u2019s use of the \u201cmarket basket\u201d methodology was within the Commission\u2019s statutory authority despite the fact that the method had been altered over time). Simply because a methodology has been refined does not mean' that it was initially defective. 302 Md. at 209, 486 A.2d at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The Commission\u2019s authority to employ the IAS is reinforced by the General Assembly\u2019s acquiescence in the 22 years that the IAS has been utilized by the Commission. Section 19-212, which delineates the Commission\u2019s duties, has been amended four times since the IAS was first implemented in 1976, and \u00a7 19-219, which permits use of \u201calternate ratesetting methods,\u201d has been amended five times since 1976. In fact, in 1985, the General Assembly, added \u00a7 19-219(b)(3) which specifically allows the Commission \u201cto take into account objective standards of efficiency and effectiveness\u201d when \u201cdetermining the reasonableness of rates.\u201d The General Assembly has had numerous opportunities to forbid the use of, or even limit the use of, the IAS, yet it has not done so.- The Legislature has not reduced the Commission\u2019s authority and, with the addition of section 19-219(b)(3), has even expanded that authority. Finally, when the statutory provisions governing the Commission\u2019s authorizing statute were amended this year, after the present case was filed, the General Assembly failed to make any relevant changes to the statutory provisions at issue in this case. Since the IAS methodology has been utilized by the Commission for 22 years without any legislative change, there is \u201ca strong presumption that the agency\u2019s interpretation [of the statute] is correct.\u201d <em>Falik v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>Prince George\u2019s Hosp., </em>322 Md. 409, 415-416, 588 A.2d 324, 327 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">In addition to the statute\u2019s plain language and the Legislature\u2019s inaction over the past 22 years, the General Assembly has made one goal clear which provides further legislative justification for the use of the IAS. The Commission has been told repeatedly by the General Assembly to maintain the so-called \u201cMedicare waiver,\u201d which is considered to be \u201cthe foundation of Maryland\u2019s hospital payment system.\u201d Ch.112 of the Acts of 1985, <em>Laws of Maryland </em>1985 at 1544. <em>See </em>\u00a7 19\u2014214(b)(5). Under Maryland\u2019s \u201call-payor\u201d system, which was implemented in 1977, all payors of hospital care in Maryland generally pay the same Commission-set rates. This enables Maryland hospitals to provide care for the uninsured. In order for this system to be carried out, the federal Medicare program has waived application of its reimbursement rates in Maryland. Consequently Commission rates also apply to Medicare reimbursement. To keep this waiver, Maryland hospitals\u2019 aggregate rate of increase in costs per hospital inpatient admissions must not exceed the rate of increase for admissions with respect to all hospitals in the nation. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395(f)(b)(3)(B). Therefore, in order to maintain the Medicare waiver, the Commission must do a national rate comparison. Under the IAS, the national inflation rate in certain goods is applied in order to adjust rates from the previous year. In light of the Commission\u2019s mandate to keep rates below the national rate of increase, use of the national inflation rate is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The Commission\u2019s authority to use the IAS is further supported by our prior opinions dealing with the Commission. In <em>Franklin Square I, </em>277 Md. 93, 352 A.2d 798, we addressed the issue of whether or not the Commission was required to approve rates proposed by a hospital whenever those rates were reasonable. We answered that question in the negative, holding that the Legislature intended to give the Commission \u201cbroad authority over the financial affairs of hospitals.\u201d 277 Md. at 111, 352 A.2d at 809. Accordingly, we concluded that the Commission was \u201cempowered to approve that rate struc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>ture which it finds to be most reasonable under the circumstances,\u201d and was not required \u201cto defer to the hospital\u2019s view of reasonableness in cases of conflict.\u201d 277 Md. at 110, 113, 352 A.2d at 809, 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">After <em>Franklin Square I </em>was remanded to the trial court and the judgment was modified, the case was again appealed to this Court in order to determine if the modified judgment was consistent with this Court\u2019s prior opinion. <em>Health Serv. Cost v. Franklin Sq., </em>280 Md. 233, 372 A.2d 1051 (1977) <em>(Franklin Square </em>II). In <em>Franklin Square II, </em>we held that the trial court\u2019s modified judgment was inconsistent with this Court\u2019s opinion in that it required the Commission to include certain cost factors in rate determination without a finding by the Commission that inclusion was appropriate in each particular case. 280 Md. at 241, 372 A.2d at 1055. This Court held that, in order for the Commission to exercise its broad authority to set reasonable rates, the Commission\u2019s setting of rates \u201cmust of necessity be determined on a case-by-case basis,\u201d and that \u201c[ajbsolute rules concerning cost factors, applicable to all hospitals under all circumstances ... are ... inappropriate.\u201d 280 Md. at 241, 372 A.2d at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Contrary to the contentions of the plaintiffs, the Commission\u2019s implementation of the IAS is not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Franklin Square II. </em>During the past 22 years in which the IAS has been in use, hospital rates in Maryland have been determined on a case-by-case basis. Although the national inflation rate is uniformly applied to all hospitals under the Commission\u2019s authority, the individual circumstances of each hospital have been taken into account annually, resulting in a wide range of hospital rate increases per year. For example, in 1996-97, the individual hospital rate changes ranged from -1.78% to + 20.41%.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The wide range of rate changes is the result of the' particularized findings of the Commission in the application of the IAS to each hospital. As discussed previously, the application of the national inflation rate varies from hospital to hospital because the rate is indexed and applied according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the individual hospital\u2019s category-specific cost structure. For example, a hospital carrying a larger burden in salaries and fringe benefits compared to equipment would have the inflation rate applied differently than a hospital with elevated equipment costs and lower salary costs. In addition, according to the Commission\u2019s staff, the IAS takes into account the particular circumstances of individual hospitals in numerous ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">\u201cUncompensated care mark-ups are provided based on a hospital\u2019s actual values of characteristics that are statistically significant in explaining variations in uncompensated care. Adjustments for providing payer discounts are provided based on a hospital\u2019s actual payer mix. Price adjustments and penalties are based on a hospital\u2019s actual pricing practices. Volume adjustments are based on a hospital\u2019s actual variance from its budgeted volumes. Unusual cost adjustments are based on a hospital\u2019s actual cost of conforming to certain government mandates or any other irregular cost proposed by a hospital that is determined by the Commission to be eligible under this category of cost. * * * The GIR or TPR [Total Patient Review] reward is based on the hospital\u2019s actual improvement in treating patients on a per case or capitation basis.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aiy\">As a result of the particularized application of the IAS, rates are determined on a case-by-case basis, and as such, the IAS is not an \u201cabsolute\u201d rule \u201capplicable to all hospitals under all circumstances.\u201d <em>Franklin Square II, </em>280 Md. at 241, 372 A.2d at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The IAS is similar to two other methodologies implemented by the Commission and reviewed by this Court in <em>P.G. Doctors\u2019 Hosp. v. Health Serv. Cost Rev. Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>302 Md. 193, 486 A.2d 744. The two methodologies at issue were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>GIR System, which \u2018\u201cestablishes an approved rate for the total costs incurred for the treatment of a given patient\u2019s diagnosis regardless of the units of service rendered,\u2019 \u201d and the market basket system which compares the costs of the hospital being reviewed to the costs of a group of hospitals (the \u201cmarket basket\u201d) considered to be comparable to that hospital. <em>P.G. Doctors\u2019 Hosp., </em>302 Md. at 203, 207, 486 A.2d at 749, 751, quoting <em>Health Serv. Cost Rev. v. Lutheran Hosp., </em>298 Md. 651, 659-660 n. 5, 472 A.2d 55, 59 n. 5 (1984). In the <em>P.G. Doctors\u2019 Hosp. </em>case, the hospital alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that use of the GIR System exceeded the Commission\u2019s statutory authority to \u201cdetermine the reasonableness of costs,\u201d because it \u201cregulate[d] the quality [and] quantity of services,\u201d and that the market basket methodology \u201cwas illegally used as an absolute rule.\u201d 302 Md. at 203, 207, 486 A.2d at 749, 751. This Court held that the GIR System and the market basket methodology were within the Commission\u2019s authority to \u201cpromote and approve alternate methods of rate determination and payment that are of an experimental nature,\u201d (\u00a7 19-219(c); 302 Md. at 204, 208-210, 486 A.2d at 750, 751-753), and that the market basket methodology did not impose an absolute rule but was \u201csimply a method of comparison.\u201d 302 Md. at 210, 486 A.2d at 753. As a result, we held that both methodologies were within the statutory authority of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The IAS, like the GIR System and the market basket methodology, is an administratively efficient \u201calternate method of rate determination.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 19-219(c). It is individualized, as actual costs are taken into account. Because of the Maryland regulatory scheme, which includes the IAS, Maryland is the only state to retain the Medicare waiver. For all these reasons, the use of the IAS is entirely within the statutory authority of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Next, the plaintiffs claim that the Commission has violated the statute by allowing excess revenue to fund community service programs. They argue that community service</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>programs are not within the definition of \u201chospital services\u201d under \u00a7 19-201 and that, therefore, the Commission does not have the authority \u201cto approve rates that fund activities other than hospital services.\u201d (Plaintiffs\u2019 brief at 23).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that the Commission is obligated to account for excess revenue and to make sure that it is applied to reduce a hospital\u2019s future rates. They contend that, when a hospital has succeeded in performing more efficiently than required by the Commission, any excess revenue thus produced is to be used to benefit purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The Commission is required to assure purchasers of health care services that the \u201ctotal costs of all hospital services ... are reasonable,\u201d and that aggregate hospital rates are \u201crelated reasonably\u201d to aggregate costs. \u00a7 19\u2014212(5)(i), (ii); \u00a7 19-219(a)(1), (2). The plaintiffs argue that, because community services are financed \u201cthrough the ratemaking process ... rates are not reasonably related to the \u2022 costs of hospital services.\u201d (Plaintiffs\u2019 brief at 24). The result, they contend, is a \u201chidden tax\u201d levied on the purchasers \u201cto support community programs unrelated to hospital services.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The foundation of the petitioners\u2019 argument is flawed. The Commission does not take into account the cost of community service programs when it is setting rates for individual hospitals. Rates are set according to either the full rate review or the IAS, and at no time under either methodology is the cost of community service programs a factor taken into consideration. Through the implementation of the IAS, the Commission is fulfilling its statutory duty of determining reasonable rates, and it is also permitting the facilities within its jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>tion \u201cto provide effective and efficient service that is in the public interest.\u201d \u00a7 19-220(d). The final rate order proposed by the Commission is intended to encourage hospitals to operate within their budget and to create their own excess revenues. This is evidenced by the Commission\u2019s two-fold purpose in the implementation of the IAS: first, to provide a less administratively difficult method of rate determination to replace the full rate reviews, and second, to provide incentives for the hospitals to perform more efficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The General Assembly has not mandated that the Commission set rates that are absolutely equal to the costs of \u201chospital services.\u201d On the contrary, the Commission is to \u201c[ajssure each purchaser of health care facility services that ... [tjhe aggregate rates of the facility are related reasonably to the aggregate costs of the facility .... \u201d \u00a7 19-212(5)(ii). <em>See also </em>\u00a7 19\u2014219(a)(2). In addition, the Commission has a responsibility to \u201cconcern itself\u2019 with the fiscal integrity of the individual hospitals. \u00a7 19-212(4). <em>See Franklin Square I, </em>277 Md. at 111, 352 A.2d at 809. The rates set by the Commission are a boundary within which the hospitals must operate. If a hospital fails to operate within the boundary, the Commission works out a \u201cspend-down\u201d agreement with the specific hospital. If the hospital succeeds in minimizing costs, however, the revenue thus produced is the property of the hospital. This excess revenue provides incentive for the individual hospitals to perform more efficiently. If the rates set by the Commission have been \u201creasonable,\u201d and if they have been \u201crelated reasonably\u201d to costs in the aggregate, the Commission has fulfilled its statutory mandate. It is not required to place further limitations upon an efficient hospital.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The General Assembly did not require that excess revenue be used to reduce hospital rates in the next year. Moreover, the Commission could reasonably conclude that using revenue for community service programs, including preventive public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>health, may, in fact, reduce future hospital costs. As the Commission points out, \u201c[cjommunity health programs provided by Maryland hospitals help reduce both present and future utilization, emergency room primary care, and case complexity.\u201d (Commission\u2019s brief at 27). Allowing hospitals to use excess revenue to serve their respective communities is consistent with the Commission\u2019s authority to consider the public interest. <em>See </em>\u00a7 19-220(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final argument is that the Commission violated Maryland\u2019s APA when it adopted the IAS by resolution, and began applying it to particular facilities, instead of promulgating it as regulation. They contend that the IAS fits within the APA definition of \u201cregulation\u201d and that, therefore, it must be adopted by formal APA rulemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Under the APA, Code (1984, 1999 RepLVol. ), \u00a7 10-101(g)(1) of the State Government Article, the term \u201cregulation\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">\u201c[A] statement or an amendment or repeal of a statement that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">(i) has general application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-10\">(ii) has future effect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-11\">(iii) is adopted by a unit to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-12\">1. detail or carry out a law that the unit administers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-13\">2. govern organization of the unit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-14\">3. govern the procedure of the unit; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-15\">4. govern practice before the unit; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-16\">(iv) is in any form, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-17\">1. a guideline;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-18\">2. a rule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-19\">3. a standard;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-20\">4. a statement of interpretation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-21\">5. a statement of policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-22\">The plaintiffs argue that the IAS, \u201cas a statement, standard and rule of Commission policy, with general application and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>future effect ... is indisputably a regulation under the APA.\u201d (Plaintiffs\u2019 brief at 27). As this Court\u2019s opinions have made clear, however, whether an agency policy technically fits the APA definition of \u201cregulation\u201d is not the test for determining if the agency is required to proceed by formal rulemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In <em>Balto. Gas &amp; Elec. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>305 Md. 145, 168, 501 A.2d 1307, 1319 (1986), which also involved a challenge to agency standards and policies used in rate regulation, Chief Judge Murphy for the Court set forth the governing principle as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">\u201cIt is a well settled principle of administrative law that \u2018the choice made between proceeding by general rule or by individual, ad hoc litigation is one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.\u2019 <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 203, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1580, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The Court in <em>Balto. Gas &amp; Elec., </em>305 Md. at 167, 501 A.2d at 1318, also pointed out that, when setting or approving rates for a particular entity, the government regulatory agency \u201cis required to articulate the standards through which it applied the applicable law to the relevant facts in reaching its decision\u201d and that \u201csuch standards will often have a degree of general application and future effect.\u201d The Court continued, \u201c[t]o conclude, however, that every time an agency explains the standards through which it applies a statute ... it is promulgating rules, ... would be patently unreasonable.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We concluded in <em>Balto. Gas &amp; Elec, </em>that the agency had not abused its discretion by failing to promulgate its ratesetting standards through formal rulemaking, stating that \u201c[t]his is not a case ... in which materially modified or new standards were applied retroactively to the detriment of a [regulated entity] that had relied upon the Commission\u2019s past pronouncements.\u201d 305 Md. at 169, 501 A.2d at 1319. <em>See also Consumer Protection v. Consumer Pub., </em>304 Md. 731, 754-755, 501 A.2d 48, 60-61 (1985), where we earlier pointed out that courts allow government regulatory agencies \u201cbroad discretion in choosing whether to develop policy by rulemaking\u201d or through \u201c \u2018case-by-case evolution of statutory standards.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>(Quoting <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., supra, </em>332 U.S. at 203, 67 S.Ct. at 1580, 91 L.Ed. at 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Another pertinent case is <em>Dept. of Health v. Chimes, </em>343 Md. 336, 681 A.2d 484 (1996). In <em>Chimes, </em>the Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene had contracted with Chimes, Inc. to provide community-based residential programs for persons with developmental disabilities. In order to control costs, the DDA instituted the Prospective Payment System (PPS). Under the PPS, payments to providers like Chimes were based on two categories of costs or \u201ccost centers.\u201d <em>Chimes, </em>343 Md. at 341, 681 A.2d at 486. In 1994, the DDA applied a \u201cgrowth cap,\u201d limiting growth in the second set of cost centers (administrative, general, capital, and transportation costs). Chimes filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the \u201cgrowth cap\u201d on the ground that the agency had violated the APA in failing to adopt the growth cap by formal rulemaking. The circuit court agreed with Chimes, declaring that the growth cap was invalid, but this Court reversed. Relying on the <em>Balto. Gas &amp; Elec, </em>case and the <em>Consumer Pub. </em>case, we held that the DDA did not violate the APA by implementing the cap without formal rulemaking. The Court noted that the growth cap \u201cdid not formulate new rules of widespread application, change existing law, or apply new standards retroactively to the detriment of an entity that had relied on the agency\u2019s past pronouncements.\u201d <em>Chimes, </em>343 Md. at 346, 681 A.2d at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The case in this Court on which the plaintiffs primarily rely is <em>CBS v. Comptroller, </em>319 Md. 687, 575 A.2d 324 (1990). <em>CBS </em>involved the method or formula used by the Comptroller of the Treasury for apportioning a part of CBS\u2019s taxable income to Maryland. Prior to 1980, CBS had computed its taxes according to a particular method which had been approved by the Comptroller. During an audit of CBS\u2019s tax return for the 1980-1981 tax year, however, the Comptroller insisted on changing the method. This Court held that the Comptroller w-as required to adopt the new method by rulemaking because it was a change in the Comptroller\u2019s generally applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>policy and was being applied retroactively to the detriment of the taxpayer. The Court distinguished our prior cases as follows <em>(CBS, </em>319 Md. at 699-700, 575 A.2d at 330):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">\u201cThe effect of the Comptroller\u2019s audit was to announce a substantially new generally applicable policy with respect to apportionment of the network advertising income of national broadcasting corporations. That change, for practical purposes, amounted to a change in a generally applicable rule. Unlike the agency action in <em>Consumer Protection, </em>it <em>was </em>an effective \u2018change [in] existing law5 and <em>did </em>\u2018formulate rules of widespread application.\u2019 304 Md. at 756, 501 A.2d at 61. Unlike the agency action in <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec, </em>it <em>was </em>\u2018a case ... in which materially modified or new standards were applied retroactively to the detriment of a company that had relied upon the [agency\u2019s] past pronouncements.\u2019 305 Md. at 169, 501 A.2d at 1319. Under these circumstances, we hold that the new policy had to be promulgated pursuant to the rulemaking procedures of the APA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The <em>CBS </em>decision furnishes no support for the plaintiffs\u2019 argument in the case at bar. The Commission\u2019s use of the IAS does not represent a change in. the policies or standards applied by the Commission. It is not being applied retroactively to the detriment of the regulated hospitals. The IAS is simply a methodology, long in use, to effectuate the law. It reflects policies set forth by the General Assembly. It is a starting point from which the Commission proceeds case-by-case in order to take into account the individualized costs and needs of the particular hospitals. As such, formal rulemaking is not required as it was in <em>CBS. </em>Instead, the Commission\u2019s use of the IAS is much more like the use of agency policies or methods in the <em>Chimes, Balto. Gas &amp; Elec. </em>and <em>Consumer Pub. </em>cases, where formal rulemaking was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Although we agree with the circuit court that this case should be resolved in favor of the defendants, we cannot affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The plaintiffs in this action sought a declaratory judgment, and the issues under counts 1, 3, and 4 were appropriate for a declaratory judgment. The circuit court, however, filed no written declaratory judgment and filed no written opinion which could be treated as a declaratory judgment. In this regard, the circuit court committed error.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">In <em>Harford Mutual v. Woodfin, </em>344 Md. 399, 414-415, 687 A.2d 652, 659 (1997), we recently explained the requirement of a written declaration in a case such as this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">\u201cThis Court has reiterated time after time that, when a declaratory judgment action is brought, and the controversy is appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment, \u2018the trial court must render a declaratory judgment.\u2019 <em>Christ v. Department, </em>335 Md. 427, 435, 644 A.2d 34, 38 (1994). \u2018[WJhere a party requests a declaratory judgment, it is error for a trial court to dispose of the case simply with oral rulings and a grant of ... judgment in favor of the prevailing party.\u2019 <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 87, 660 A.2d 447, 455 (1995), and cases there cited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">\u201cThe fact that the side which requested the declaratory judgment did not prevail in the circuit court does not render a written declaration of the parties\u2019 rights unnecessary. As this Court stated many years ago, Vhether a declaratory judgment action is decided for or against the plaintiff, there should be a declaration in the judgment or decree defining the rights of the parties under the issues made.\u2019 <em>Case v. Comptroller, </em>219 Md. 282, 288, 149 A.2d 6, 9 (1959). <em>See also, e.g., Christ v.
