We are asked to decide whether separate sentences for the same act were proper and, if they were not, to decide which offense merged for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Steven Scott McGrath was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Talbot County of battery, theft under $300 in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 342, and the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 342A. The theft conviction and unlawful taking of a motor vehicle conviction resulted from the same incident. Both convictions were based on McGrath\u2019s taking of his former girlfriend\u2019s automobile on the evening of December 23, 1995, after she had told McGrath that he could never use her car again.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">McGrath was sentenced to imprisonment for ten years for battery, with five of the ten years suspended in favor of probation for five years. He was sentenced to a consecutive term of five years imprisonment for the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 342A. Finally, he was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for the theft conviction under Art. 27, \u00a7 342, with the sentence to be consecutive to the battery sentence but concurrent with the sentence under \u00a7 342A.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">Upon McGrath\u2019s appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, he argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that he should not have been separately sentenced for the same act under both \u00a7 342 and \u00a7 342A, and that the sentence under \u00a7 342A should merge into the sentence under \u00a7 342. The Court of Special Appeals, in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>unreported opinion, affirmed the judgments of the circuit court. The intermediate appellate court held that the sentences for violations of \u00a7\u00a7 342 and 342A, even though based upon the same act, should not merge under either the required evidence test or the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Thereafter, we granted McGrath\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, <em>McGrath v. State, </em>350 Md. 280, 711 A.2d 871 (1998), which presented a single issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">\u201cWhether a person may be separately punished for convictions of theft of a motor vehicle under ... Art. 27, \u00a7 342A and theft under ... Art. 27, \u00a7 342 where both convictions and sentences are based on the single act of taking a car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Under Maryland common law principles, \u201cthe normal standard for determining whether one offense merges into another is what is usually called the \u2018required evidence test.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miles v. State, </em>349 Md. 215, 219, 707 A.2d 841, 843 (1998). <em>See, e.g., State v. Lancaster, </em>332 Md. 385, 391, 631 A.2d 453, 456 (1993); <em>Eldridge v.

State, </em>321 Md. 612, 616, 583 A.2d 1056, 1058 (1991). We have explained the required evidence test as follows <em>(State v. Lancaster, supra, </em>332 Md. at 391-392, 631 A.2d at 456-457):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">\u201cThe required evidence test \u2018 \u201cfocuses upon the elements of each offense; if all of the elements of one offense are included in the other offense, so that only the latter offense contains a distinct element or distinct elements, the former merges into the latter.\u201d \u2019 <em>Snowden v. State, supra, </em>321 Md. at 617, 583 A.2d at 1059, quoting <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>307 Md. 501, 517, 515 A.2d 465, 473 (1986). Stated another way, the \u2018 \u201crequired evidence is that which is minimally necessary to secure a conviction for each ... offense. If each offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, or in other words, if each offense contains an element which the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>does not,\u201d \u2019 there is no merger under the required evidence test even though both offenses are based upon the same act or acts. \u2018 \u201cBut, where only one offense requires proof of an additional fact, so that all elements of one offense are present in the other,\u201d \u2019 and where both \u2018offenses are based on the same act or acts, ... merger follows.... \u2019 <em>Williams v. State, supra, </em>323 Md. at 317-318, 593 A.2d at 673, quoting in part <em>Thomas v.

State, supra, </em>321 Md. at 618, 583 A.2d at 1059.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">And later in <em>Lancaster </em>we stated (332 Md. at 409-410, 631 A.2d at 466):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">\u201cUnder this Court\u2019s decisions, the required evidence test is not simply another rule of statutory construction. Instead, it is a long-standing rule of law to determine whether one offense is included within another when both are based on the same act or acts. <em>See Hagans v. State, </em>316 Md. 429, 445-453, 559 A.2d 792, 799-804 (1989).... [T]he test if fully applicable to determine merger issues involving common law crimes, including common law crimes for which there is no statutorily prescribed penalty. <em>See, e.g., In re Montrail, supra, </em>325 Md. at 532, 601 A.2d at 1104 (\u2018The required evidence test \u201capplies to both common law and statutory offenses\u201d \u2019)____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-9\"><em>See also Miles v. State, supra, </em>349 Md. at 219, 707 A.2d at 843-844; <em>Spitzinger v.

State, supra, </em>349 Md. at 221, 707 A.2d at 844, and cases there cited. The rule of lenity, applicable to statutory offenses only, provides that where there is no indication that the legislature intended multiple punishments for the same act, a court will not impose multiple punishments but will, for sentencing purposes, merge one offense into the other. <em>Miles, </em>349 Md. at 227, 707 A.2d at 847; <em>Williams v. State, supra, </em>323 Md. at 321-322, 593 A.2d at 675; <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 582 A.2d 525 (1990); <em>White v. State, </em>318 Md. 740, 569 A.2d at 1271 (1990). When \u201cthere is merger under the rule of lenity, the offense carrying the lesser maximum penalty ordinarily merges into the offense carrying the greater maximum penalty.\u201d <em>Miles, </em>349 Md. at 229, 707 A.2d at 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The Maryland \u201cTheft\u201d statute, Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 340-342, and 343-344, which was first enacted by Ch. 849 of the Acts of 1978, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">\u201c\u00a7 342.

He further contends that the offense under \u00a7 342A is a lesser-included offense of theft under \u00a7 342, and that, for purposes of sentencing, the \u00a7 342A offense merges into the \u00a7 342 offense under the required evidence test. Acceptance of McGrath\u2019s argument would require that his five year sentence under \u00a7 342A be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The State argues that the two offenses do not merge under the required evidence test \u201cbecause each offense contains an element which the other does not.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s brief at 3). The State in its brief suggested, and at oral argument before this Court the State agreed, that the rule of lenity was applicable and that a defendant should not be separately sentenced under both statutes for the same act of taking a motor vehicle. Nevertheless, according to the State, the rule of lenity would dictate that the \u00a7 342 offense merge into the \u00a7 342A offense. Consequently, under the State\u2019s position, the eighteen month sentence for theft should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">We agree with the State and the Court of Special Appeals that there is no merger of the two offenses based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the required evidence test. Each offense has elements not present in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The theft offense, as charged in this case, requires proof that the defendant had deprived the owner of the property. \u201cDeprive\u201d is defined as a permanent withholding of the property, or a withholding for such a period as to appropriate a portion of its value, or a withholding until a reward or, other compensation has been paid. The \u00a7 342A offense, however, does not contain such an element. Any knowing and willful taking of the property without the owner\u2019s consent is sufficient under \u00a7 342A.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Section 342A, on the other hand, has elements not found in the type of theft offense charged in this case. Section 342A relates only to the unlawful taking of motor vehicles, whereas the theft offense covers property generally. The property subject to the theft offense is \u201canything of value.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 340(i). In addition, the \u00a7 342A offense, by its definition of \u201cowner,\u201d requires that the victim have \u201ca lawful interest in or [be] in lawful possession of\u2019 the motor vehicle. The theft offense under \u00a7\u00a7 340-342, however, has no such requirement. In light of the definition of \u201cowner\u201d in \u00a7 340(h), the victim need not have a lawful interest in or have lawful possession of the property for the defendant to be guilty of the crime of theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">We also agree with the State that there is no indication in the statutory language or the legislative history that the General Assembly intended that separate sentences be imposed when the single act of taking a motor vehicle constituted a violation of both \u00a7 342 and \u00a7 342A. Consequently, under our cases, the rule of lenity is fully applicable to this situation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>As previously mentioned, when there is a merger of offenses under the rule of lenity, the offense carrying the smaller maximum penalty ordinarily merges into the offense carrying the greater maximum penalty. <em>Miles v. State, supra, </em>349 Md. at 221, 229, 707 A.2d at 844, 848. Application of this principle is normally a simple matter. The penalty provision of the theft statute, however, creates a degree of complication. The maximum term of imprisonment under the theft statute, in \u00a7 342(f), is fifteen years, whereas the maximum term of imprisonment under \u00a7 342A(d) is five years. Viewed in this manner, the unlawful taking offense under \u00a7 342A would merge into the theft offense under \u00a7 342 for purposes of sentencing. Nevertheless, the penalty provision of the theft statute in \u00a7 342(f) further provides that, where the value of the stolen property was less than $300, the maximum term of imprisonment is eighteen months. Moreover, the jury in the present case found that the value of the automobile was less than $300. Thus, the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon McGrath for theft was eighteen months. For this reason, the State argues that the \u00a7 342 offense should be merged into the \u00a7 342A offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">We need not decide how merger based on the rule of lenity should be applied in a situation similar to that in the present case, but where there is no clear indication of legislative intent. In this case, we do have persuasive evidence of the General Assembly\u2019s purpose. By Ch. 348 of the Acts of 1999, which was signed into law by the Governor on May 13, 1999, the General Assembly added new subsection (e) to Art. 27, \u00a7 342A. The new subsection states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">\n<em>\u201c(e)(1) THIS SECTION DOES NOT PRECLUDE PROSECUTION FOR THEFT OF A MOTOR VEHICLE UNDER \u00a7 342 OF THIS SUBHEADING.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\n<em>(2) IF A PERSON IS CONVICTED UNDER \u00a7 34.2 OF THIS SUBHEADING AND THIS SECTION FOR THE SAME ACT OR TRANSACTION, THE CONVICTION UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL MERGE FOR SENTENCING PURPOSES INTO THE CONVICTION UNDER \u00a7 342 OF THIS SUBHEADING.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Although the new provision may not directly control the present case,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it is significant that the General Assembly, in the Title to Ch. 348 of the Acts of 1999, stated that it was \u201c[f|or the purpose of clarifying\u201d the relationship between \u00a7 342 and \u00a7 342A. The Title thus indicates that clarification, and not a change in the law, was intended. We see no reason why, in applying the rule of lenity, McGrath should not be given the benefit of the General Assembly\u2019s clarified legislative intent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Consequently, we shall order that the sentence under \u00a7 342A be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.

The definition section of the theft statute, Art. 27, \u00a7 340, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">\" \u00a7 340.

In fact, the legislative history affirmatively suggests that separate sentences under both statutes were not contemplated. Section 342A was first enacted by Ch. 268 of the Acts of 1995. The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee\u2019s bill analysis of House Bill 497, which became Ch. 268, indicates the Committee's belief that, with regard to the taking of motor vehicles, it was often difficult for the State to prove that the defendant \"intended to permanently deprive the owner of the vehicle,\u201d which was a requirement for a theft conviction under \u00a7 342. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>purpose of Ch. 268, according to the Committee\u2019s bill analysis, was to remove the requirement of permanent deprivation with regard to motor vehicles. Ch. 268, therefore, seems to have been primarily aimed at situations where the State could not prove theft under \u00a7 342. It was not enacted to enhance the punishment for theft of a motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 342.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-8\">. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol), Art. 1, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b92-9\">. In addition, it was logical for the General Assembly to view \u00a7 342A as a lesser offense of \u00a7 342 in all instances when a motor vehicle was unlawfully taken. The General Assembly probably was of the view that it would be rare, if ever, for a motor vehicle to be valued at less than $300. Under Code (1977, 1999 Repl.Vol), \u00a7 13-809(a)(2) of the Transportation Article, the minimum value of any motor vehicle is deemed to be $500. At an earlier period, it was deemed to be $300. <em>See </em>Code (1977, 1984 Repl.Vol), \u00a7 13-809(a)(2) of the Transportation Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
