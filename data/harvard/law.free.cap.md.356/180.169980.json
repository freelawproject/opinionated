We hold that the employees are not entitled to the unemployment benefits and shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Petitioner is a retail grocer which owns and operates two distribution and warehouse centers in Jessup, Maryland and Landover, Maryland. It also owns and operates a beverage plant and ice cream plant in Jessup, a dairy in Landover, and a bakery in Silver Spring, Maryland. Respondent Teamsters Local 639 consists of the truckers who deliver products from those two distribution and warehouse centers to all of petitioner\u2019s 174 stores in the Mid-Atlantic region.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">The strike at issue in this case began when the collective bargaining agreement between petitioner and respondent Teamsters Local 639 expired and the local went on strike. The remaining union locals appearing as respondents in this case assisted in the strike either by actively refusing to cross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>picket lines or engaging in \u201csympathy strikes.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of the strike, petitioner\u2019s warehouse and distribution centers ceased operations as did the various manufacturing plants. Petitioner responded to the closings by having other wholesalers and suppliers ship products directly to its retail stores. The record also reflects that they overstocked products in anticipation of the strike. Petitioner estimates that it lost approximately four million dollars in profits from the closing of the plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The 1,346 employees participating or assisting in the strike applied for unemployment benefits for the period during which they were out of work. After a hearing, the Board of Appeals of the Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation (Board), also a respondent to this appeal, ruled that the employees were entitled to the benefits. On judicial review, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County affirmed. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court. <em>See generally Giant v. Department of Labor, Licensing &amp; Reg., </em>124 Md.App. 357, 722 A.2d 398 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Our review of an agency\u2019s decision \u201centails only an appraisal and evaluation of the agency\u2019s fact-finding and not an independent decision on the evidence.\u201d <em>Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc. v. Loveman, </em>349 Md. 560, 569, 709 A.2d 749, 753 (1998); <em>see Anderson v. Department of Pub. Safety &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>Correctional Servs., </em>330 Md. 187, 212, 623 A.2d 198, 210 (1993). When the agency is acting in a fact-finding or quasi-judicial capacity, we review its decision to determine \u201cwhether the contested decision was rendered in an illegal, arbitrary, capricious, oppressive or fraudulent manner.\u201d <em>Department of Natural Resources v. Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. 211, 224, 334 A.2d 514, 523 (1975); <em>see Goodwich v. Nolan, </em>343 Md. 180, 148, 680 A.2d 1040, 1049 (1996); <em>Weiner v. Maryland Ins. Admin., </em>337 Md. 181, 190, 652 A.2d 125, 129 (1995). When dealing with factual issues, \u201c[w]e are also obligated to \u2018review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency,\u2019 since their decisions are <em>prima facie </em>correct and cany with them the presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Catonsville Nursing Home, </em>349 Md. at 569, 709 A.2d at 753 (quoting <em>Anderson, </em>330 Md. at 213, 623 A.2d at 210; <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 513, 390 A.2d 1119, 1124 (1978)). We have noted that our review of an administrative agency\u2019s fact-finding decisions differs markedly from our review of the decision of a trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">In the latter context the appellate court will search the record for evidence to support the judgment and will sustain the judgment for a reason plainly appearing on the record whether or not the reason was expressly relied upon by the trial court. However, in judicial review of agency action the court may not uphold the agency order unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><em>United Steelworkers v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>298 Md. 665, 679, 472 A.2d 62, 69 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">We have stated that, \u201c[a] court\u2019s role is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994), <em>quoted in Bucktail, LLC v.

Co., </em>316 Md. 491, 497, 560 A.2d 32, 34-35 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the factual determinations of the Board are generally not in contest. Thus, our review of the administrative agency\u2019s decision below is strictly concerned with whether their decision was based on proper legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The issue before the Court, in general terms, is whether respondents were disqualified from receiving the requested unemployment benefits under Maryland Code (1991), section 8-1004 of the Labor and Employment Article. Section 8-1004 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">(a) <em>Grounds for </em>disqualification.\u2014Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">(1) an individual who otherwise is eligible to receive benefits is disqualified from receiving benefits for each week for which the Secretary finds that <em>unemployment results from a stoppage of work, other than a lockout, that exists because of a labor dispute at the premises where the individual last was employed; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">(2) if separate branches of work that usually are conducted as separate businesses in separate premises are conducted in separate departments on the same premises, each department shall be considered a separate premises for the purposes of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">(b) Exception.\u2014A disqualification under this section does not apply to an individual who satisfies the Secretary that the individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">(1) is not participating in, financing, or directly interested in the labor dispute that caused the stoppage of work; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">(2) does not belong to a class or grade of workers that, immediately before the stoppage, had any members:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-14\">(i) employed at the premises; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>(ii) participating in, financing, or directly interested in the labor dispute. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">More specifically, the parties debate whether the \u201cstoppage of work\u201d required by subsection (a)(1) must be \u201cat the premises where the individual last was employed.\u201d The statute clearly requires there to be a \u201clabor dispute\u201d at the premises where the employees worked and there is no question in this case that there was a labor dispute at the various sites where petitioner\u2019s employees struck.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respondents, who interpret section 8-1004(a)(l) as not limiting the stoppage of work to each individual \u201cpremises\u201d of petitioner\u2019s business, argue that there was no work stoppage because petitioner\u2019s business as a whole was not \u201csubstantially curtailed.\u201d Petitioner argues that subsection (a)(1) does apply the \u201cstoppage of work\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>language to each individual premises and thus, because its business was substantially curtailed at each of the distribution and warehouse centers and the manufacturing plants, those facilities experienced a work stoppage. The parties also debate the exact meaning of \u201cpremises\u201d in their respective attempts to broaden Or limit the geographic scope of the statute. Petitioner argues that premises refers to each individual unit of employment while respondents argue that it refers to petitioner\u2019s facilities as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">A. Rules of Statutory Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">This Court has stated repeatedly that \u201c[t]he cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995). Legislative intent must be sought in the first instance in the actual language of the statute. <em>Board of License Comm\u2019rs v. Toye, </em>354 Md. 116, 122, 729 A.2d 407, 410 (1999); <em>Anne Arundel County v. City of Annapolis, </em>352 Md. 117, 123, 721 A.2d 217, 220 (1998); <em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 444-45, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997); <em>Coburn v. Coburn, </em>342 Md. 244, 256, 674 A.2d 951, 957 (1996); <em>Romm v. Flax, </em>340 Md. 690, 693, 668 A.2d 1, 2 (1995); <em>Oaks, </em>339 Md. at 35, 660 A.2d at 429; <em>Mauzy v. Hornbeck, </em>285 Md. 84, 92, 400 A.2d 1091, 1096 (1979); <em>Board of Supervisors v. Weiss, </em>217 Md. 133, 136, 141 A.2d 734, 736 (1958). Furthermore, when the statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity, and expresses a definite and simple meaning, courts do not normally look beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent. <em>Toye, </em>354 Md. at 122, 729 A.2d at 410; <em>Anne Arundel County, </em>352 Md. at 123, 721 A.2d at 220; <em>Marriott Employees, </em>346 Md. at 445, 697 A.2d at 458; <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 515, 525 A.2d 628, 633 (1987); <em>Hunt v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 403, 414, 237 A.2d 35, 41 (1968); <em>see also Brodsky v. Brodsky, </em>319 Md. 92, 98, 570 A.2d 1235, 1237 (1990) (\u201cIn construing a statute, we look first to its language, ... we assume that the words of the statute are intended to have their natural, ordinary and gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>ally understood meaning in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">This Court in <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73-75, 517 A.2d 730, 731-32 (1986) opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">In construing the meaning of a word in a statute, the cardinal rule is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intention. The primary source of legislative intent is, of course, the language of the statute itself.... Of course, where statutory provisions are clear and unambiguous, no construction or clarification is needed or permitted, it being the rule that a plainly worded statute must be construed without forced or subtle interpretations designed to extend or limit the scope of its operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">That a term may be free from ambiguity when used in one context but of doubtful application in another context is well settled....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">... We ... recognize the rule that where a statute is plainly susceptible of more than one meaning and thus contains an ambiguity, courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of the enactment.... [T]he court ... may consider the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Finally, in <em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387, 614 A.2d 590, 594 (1992), this Court opined, in reference to construing a statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">While the language of the statute is the primary source for determining legislative intention, the plain meaning rule of construction is not absolute; rather, the statute must be construed reasonably with reference to the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body. The Court will look at the larger context, including the legislative purpose, within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>which statutory language appears. Construction of a statute which is unreasonable, illogical, unjust, or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">B. Legislative History of Section 8-1004</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Turning to the legislative history, section 8-1004 was transferred from Maryland Code (1957, 1985 Repl.Vol.), Article 95A, section 6(e), in 1991 when the current Labor and Employment Article was adopted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to the transfer, section 6 read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">An individual shall be disqualified for benefits:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">(e) <em>Stoppage of work because of labor </em>disputes.\u2014For any week with respect to which the Executive Director finds that his unemployment is due to a stoppage of work, other than a lockout, which exists because of a labor dispute at <em>the factory, establishment, or other premises </em>at which he is or was last employed, provided that this subsection shall not apply if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Executive Director that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">(1) He is not participating in or financing or directly interested in the labor dispute which caused the stoppage of work; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">(2) He does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement of the stoppage, there were members employed at the premises at which the stoppage occurs, any of whom are participating in or financing or directly interested in the dispute; provided, that if in any case separate branches of work which are commonly conducted as separate businesses in separate premises are conducted in separate departments of the same premises, each such department shall, for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>poses of this subsection, be deemed to be a separate factory, establishment, or other premises. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The Legislature, in the transfer between Code volumes, replaced the words \u201cfactory, establishment, or other premises\u201d with \u201cpremises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The legislative history provides no express statement as to why that change was made. A report to the Legislature, in describing the transfer of former section 6 into subtitle 10 of the Labor &amp; Employment Article, does not discuss former section 6(e) or current section 8-1004. <em>See </em>Department of Legislative Reference, Report on H.B. 1, at 32 (Jan. 14, 1991). The report does indicate, however, that \u201cthe primary purposes of the [revision] are modernization and clarification, not policy-making. ... Every effort is made to ensure that a proposed revision conforms as nearly as possible to the intent of the General Assembly, and all these revisions are highlighted in the appropriate revisor\u2019s notes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1. The revisor\u2019s note accompanying section 8-1004 notes that \u201c[t]his section is new language derived <em>without substantive change </em>from former Art. 95A, \u00a7 6(e).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) In addition, this Court \u201cconsistently has presumed that general recodifications of statutes, such as ... the Labor &amp; Employment Article, are for the purpose of clarity only and not [for] substantive change, unless the language of the recodified statute unmistakably indicates the intention of the Legislature to modify the law.\u201d <em>DeBusk v. Johns Hopkins Hosp., </em>342 Md. 432, 444, 677 A.2d 73, 79 (1996); <em>see also Duffy v. Conaway, </em>295 Md. 242, 257-58, 455 A.2d 955, 962-63 (1983); <em>In Re: Special Investigation No. 236, </em>295 Md. 573, 576-77, 458 A.2d 75, 76 (1983); <em>Bureau of Mines v. George\u2019s Creek Coal &amp; Land Co., </em>272 Md. 143, 155, 321 A.2d 748, 754-55 (1974); <em>Welch v. Humphrey, </em>200 Md. 410, 417, 90 A.2d 686, 689 (1952). Thus, we interpret the term</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>\u201cpremises\u201d in current section 8-1004 as the equivalent of its earlier limitation in section 6(e) to \u201cthe factory, establishment, or other premises\u201d where the employees worked, i.e., the individual site of their employment. This interpretation of \u201cpremises\u201d complies with the plain and simple definition given to the word. <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>1136 (unabr. ed.1983), for instance, defines premises as: \u201ca. a tract of land including its buildings, b. a building together with its grounds or other appurtenances, c. the property forming the subject of a conveyance or bequest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In addition to our interpretation of Maryland legislative history, this Court has previously analyzed the English statute pertaining to labor dispute unemployment disqualifications to evaluate our own version of the same provision. Maryland\u2019s unemployment insurance statutes were \u201cpassed by the General Assembly in 1936 to alleviate the consequences of widespread involuntary unemployment caused by the depression.\u201d <em>Employment Security Admin. v. Browning-Ferris, Inc., </em>292 Md. 515, 517, 438 A.2d 1356, 1358 (1982). Those provisions were patterned after portions of a federal Social Security Draft Bill pertaining to unemployment compensation. Most of that statute, including the labor dispute disqualification, was derived from the English unemployment statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 521-22, 438 A.2d at 1360. This Court noted in <em>Saunders v. Maryland Unemployment Compensation Bd., </em>188 Md. 677, 687-88, 53 A.2d 579, 583-84 (1947), that the history of the English version of the disqualification provision and its subsequent interpretation were relevant to the interpretation of Maryland\u2019s similar statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">The exception in the English statutes (1920, 10 and 11, Geo. V, Chap. 30, 8-(1), 1935, 25 Geo. V, Chap. 8, 26-(1)) is practically identical with our statute. It reads \u201cAn insured contributor who has lost employment by reason of a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute at <em>the factory, workshop, or other premises </em>at which he was employed shall be disqualified for receiving unemployment benefit so long as the stoppage of work continues, * * * \u201d A practically similar clause is in the 1946 Act. 9 and 10 Geo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>VI, Chap. 67, 13\u2014(1).... [I]t has been held that the contemporaneous construction of the copied statute is intended to be the construction of the copying act. <em>Lavender v. Rosenheim, </em>110 Md. 150, at page 156, 72 A. 669, [671 (1909) ]; <em>Heyn v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>174 Md. 639, at page 658, 197 A. 292, 1 A.2d 83, [87 (1938) ]. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzM\">Thus, section 8-1004 as derived from the English Act originally limited the scope of the disqualification to the \u201cfactory, workshop or other premises\u201d involved. <em>See </em>Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935, 25 &amp; 26 Geo. 5, ch. 8, \u00a7 26(1) (Eng.). A subsequent revision of the disqualification provision substituted \u201cplace of employment\u201d for \u201cfactory, workshop or other premises.\u201d National Insurance Act, 1965, ch. 51, \u00a7 22(1) (Eng.). The National Insurance Act defined place of employment in a separate subsection: \u201cthe expression \u2018place of employment\u2019 in relation to any person, means the factory, workshop, farm or other premises or place at which he was employed.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 22(6)(a). That definition remained virtually unaltered until 1995. <em>See </em>Social Security Contributions <em>&amp; </em>Benefits Act, 1992, ch. 4, \u00a7 27(3)(a) (Eng.); Social Security Act, 1975, ch. 14, \u00a7 19(2)(a) (Eng.). The English disqualification provision currently uses the term \u201cplace of work,\u201d which \u201cin relation to any person, means the premises or place at which he was employed.\u201d Jobseekers Act, 1995, \u00a7 14(4) (Eng.).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The English disqualification statute, since its inception, has maintained a definition of place of employment or work limited to each individual site of employment, not the employer\u2019s entire operations. We interpret the Maryland statute similarly.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"> Finally, we note that under subsection (a)(2) of section 8-1004, \u201cif separate branches of work that usually are conducted as separate businesses in separate premises are conducted in separate departments on the same premises, <em>each department shall be considered a separate premises </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>.... \u201d (Emphasis added). When we examine the plain meaning of the words of a statute, \u201c[o]ur examination of such words is guided by the principle that we should read \u2018pertinent parts of the legislative language together, giving effect to all of those parts if we can, and rendering no part of the law surplusage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holman v. Kelly Catering, Inc., </em>334 Md. 480, 485, 639 A.2d 701, 704 (1994) (quoting <em>Sinai Hosp. v. Department of Employment, </em>309 Md. 28, 40, 522 A.2d 382, 388 (1987)); <em>see also Rose v. Fox Pool Corp., </em>335 Md. 351, 359, 643 A.2d 906, 909-10 (1994) (\u201c[A] statute must be construed as a whole so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d) (citing <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753, 758 (1993); <em>Maryland Port Admin. v. Brawner Contracting Co., </em>303 Md. 44, 60, 492 A.2d 281, 289 (1985)). Viewing section 8-1004 as a whole, to interpret the word \u201cpremises\u201d in subsection (a)(1) as including all sites of an entire multi-site business would render subsection (a)(2) meaningless. Because subsection (a)(2) compares separate branches of work conducted within one premises to separate branches of work typically conducted in different premises, i.e., different work sites, and requires that the separate branches or departments within one facility be treated as individual premises, the Legislature clearly intended for \u201cpremises\u201d generally to refer to each individual work site of an employer. We infer from subsection (a)(2) that the Legislature\u2019s intent was to apply section 8-1004 to the smallest unit of employment discernable under the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Turning to the issue of whether the stoppage of work need only occur at an individual premises under the disqualification provision, we note that former section 6(e)(2) exempted from disqualification those who did not \u201cbelong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement of the stoppage, <em>there were members employed at the premises at which the stoppage occurs, </em>any of whom are participating in or financing or directly interested in the dispute.... \u201d (Emphasis added.) Although this subsection is not directly applicable to the case at bar, we note that it applied only to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>employed \u201cat the premises at which the stoppage occurred],\u201d prior to its 1991 recodification in section 8\u20141004(b)(2). Recalling that section 8\u20141004(b)(2) was \u201cderived without substantive change\u201d from section 6(e)(2), the former language from that exception reflects inferentially that the General Assembly viewed a stoppage of work as occurring in an individual premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Though this Court has never squarely addressed this issue, prior comments by this Court reflect that our original interpretation of the disqualification provision was that a stoppage of work need only occur within an individual premises to trigger a disqualification. As noted, <em>supra, </em>we utilized the subsequent interpretations of the English Unemployment Act of 1935 in <em>Saunders </em>to review the similar Maryland provision. Regarding the stoppage of work requirement, we noted the interpretation of that phrase by the English Umpires, administrative judges within the British Ministry of Labour:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">The English Umpires who administer the English statutes, have handed down a number of administrative decisions construing this clause. These decisions are final because there is no provision for judicial review____ The English Umpires hold that stoppage of work refers primarily not to the cessation of an employee\u2019s labor, <em>but to a stoppage of work carried on at the premises, factory or workshop in consequence of the dispute. </em>(Umpire\u2019s Decisions, 609, 3809, 4850-1926.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 688, 53 A.2d at 584 (emphasis added). <em>Saunders </em>also made similar interpretations of the work stoppage requirement in reviewing decisions by courts in two sister states. In interpreting an Oklahoma case, <em>Board of Review v. Mid-Continent Petroleum Corp., </em>193 Okla. 36, 141 P.2d 69 (1943), we noted \u201cthe decision of the court ... only goes so far as to say that a \u2018stoppage of work\u2019 <em>does not mean that a whole plant has to be shut down.\u201d Saunders, </em>188 Md. at 685, 53 A.2d at 582 (emphasis added). Later, in reviewing <em>Magner v. Kinney, </em>141 Neb. 122, 2 N.W.2d 689 (1942), we noted that \u201c[t]he court referred to the fact that the unemployment compensation law was a substantial reenactment of the English [Unemployment] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Insurance Act and that the construction by the English officials administering that act ... is that \u2018stoppage of work\u2019 is a substantial curtailment of work <em>in an </em>establishment.... \u201d <em>Saunders, </em>188 Md. at 685-86, 53 A.2d at 583 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In <em>Lloyd E. Mitchell, Inc. v. Maryland Employment Security Board, </em>209 Md. 237, 121 A.2d 198 (1956), we reviewed a case in which the claimants, though not striking, had not crossed the picket lines. We noted that before a special examiner, \u201cit was stipulated by all the parties that beginning on June 2, 1952, there was a complete stoppage of work at the Sparrows Point plant of the Bethlehem Steel Company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241, 121 A.2d at 200. For this reason, we had concluded that \u201c[i]t is undisputed that there was a stoppage of work <em>at their place of employment </em>due to a labor dispute between other parties, so that the proviso comes into play and the claimants must show affirmatively that they did not participate in the labor dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240, 121 A.2d at 199-200 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In <em>MEMCO v. Maryland Employment Security Administration, </em>280 Md. 536, 375 A.2d 1086 (1977), we were concerned with whether employees involved in a multi-employer labor dispute were disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits. After labor contract negotiations failed, butchers at a number of grocery stores in the Washington area decided to strike against one of the employers (which, coincidentally, was petitioner) to put pressure on the other employers. The employers subsequently \u201clocked out\u201d all of the butchers. We held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the \u201cfactory, establishment, or other premises\u201d where the labor dispute had occurred was each \u201cindividual place of employment, not [the] multi-employer association.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545, 375 A.2d at 1092. We also held that \u201cthe <em>stoppages of </em>work were directly caused by the employers\u2019 <em>lockouts.\u201d Id. </em>at 549, 375 A.2d at 1094 (emphasis added). By using the plural \u201cstoppages\u201d and \u201clockouts,\u201d we infer that <em>MEMCO </em>viewed a work stoppage as occurring at each individual grocery store, i.e., each premises, once the \u201clockouts\u201d at each site began.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Finally, in <em>Browning-Ferris, </em>292 Md. at 522, 438 A.2d at 1360, we quoted Milton I. Shadur, <em>Unemployment Benefits and the Labor Dispute Disqualification, </em>17 U. Chi. L.Rev. 294, 308 (1950), which notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">Like most other aspects of the Draft Bill, the stoppage of work requirement had its origin in the British Unemployment Insurance Acts. When this country\u2019s fifty-one statutes were adopted, the phrase had long since acquired a settled construction from the British Umpires as referring \u201cnot to the cessation of the workman\u2019s labour, <em>but to a stoppage of the work carried on in the factory, workshop or other premises at which the workman is </em>employed.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Since its passage, our understanding of the operation of the labor disqualification provision has been that, in order for claimants to be disqualified from receiving benefits, there must be both a labor dispute and a work stoppage at the individual place, site, factory, workshop, establishment, or premises where they worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Respondents cite numerous cases in which courts of other states have applied a standard of \u201csubstantial curtailment\u201d of the employer\u2019s entire operations to determine whether there has been a work stoppage. We noted in <em>Browning-Ferris </em>that</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">[m]ost jurisdictions hold that \u201cstoppage of work\u201d means a substantial curtailment of the employer\u2019s operations.... However, the difficulty of applying a fixed percentage rule to define \u201csubstantial\u201d has led courts to consider various other factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">\u201cSince the mid-fifties, there has been a new emphasis placed upon the term \u2018operations.\u2019 As <em>production increasingly represents less than totality of the employing unit\u2019s performance, decreases in business revenue, services rendered, marketing, research, and maintenance, transportation, and construction activities have come to the fore as indicia of substantialness.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>292 Md. at 528-30, 438 A.2d at 1364-65 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted) (quoting Willard A. Lewis, <em>The \u201cStoppage of Work\u201d Concept in Labor Dispute Disqualification Jurisprudence, </em>45 J. Urb. L. 319, 332 (1967)). Thus, the original intent of the \u201csubstantial curtailment\u201d test may have been not to increase the geographic scope of the disqualification provision, as respondents allege, but to expand the criteria from industrial production to other business-related factors in determining whether a work stoppage had occurred at the individual work site.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Cumberland &amp; Allegheny Gas Co. v. Hatcher, </em>147 W.Va. 630, 638, 130 S.E.2d 115, 120 (1963) (\u201c \u2018[Stoppage of work\u2019 as used in statutes of this nature is held to refer to the employer\u2019s <em>plant </em>operations ... and to mean a substantial curtailment of work or operations <em>in the employing </em>establishment----\u201d (emphasis added)), <em>overruled on other grounds by Lee-Norse Co. v. Rutledge, </em>170 W.Va. 162, 291 S.E.2d 477 (1982). In other words, whether operations have been substantially curtailed at a particular job site depends on the type of business the employer conducts there and on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. <em>See Twenty-Eight (28) Members of Oil, Chem., &amp; Atomic Workers Union v. Employment Security Div., </em>659 P.2d 583, 591, 592 (Alaska 1983); <em>Continental Oil Co. v. Board of Labor Appeals, </em>178 Mont. 143, 155, 156, 582 P.2d 1236, 1243, 1244 (1978). In this case, the main purpose of each work site was to either produce grocery products or store and distribute them. Not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>only were these activities substantially curtailed, they completely ceased at each location. Thus, a stoppage of work occurred at each of these premises. <em>Cf. Continental Oil Co., </em>178 Mont. at 156, 582 P.2d at 1244 (\u201c[I]n determining whether there is a stoppage of work at a plant ... engaged in the production of a final product or set of final products, the first and major measure must be whether such production is curtailed or stopped.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Respondents also urge us to apply a multi-site definition of \u201cpremises\u201d in this case based on the \u201cfunctional integrality\u201d and \u201cgeneral unity\u201d tests we discussed in <em>Tucker v. American Smelting &amp; Refining Co., </em>189 Md. 250, 256, 55 A.2d 692, 694-95 (1947). We note that <em>Tucker, </em>though not expressly rejecting those tests, refused to use them in that case because \u201cin the ordinary use of words a plant at Garfield[, Utah] and one at Baltimore would not be called one \u2018establishment\u2019 and facts are lacking which might give a special and unusual application to the word \u2018establishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>We again find those tests useless in the case at bar because the facts are not so \u201cspecial and unusual\u201d as to require their application. <em>Cf. Matson Terminals, Inc. v. California Employment Comm\u2019n, </em>24 Cal.2d 695, 707, 151 P.2d 202, 208 (1944) (equating \u201cestablishment\u201d to all work sites covered by a union contract because hiring and work assignments were conducted through the union halls); <em>Abendroth v. Wisconsin Dep\u2019t of Indus., Labor &amp; Human Relation,s, </em>69 Wis.2d 754, 764, 233 N.W.2d 343, 348 (1975) (rejecting an argument founded on functional integrality and general unity tests that airline ground employees in Wisconsin worked in the same establishment as pilots in Seattle and Minneapolis). There clearly was a stoppage of work at each individual premises where the respondents worked. The remainder of petitioner\u2019s operations are irrelevant to that determination in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">C. Interpretation by Other States</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">When Maryland statutes are adopted around the same time as similarly-worded statutes in other states, this Court has looked to judicial interpretation of those foreign statutes as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>persuasive authority. <em>See St. Joseph Hosp. v. Quinn, </em>241 Md. 371, 377, 216 A.2d 732, 735 (1966); <em>Public Service Comm\u2019n v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>207 Md. 524, 534, 114 A.2d 834, 838 (1955); <em>Continental Oil Co. v. Horsey, </em>177 Md. 383, 385, 9 A.2d 607, 608 (1939). That courts of other states have interpreted the disqualification statute as examining \u201cstoppage of work\u201d in relation to an individual premises bolsters our interpretation of Maryland\u2019s version of the unemployment benefits law. The Supreme Court of Hawaii, for instance, reviewed whether a work stoppage had occurred at an airport and at a separate ticket office in <em>Ahnne v. Department of Labor &amp; Industrial Relations, </em>53 Haw. 185, 489 P.2d 1397 (1971). The court first noted that \u201c[t]he sole issue before us is whether during the strike there was \u2018stoppage of work\u2019 at the \u2018establishment or other premises\u2019 of Qantas, where the employees were last employed.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, 489 P.2d at 1399. Turning to the history behind the disqualification statute, the court noted that \u201c[t]he British courts ... quickly interpreted the phrase \u2018stoppage of work\u2019 to refer \u2018not to the cessation of the workman\u2019s labor, but to a stoppage of work carried on in the factory, workshop or other premises at which the workman is employed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188, 489 P.2d at 1399. In addition, the court itself had previously held that \u201c \u2018stoppage of work\u2019 means a \u2018substantial curtailment of the business activities <em>at the employer\u2019s establishment </em>rather than unemployment on the part of the striking employee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189, 489 P.2d at 1400 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Meadow Gold Dairies-Hawaii, Ltd. v. Wiig, </em>50 Haw. 225, 227-28, 437 P.2d 317, 319 (1968); <em>Inter-Island Resorts v. Akahane, </em>46 Haw. 140, 148, 377 P.2d 715, 720 (1962)). The court ultimately held that there was a substantial curtailment of \u201cactivities\u201d at the ticket office, but not of the \u201coverall business activities at the airport establishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192-94, 489 P.2d at 1402-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The Supreme Court of Nebraska is in accord. In <em>IBP, Inc. v. Aanenson, </em>234 Neb. 603, 609, 452 N.W.2d 59, 64 (1990), the court was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">not persuaded by the lockout claimants\u2019 argument that the word \u201cestablishment,\u201d as used in the disqualification section, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>should be so broadly construed in the case before us as to encompass the entire multiplant operations of IBP. In defining \u201cfactory, establishment, or other premises\u201d for the purpose of ascertaining whether a stoppage of work existed ... \u201cestablishment\u201d and \u201cpremises\u201d \u201care so commonly understood as units of place that further definition is superfluous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">The court also noted that it had previously held \u201cthat a work stoppage exists when it is proven that there has been a substantial curtailment of work produced by a labor dispute in an employing establishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610-11, 452 N.W.2d at 64 (citing <em>George A. Hormel &amp; Co. v. Hair, </em>229 Neb. 284, 426 N.W.2d 281 (1988); <em>Magner, </em>141 Neb. 122, 2 N.W.2d 689); <em>see also Magner, </em>141 Neb. at 130, 2 N.W.2d at 693 (noting that a \u201cstoppage or curtailment of work\u201d may occur in one of three forms: (1) total cessation of work in the premises; (2) cessation of work by part of the employees, which prevents others in the premises from working; or (3) diminished patronage by customers, which produces unemployment).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The appellate courts of Illinois have also consistently equated stoppage of work to a substantial curtailment of business within each individual premises, not the employer\u2019s business as a whole. <em>See Central Foundry Div. v. Holland, </em>36 Ill. App.3d 998, 1002, 345 N.E.2d 143, 147 (1976) (\u201cStoppage of work refers \u2018to a stoppage of work of the plant or particular department of a plant and not to the individual unemployment of the worker or workers.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Robert S.

Finally, we note that Lewis, <em>supra, </em>at 343, summarized the case law with a similar interpretation to that which <em>we </em>adopt today:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">The general rules in stoppage of work jurisdictions, as they have been judicially construed, are: benefits will be denied for any week during which (1) a claimant-striker will not perform available work and there <em>is a substantial curtailment of production or operations at the employer\u2019s establishment which curtailment would not exist but for a labor dispute at said </em>establishment---- [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">We also note that other courts in our sister states have interpreted the term premises or related terms as meaning a single unit of employment. In <em>Walgreen Co., </em>386 Ill. at 39, 53 N.E.2d at 394, for instance, the Supreme Court of Illinois held that Illinois\u2019 disqualification provision \u201cmakes every \u2018factory, establishment, or other premises\u2019 a unit for the purpose of ascertaining whether a stoppage of work due to a labor dispute exists.\u201d The Indiana Appellate Court held in <em>Blakely, </em>120 Ind.App. at 275, 90 N.E.2d at 361, that the disqualification provisions \u201crender ineligible for benefits the employees of a separate department of an employer\u2019s business when a labor dispute between such employees and the employer has caused a work stoppage which resulted in a curtailment or complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>stoppage of work in such department.\u201d The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, has followed this limited definition of premises or, in their statute, \u201cestablishment,\u201d consistently. <em>See In re Falco-Ward, </em>129 A.D.2d 929, 930, 514 N.Y.S.2d 568, 569 (1987); <em>DiLella v.

Resolution</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Applying this reasoning to the case at hand, it is clear that there was a stoppage of work at the distribution and warehouse centers and each of petitioner\u2019s manufacturing plants where sympathy strikes took place. The Board, in its opinion, found that (1) petitioner could not operate its warehouse and distribution centers; (2) \u201c[t]he ice cream plant, beverage plant and dairy remained closed down during the strike\u201d; and (3) the bakery remained closed during three weeks of the strike. Under section 8-1004, there was a \u201csubstantial curtailment\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>operations at each of these premises to cause a \u201cstoppage of work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Respondent Teamsters Local 639 argues that the various distribution and warehouse centers and manufacturing plants were not their place of \u201clast employment.\u201d We disagree because those facilities were their centralized place of employment. The truckers admit in their brief that each trucker reports for work at one of these facilities, loads his or her truck there, departs from the individual site prior to servicing petitioner\u2019s many stores, and then returns to the site at the end of his or her working day. We note that courts in our sister states, posed with similar arguments, have made the same conclusion. <em>See Noblit v. Marmon Group\u2014Midwest Foundry Div., </em>25 Mich.App. 432, 437, 181 N.W.2d 593, 595 (1970) (holding that truck drivers who picked up items from a foundry and returned there at the end of the day were \u201clast employed\u201d there), <em>aff'd, </em>386 Mich. 652, 194 N.W.2d 324 (1972); <em>Alldredge v.

Preservation of Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">We briefly address respondents\u2019 argument that, before the Board, petitioner failed to preserve the arguments they have presented to this Court and both courts below. The record contains evidence to the contrary. For instance, in his opening statements to the Board, counsel for petitioner claimed \u201cthat there was a substantial curtailment of Giant Food\u2019s operations during the strike. Virtually, as you will hear, the warehouses were essentially shut down which are a major portion of Giant\u2019s operation. The manufacturing operations at Giant were essentially shut down.\u201d In its post-hearing brief to the Board, petitioner also argued it had \u201cdemonstrated a substantial curtailment of at least four aspects of its operations, each of which <em>alone </em>would constitute a stoppage of work under the applicable precedent.\u201d Two of those \u201caspects\u201d alleged by petitioner to have been substantially curtailed were its manufacturing plants and the distribution and warehouse centers. That petitioner cited its general loss of sales and having to find a substitute for its in-house distribution system as the two other \u201caspects\u201d of substantial curtailment does not prove that they waived the argument they now present to this Court. Rather, it reflects that petitioner presented both theories to the Board\u2014that a stoppage of work occurred at each of the various premises and that a curtailment of all of petitioner\u2019s operations equated to a work stoppage. The voluminous testimony in the record reflects that petitioner had been attempting to prove both theories during the hearing. Petitioner preserved the current issue for judicial review and appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">We hold that the term \u201cstoppage of work\u201d refers to the substantial curtailment of work at each individual facility, premises, or individual department within such a facility. Generally under section 8-1004 there must be a stoppage of work at the individual premises where a labor dispute has occurred for an employee at such individual premises to be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>operations ceased at the various premises in which the employees worked in this case, there was a \u201cstoppage of work\u201d at each of those locations caused by the labor dispute in question. Thus, none of the employees are entitled to unemployment benefits. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Special Appeals. '</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AND TO DIRECT THAT COURT TO REVERSE THE DECISION OF THE BOARD OF APPEALS; RESPONDENTS TO PAY THE COSTS EQUALLY IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\">. Those respondents are: (1) Teamsters Local 730, consisting of warehouseman and cardboard salvage workers at the warehouses, janitors at the bakery, employees at an ice plant operated by petitioner, and cafeteria staff at petitioner's corporate offices; (2) Teamsters Local 67, which represents employees at the beverage plant; (3) Teamsters Local 355, which represents truck drivers delivering pharmaceuticals to the retail stores; (4) Teamsters Local 922, consisting of cardboard salvagers, and garage and maintenance employees; (5) Teamsters Local 246, consisting of the employees at the dairy and ice cream plants, and truckers who deliver baked goods from the Silver Spring plant to the distribution centers and to the retail stores; (6) Bakery, Confectionary and Tobacco Workers International Union, Local 118, which represents employees in the Silver Spring bakery. Local 118 also represents bakery workers at the individual retail stores, who apparently were not involved in the strike.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b249-6\">. The Bakers Union impliedly argues that there was no labor dispute at the premises where they worked. They argued to the Board that they were exempted from disqualification by section 8-1004(b). Despite their ruling that all of the claimants were entitled to benefits, the Board\u2019s opinion did address this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">The non-[Local ]639 Claimants failed to prove that they met the exemption set out in [Labor &amp; Employment Article], \u00a7 8-1004(b). The Board finds their evidence on this issue to be totally lacking in credibility. The Board further finds that there was overwhelming evidence in the record to support a conclusion that they all belonged to a class or grade of workers that had members who were employed at the premises of Giant Food and who were participating in and directly interested in the labor dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">There was a labor dispute at the bakery and other manufacturing plants because the employees at those premises engaged in a sympathy strike. Generally, participants in a sympathy strike are not entitled to unemployment benefits because courts view sympathy strikes or the refusal to cross picket lines as voluntary participation in the labor dispute. <em>See Baltimore Typographical Union No. 12 v.

We also note that Shadur, <em>supra, </em>at 311-12, proposed using a test similar to respondents\u2019 interpretation of \"substantial curtailment\u201d to address when a specific department within a premises is engaged in a labor dispute. Most disqualification provisions require that \"if separate branches of work that usually are conducted as separate businesses in separate premises are conducted in separate departments on the same premises, each department shall be considered a separate premises for the purposes of this subsection.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 8-1004(a)(2). Shadur, <em>supra, </em>at 311-12, finding this provision \"troublesome,\u201d proposed that the work stoppage of the department be evaluated as to whether it \"was substantial in relation to the <em>entire </em>establishment\u2019s production, not merely to that of the department in which the dispute occurred.\u201d We disagree with that interpretation as it clearly violates the statute on its face\u2014each subunit of employment must \"be considered a separate premises\u201d under subsection (c)(2). <em>See supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b265-7\">. In addition, one scholar has equated the \"factory, establishment, or other premises\u201d clause in the unemployment disqualification statute to the term \"establishment,\u201d which, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, has been \"interpreted as one particular business premises\u201d by both federal regulators and the courts. <em>See </em>Jerre S. Williams, <em>The Labor Dispute Disqualification\u2014A Primer and Some Problems, </em>8 Vand. L.Rev. 338, 347 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b266-6\">. The same argument applies to respondent Teamsters Local 355. Their last place of employment was the pharmaceuticals warehouse from which they operated in Baltimore. The Board did not address whether work had stopped at that warehouse. The record does contain evidence that operations at that warehouse had been substantially curtailed. <em>(See </em>memorandum from petitioner to the Board of 2/6/97, at 1.) We will assume that operations were substantially curtailed at that location without drivers to deliver the pharmaceuticals from the warehouse to petitioner\u2019s stores. Teamsters Local 355 has not cited any evidence or made any argument to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
